[[Weta (band)]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand rock music groups

Weta are a four piece rock band from Wellington, New Zealand.
The band was formed in 1995, and quickly developed an enviable live reputation, securing support slots for the likes of Everclear, The Foo Fighters and Soundgarden (after a Wellington Town Hall show, Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd presented Clinton Tokona with his Music Man bass guitar after falling out with it on stage).
In 1997 Aaron Tokona temporarily filled in on guitar for Adelaide, Australia band The Superjesus, after guitarist Chris Tennent left the band. When offered the position full-time, Tokona declined in order to concentrate on Weta. Impressed with his abilities as a guitarist, former Superjesus manager Dan Hennessy took a keen interest in the band and when he took over as A&R chief at Warner Bros. Records Australia, Weta were added to their roster and the band moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1998.
The band's first release came in 1999 with the Natural Compression EP, which had been recorded at Marmalade Studios in Wellington, with friend and Shihad drummer Tom Larkin producing.
September 2000 saw the New Zealand release of their debut album, Geographica.
The band broke up early in 2001, after Aaron Tokona "stopped believing that I was doing what I really wanted to do. I'm not talking about playing music because I think I'll always do music. I'm talking about playing music in the sense of being in a band or being in public."[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The album, recorded at Melbourne's Sing Sing studios and produced by Steve James[tpl]dn|date=July 2013[/tpl], was never released in Australia. The song "Calling On" received regular airplay on Australian radio station Triple J during 2001, however it failed to break into the station's Hottest 100 that year.
Weta reformed and played small 200-300 person venues in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch during November 2008.
Following this mini tour they announced they were all committed to a second album, after a break of 8 years --- only to break up shortly before recording, feeling "too old."
One new live song was played during their reunion tour, however there are no plans to release this new material.
