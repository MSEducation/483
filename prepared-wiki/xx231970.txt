He is known for his 1960s radical activism as well as his current work in education reform, curriculum, and instruction. In 1969 he co-founded the Weather Underground, a self-described communist revolutionary groupThe Weathermen's founding manifesto, signed by Ayers and ten others, indicates, "The most important task for us toward making the revolution, and the work our collectives should engage in, is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement...akin to the Red Guard in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people...with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle.

He is a retired professor in the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, formerly holding the titles of Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar. During the 2008 US presidential campaign, a controversy arose over his contacts with then-candidate Barack Obama.  He is married to Bernardine Dohrn, who was also a leader in the Weather Underground.

==Early life==

Ayers grew up in Glen Ellyn, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. He attended public schools there until his second year in high school, when he transferred to Lake Forest Academy, a small prep school.Terry, Don (Chicago Tribune staff reporter, "The calm after the storm", Chicago Tribune Magazine, p 10, September 16, 2001, June 8, 2008 Ayers earned a B.A. from the University of Michigan in American Studies in 1968 (his father, mother and older brother had preceded him there). His parents are Mary (née Andrew) and Thomas G. Ayers, who was later Chairman and CEO of Commonwealth Edison (1973 to 1980),[tpl]cite news |author=Jackson, Cheryl V. |date=June 12, 2007 |title=Former ComEd CEO; Businessman also fought for equality |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=49 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=headline(Former%20ComEd%20CEO)%20AND%20date(6/12/2007%20to%206/12/2007)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=6/12/2007%20to%206/12/2007)&p_field_advanced-0=title&p_text_advanced-0=(Former%20ComEd%20CEO)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no |accessdate=2008-10-09[/tpl] and for whom Northwestern's Thomas G. Ayers College of Commerce and Industry was named.Obituary: Thomas Ayers Served as Board Chair from 1975 to 1986 Northwestern University, June 19, 2007Sheepdogdesign.net, Thomas G Ayers, 1915-2007 Cinnamon Swirl, June 18, 2007
Ayers was affected when Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) President Paul Potter, at a 1965 Ann Arbor Teach-In against the Vietnam war, asked his audience, "How will you live your life so that it doesn't make a mockery of your values?" Ayers later wrote in his memoir, Fugitive Days, that his reaction was: "You could not be a moral person with the means to act, and stand still. ... To stand still was to choose indifference. Indifference was the opposite of moral".Barber, David, "Fugitive Days; A Memoir - Book Review", Journal of Social History, Winter 2002, retrieved June 10, 2008
In 1965, Ayers joined a picket line protesting an Ann Arbor, Michigan pizzeria for refusing to seat African Americans. His first arrest came for a sit-in at a local draft board, resulting in 10 days in jail. His first teaching job came shortly afterward at the Children's Community School, a preschool with a very small enrollment operating in a church basement, founded by a group of students in emulation of the Summerhill method of education.Before "going underground" he published an account of this experience, Education: An American Problem.
The school was a part of the nationwide "free school movement". Schools in the movement had no grades or report cards; they aimed to encourage cooperation rather than competition, and the teachers had pupils address them by their first names. Within a few months, at age 21, Ayers became director of the school. There also he met Diana Oughton, who would become his girlfriend until her death in 1970 after a bomb exploded while preparing the bombs for Weather Underground activities.

==Early activism==

Ayers became involved in the New Left and the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).Fugitive Days: A Memoir He rose to national prominence as an SDS leader in 1968 and 1969. As head of an SDS regional group, the "Jesse James Gang", Ayers made decisive contributions to the Weatherman orientation toward militancy.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
The group Ayers headed in Detroit, Michigan became one of the earliest gatherings of what became the Weatherman. Before the June 1969 SDS convention, Ayers became a prominent leader of the group, which arose as a result of a schism in SDS. "During that time his infatuation with street fighting grew and he developed a language of confrontational militancy that became more and more pronounced over the year 1969", disaffected former Weatherman member Cathy Wilkerson wrote in 2001. Ayers had previously been a roommate of Terry Robbins, a fellow militant who was killed in 1970 along with Ayers' girlfriend Oughton and one other member in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, while constructing anti-personnel bombs intended for a non-commissioned officer dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey.[tpl]cite news|author=Cathy Wilkerson|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/viewArticle/12798|title=Fugitive Days (book review)|publisher=Zmag magazine|date=2001-12-01[/tpl]
In June 1969, the Weatherman took control of the SDS at its national convention, where Ayers was elected Education Secretary. Later in 1969, Ayers participated in planting a bomb at a statue dedicated to police casualties in the 1886 Haymarket affair confrontation between labor supporters and the Chicago police.Jacobs, Ron, The way the wind blew: a history of the Weather Underground, London & New York: Verso, 1997. ISBN 1-85984-167-8 The blast broke almost 100 windows and blew pieces of the statue onto the nearby Kennedy Expressway.[tpl]cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |pages=431 [/tpl] (The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, and blown up again by other Weathermen on October 6, 1970.Adelman. Haymarket Revisited, p. 40. Rebuilding it yet again, the city posted a 24-hour police guard to prevent another blast, and in January 1972 it was moved to Chicago police headquarters).Haymarket Memorial Statue Rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters Chicago Police Department, June 1, 2007
Ayers participated in the Days of Rage riot in Chicago in October 1969, and in December was at the "War Council" meeting in Flint, Michigan.  Two major decisions came out of the "War Council". The first was to immediately begin a violent, armed struggle (e.g., bombings and armed robberies) against the state without attempting to organize or mobilize a broad swath of the public. The second was to create underground collectives in major cities throughout the country.Good, "Brian Flanagan Speaks," Next Left Notes, 2005. Larry Grathwohl, a Federal Bureau of Investigation informant in the Weatherman group from the fall of 1969 to the spring of 1970, stated that "Ayers, along with Bernardine Dohrn, probably had the most authority within the Weatherman".Grathwohl, Larry, and Frank, Reagan, Bringing Down America: An FBI Informant in with the Weathermen, Arlington House, 1977, page 110

==Involvement with Weather Underground==

After the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion in 1970, in which Weatherman member Ted Gold, Ayers’s close friend Terry Robbins, and Ayers’s girlfriend, Diana Oughton, were killed when a nail bomb being assembled in the house exploded, Ayers and several associates evaded pursuit by U.S. law enforcement officials. Kathy Boudin and Cathy Wilkerson survived the blast. Ayers was not facing criminal charges at the time, but the federal government later filed charges against him. Ayers participated in the bombings of New York City Police Department headquarters in 1970, the United States Capitol building in 1971, and the Pentagon in 1972, as he noted in his 2001 book, Fugitive Days.  Ayers writes:  Although the bomb that rocked the Pentagon was itsy-bitsy—weighing close to two pounds—it caused ‘tens of thousands of dollars’ of damage. The operation cost under $500, and no one was killed or even hurt.Bill Ayers, Fugitive Days, pg. 261  
During this time Ayers and fellow member Bernardine Dohrn married, and the two remained fugitives together, changing identities, jobs and locations.
In 1973 new information came to light about FBI operations targeted against Weather Underground and the New Left, all part of a series of covert and often illegal FBI projects called COINTEL.Why Weren't Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dohrn Convicted of Terrorism? Glenrose.net Due to the illegal tactics[tpl]clarify|date=October 2010[/tpl] of FBI agents involved with the program, government attorneys requested all weapons- and bomb-related charges be dropped against the Weather Underground, including charges against Ayers.Jeremy Varon, Bringing The War Home: The Weather Underground, The Red Army Faction And Revolutionary Violence In The Sixties And Seventies, (Berkley: University of California Press, 2004), 297.
However, state charges against Dohrn remained. Dohrn was still reluctant to turn herself in to authorities. “He was sweet and patient, as he always is, to let me come to my senses on my own,” she later said of Ayers. She turned herself in to authorities in 1980. She was fined $1,500 and given three years probation.Susan Chira, At home with: Bernadine Dohrn; Same Passion, New Tactics, The New York Times, November 18, 1993
In 1973 Ayers co-authored the book Prairie Fire with other members of the Weather Underground, which they dedicated to close to 200 people including Harriet Tubman, John Brown, ‘All Who Continue to Fight,’ and ‘All Political Prisoners in the U.S.’[tpl]cite web|url=http://site2.littlegreenfootballs.com/pdf/Prairie-fire.pdf |title=Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism:Political Statement of the Weather Underground|publisher=Communications Co.|authors= Bernardine Dohrn, Billy Ayers, Jeff Jones, Celia Sojourn |date= May 9, 1974|accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl] The list includes Sirhan Sirhan, convicted assassin of Robert F.

===Later reflections on underground period===

====Fugitive Days: A Memoir====

In 2001, Ayers published Fugitive Days: A Memoir, which he explained in part as an attempt to answer the questions of Kathy Boudin's son, and his speculation that Diana Oughton died trying to stop the Greenwich Village bomb makers.Marcia Froelke Coburn, No Regrets, Chicago Magazine, August 2001 Some have questioned the truth, accuracy, and tone of the book.  Brent Staples wrote for The New York Times Book Review that "Ayers reminds us often that he can't tell everything without endangering people involved in the story.Staples, Brent, "The Oldest Rad", book review of Fugitive Days by Bill Ayers in New York Times Book Review, September 30, 2001, accessed June 5, 2008  Historian Jesse Lemisch (himself a former member of SDS) contrasted Ayers' recollections with those of other former members of Weatherman and has alleged serious factual errors.Jesse Lemisch, Weather Underground Rises from the Ashes: They're Baack!, New Politics, Summer 2006 Ayers, in the foreword to his book, states that it was written as his personal memories and impressions over time, not a scholarly research project.Dinitia Smith, No Regrets for a Love Of Explosives; In a Memoir of Sorts, a War Protester Talks of Life With the Weathermen, The New York Times, September 11, 2001

====Statements made in 2001====

Chicago Magazine reported that "just before the September 11th attacks," Richard Elrod, a city lawyer injured in the Weathermen's Chicago "Days of Rage," received an apology from Ayers and Dohrn for their part in the violence. "They were remorseful," Elrod says. "They said, 'We're sorry that things turned out this way.'"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2006/Sudden-Impact/ |title=Sudden Impact|publisher=Chicago Magazine|author=Bryan Smith |date=December 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081010141846/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2006/Sudden-Impact/| archivedate= 10 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In the months before Ayers' memoir was published on September 10, 2001, the author gave numerous interviews with newspaper and magazine writers in which he defended his overall history of radical words and actions. Some of the resulting articles were written before the September 11 attacks and appeared immediately after, including one often-noted article in The New York Times, and another in the Chicago Tribune. Numerous observations were made in the media comparing the statements Ayers was making about his own past just as a dramatic terrorist incident shocked the public.
Much of the controversy about Ayers during the decade since 2000 stems from an interview he gave to The New York Times on the occasion of the memoir's publication.NB that although the interview was published on 9/11, it was completed prior to that and cannot be properly construed as a reaction to the events of that day. The reporter quoted him as saying "I don't regret setting bombs" and "I feel we didn't do enough", and, when asked if he would "do it all again," as saying "I don't want to discount the possibility." Ayers protested the interviewer's characterizations in a Letter to the Editor published September 15, 2001: "This is not a question of being misunderstood or 'taken out of context', but of deliberate distortion."Bill Ayers, Clarifying the Facts— a letter to the New York Times, 9-15-2001, Bill Ayers (blog), April 21, 2008 In the ensuing years, Ayers has repeatedly avowed that when he said he had "no regrets" and that "we didn't do enough" he was speaking only in reference to his efforts to stop the United States from waging the Vietnam War, efforts which he has described as ". . . inadequate as the war dragged on for a decade."Bill Ayers, Episodic Notoriety–Fact and Fantasy, Bill Ayers (blog), April 6, 2008  Ayers has maintained that the two statements were not intended to imply a wish they had set more bombs.Bill Ayers, WordPress.com, I'm Sorry!!!!... I think, Bill Ayers (blog)
In a November 2008 interview with The New Yorker, Ayers said that he had not meant to imply that he wished he and the Weathermen had committed further acts of violence. Instead, he said, “I wish I had done more, but it doesn’t mean I wish we’d bombed more shit.” Ayers said that he had never been responsible for violence against other people and was acting to end a war in Vietnam in which “thousands of people were being killed every week.” He also stated, "While we did claim several extreme acts, they were acts of extreme radicalism against property,” and “We killed no one and hurt no one. Three of our people killed themselves.”[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Remnick |authorlink=David Remnick |title=Mr. Ayers’s Neighborhood |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/11/mr-ayerss-neighborhood.html?yrail |work=The New Yorker |date=November 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081224081950/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/11/mr-ayerss-neighborhood.html?yrail| archivedate= 24 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The interviewer also quoted some of Ayers' own criticism of Weatherman in the foreword to the memoir, whereby Ayers reacts to having watched Emile de Antonio's 1976 documentary film about Weatherman, Underground: "Ayers was 'embarrassed by the arrogance, the solipsism, the absolute certainty that we and we alone knew the way. The rigidity and the narcissism.' " "We weren't terrorists," Ayers told an interviewer for the Chicago Tribune in 2001. "The reason we weren't terrorists is because we did not commit random acts of terror against people. Terrorism was what was being practiced in the countryside of Vietnam by the United States."
In a letter to the editor in the Chicago Tribune, Ayers wrote, "I condemn all forms of terrorism — individual, group and official". He also condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks in that letter. "Today we are witnessing crimes against humanity on our own shores on an unthinkable scale, and I fear that we may soon see more innocent people in other parts of the world dying in response."Ayers, Bill, letter to the editor, Chicago Tribune, September 23, 2001, retrieved June 8, 2008

====Views on his past expressed since 2001====

Ayers was asked in a January 2004 interview, "How do you feel about what you did? Would you do it again under similar circumstances?" He replied:Web page titled "Weather Underground/ Exclusive interview: Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers", Independent Lens website, accessed June 5, 2008 "I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... I don't think so. I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable."
On September 9, 2008, journalist Jake Tapper copied to his ABC News "Political Punch" blog and opined on a four-panel comic strip by Ryan Alexander-Tanner from Bill Ayers blog site.[tpl]cite web|last=Alexander-Tanner|first=Ryan|date=September 2, 2008|title=bill ayers speaks|work=Ryan Alexander-Tanner's blog|publisher=ohyesverynice.com|url=http://ohyesverynice.com/blog/2008/09/bill-ayers-speaks/|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Ayers|first=Bill|date=September 2008|title=amessagefrombillayersreformat.jpg|work=Bill Ayers' blog|publisher=billayers.wordpress.com|url=http://billayers.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/amessagefrombillayersreformat.jpg|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last1=Gewargis|first1=Natalie|last2=Tapper|first2=Jake|date=September 9, 2008|title=In a not-remotely-comic strip, Bill Ayers weighs in on what he meant by 'we didn't do enough' to end Vietnam War|work=Political Punch blog|publisher=ABC News|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/in-a-not-remote.html|accessdate=September 10, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Ben|date=September 9, 2008|title=Ayers explains|work=Ben Smith's blog|publisher=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Ayers_explains.html|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] In the Alexander-Tanner comic strip, the Ayers cartoon character says: "The one thing I don’t regret is opposing the war in Vietnam with every ounce of my being.... When I say, ‘We didn’t do enough,’ a lot of people rush to think, ‘That must mean, "We didn’t bomb enough shit."’ But that’s not the point at all. It’s not a tactical statement, it’s an obvious political and ethical statement. In this context, ‘we’ means ‘everyone.’ "
In an op-ed piece in 2008, Ayers gave this assessment of his actions:
 The Weather Underground crossed lines of legality, of propriety and perhaps even of common sense. Our effectiveness can be — and still is being — debated.[tpl]Cite news| last = Ayers | first = William| author-link =  | title = The Real Bill Ayers | newspaper = The New York Times| pages = A21| date = December 6, 2008| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/opinion/06ayers.html?_r=2| postscript = [/tpl] 
He also reiterated his rebuttal to the charge of terrorism:
 The Weather Underground went on to take responsibility for placing several small bombs in empty offices....  We did carry out symbolic acts of extreme vandalism directed at monuments to war and racism, and the attacks on property, never on people, were meant to respect human life and convey outrage and determination to end the Vietnam war. 

==Academic career==

Ayers is a retired professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Education. His interests include teaching for social justice, urban educational reform, narrative and interpretive research, children in trouble with the law, and related issues.William Ayers University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Education
He began his career in primary education while an undergraduate, teaching at the Children’s Community School (CCS), a project founded by a group of students and based on the Summerhill method of education. After leaving the underground, he earned an M.Ed from Bank Street College in Early Childhood Education (1984), an M.Ed from Teachers College, Columbia University in Early Childhood Education (1987) and an Ed. D from Teachers College, Columbia University in Curriculum and Instruction (1987).
He has edited and written many books and articles on education theory, policy and practice, and has appeared on many panels and symposia. On August 5, 2010, Ayers officially announced his intent to retire from the University of Illinois at Chicago.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/2570004,ayers-to-retire-080510.article | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Bill Ayers to retire from UIC | first=Kara | last=Spak | date=August 5, 2010[/tpl]
On September 23, 2010 William Ayers was unanimously denied emeritus status by the University of Illinois, after a speech by the university's board chair Christopher G. Kennedy (son of assassinated U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy), containing the quote "I intend to vote against conferring the honorific title of our university to a man whose body of work includes a book dedicated in part to the man who murdered my father, Robert F.

According to Ayers, his radical past occasionally affects him, as when, by his account, he was asked not to attend a progressive educators' conference in the fall of 2006 on the basis that the organizers did not want to risk an association with his past.Interview with Bill Ayers: On Progressive Education, Critical Thinking and the Cowardice of Some in Dangerous Times, Revolution, October 1, 2006 On January 18, 2009, on his way to speak about education reform at the Centre for Urban Schooling at the University of Toronto, he was refused admission to Canada when he arrived at the Toronto City Centre Airport although he has travelled to Canada more than a dozen times in the past. According to Ayers, "It seems very arbitrary. The border agent said I had a conviction for a felony from 1969. I have several arrests for misdemeanours, but not for felonies."

===Political views===

In an interview published in 1995, Ayers characterized his political beliefs at that time and in the 1960s and 1970s: "I am a radical, Leftist, small 'c' communist ... Laughs Maybe I'm the last communist who is willing to admit it. Laughs We have always been small 'c' communists in the sense that we were never in the Communist party and never Stalinists. The ethics of communism still appeal to me. I don't like Lenin as much as the early Marx. I also like Henry David Thoreau, Mother Jones and Jane Addams ...".Chepesiuk, Ron, "Sixties Radicals, Then and Now: Candid Conversations With Those Who Shaped the Era", McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers: Jefferson, North Carolina, 1995, "Chapter 5: Bill Ayers: Radical Educator", p. 102

In June 1974, the Weather Underground released a 151-page volume titled Prairie Fire, which stated: "We are a guerrilla organization ...

Larry Grathwohl, an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated The Weather Underground, claims Ayers told him where to plant bombs. He says Ayers was bent on overthrowing the government.
In response to Grathwohl's claims, Ayers stated, "Now that's being blown into dishonest narratives about hurting people, killing people, planning to kill people. That's just not true. We destroyed government property,"

On June 18, 2013, Ayers gave an interview to RealClearPolitics' Morning Commute in which he stated that every president in this century should be tried for war crimes, including President Obama for his use of drone attacks, which Ayers considers an act of terror.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/06/18/bill_ayers_obama_should_be_put_on_trial_for_war_crimes.html

===Obama-Ayers Controversy===

During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, a controversy arose regarding Ayers' contacts with then-candidate Barack Obama, a matter that had been public knowledge in Chicago for years.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/04/18/how_obama_and_the_radical_became_news/ |first=Joanna |last=Weiss |work=The Boston Globe |date=2008-04-18 |title=How Obama and the radical became news[/tpl] After being raised by the American and British press[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-511901/The-Black-Kennedy-But-does-know-real-Barack-Obama.html |work=Daily Mail |title=The Black Kennedy: But does anyone know the real Barack Obama? |first=Peter |last=Hitchens |date=2008-02-02 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Dobbs |authorlink=Michael Dobbs (US author) |title=Obama's 'Weatherman' Connection |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html |work=The Fact Checker |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-02-19[/tpl] the connection was picked up by conservative blogs and newspapers in the United States.  The matter was raised in a campaign debate by moderator George Stephanopoulos, and later became an issue for the John McCain presidential campaign.  Investigations by The New York Times, CNN, and other news organizations concluded that Obama does not have a close relationship with Ayers.[tpl]cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |title=Obama and ’60s Bomber: A Look Into Crossed Paths |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/politics/04ayers.html |work=The New York Times |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2008-10-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006143750/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/politics/04ayers.html?| archivedate= 6 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Fact Check: Is Obama 'palling around with terrorists'? |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/05/fact-check-is-obama-palling-around-with-terrorists/ |work=CNN |date=2008-10-05 |accessdate=2008-10-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081013010626/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/05/fact-check-is-obama-palling-around-with-terrorists/| archivedate= 13 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://m.cnn.com/cnn/lt_ne/lt_ne/detail/178228|title=Palin hits Obama for 'terrorist' connection|date=2008-10-05[/tpl]

==Praise and criticism of Ayers==

===Praise for Ayers and his work===

In 1997 Chicago awarded him its Citizen of the Year award for his work on the Chicago Annenberg Challenge project.
William C. Ibershof, formerly the lead federal prosecutor in the Weather Underground case, wrote in 2008: "Although I dearly wanted to obtain convictions against all the Weathermen, including Bill Ayers, I am very pleased to learn that he has become a responsible citizen."[tpl]cite news |first=William C. |last=Ibershof |title= Prosecuting Weathermen (Letter to the Editor)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/opinion/l10ayers.html |work=The New York Times |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2008-11-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081014053230/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/opinion/l10ayers.html?| archivedate= 14 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Ayers was elected Vice President for Curriculum Studies by the American Educational Research Association in 2008.Aera.net, 2008 AERA Election Results, American Educational Research Association William H. Schubert, a fellow professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, wrote that his election was "a testimony of Ayers' stature and the high esteem he holds in the field of education locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.""My friend and colleague, Bill Ayers", quoted from the Chronicle of Higher Education
Wall Street Journal columnist Thomas Frank praised Ayers as a "model citizen" and a scholar whose "work is esteemed by colleagues of different political viewpoints.""My Friend Bill Ayers", Wall Street Journal, Oct. 15, 2008 Studs Terkel called Ayers' memoir "a deeply moving elegy to all those young dreamers who tried to live decently in an indecent world."Fugitive Days: A Memoir at Amazon; scroll down for Terkel blurb.
In an October 2010 Chicago Sun Times editorial Attacks on Ayers distort our history, former students of Ayers and UIC Alumni, Daniel Schneider and Adam Kuranishi, responded in opposition to the University of Illinois Board of Trustees' decision to deny Ayers Emeritus status. They write, "We juxtaposed the image of him painted by the media with the teacher we saw in class; and the two could not be more distinct. The Ayers in the media was frozen in time; he never left the 1960s, never aged out of his 20s, and never grew in perspective. As his students, we see through this representation ... Ayers is still committed to movements for peace and justice. His worldview and tactics are evolved and elaborate, thoughtful and wise, making him unrecognizable to the media's caricature. Should we not expect someone to evolve after 40 years? One may disagree with his activism, but it is impossible to ignore his hard work and contributions to urban education, juvenile justice reform, the University of Illinois and Chicago.""Attacks on Ayers distort our history", Chicago Sun Times, Oct. 10, 2010

===Criticism of Ayers and his work===

Radical bomber Jane Alpert criticized Ayers in 1974 "for his callous treatment and abandonment of Diana Oughton before her death, and for his generally fickle and high-handed treatment of women."Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory, Special Collections Library, Duke University
Reviewing Ayers' memoir in Slate Magazine, Timothy Noah said he couldn't recall reading "a memoir quite so self-indulgent and morally clueless as Fugitive Days.""Radical Chic Resurgent", by Timothy Noah, Slate Magazine, Aug. 22, 2001] Sol Stern, a conservative opponent of liberal education policies, is a longtime critic of Ayers; he has "studied Mr. Ayers's work for years and read most of his books.""Ayers Is No Education 'Reformer'" Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 2008 Stern has written critiques of Ayers's career as an education reformer for City Journal and elsewhere."The Ed Schools’ Latest—and Worst—Humbug: Teaching for “social justice” is a cruel hoax on disadvantaged kids.", City Journal, Summer 2006"Obama’s Real Bill Ayers Problem: The ex-Weatherman is now a radical educator with influence.", City Journal, 23 April 2008  His criticism in summary: "Calling Bill Ayers a school reformer is a bit like calling Joseph Stalin an agricultural reformer."."The Bomber as School Reformer", City Journal, 6 October 2008 "The media mainstreaming of a figure like Mr. Ayers could have terrible consequences for the country's politics and public schools."
Feminist critic Katha Pollitt sharply criticized Ayers' December 2008 New York Times opinion pieceAyers, William. "The Real Bill Ayers", New York Times (December 5, 2008). as a "sentimentalized, self-justifying whitewash of his role in the weirdo violent fringe of the 1960s-70s antiwar left." She castigates Ayers and his Weathermen cohorts for making "the antiwar movement look like the enemy of ordinary people" during the Vietnam War era.Pollitt, Katha. "Bill Ayers Whitewashes History, Again", The Nation magazine (December 8, 2008).
