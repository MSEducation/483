==History==

The Melbourne & Murray River Railway (now the Bendigo line) opened in 1859 running from Footscray to Sunbury, by the early 1860s the line had been extended to Bendigo. A station named Albion & Darlington was built on the site of the current Albion station, opening on 5 January 1860. Albion & Darlington only remained open for a single year. In 1891 a new station named Albion opened to the west of the previous station. In 1919 Albion station was relocated to the current site.
The old Ballarat Road level crossing was grade separated in 1961 resulting in the bridge going over the railway line just west of Albion station.[tpl]cite book|author=SE Dornan & RG Henderson|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|page=68|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1[/tpl]
