Lightmoor Junction was a railway junction between Ironbridge Power Station at Buildwas and Madeley Junction in Shropshire, England.
From Lightmoor Junction a line ran towards Wellington via Doseley and Horsehay. Following the closure of this branch line, Lightmoor Junction Signal Box was retained to control the connection between the double-track section towards Ironbridge Power Station and the single-track section towards Madeley Junction. The signal box closed on 23 October 2006, when the line towards Ironbridge Power Station was singled, with new signalling controlled from Madeley Junction Signal Box.
Telford Steam Railway use a portion of the former line to Wellington, and intend to use the signal box as part of their heritage railway. Negotiations for the lease and occupation of Lightmoor Junction Signal Box were concluded and keys handed over to TSR by Network Rail officials on 8 August 2008.
