She rose to fame in the late 1990s following roles in the films The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999). Theron received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003), for which she won the Silver Bear, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award for Best Actress among several other accolades, becoming the first South African to win an Academy Award in a major acting category.

In 2012, she appeared in Snow White & the Huntsman and Prometheus, both of which were box office successes. Theron became a U.S. citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship.

==Early life==

Theron was born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa, the only child of Gerda (née Maritz)[tpl]cite book|title=Charlize: Life's One Helluva Ride|last=Karsten|first=Chris|publisher=Human & Rousseau|year=2009|page=18|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/21251449/Charlize-Life-s-One-Helluva-Ride|id=[/tpl]Karsten, p. 16 and Charles Theron (born 27 November 1947).

==Career==

===Early work===

Although seeing herself as a dancer, Theron at 16 won a one-year modeling contract at a local competition in Salerno[tpl]cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/settembre/18/Charlize_Theron_Salerno_Potrei_innamorarmi_co_0_00091811394.shtml|title=Charlize Theron at Salerno "I could fall in love with Allen|accessdate=8 August 2012[/tpl] and with her mother moved to Milan, Italy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/sex-relationships/story/2011-12-14/The-amazing-low-key-life-of-Charlize-Theron/51898844/1|work=USA Weekend|title=The Amazing, Low-Key Life of Charlize Theron|first=Mark|last= Morrison|date=9–11 December 2011|accessdate=20 December 2011|archivedate=20 December 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/644g6WI12|deadurl=no[/tpl] After Theron spent a year modeling throughout Europe, she and her mother moved to New York City and Miami, Florida. In New York, she attended the Joffrey Ballet School, where she trained as a ballet dancer until a knee injury closed this career path.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/style/tmagazine/24coverlynn.html|title= Charlize Angel|accessdate=24 February 2008|first=Lynn|last= Hirschberg|date= 24 February 2008|work=The New York Times T Magazine|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63aaEG9lY|archivedate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl] As Theron recalled in 2008,

During her early months there, she went to a Hollywood Boulevard bank to cash a check her mother had sent her to help with the rent. When the teller refused to cash it, Theron engaged in a shouting match with him. Upon seeing this, talent agent John Crosby, in line behind her, handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to casting agents and also an acting school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/in-the-valley-of-elah-charlize-theron-interview|title=In the Valley of Elah: Charlize Theron interview|accessdate=23 February 2008|first=Jack|last=  Foley|publisher=IndieLondon.co.uk|archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090113184755/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/in-the-valley-of-elah-charlize-theron-interview| archivedate=13 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/celebrities/movie-celebs/face-to-face-with-charlize-theron/article.html|title=Charlize Theron Interview|accessdate=23 February 2008|first=Sara |last= Davidson|date=October 2005|work=Reader's Digest|archivedate=25 March 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080325213620/http://www.rd.com/celebrities/movie-celebs/face-to-face-with-charlize-theron/article.html[/tpl] She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to Showgirls and Species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/06/charlize_theron?printable=true| title=Charlize| accessdate=23 May 2008|first=Gabriel|last=  Snyder|date=June 2008|publisher=W| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090210125754/http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/06/charlize_theron?printable=true| archivedate=10 February 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] After several months in the city, she was cast in her first film role, a non-speaking role in the direct-to-video film Children of the Corn III (1995). Her first speaking role was a supporting but significant and attention-garnering part as a hitwoman in 2 Days in the Valley (1996). Larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career expanded in the late 1990s with box-office successes like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999). She was on the cover of the January 1999 issue of Vanity Fair as the "White Hot Venus".Philippe J.

===Success and hiatus===

She starred in four films in 2000 – Reindeer Games, The Yards, The Legend of Bagger Vance and Men of Honor – and was briefly considered a new It girl. Theron has said of this period in her career that, "I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. began a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. Reindeer Games was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved John Frankenheimer."Johnathan Van Meter (October 2004).

===Recent work===

Following a three-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with Young Adult. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim especially for Theron's performance. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and several other high profile awards. Theron played the Wicked Queen in the film Snow White & the Huntsman, which began production in 2011 and was released in 2012.Huffington Post – Charlize Theron to play evil queen in Snow White and the huntsman
In 2011, she described her process for becoming the characters in her film:
[tpl]quote|When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it – and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about character all the time – I observe things, I see things and file things my head, everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with character's nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time to do my job, to do the honest truth. You can't do that part of the character-creation work when you're the middle of making the film. At least I can't.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012 | title=High School Disunion: Charlize Theron, Diablo Cody & Jason Reitman on 'Young Adult'|work=Film Journal International|authorlink=Frank Lovece|first=Frank|last=Lovece|date=30 November 2011|archiveurl=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012| archivedate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl][/tpl]

==Activism==

The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Charlize Theron, Academy Award winning actor and UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP's mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The Project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize's home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent HIV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlizeafricaoutreach.org|title=Message from Charlize[/tpl]
In December 2009, CTAOP and TOMS Shoes partnered to create a limited edition unisex shoe. The shoe was made from vegan materials and inspired by the African baobab tree, the silhouette of which was embroidered on blue and orange canvas. Ten-thousand pairs were given to destitute children, and a portion of the proceeds went to CTAOP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2009/12/17/exclusive-charlize-theron-designs-a-shoe-with-toms-for-charity|title= Charlize Theron Designs Shoes with TOMS for Charity|work=People |date= 17 December 2009[/tpl]
