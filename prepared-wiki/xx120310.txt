Parson Street railway station serves the western end of Bedminster in Bristol, England. It also serves other surrounding suburbs including Bishopsworth, Ashton Vale and Ashton Gate, along with Bristol City FC. It is [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] from [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl], and [tpl]convert|120|mi|km|0[/tpl] from London Paddington. Its three letter station code is PSN. It was opened in 1927 by the Great Western Railway, and was rebuilt in 1933. The station, which has two through-lines and two platforms, plus one freight line for traffic on the Portishead Branch Line, has minimal facilities. As of 2012, it is managed by First Great Western, which is the sixth company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly an hourly service between [tpl]rws|Bristol Parkway[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Weston-super-Mare[/tpl].
There is local support for the line to be electrified, as an extension of the planned electrification of the London to Bristol route, and the level of service would be improved if proposals for the re-instatement of passenger services on the nearby Portishead Branch Line, which was re-opened for freight in 2001, are successful.

==Description==

The station is built in a cutting in the western end of Bedminster, on the Bristol to Exeter Line [tpl]convert|120|mi|16|chain|km|2[/tpl] from London Paddington and [tpl]convert|1|mi|65|chain|km|2[/tpl] from [tpl]rws|Bristol Temple Meads[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/ELRs/_mileages/M/MLN1.txt|title=Engineers' Line References: MLN1 Paddington to North Road Junction|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Deaves, Phil[/tpl] It is the second station along the line from Bristol Temple Meads.[tpl]cite book|first=S.K.|last=Baker|title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland|edition=12|year=2010|isbn=978-0-86093-632-9|publisher=Ian Allan[/tpl] The surrounding area is mostly residential, with some industrial buildings to the north-east. There are two island platforms, each [tpl]convert|210|yd|m[/tpl] long, but only the first [tpl]convert|100|yd|m[/tpl] are in use, the rest fenced off. The platforms are on an alignment of roughly 60 degrees, with a slight curve. The southern island's northern face, platform 1, is for westbound trains; and the southern face of the northern island, platform 2, is for eastbound trains. The track on the southern side of the southern island has been removed, while the track to the northern side of the northern island is only accessible to trains to or from the Portishead Branch Line and Liberty Lane Freightliner terminal - no passenger trains use this. The speed limit through the station is [tpl]convert|90|mph|kph[/tpl] on the main lines and [tpl]convert|25|mph|kph[/tpl] on the freight line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/baseline%20capability/track%20and%20route%20mileage,%20permissible%20line%20speeds/table%20a_track_and_route%20miles_linespeed_western%20route.pdf|title=Network Capability - Baseline Declaration: (1) Track and Route mileage: (2) Line-speeds: Western Route|publisher=Network Rail|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=11 October 2013|page=54[/tpl]
The station is surrounded on all sides by the A38 road, which splits the carriageways at this point, with the station in between. The line runs under the road at both ends of the station.[tpl]cite book |title=OS Landranger Map 172 - Bristol & Bath |year=2008 |publisher=Ordnance Survey |location=Southampton |isbn=978-0-319-22914-9[/tpl] Access between the platforms is via steps to the A38 at the east end of the platforms. There is no disabled access.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/psn.html |title=Parson Street (PSN) |publisher=National Rail |accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl]
Facilities at the station are minimal - there is a metal and glass shelter on each of the two islands as well as on the bridge. The station is completely unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, nor is there any cycle storage available. There are several bus stops nearby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/posters/PSN.pdf|title=Parson Street Station: Onward Travel Information|publisher=Network Rail|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl]
Just to the west of the station is Parson Street Junction, where the Portishead Branch diverges from the main line, heading north. The South Liberty Lane goods depot is adjacent to the junction, in the triangle between the main line, the Portishead Branch and the now-disused western connection between the branch and the main line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iorw.org/news_index.html|title=Rail industry news|quote=Network Rail and Freightliner have jointly reinstated a short section of disused track near Bristol Temple Meads enabling seven wine trains to terminate at South Liberty Lane depot every week.

==Services==

The station is managed by First Great Western, who also operate all rail services from the station. As of the December 2011 timetable, the basic service from Monday to Friday consists of one train in each direction per hour, between [tpl]rws|Bristol Parkway[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Weston-super-Mare[/tpl], calling at all stations. Some trains working between Cardiff and [tpl]rws|Taunton[/tpl] or [tpl]rws|Exeter St Davids[/tpl] call at peak hours and in the evening. All trains at Parson Street also stop at [tpl]rws|Nailsea and Backwell[/tpl] westbound and [tpl]rws|Bedminster[/tpl] eastbound. On Saturday there is a similar pattern, but with no services beyond Bristol Parkway or Weston-super-Mare except during the early morning and late evening. Sunday sees a reduced service, with only three trains westbound and two eastbound, all after 4pm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/~/media/PDF/TicketsAndTrainTimes/TrainTimes/December%202013%20Timetables/TTC04_Web.ashx|title=Central 4: Guide to train times 8 December 2013 to 17 May 2014 - Cardiff and Bristol to Weston-super-Mare and Taunton|date=November 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|publisher=First Great Western[/tpl]
Services are formed by a mix of [tpl]brc|150[/tpl], [tpl]brc|153|n[/tpl] and [tpl]brc|158|n[/tpl] diesel multiple-unit trains. Until 2012, [tpl]brc|143[/tpl] Pacer units were a regular sight, but these have mostly been moved south to work in Devon and Cornwall following a cascade of Class 150/1 units from London Midland and London Overground.[tpl]cite news |title=LOROL Class 150s all with FGW |author=Miles, Tony |work=Modern Railways |location =London |date= December 2010 |page=90[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Salveson, Paul | editor = Abell, Paul | date = June 2012 | title = Severn Beach: Not your typical branch line! | journal = Today's Railways | issue =126 | pages =42–47 | location =Sheffield | publisher =Platform 5 [/tpl] CrossCountry services between Scotland and the South West pass non-stop throughout the day,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/SiteImages/Assets/3/Scotland_the_North_East_to_the_South_West_and_South_Coast_V2.pdf |title=Timetable: Scotland, the North East to the South West and South Coast; 11 December 2011 to 13 May 2012 |publisher=CrossCountry|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] with First Great Western services between London Paddington and Weston-super-Mare passing through during the morning and evening peaks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/~/media/PDF/TicketsAndTrainTimes/TrainTimes/December%202013%20Timetables/TTC01_Web.ashx|title=Central 1: Guide to train times 8 December 2013 to 17 May 2014 - London to Bristol, Cheltenham Spa and South Wales|date=November 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|publisher=First Great Western[/tpl]

==History==

The first section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway's main line opened on 14 June 1841 between Bristol and [tpl]rws|Bridgwater[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway, vol. II: 1863–1921 |year=1931 |publisher=Great Western Railway |location=Paddington |oclc=55853736 |pages=133–4, 617 |ref=harv [/tpl] Engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the line was originally built as [tpl]RailGauge|7ft[/tpl] broad-gauge, but had been reconstructed as a mixed gauge line to accommodate local [tpl]RailGauge|ussg[/tpl]-gauge traffic by 1 June 1875. Broad gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892. The Portishead Branch Line, which diverged from the Bristol to Exeter Line at Parson Street Junction, the other side of a road bridge west of where the station would be built, had opened on 12 July 1867. It was only in 1871, with the opening of a station at [tpl]rws|Bedminster[/tpl] that there was a stop between the junction and Bristol Temple Meads.[tpl]cite book|title=Bristol Railway Stations 1840–2005|publisher=Redcliffe Press|author=Oakley, Mike|year=2006|isbn=1-904537-54-5[/tpl]
As Bristol expanded in the early 20th century, the need for a new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt.[tpl]#tag:ref|Sources are inconsistent about the name of the station - Oakley's book on Bristol railway stations says the station was called Parson Street Platform, while both Butt's directory and the work of Mitchell and Smith state it was Parson Street Halt.[tpl]Butt-Stations|page=181[/tpl]|group=Note|name="Platform"[/tpl] There were two platforms, one on each side of the two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.
The station was rebuilt in the early 1930s to cope with the relaying of the line west from Temple Meads with four tracks instead of two. Considerable engineering works were needed to cope with the widening of the station, including the removal of a short tunnel to the west of the station. The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933, and the station name was changed to simply Parson Street in November 1933. The new station included covered waiting shelters, and a booking office on the road bridge. Again, no goods facilities were provided.
Parson Street railway station served a dual purpose: as well as serving local suburban developments for commuter and excursion traffic, it also acted as a minor interchange for passengers on the Portishead Branch Line. When Parson Street opened in 1927, there were 21 services each weekday along the branch, operated by the Great Western Railway at half-hour intervals from Temple Meads. There were 8 trains on Sundays.[tpl]cite book |title=Lost Railways of Somerset |author=Yorke, Stan |year=2007 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury, Berkshire |isbn=978-1-84674-057-2 |pages=113–122[/tpl]
Following the Second World War, service levels dropped dramatically along the Portishead branch. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Parson Street came under the auspices of the Western Region of British Railways, and by the time the branch was closed to passengers in 1964, there were only six trains each weekday, and none on Sundays. With the closure of the branch, Parson Street lost its interchange status, and in January 1971 the station buildings were demolished. Some special services did continue along the branch to [tpl]rws|Ashton Gate[/tpl], carrying fans to Bristol City FC games at the nearby Ashton Gate Stadium. These ceased in 1977, and Parson Street became the arrival and departure point for these trains.
The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down Relief line, the most southern of the four running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west. At the same time, Parson Street Junction was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from the Down Main line to the Up Main line before they were able to access the Portishead Branch.[tpl]cite book|author1=Mitchell, Vic|author2=Smith, Keith|title=Branch Lines to Clevedon and Portishead|date=October 2003|publisher=Middleton Press|isbn=1-904474-18-7[/tpl] The Down Relief line was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at St Philips Marsh to service High Speed Trains.[tpl]cite book |last=Yonge |first=John |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=Gerald |title=Railway Track Diagrams 3: Western |edition=4th |date=November 2005 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0-9549866-1-X |at=map 5B |ref=harv [/tpl]
British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Bedminster passed to Regional Railways. Local services were franchised to Wales and West when the railway was privatised in 1997,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/11/99/track_record/regions/west_southwest.stm|title=Track record: West and South-West|publisher=BBC|date=November 1999|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=Frith, Malcolm[/tpl] which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.walesandwest.co.uk/|title=Wales and West|publisher=Wales and West|accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl] The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of First Group.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theironroad.net/Operator/Train-Operating-Companies/Wessex-Trains/|title=Wessex Trains |work=The Iron Road: Railway Photography by Scott Borthwick|accessdate=29 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4523592.stm|title=FirstGroup wins rail franchises|date=13 December 2005|accessdate=27 April 2012|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13351368|title=First Great Western bids for longer rail franchise deal|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]
In recent years, there has been a marked increase in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 financial year, less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six eastbound and eight westbound trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service levels have increased to 21 westbound trains and 18 eastbound per weekday, and passenger levels have more than quadrupled, to 68,840 in 2010/11.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529|title=Station usage|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation[/tpl]Annual estimated passenger usage based on sales of tickets in stated financial year(s) which end or originate at Parson Street from Office of Rail Regulation statistics.

The campaign group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held a celebration in 2009 to mark the increase in passenger numbers. They were joined by pupils from Parson Street Primary School who had provided artwork to brighten up the station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fosbr.org.uk/news/2009/parson-street|title=Parson Street Station celebration|publisher=Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways|author=Boston, Julie|date=17 July 2009|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Crazy-creatures-greet-passengers/story-11234536-detail/story.html|title=Crazy creatures to greet Bristol train passengers|publisher=Northcliffe Media|work=This is Bristol|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=22 July 2009[/tpl] This was done as part of the Severnside Schools Community Stations Programme, organised by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.severnside-rail.org.uk/data/downloads/progress%20report%202010.pdf|title=Progress Report: January 2010|publisher=Severnside Community Rail Partnership|accessdate=28 June 2012|date=January 2010[/tpl] The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.severnside-rail.org.uk/data/downloads/progress%20report%202009.pdf|title=Progress Report: January 2009|publisher=Severnside Community Rail Partnership|accessdate=28 June 2012|date=January 2009[/tpl] and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.severnside-rail.org.uk/data/downloads/progress%20report%202011.pdf|title=Progress Report: January 2011|publisher=Severnside Community Rail Partnership|accessdate=28 June 2012|date=January 2011[/tpl]
In 2000/01, the track towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Docks. In 2010, another section of track was reinstated to allow the reopening of South Liberty Lane depot to handle Trans Ocean's wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at the depot every week. The depot had closed in 1990 due to lack of demand for its facilities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-10805870|title=Rail terminal for 'wine trains' opens in Bristol|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=10 June 2012|work=BBC News[/tpl]

==Future==

First Great Western declined an option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Parson Street are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender,[tpl]cite journal|title=First leads a field of seven bidding for rail franchises|author=Haigh, Philip|journal=RAIL magazine|publisher=Bauer Media|date=18 April 2012|pages=8–9|issue=694|location=Peterborough[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2012/07/19-great-western-franchise-to-be.html|title=Great Western franchise to be extended|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=19 July 2012|work=Railnews[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=New Great Western franchise to deliver new express trains |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120727a/ |publisher=Department for Transport |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012[/tpl] but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21272542|title=Great Western London to south Wales rail contest scrapped|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=31 January 2013|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC[/tpl] A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, following negotiations between First Great Western and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin MP.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2013/10/03-first-celebrates-lastminute-great-western.html|title=First celebrates last-minute Great Western deal|work=Railnews|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24378053|title=First Great Western retains Wales and west rail franchise|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

==Incidents==

There have been several railway incidents in the Parson Street area over the years. On 19 November 2002, a Wessex Trains diesel multiple unit suffered an axle problem near Parson Street while operating a westbound service, causing the line to be blocked for four hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiffandavonside.org.uk/Magazines/Old_Magazines/2003/0301mag.htm|title=January 2003|publisher=Cardiff & Avonside Railway Society|date=January 2003|accessdate=9 May 2012|quote=19/11 Following the failure of a Wessex Trains working around 17.30 near Parsons Street station, the down main was blocked for around four hours as the unit had suffered a serious axle problem.[/tpl] Delays all along the line to [tpl]rws|Taunton[/tpl] have been caused by trackside cabling being stolen, affecting signalling between [tpl]rws|Nailsea and Backwell[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Bedminster[/tpl]. Notable occurrences of this type happened in October 2006 and May 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cardiffandavonside.org.uk/Magazines/Old_Magazines/2006/0612mag.htm|title=December 2006|publisher=Cardiff & Avonside Railway Society|date=December 2006|accessdate=9 May 2012|quote=25/10 There were morning service delays as repairs were carried out to damaged trackside cabling near Parson's Street station which affected signalling between Bedminster and Nailsea around 06.00. It is thought the incident had been caused by vandals.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/update_vandalism_causes_rail_misery_1_1384770|title=Update: Vandalism causes rail misery|author=Wright, Tom|work=Weston, Worle and Somerset Mercury|publisher=Archant Community Media|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl] Theft of personal property has also occurred on the station.
