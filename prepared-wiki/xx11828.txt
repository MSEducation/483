Observers contend that Gibson's influence on the development of the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream.[tpl]cite web |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |date=February 2001 |title=Riding shotgun with William Gibson |publisher=Salon.com |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/02/07/gibson_doc/index.html |accessdate= 2007-11-06 [/tpl] Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the "meatpuppet", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of virtual sex.[tpl]cite news |first=Jayne M. |last=Blanchard |title=Sci-Fi Author Gibson Is `Cyber'-Crowd's Guru |work=St. Paul Pioneer Press |publisher=MediaNews Group |date=September 12, 1993 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |quote=Although author William Gibson came up with the concept of virtual sex, he does not want any parts of it, thank you very much.

Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?"[tpl]cite book | last = Gibson | first = William |coauthors=Jack Womack | title = Neuromancer | publisher = Ace Books | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-441-01203-9 |oclc = 55745255 |page=269[/tpl]
Gibson scholar Tatiani G. Rapatzikou has commented, in Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson, on the origin of the notion of cyberspace:
[tpl]bquote|Gibson's vision, generated by the monopolising appearance of the terminal image and presented in his creation of the cyberspace matrix, came to him when he saw teenagers playing in video arcades. The physical intensity of their postures, and the realistic interpretation of the terminal spaces projected by these games – as if there were a real space behind the screen—made apparent the manipulation of the real by its own representation.[tpl]cite book | last = Rapatzikou | first = Tatiani | title = Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-90-420-1761-0 |oclc = 55807961[/tpl][/tpl]
In his Sprawl and Bridge trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities.[tpl]cite journal |last=Dear |first=Michael |coauthors=Steven Flusty |date=March 1998 |title=Postmodern Urbanism |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=50–72 |doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00084|accessdate= 2007-11-05 [/tpl] Not all responses to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce, though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that "no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally effected the direction of the hacker community,"[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/pesce.html |title=Magic Mirror: The Novel as a Software Development Platform |accessdate=2007-12-02 |last=Pesce |first=Mark |work=MIT Communications Forum |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology[/tpl] dismissed them as "adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/1998/06/13/feature947640934/ |title=3-D epiphany |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Pesce |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Pesce |date=1998-07-13 |publisher=Salon.com[/tpl] In Pattern Recognition, the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon.

For his part, Gibson rejects any notion of prophecy. Although the press stated that he used Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson said that "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite them appearing in his stories.[tpl]cite news | title=An Interview with William Gibson | work=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1988 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | page=30[/tpl] An anecdote often recited in cybercultural enclaves and English departments holds that Neuromancer was written on a manual typewriter;[tpl]cite book | last = Bukatman | first = Scott | title = Matters of Gravity |chapter=Gibson's Typewriter |publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-8223-3119-3 |oclc = 51058973[/tpl] the author has confirmed that the novel was written on a 1927 model of an olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which looked to him as "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field".[tpl]r|gibson198809[/tpl][tpl]Ref_label|H|VIII|none[/tpl] By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"),[tpl]r|gibson198809[/tpl] but until 1996 Gibson did not have an email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing.

VII. [tpl]Note_label|G|VII|none[/tpl] The idea of a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site was first described in 1962 in a series of memos on the "Galactic Computer Network" by J.C.R. Licklider of DARPA.

VIII. [tpl]Note_label|H|VIII|none[/tpl] Gibson wrote the following in the "Author's Afterword" of Mona Lisa Overdrive, dated July 16, 1992.
Neuromancer was written on a "clockwork typewriter," the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black "crackle" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.
