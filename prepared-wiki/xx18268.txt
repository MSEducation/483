===Eastern Europe===

Advocates of the flat tax argue that the former communist states of Eastern Europe have benefited from the adoption of a flat tax.  Some of these nations have experienced strong economic growth of 6% and higher in recent years[tpl]When|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl], particularly the Baltic countries, who experience exceptional GDP growth of around 10% yearly. Some argue that other factors, primarily the advent of capitalist economic systems and rapid market expansion after Soviet (communist) domination explain the rapid growth. Some argue that economic growth in these countries would likely have occurred regardless of the chosen tax system.
