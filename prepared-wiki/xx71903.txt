Rudolph Joseph Rummel (October 21, 1932 – March 2, 2014Honolulu Star-Advertiser Obituaries) was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii. He spent his career assembling data on collective violence and war with a view toward helping their resolution or elimination. Rummel coined the term democide for murder by government (compare genocide), and his research claims that six times as many people died of democide during the 20th century than in all that century's wars combined.[tpl]Wayback |date=20071101055924 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/11/reevaluating-chinas-democide-to-be.html |title=Democratic Peace: Reevaluating China's Democide to be 73,000,000 [/tpl] He concluded that democracy is the form of government least likely to kill its citizens and that democracies do not wage war against each otherAbout R.J. Rummel – Freedom, Democide, War (see Democratic peace theory).
Rummel was the author of 24 scholarly books, and published his major results in Understanding Conflict and War (1975–81). He then spent the next fifteen years refining the underlying theory and testing it empirically on new data, against the empirical results of others, and on case studies. Power Kills (1997) sums up Rummel's research. Other works include Lethal Politics: Soviet Genocides and Mass Murders 1917–1987 (1990); China's Bloody Century: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900 (1991); Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder (1992); Death by Government (1994); and Statistics of Democide (1997). Extracts, figures, and tables from the books, including his sources and details regarding the calculations, are available online on his website. Rummel also authored Understanding Factor Analysis (1970) and Understanding Correlation (1976). He was the author of the Never again series of alternative-history novels, in which a secret society sends two lovers armed with fabulous wealth and modern weapons back to 1906 with orders to create an alternative, peaceful century. These works are available online.
There is an extensive FAQ on his webpage, answering many questions and objections regarding the democratic peace and democide.Democratic Peace Q&A Version 2.0 – Freedom, Democide, War The book Never Again: Ending War, Democide, & Famine Through Democratic Freedom is available on his website. This book aims at popularizing his findings and is available as a free download.

==Career==

He received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Hawaii in 1959 and 1961, respectively, and his Ph.D. in Political Science from Northwestern University in 1963. He began his teaching career at Indiana University. In 1964 he moved to Yale University, and finally in 1966 returned to the University of Hawaii, where he spent the rest of his active career. In 1995 he retired and became Professor Emeritus of Political Science. His research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and the United States Peace Research Institute.
Rummel wrote about two dozen books and over 100 professional articles. His book Applied Factor Analysis was selected as a "Citation Classic" by the Institute for Scientific Information in 1987. He received the Susan Strange Award of the International Studies Association in 1999 for having intellectually most challenged the field, and in 2003 was given the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Conflict Processes Section, American Political Science Association.R.J.

==Research==

===Democide===

Rummel was the creator of the term democide: "the murder of any person or people by a government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder". He has further stated: "I use the civil definition of murder, where someone can be guilty of murder if they are responsible in a reckless and wanton way for the loss of life, as in incarcerating people in camps where they may soon die of malnutrition, unattended disease, and forced labor, or deporting them into wastelands where they may die rapidly from exposure and disease."
His research concluded that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, he estimated that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century20th Century Democide, Hawaii.edu and that six times as many people have died at the hands of people working for governments than have died in battle.
He argued that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. "The more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a major reason for promoting freedom." He concluded: "Concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth."[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Democratic peace===

Rummel was one of the early researchers on democratic peace theory, after Dean Babst.DOES DEMOCRACY CAUSE PEACE? James Lee Ray -Annu. Rev. Polit. Sci. 1998. 1:27–46. He found that in the period between 1816 and 2005 there were 205 wars between non-democracies, 166 wars between non-democracies and democracies, and no wars between democracies.
The definition of democracy used is "where those who hold power are elected in competitive elections with a secret ballot and wide franchise (loosely understood as including at least 2/3 of adult males); where there is freedom of speech, religion, and organization; and a constitutional framework of law to which the government is subordinate and that guarantees equal rights". In addition, it should be "well-established". He stated "enough time has passed since its inception for peace-sufficient democratic procedures to become accepted and democratic culture to settle in. Around three years seems to be enough for this".POWER KILLS Appendix 1.1 – Q And A On The Fact That Democracies Do Not Make War On Each Other – By R.J. Rummel – Q AND A ON DEMOCRACY AND WAR – Freedom, Democide, War Regarding war, he adopted the definition of a popular database: War is a conflict causing at least 1,000 battle deaths.
The peace is explained thus: "Start with the answer of the philosopher Immanuel Kant to why universalizing republics (democracy was a bad word for Classical Liberals in his time) would create a peaceful world. People would not support and vote for wars in which they and their loved ones could die and lose their property. But this is only partly correct, for the people can get aroused against nondemocracies and push their leaders toward war, as in the Spanish–American War. A deeper explanation is that where people are free, they create an exchange society of overlapping groups and multiple and crosschecking centers of power. In such a society a culture of negotiation, tolerance, and splitting differences develops. Moreover, free people develop an in-group orientation toward other such societies, a feeling of shared norms and ideals that militates against violence toward other free societies"Democratic Peace Q&A

===Mortacide===

Democide requires intention. Yet what about those regimes that unintentionally, yet culpably, cause the deaths of their citizens through negligence, incompetence or sheer indifference? One example might be a regime where corruption has become so pervasive and destructive of a people's welfare that it threatens their daily lives and reduces their life expectancy. Rummel termed such deaths mortacide. He argued that democracies have the least amount of such deaths.Defining Mortacracies

===Famine, economic growth, and happiness===

Rummel did include famine in democide if he deemed it the result of deliberate policy, as he did with Holodomor. However, he argued that there have been no famines in democracies, deliberate or not. He also argued that democracy is an important factor for economic growth and raising living standards.Chapter 4 Freedom Promotes Wealth and Prosperity[tpl]Wayback |date=20070519174746 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2006/02/global-corruption-and-democracy-2006.html |title=Democratic Peace: Global Corruption and Democracy 2006 [/tpl] and pointed to research showing that average happiness in a nation increases with more democracy.[tpl]Wayback |date=20061102103525 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2006/02/happiness-this-utilitarian-argument.html |title=Democratic Peace: Happiness – This Utilitarian Argument For Freedom Is True [/tpl]
The continuing increase in democracy worldwide will soon, according to Rummel, lead to an end to wars and democide, possibly around or even before the middle of this century.DEMOCRATIC PEACE CLOCK

==Political views==

Rummel was a strong supporter of spreading liberal democracy, although he didn't support invasion of another country solely to replace a dictatorship.Democratic Peace Q&A Version 2.0 – In the Fostering Democracy section, Rummel writes, "I am opposed to invading a country to democratize it." – Freedom, Democide, War Rudolph Rummel talked about the "miracle" of liberty and peace, and was an outspoken critic of communism. However, he also criticized right-wing dictatorships and the democides that occurred under colonialism. He had also been critical of past American foreign policy: for example, the Philippine War, the bombing of civilians during World War II and the involvement in the 1900 Battle of Peking.STATISTICS OF DEMOCIDE Chapter 13 Death By American Bombing And Other Democide * By R.J. Rummel He believed that the U.S. under Woodrow Wilson was a domestic tyranny.http://rudyrummel.blogspot.com/2009/07/so-what-if-lie-it-is-politics-of-power.html
He strongly supported the current War on Terror and the Iraq War. There is a need, Rummel argued, for an intergovernmental organization of all democracies outside of the United Nations to deal with issues about which the UN cannot or will not act, but particularly to further the promotion of peace, human security, human rights, and democracy—an Alliance of Democracies.Eliminating Democide and War Through An Alliance of Democracies* By R.J. Rummel
He also argued that there was a leftist bias in some parts of the academic world that selectively focused on problems in nations with high political and economic freedom and ignored much worse problems in other nations. Related to this, he also criticized the tenure system.[tpl]Wayback |date=20070806141451 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/02/on-ward-churchill-and-academic.html [/tpl][tpl]Wayback |date=20070519174724 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_freedomspeace_archive.html [/tpl]

==Criticisms==

===Democratic peace theory===

The democratic peace theory is now one of great controversies in political science and one of the main challenges to realism in international relations. More than a hundred different researchers have published multiple articles in this field according to an incomplete bibliography.Democratic Peace Bibliography Some critics argue that there have been exceptions to the democratic peace. Rummel discussed some claimed exceptions in his FAQDemocratic Peace Q&A and he has referred to books by other scholars such as Never at War. There are also various other criticisms as discussed in the democratic peace theory article.
Rummel's first work on democratic peace received little attention. His results were incorporated in a "gigantic philosophical scheme" of 33 propositions in a 5 volume work, whose "immoderate pretensions", together with Rummel's "unrelenting" economic liberalism and "extreme" views on defense policy, may have distracted readers from his more conventionally acceptable propositions.http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-3433%28199211%2929%3A4%3C369%3ADAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y (Quotations from Nils Petter Gleditsch: "Democracy and Peace" (1995), a paper that warmly defends the existence of democratic peace, and asserts that it, and the difficulty distant states have in waging war against each other, fully account for the phenomena.)[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
His version of the democratic peace theory has some distinctive features disputed by some other researchers who support the existence and explanatory power of the democratic peace:
Rummel did not always use his definition of democracy; nor did he always take pains to indicate when he was not. The opening paragraphs of an appendix from his book Power Kills http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/PK.APPEN1.1.HTM adopt Michael Doyle's lists of liberal democracies for 1776–1800 and 1800–1850. http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0048-3915%28198322%2912%3A3%3C205%3AKLLAFA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O Doyle uses a much looser definition: The secret ballot was first adopted, by Tasmania, in 1856, and Belgium had barely 10% adult male suffrage before 1894.

==Awards and Nominations==

In 1999, Rummel was awarded the Susan Strange Award of the International Studies Association.AWARD RECIPIENTS This award recognizes a person "whose singular intellect, assertiveness, and insight most challenge conventional wisdom and intellectual and organizational complacency in the international studies community".Susan Strange Award
In 2003, Rummel was given The Lifetime Achievement Award from the Conflict Processes Organized Section of the American Political Science Association for "scholarly contributions that have fundamentally improved the study of conflict processes".Conflict Processes Organized Section Lifetime Achievement Award Recipients
Rummel was initially stated to have been a finalist for the Nobel Prize for Peace, based on media reports and especially an AP report, reprinted in the Honolulu Advertiser on 3/1/96, about an alleged Nobel short list of 117 names.http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NPP.FINALIST.HTM A NECESSARY FOOTNOTEhttp://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NA.SUPPLEMENT.PDF 
Following discussion with a friend and additional research, he stated that he has been "frequently nominated" for the Nobel prize.A Freedomist View Rummel basis for this claim was a printed remark made by Per Ahlmark, Swedish writer and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, who pledged in 1999 to persistently nominate Rummel for the Nobel Peace Prize during the next decade. While the Statutes of the Nobel Foundationhttp://nobelprize.org/nobel/nobel-foundation/statutes.html#par10 insist on confidentiality of the nomination, some sponsors breach this secrecy rule.NOBEL PEACE PRIZE: IN GOD'S COUNTRY

==Never Again Series==

Rummel is also author of the Never Again Series. According to the series' website, Never Again is "a what-if, alternative history... which two lovers are sent back in time to 1906 with modern weapons and 38 billion 1906 dollars" in order to prevent the rise of totalitarianism and the outbreak of world war.
