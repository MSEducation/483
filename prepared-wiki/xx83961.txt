Sherron Watkins (born August 28, 1959) was Vice President of Corporate Development at the Enron Corporation. Watkins testified about her role in the Enron fraud before committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate at the beginning of 2002. 
In August 2001, Watkins alerted then-Enron CEO Kenneth Lay of accounting irregularities in financial reports. However, Watkins has been criticized for not reporting the fraud to government authorities and  not speaking up publicly sooner about her concerns, as her memo did not reach the public until five months after it was written.[tpl]cite web|last=Ackman|first=Dan|title=Sherron Watkins Had Whistle But Blew It|url=http://www.forbes.com/2002/02/14/0214watkins.html|publisher=Forbes Magazine|website = Forbes.com|date = 2002-02-14|accessdate = 2013-08-11[/tpl] Ms. Watkins was represented by Houston attorney Philip H.
