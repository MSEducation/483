[[Serpell Report]]

CATEGORIES: 1982 in rail transport, Transport policy in the United Kingdom

The Serpell Report was produced by a committee chaired by Sir David Serpell, a senior civil servant. It was commissioned by the government of Margaret Thatcher to examine the state and long-term prospects of Great Britain's railway system. There were two main parts to the report. The first (and lengthier) part described in detail at the state of British Rail's finances in 1982.  The second part looked at various options for a future (1992) rail network, and made comparisons between each option and the continuing the existing network. 

==Background==

In many ways, 1982 represented the nadir of Britain's railways. That year saw the lowest number of passenger journeys of the second half of the 20th century, the lowest level of passenger-miles, and the lowest (real) level of passenger revenue since 1968.Table 6.1 from Transport Statistics Great Britain (Excel file) Although these figures were partly the result of the 1982 strike (over rostering arrangements), rail passenger numbers had been in steady decline since 1957. (Only 1978–1980 saw consecutive years of passenger growth). In 1982 terms, revenues had decreased steadily from £2,300 million in 1970 to £1,800 million in 1982, while costs had risen from £2,500 million to £2,700 million.Serpell report page 109 (page 112 in the PDF file) Consequently, BR's deficit had increased by a factor of 4.5.

==Options==

For reference, in 1982, journeys totalling 18,300 million passenger-miles were made; the network comprised 10,370 route miles; and BR's passenger deficit was £933 million.  The various options for the network considered in Part 2 were as follows:
The report also briefly considered an Option H – a "high investment" option. This looked at the effects of new rolling stock on maintenance costs, and concluded that the return would be far too small. 
Otherwise, the report did not seriously examine the effects of improving rail services.Alan Williams Not the age of the train, Ian Allen Ltd (Shepperton) 1983 ISBN 0-7110-1349-7

==Effects==

The report was portrayed by rail supporters as a "second Beeching", was not taken up by the government, and did not result in any network changes. Passenger numbers picked up through the mid and late eighties, reaching a 20-year high in 1988, and have continued to grow since.
