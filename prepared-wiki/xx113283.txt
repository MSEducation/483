Kristof Ziegler and Marius Markus met at Lofsrud Skole in Mortensrud, Oslo. The two didn't become friends until they discovered a mutual liking for Stoner rock and Punk rock. After a year at boarding school, Ziegler joined Markus' current band as a singer as a temporary fill-in, but was immediately given the option to join the band as a permanent member from the current singer in an attempt to be recognized. Both Ziegler and the other members accepted, and the band started doing shows in Oslo. The band got second place in the Norwegian Battle of Bands competition"Aftenposten: Spillet om NM Gullet" later that year and was signed by a management company the next year.
