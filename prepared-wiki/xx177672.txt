He was at the helm for four games in 1924, winning two and losing two, and for two games in 1928, finishing with one loss and one tie. The first of those games was for the 1928 Summer Olympics, and saw the United States lose to Argentina 11-2, which eliminated the Americans from the Games. The second was a 3-3 draw against Poland.
