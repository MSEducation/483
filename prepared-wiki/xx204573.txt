Isaac Rochussen or Isaac Rockesen (1631–1710) was a 17th-century Dutch corsair and privateer during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch War. His capture of the The Falcon, a merchantman belonging to the East India Company, was one of the most valued ships captured during the late 17th century.

==Biography==

Isaac Rochussen was born in the city of Vlissingen, although little of his life is recorded. An active corsair during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch War, he captured the English East India merchantman The Falcon near the Isles of Scilly on July 7, 1672.Bruijn, J.N. "Dutch Privateering during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars". The Low Countries History Yearbook, XII (1978): 91. The prize was sold at as 350,000 gilders, the highest paid for the time when an average ship and cargo went for only a few thousand or, at best, tens of thousands of gilders. The Falcon was thereafter referred to by the Dutch as De Gouden Valk (or The Golden Falcon). Rochussen himself received a gold medal from the ships´ owner for this capture. He later became a successful privateer in his later years, a trade followed by his son Isaac Rochussen, Jr., before his death in 1710.[tpl]cite web |url=http://zeerovery.nl/history/rochussn.htm |title=Privateers and Pirates: Isaac Rochussen |accessdate= |author=Bruyneel, M. |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2005 |month= |work= |publisher=Isle of Tortuga |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
