[[Ischoklad]]

Ischoklad ("Ice chocolate"; Eiskonfekt in German) is a candy originating in Germany which is now popular in both Germany and Sweden, and it is a seasonal candy in Denmark during Christmas. It is usually made using just chocolate (half to two thirds) and coconut oil (a third to a half).
The reference to ice in the name relates to the fact that it melts very easily in the mouth and is perceived to have a cooling effect as the heat energy is absorbed. This effect is due to the melting point of coconut oil lying between 20 and 23 Celsius degrees; around ten degrees lower than chocolate. In some recipes menthol is added, and in industrial production urea is often added, both of which increase the cooling sensation.
Ischoklad is a popular Swedish Christmas treat. In Germany, the largest producer of eiskonfekt is Eichetti.
