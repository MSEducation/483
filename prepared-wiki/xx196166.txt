==History==

A small group of immigrants from the Rhine River wine district in Germany settled in rural Campbell County and established farms and vineyards. The immigrants constructed numerous buildings with stone masonry, using unusual architectural features that give the area a unique style.  Many of these local properties were added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[tpl]NRISref|version=2010a|[/tpl]
