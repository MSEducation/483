Guide-A-Ride is MTA New York City Transit’s bus stop information display. It is a rectangular box attached to the bus stop pole that displays a route map and a schedule.[tpl]cite web|title=How to Ride the Bus, Welcome Tourists and Visitors|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/howto_bus.htm|publisher=MTA New York City Transit Authority|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The prototype for Guide-A-Ride was developed for Transit in 1977, the key novelty in the display of  times to the minute the bus was due at the individual stop.[tpl]cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Ralph|title=Information ‘Kiosks’ Help Bus Riders Solve Puzzle|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60B17FB3C5E167493C6A8178AD95F438785F9|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 14, 1977[/tpl]   Although skeptics doubted the ability of buses on New York’s densely packed streets to show up anything like the times posted, on-time performance proved fairly reliable.   In any event, customers had the comfort of knowing they were in the right place at the right time.   The  actual displays began appearing at New York City bus stops a few years later. Transit operations did not have a good reputation at the time, but Guide-A-Ride came to be viewed as one bright spot.[tpl]cite news|title=The Worm and the Apple|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/01/opinion/the-worm-and-the-apple-user-friendly-and-unfriendly-confused-arrivals.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 1, 1985[/tpl]

==Current Status==

Even in an age when customers can access on their smartphones real-time bus arrivals as projected by satellite, Guide-A-Ride over three decades on remains an aid to bus riders needing a quick sense at a bus stop of the service offered. Similar transit aids can be seen in at bus stops in other cities including Boston,[tpl]cite web|title=Key Bus Route Improvement Program|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/t_projects/default.asp?id=19047|publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Atlanta,[tpl]cite news|last=Hymon|first=Steve|title=The Art of Transit|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2010/08/24/the-art-of-transit-6/|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=The Source|date=August 24, 2010[/tpl] and Los Angeles, while still attracting the astonished notice of visitors to the Big Apple.[tpl]cite news|last=Geller|first=Larry|title=Honolulu city government: near zero bang for the buck|url=http://www.disappearednews.com/2012/06/honolulu-city-government-near-zero-bang.html|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=Disappeared News|date=June 6, 2012[/tpl]
