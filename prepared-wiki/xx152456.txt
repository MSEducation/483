Tretten was also the location of the biggest train disaster in Norway's history. The Tretten train disaster occurred on 22 February 1975 when two passenger trains collided head on. 27 people were killed in the accident.

==The name==

The parish is named after the old farm Tretten (Norse Þrœttin for *Þróttvin - now called Prestgarden 'the vicarage'), since the first church was built there. The first element is þróttr m 'force, power', the last element is vin f 'meadow'. The farm is lying close to the river Moksa, and the first element is probably referring to the stream and the waterfalls in the river here.
