==Career==

A 1963 graduate of Barnard College with an MA (1965) in 18th century English Literature from Columbia University, Erica Jong is best known for her first novel, Fear of Flying (1973), which created a sensation with its frank treatment of a woman's sexual desires.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fear-of-flying-author-erica-jong-zips-along-40-years-after-dropping-her-literary-bombshell/2013/10/07/23fb65f8-29ce-11e3-b139-029811dbb57f_story.html|title=‘Fear of Flying’ author Erica Jong zips along 40 years after dropping her literary bombshell|date=7 October 2013|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=28 February 2014|first=Neely|last=Tucker[/tpl] Although it contains many sexual elements, the book is mainly the account of a hypersensitive young woman, in her late twenties, trying to find who she is and where she is going. It contains many psychological, humorous, descriptive elements, and rich cultural and literary references. The book tries to answer the many conflicts arising in women in late 1960s and early 1970s America, of womanhood, femininity, love, one's quest for freedom and purpose.

Grandma’s flower paintings were filled with lavish colors, sensuous shapes, and the hand of her abused housekeeper, who’d been holding the flowers since early the day before. Grandma’s flower paintings were the stuff of midwestern hotel room walls. But Grandma’s portraits of her children and grandchildren seemed to express something more than just a love of flowers or housekeepers: Grandma’s paintings of her family highlighted her distaste for motherhood".
