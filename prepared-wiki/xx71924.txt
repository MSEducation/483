==History==

Inhabited since the Iron Age, Oundle was originally a trading place and market for local farmers and craftsmen.
The Saxon invasion saw the arrival of a tribe called Undalas which possibly meant undivided. It is the death place of St Wilfrid in 709AD where he had consecrated a church as well as being the location of one of his monasteries. The current St Peter's Church occupies the same site as St Wilfrid's original Church.[tpl]cite web|last=Page|first=William|title=A History of the County of Northampton|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66265|publisher=British History Online[/tpl]

The late Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval cult of saints in England, page 5 .[/ref] Very Little is known of him, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript,Stowe MS 944 II.14, British Library he was from around 1000AD,  buried in the monastery at Oundle near the river Nene,Cett in The Oxford Dictionary of Saints and a chapel to St Cett was built in the eleventh century, on the small knoll beyond the end of St Sythes Lane. The presence of this shrine and the market charter, explain much of the growth of Oundle in the twelth century.
The Domesday book records a population of 36 households, a mill and a value in 1066 of £0.3, which had risen to £11 by 1086.
As the area became prosperous, wealthy traders set up shops and houses, and guilds were formed. Unlike other settlements in the vicinity, Oundle was unaffected by the Black Death in the mid-14th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
Oundle had a grammar school since at least 1465, at which Sir William Laxton (Lord Mayor of London) was educated. He founded Laxton Grammar School in 1556, administered by the Worshipful Company of Grocers, from which Oundle School evolved.
In 1743 a group of mutineers from the Black Watch were captured at Ladywood, near Oundle. They had deserted in protest at being sent abroad, instead of patrolling the Highlands, for which the regiment had been raised.The Black Watch - The MutinyLegends of The Black Watch or Forty-Second Highlanders - The Story of Farquhar Shaw

Other public houses include the Rose & Crown (a 17th Century Inn Haunted by the White Cavalier), the Ship Inn (a 14th-century coaching inn), the Angel, the George and the Riverside, which is currently derelict.
There are a number of churches. By far the most prominent, with the largest steeple in the area, is St Peter's Church which occupies the main churchyard.
