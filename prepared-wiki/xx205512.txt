[[Government Car and Despatch Agency]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct executive agencies of the United Kingdom government, Department for Transport

The Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA) was an executive agency of the Department for Transport, responsible for providing logistics services to the United Kingdom government and wider public sector.  It closed on Sunday 30 September 2012 following discontinuation of its despatch services earlier in the year.  All Government Car services were closed as of that date, with the exception of ministerial transport which transferred to the Department for Transport together with the supporting workshop services.
GCDA was split into two businesses: Government Cars and Government Mail.  Government Cars provided cars and drivers to government ministers and ran other people-movement services for the wider public sector.  Government Mail (formerly known as the Interdespatch Service) provided inter-departmental mail and package movements, and a secure courier service for the wider public sector.
