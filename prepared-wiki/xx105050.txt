==History==

===Forward, Ukraine!===

Originally, the party takes its roots from the electoral bloc "Forward, Ukraine!" that was formed on April 3, 1997. Composed out of several political formations such as the parliamentary faction "Reforms", the Christian-Democratic Party of Ukraine (leader V.Stretovych), the Christian Democratic Union, the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party, Hromada (led by Oleksandr Turchynov), Christian Democratic Youth of Ukraine, the trade union "Our Right", the charity fund "Ukrainian Perspective", Ukrainian fund in support of reforms, and the political association "Young Ukraine". The leading section of that bloc was the parliamentary faction "Reforms" led by Serhiy Sobolyev. In June of 1997 the faction changed its name to "Forward, Ukraine!" as well whose unofficial leader became the deputy speaker Viktor Musiyaka.Секонд-хенд для Наталі Королевської (Second hand for Nataliya Korolevska).

Right before the 1998 Ukrainian parliamentary elections however the bloc fell apart, out which was created the Reforms and Order Party of Viktor Pynzenyk. The rest of the bloc consisting of the Christian Democratic Union, the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party and the Young Ukraine went to the elections under its original name and led by the former deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) Viktor Musiyaka. The bloc "Forward, Ukraine!" proved to be an unsuccessful political project gathering only 1.73% at the elections and receiving no representation. Next year Viktor Musiyaka transformed the bloc into a party with the same name. Interestingly that in 2012 another party with the same name Ukraine - Forward! led by Natalia Korolevska copied the statute of the "Forward, Ukraine!" and also failed to place any representation in parliament in 2012.
The Forward, Ukraine! Party was registered by the Justice Ministry on May 13, 1999.[tpl]uk icon[/tpl] Політична партія „Народна Самооборона“, Database DATA
