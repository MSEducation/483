Once couples have met on a romance tour, an agency arranges "one on one" dates between the man and the women he found most compatible.  The ultimate goal of the tour is for the man to find a compatible wife.
Romance tours are just one part of the mail order bride business, which may also include catalogs, CD-ROMs and the Internet.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2DF143FF937A25751C0A961958260|title=Video Valentines to Russia, Seeking Patient Brides|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=1997-02-14|author=Alessandra Stanley|work=The New York Times[/tpl] The traditional romance tour, seen by some as superficial, is being somewhat replaced by the internet as technology evolves. However, the two are closely linked as a man eventually has to meet his prospective wife using a well organized method of meeting and dating.
Romance tours should not be confused with sex tourism, because the ultimate goal of a sex tourist is usually not marriage.
