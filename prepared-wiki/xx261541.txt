Site of Old Croton Dam is a historic dam site located at Yorktown, Westchester County, New York. The dam was built between 1837 and 1842 and was the first substantial masonry dam in the United States. Construction of the dam was delayed by a January 1841 storm that washed away most of the dam.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorktownhistory.org/newsletters/fall04.pdf |title=Preserve the Past - Enlighten the Future |publisher=Yorktown Historical Society |first=Joan J. |last=Fyfe |format=PDF |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=2011-11-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ascemetsection.org/content/view/341/875/ |title=Croton Water Supply System |work=ASCE Metropolitan Section |accessdate=2011-11-03[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Tompkins |first=Christopher R. |title=The Croton Dams and Aqueduct |series=Images of America |year=2000 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=0-7385-0455-6 |page=8[/tpl]
A gravity dam constructed with a rubble core and granite ashlar foundation, it was [tpl]convert|57|ft|m[/tpl] high and [tpl]convert|670|ft|m[/tpl] long.  The dam formed a reservoir several miles long, extending northeast along the path of the Croton River.   Water flowed to New York City through the Old Croton Aqueduct, which starts just upstream of the dam and carries water down the Croton River valley toward the Hudson, and roughly follows the Hudson south.  The dam and aqueduct constitute a major part of the original New York City water supply system.  When the New Croton Dam was completed in 1906, the old dam was submerged, but the aqueduct continued to operate until 1955.  When the reservoir created by the New Croton Dam is full, the old dam is submerged to [tpl]convert|34|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10399 |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Site of Old Croton Dam |date=April 1973 |accessdate=2011-01-01 |first=Lenore M. |last=Rennenkampf |publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10383|title=Accompanying four photos[/tpl][ref]
