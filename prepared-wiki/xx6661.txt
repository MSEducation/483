===Topography===

Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of [tpl]convert|502.7|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us[/tpl], comprising [tpl]convert|468.7|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of land and [tpl]convert|34.0|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of water. The city extends for [tpl]convert|44|mi|km[/tpl] longitudinally and for [tpl]convert|29|mi|km[/tpl] latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is [tpl]convert|342|mi|km[/tpl].
Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city is [tpl]convert|5074|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Mount Lukens,[tpl]cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#50| title=Elevations of the 50 Largest Cities (by population, 1980 Census) – USGS| publisher=United States Geological Survey| accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/09e.htm| title=Mount Lukens – Sierra Club – Hundred Peak Section | publisher=Sierra Club Angeles Chapter| accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.
The Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel.[tpl]cite book|last=Gumprecht|first=Blake|title=The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC|accessdate=2011-10-03|date=March 2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6642-5|page=173[/tpl] The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.
The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub,[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=George Oxford|title=Landscaping with Native Plants of Southern California|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RjbPQ6ZOgzMC&pg=PA15|accessdate=2011-10-06|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-2967-2|page=15[/tpl] which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Though it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra)[tpl]cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native.

===Geology===

Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/facts.php |title=Earthquake Facts |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] One of the major faults is the San Andreas Fault.

Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes.[tpl]cite journal | url = https://www.sciencemag.org/content/283/5407/1516.abstract?ck=nck | journal = Science | title = An Elusive Blind-Thrust Fault Beneath Metropolitan Los Angeles | date = March 5, 1999 | volume = 283 | pages = 1516–1518 | last1 = Shaw | first1 = John H. | last2 = Shearer | first2 = Peter M. | accessdate =2011-10-03 | issue = 5407 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5407.1516 | pmid = 10066170[/tpl] Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960.[tpl]cite web| url=http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/web_tsus/19600522/damage.htm|title=May 22, 1960 South Central Chile Tsunami Damage along the Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California coasts|accessdate=2011-10-03| work=May 22, 1960 South Central Chile Tsunami Coverage|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Climate===

Los Angeles has a Subtropical-Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csb on the coast, Csa inland), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid either Köppen's BSh or BSk (semi-arid climate) classification. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&refer=| title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America| publisher=Weatherbase.com| accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl]
The average annual temperature in downtown is [tpl]convert|66|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl]: [tpl]convert|75|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] during the day and [tpl]convert|57|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from [tpl]convert|59|to|73|F|C[/tpl] during the day and [tpl]convert|45|to|55|F|C[/tpl] at night. In the warmest month – August – the temperature typically ranges from [tpl]convert|79|to|90|F|C[/tpl] during the day and around [tpl]convert|64|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] at night.
Temperatures exceed [tpl]convert|90|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl] on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 Fahrenheit (16 Celsius) degrees.[tpl]cite web  | url = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/041484.pdf  | title = Climatography of the United States No. 20 (1971–2000) – Canoga Park Pierce Collg, CA  | format=PDF  | year=2004  | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  | accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl] The average annual temperature of the sea is [tpl]convert|63|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl], from [tpl]convert|58|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] in January to [tpl]convert|68|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] in August.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach/california-ocean-temperature.html|title=Pacific Ocean Temperatures on California Coast|publisher=beachcalifornia.com|accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl] Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/united-states/california/los-angeles-ca.php|title=Los Angeles Climate Guide|publisher=weather2travel.com|accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl]
The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other.

Downtown Los Angeles averages [tpl]convert|15.14|in|mm|1[/tpl] of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April), generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but often as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms during winter storms. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the mountains get slightly more. However the San Fernando Valley Region of Los Angeles can get between [tpl]convert|16|and|20|in|mm[/tpl] of rain per year. Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is bimodal, with a short string of dry years (perhaps [tpl]convert|7|–|8|in|mm|disp=or[/tpl]) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin, but the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter.

===Environmental issues===

A Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyáangẚ (written Yang-na by the Spanish), which has been translated as "poison oak place". Yang-na has also been translated as "the valley of smoke."According to Gordon J. MacDonald, geophysicist and professor formerly with the University of California, San Diego, quoted in [tpl]cite news|first=Chris |last=Bowman |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080709015204/http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/1066675.html|url=http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/1066675.html|title=Smoke is Normal – for 1800|work=The Sacramento Bee|date=July 8, 2008|archivedate=2008-07-09|accessdate =2011-10-06[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.[tpl]cite book|last=Stimson|first=Thomas E.|title=What can we do about smog?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|accessdate=2011-10-06|date=July 1955|publisher=Popular Mechanics|page=65|issn=00324558[/tpl]

Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years due to aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.
The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html |title=People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution|publisher=American Lung Association|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070325171724/http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2a.html|archivedate=2007-03-25|accessdate =2011-10-07[/tpl] In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.[tpl]cite web|title= Pittsburgh and Los Angeles the most polluted US cities|url=http://www.citymayors.com/environment/polluted_uscities.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080912203013/http://citymayors.com/environment/polluted_uscities.html|archivedate=2008-09-12|date= May 4, 2008|publisher=citymayors.com | accessdate =2011-10-07[/tpl]  The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-14/los-angeles-meets-20-percent-renewable-energy-goal.html |title=Los Angeles meets 20 percent renewable energy goal |publisher=Bloomberg|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110201090303/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-14/los-angeles-meets-20-percent-renewable-energy-goal.html|archivedate=2011-02-01|date=January 14, 2011|accessdate =2011-10-07[/tpl]

==Government==

Los Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the Mayor of Los Angeles which operate under a mayor-council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The current mayor is Eric Garcetti. There are 15 city council districts.
The city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).
The Charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are currently about 90 neighborhood councils.
Residents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th supervisorial districts. They also elect the 45th, 46th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, 54th, 59th, 64th, and 70th district State Assemblymen, the 18th, 27th, 30th, and 35th district State Senators, and the 28th, 29th, 30th, 33rd, 37th, and 44th district U.S. Representatives.
