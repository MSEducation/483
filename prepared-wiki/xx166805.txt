Bonded Parallels ([tpl]lang-hy|Խճճված զուգահեռներ[/tpl]) is a 2009 film written and directed by Armenian filmmaker Hovhannes Galstyan. This film deals with two stories which take place at different times and linked by the birth of the protagonist, the daughter, and the death of the second main character, the mother. The destiny of these two heroines has been influenced by the true story of an Armenian soldier during World War II in Norway and by director's personal history.

==Plot==

Norway, World War II. Hanna, whose husband Henrik participates in the resistance movement, gives temporary asylum to a prisoner of war, Arakel, by hiding him in her house in northern Norway. The presence of this stranger changes Hanna's life, and she starts writing about her mixed feelings in her diary.
Soviet Union, Armenia, 1988. Laura, 42, a single and fiercely independent math-teacher, lives a quiet and isolated life in Yerevan. It seems that nothing can change her rigidly ordered daily routine until she receives the diary of her mother, who died while giving birth to her. As Laura learns about her parents' story for the first time - a love story of desperation, loss and primal passion - she begins to experience a parallel story of forbidden love in her own life.
