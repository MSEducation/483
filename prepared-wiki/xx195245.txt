[[Gumuz language]]

CATEGORIES: Komuz languages, Languages of Ethiopia, Languages of Sudan

Gumuz (also spelled "Gumaz") is a dialect cluster spoken along the border of Ethiopia and Sudan. Most Ethiopian speakers live in Kamashi Zone and Metekel Zone of the Benishangul-Gumuz Region, although a group of 1,000 reportedly live outside the town of Welkite (Unseth 1989). The Sudanese speakers live in the area east of Er Roseires, around Famaka and Fazoglo on the Blue Nile, extending north along the border.Raymond G. Gordon, Jr, ed. 2005. Ethnologue:  Languages of the World. 15th edition. Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.
An early record of this language is a wordlist from the Mount Guba area compiled in February 1883 by Juan Maria Schuver.Wendy James, et al., Juan Maria Schuver's Travels in North East Africa, 1880-1883 (London: Hakluyt Society, 1996), pp. 340-43

==Varieties==

Varieties are not all mutually intelligible. By that standard, there are two or three Gumuz languages. Grammatical forms are distinct between northern and southern Gumuz.Ahland, Colleen Anne. 2004. "Linguistic variation within Gumuz: a study of the relationship between historical change and intelligibility."  M.A. thesis. University of Texas at Arlington.

==Phonology==

Gumuz has both ejective consonants and implosives. The implosive quality is being lost at the velar point of articulation in some dialects (Unseth 1989).  There is a series of palatal consonants, including both ejective and implosive.  In some dialects, e.g. Sirba, there is a labialized palatalized bilabial stop, as in the word for 'rat' [tpl]IPA|bʲʷa[/tpl] (Unseth 1989).
Tones are high and low, with downstep.Colleen Ahland, 2012. "A Grammar of Northern and Southern Gumuz", Doctoral Dissertation, University of Oregon.

==Grammar==

Word order is AVO, with marked nominative case, though there is AOV order in the north, probably from Amharic influence .
In intransitive clauses, subjects in S–V order are unmarked, whereas those in V–S order are marked for nominative case.Colleen Ahland, 2012. "A Grammar of Northern and Southern Gumuz", Doctoral Dissertation, University of Oregon.

==Classification==

Dimmendaal (2008) notes that mounting grammatical evidence has made the Nilo-Saharan proposal as a whole more sound since Greenberg proposed it in 1963, but that such evidence has not been forthcoming for Songhay, Koman, and Gumuz: "very few of the more widespread nominal and verbal morphological markers of Nilo-Saharan are attested in the Coman languages plus Gumuz ... Their genetic status remains debatable, mainly due to lack of more extensive data." (2008:843) And later, "In summarizing the current state of knowledge, ... the following language families or phyla can be identified — ... Mande, Songhai, Ubangian, Kadu, and the Coman languages plus Gumuz." (2008:844)
This "Coman plus Gumuz" is what Greenberg (1963) had subsumed under Koman and what Bender (1989) had called Komuz, a broader family consisting of Gumuz and the Koman languages. However, Bender (2000) separated Gumuz as at least a distinct branch of Nilo-Saharan, and suggested that it might even be a language isolate. Dimmendaal (2000), who tentatively included Koman within Nilo-Saharan, excluded Gumuz as an isolate, as it did not share the tripartite singulative–collective–plurative number system characteristic of the rest of the Nilo-Saharan language families. Ahland (2010, 2012), however, reports that with better attestation Gumuz does indeed appear to be Nilo-Saharan, and perhaps closest to Koman; it has grammatical forms that resemble what might be expected from an ancestral proto-Nilo-Saharan language, and thus may help elucidate the family, which is extremely diverse and has been difficult to substantiate.
