[[Þrúðr]]

CATEGORIES: Valkyries, Ásynjur

Þrúðr (Old Norse "strength"Lindow (2001:291).), sometimes anglicized as Thrúd or Thrud, is a daughter of the major god Thor in Norse mythology. Þrúðr is also the name of one of the valkyries who serve ale to the einherjar in Valhalla (Grímnismál, stanza 36). The two may or may not be the same figure.Simek 1987

==Attestations==

Þrúðr is attested in the following sources:

===Poetic Edda===

Even if her name is not given, the Poetic Edda poem Alvíssmál, in which Thor's daughter is engaged to a dwarf, Alvíss, may also be about Þrúðr.

===Prose Edda===

The Prose Edda bookt Skáldskaparmál (4) tells that Thor can be referred to by the kenning "father of Þrúðr" ("faðir Þrúðar"). Eysteinn Valdason uses it in his poem about Thor (2). The Skáldskaparmál (21) adds that her mother is Sif.
In Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdrápa, the Jötunn Hrungnir is called "thief of Þrúðr" (Þrúðar þjófr). But there is no direct reference to this myth in any other source. The Skáldskaparmál (17), in which Snorri relates the fight between Thor and Hrungnir, mentions a very different cause, and Þjóðólfr of Hvinir's Haustlöng only describes the fight without giving the reason for it. This poem depicts two mythological scenes painted on a shield, the first being Iðunn's abduction by the giant Þjazi. Margaret Clunies Ross suggested that the two episodes might be complementary, both dealing with the abduction of a goddess by a giant, its failure and the death of the abductor.Clunies Ross 1994, p. 114. Another kenning may allude to this myth: in Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Þórsdrápa (18), Thor is called "he who longs fiercely for Þrúðr" (þrámóðnir Þrúðar).

===Karlevi Runestone===

Þrúðr is mentioned on 10th century Karlevi runestone on the island of Öland, Sweden where a chieftain is referred to as the "tree of Þrúðr".Entry Öl 1 in Rundata 2.0 for Windows.

==Kennings==

The name Þrúðr could be used in kennings for chieftains as exemplified on the Karlevi Runestone. The name is also used in kennings for women. Ormr Steinþórsson, for instance, uses in his poem about a woman (4) the kenning "hrosta lúðrs gæi-Þrúðr", which, according to Anthony Faulkes, can be rendered into "keeper of the malt-box (mash-tub) or ale-vessel".Faulkes 1998, p. 297.

==Modern references==

Thrud appears as a major character in the Danish young adult fantasy novel Erik Menneskesøn by Lars-Henrik Olsen.
