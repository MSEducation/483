==Lithology==

==Distribution==

The Saskatchewan Group reaches a maximum thickness of [tpl]convert|350|m|ft|-1[/tpl]. It is present in the sub-surface throughout the Williston Basin.

==Subdivisions==

==Relationship to other units==

The Saskatchewan Group is conformably overlain by the Three Forks Group and conformably overlays the Manitoba Group carbonates.
