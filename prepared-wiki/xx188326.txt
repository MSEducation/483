The Dark Harvest Commando was a militant group which in 1981 demanded that the British government decontaminate Gruinard Island, a site which had been used for anthrax weapon testing during World War II.
The group placed a container of soil outside the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire.  A second container of soil was placed at Blackpool, a resort town where the Conservative Party was holding a conference.  The first package was found to contain Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax), while the second was uncontaminated, but of the same soil type as found on the island.
One news source claimed that a resurgent DHC (possibly affiliated with the Scottish National Liberation Army) collected spores from Gruinard Island for an attack on Prince William in December, 2001.Nick Drainey SNLA Threats and Attacks The Scotsman. 4 Mar 2002.
