The Pomo people are an indigenous people of California. The historic Pomo territory in northern California was large, bordered by the Pacific Coast to the west, extending inland to Clear Lake, and mainly between Cleone and Duncans Point. One small group, the Northeastern Pomo of the Stonyford vicinity of Colusa County, was separated from the core Pomo area by lands inhabited by Yuki and Wintuan speakers.  
The name Pomo derives from a conflation of the Pomo words [tpl]IPA-sal|pʰoːmoː|[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA-sal|pʰoʔmaʔ|[/tpl].Campbell, Lyle (1997).
