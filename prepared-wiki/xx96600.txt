</ref> They did not have further success until the launch of their own television show in 1985[tpl]Spaced ndash[/tpl]''ChuckleHounds'', broadcast by the [[BBC]]. These short programmes, which were aimed at pre-school children and contained no [[dialogue]], had the brothers dressed up in giant dog costumes. The brothers quickly moved on to their most famous show, ''[[ChuckleVision]]'', in 1987. In 1998, ''ChuckleVision'' was nominated for a [[BAFTA|Children's BAFTA Award]] in the category "Best Children's Television Series". [[Patton Brothers|Jimmy and Brian Patton]], the Chuckles' real-life brothers, make regular appearances in the show. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the four brothers appeared as a quartet on TV.
From 1996 to 1998 the Chuckle Brothers also presented a children's game show titled To Me, To You!, named after their signature catchphrase. The format, which incorporated a "treasure island" theme, involved two teams who participated in rounds competing for prizes on a shopping trolley (which was made to resemble a bamboo structure). By rolling a die, the teams had to draw the trolley to their end of the playing board; the "squares" on the path to both ends represented challenges. When this was achieved, new prizes were added to the trolley, which was reset to the middle of the board. The show ran for three series before the brothers took a break from entertainment, citing "exhaustion" as the main reason.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
In May 2008, the brothers appeared in the BBC documentary series Comedy Map of Britain. They appeared in the TV series Celebrity Coach Trip in November 2010 and won the show, lasting the whole trip.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s136/coach-trip/news/a277261/celebrity-coach-trip-lineup-revealed.html |title=Celebrity 'Coach Trip' lineup revealed |author=Alex Fletcher |date=16 September 2010 |work=Digital Spy[/tpl] In November 2011, they starred in a series of TV advertisements for the UK-based van insurance comparison website, Van Compare.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vancompare.com/chuckles/chuckle-brothers-help-make-cheap-van-insurance-a-wheeze |title=Chuckle Brothers Help Make Cheap Van Insurance a Wheeze! |date= |publisher=Van Compare |accessdate=7 November 2011[/tpl] In October 2012,  they appeared on Comedy World Cup on Channel 4. On 15 March 2013, they were featured in David Walliams' sketch for Comic Relief, in which Walliams knocked on the brothers' door with important information to give to them; Paul responded with "To me?"
