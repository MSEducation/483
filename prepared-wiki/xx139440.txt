==History==

The mall originally opened in 1986 as "Briarcliffe Mall", with the name later changing to "Colonial Mall Myrtle Beach."  It was the second mall to open in the area, with the first being the now-defunct Myrtle Square Mall.  The name was changed to Myrtle Beach Mall in 2007 after being purchased by Jones Lang LaSalle, who acquired it from Colonial Properties Trust in July 2007.  The mall's last major update was in 2004.http://www.shopmyrtlebeachmall.com/mimages/factsheets.pdf  It is one of two malls in the area, with the other being the larger, super-regional Coastal Grand Mall. The second Belk store was added in 1994, as the original Belk store required expansion but was landlocked.http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6CD1C242D304E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM[/ref]
In the early 2000s, the mall saw a large improvement, as a Bass Pro Shops was added, demolishing the Kmart which had previously anchored the mall at that end.  That is the only Bass Pro Shops location in South Carolina, and has helped keep the mall a viable retail establishment in the Grand Strand.http://www.shopmyrtlebeachmall.com/mimages/factsheets.pdf
