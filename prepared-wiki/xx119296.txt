Dirkje Johanna ("Desi") Reijers (born June 4, 1964 in Doetinchem) is a former freestyle swimmer from the Netherlands, who competed for her native country at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. 
There she won the silver medal in the 4×100 m freestyle relay, alongside Conny van Bentum, Elles Voskes, and Annemarie Verstappen, just like a year earlier at the European LC Championships in Rome, Italy. In LA she was disqualified with the 4×100 m medley relay Team.
