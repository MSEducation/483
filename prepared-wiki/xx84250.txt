Pierre "Perrie" Mans (born 14 October 1940) is a retired professional snooker player from South Africa, who first won the South African Amateur Snooker Championship in 1965, and won the event 19 times.

==Career==

Mans won the South African Amateur Snooker Championship in 1960, the only occasion in which he competed in the event.  He then turned professional and took the South African Professional Title from Freddie Van Rensberg in 1965.Everton, Clive., Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker, 1982, p74.
Mans first entered the World Snooker Championship in 1970. His first victory in the Championship came in the 1973 event when he defeated Ron Gross 9–2 before losing 16–8 to Eddie Charlton.Everton, Clive., Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker, pp89 & 91. However, in 1974 he pulled off a major surprise by defeating John Spencer 15–13 in the second round, before being soundly defeated by Rex Williams in the quarter-final 15–4.Everton Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1974, pp9 & 14. In the 1976 event he defeated Graham Miles 15–10 and Jim Meadowcroft 15–8 to reach the semi-final where he lost 20–10 to defending champion Ray Reardon.Everton, Clive., (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1976, p13.
In 1977 he was invited to take part in BBC TV's Pot Black programme which he duly won at his first attempt beating Fred Davis, Ray Reardon and Willie Thorne (over single frames) before defeating Doug Mountjoy 90 points to 21 in the final. During the final he also took the highest break prize with an effort of 59.Perrin R., (Ed.) Pot Black, BBC Books, 1984, p86.
His career peaked in 1978, when he reached the final of the world championships, losing 25–18 to Ray Reardon. During that championship he defeated reigning Champion John Spencer 13–8, before achieving wins over Graham Miles (13–7) and Fred Davis (18–16). In the final, he never led Reardon, but held him to 18–17, before Reardon pulled away.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, pp11-17. He reached number two in the world rankings as a result; at that time rankings were based purely on the world championships of the three previous seasons.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, p28.
1978 also saw Mans win the Heidelberg 100 event, defeating Silvino Francisco 9–3 in the final. This same year brought him greater company in the South African professional ranks when Silvino Francisco, Mannie Francisco, Jimmy Van Rensberg, Derek Mienie and Roy Amdor all turned professional.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, p27.
Mans' most notable tournament success was the Benson and Hedges Masters in 1979, beating Cliff Thorburn 5–4, Ray Reardon 5–3 and, in the final, Alex Higgins 8–4, winning the competition with a top break of just 48.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, March 1979, pp16-17, top prize was £3000.
In January 1980, Mans defeated Bill Werbeniuk 3–0 and John Spencer 3–2 before losing 4–2 to Alex Higgins in the final of the Padmore/Super Crystallite event held at the Gala Baths, West Bromwich.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1980, p12.
In January 1981, he pulled off the shock of the season by defeating strong favourite Steve Davis 5–3 in the first round of the 1981 Masters event, compiling a highest break of just 36. Mans would go on to lose 5–4 to Cliff Thorburn in the quarter-final.Everton, Clive (ed.) Snooker Scene, March 1981, pp3 and 7.
In the 1982 World Championship, Mans ended the interest of the last surviving Barry Hearn managed professional, Tony Meo in the first round. Meo led 3–0, but Mans overtook him to lead 9–8. This looked likely to become 9–9 when Mans trailed 54 points to 0 in the penultimate frame. However, Mans then completed a total clearance of 62 to win frame and match. He would go on to lose 13–6 in the next round to Jimmy White.Everton, Clive (Ed.), Snooker Scene, June 1982, pp17 & 20/21.
Mans' last victory at the Crucible Theatre came in 1983 when he defeated Scottish debutant Ian Black 10–3, compiling breaks of 57, 65 and 69. However, an in-form Kirk Stevens defeated Mans 13–3 in the second round, a defeat which put Mans outside the top 16 in the world rankings.Everton, Clive, Snooker Scene, June 1983, pp11, 21, 28.
Mans last played in the World Championship in 1986. He defeated Les Dodd 10–7 in the final qualifying roundEverton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene May 1986, p15. but despite holding Doug Mountjoy to 3–4, he lost his first round match 10–3.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1986, p9. Earlier in the season he had partnered Australian John Campbell to the Quarter-final of the Hofmeister World Doubles, where they lost just 5–4 to Ray Reardon and Tony Jones.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1986, p17.
Mans played in only two ranking events the following season (and the world doubles), failing to win any matches he slumped to fiftieth in the world rankings. He announced his retirement from professional snooker in July 1987 at the age of 46.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, August 1987, p15 In terms of World Ranking and performances in the World Championship, Mans remains far and away the most successful South African snooker player.
