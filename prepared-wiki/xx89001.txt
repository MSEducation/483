[[Nonsense mutation]]

CATEGORIES: Mutation

In genetics, a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and in a  truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product. It differs from a missense mutation, which is a point mutation where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. Some genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and DMD, result from nonsense mutations.

==Simple example==

     DNA: 5' - ATG ACT CAC <span style="background-color:#ccf">CGA</span> GCG CGA AGC TGA - 3'
          3' - TAC TGA GTG <span style="background-color:#ccf">GCT</span> CGC GCT TCG ACT - 5'
    mRNA: 5' - AUG ACU CAC CGA GCG CGA AGC UGA - 3'
