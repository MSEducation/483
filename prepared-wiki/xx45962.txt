[[Xnews]]

CATEGORIES: Windows-only freeware

Xnews is a freeware Usenet newsreader created by Luu Tran.  It is written in Delphi, and it is 100% GNKSA 2.0 compliant. Some of its features were inspired by the program NewsXpress.
Tran says that he designs the Xnews interface and features for himself only, reflecting his "preferences, habits, and sensibility."
Xnews does not support UTF-8 (or any other character set encoding), making it difficult or even impossible to use for reading or posting articles in languages other than English. It is possible to run Xnews with "Mime-proxy" to work around this issue.
Xnews does not natively support SSL, but SSL support can be added using Stunnel available at www.stunnel.org
Questions and discussion about Xnews have been plentiful in the Usenet group news.software.readers for quite some time.
