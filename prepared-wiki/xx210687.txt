Cube Quest is an arcade game released by Simutrek Inc. in 1983. It combines 3-D polygonal graphics with laserdisc-streamed, animated backgrounds (a technique later employed by Namco's Galaxian 3)

==Gameplay==

The objective of the game is to guide a spaceship through a cube-like network to reach the treasure star located at the opposite extreme of the player's origin. Each cube edge leads to one of 54 uniquely themed corridors where a wave of enemies must be dispatched in a tube shooter style gameplay sequence.

==Production==

Paul Allen Newell was responsible for the design and programming.http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_paul_allen_newell.html The laserdisc backgrounds were produced by Robert Abel and Associates. Ken Nordine (uncredited) voiced the introductory narration. The game was planned to be released for the Vectrex, but was cancelled when the console went off the market.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The CGI backgrounds were later used in Beyond the Mind's Eye.
