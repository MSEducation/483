==Life==

Stapledon was born in Seacombe, Wallasey, on the Wirral Peninsula near Liverpool, the only son of William Clibbert Stapledon and Emmeline Miller. The first six years of his life were spent with his parents at Port Said. He was educated at Abbotsholme School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he acquired a BA in Modern History (Second Class) in 1909 and a MA in 1913.Kinnaird, John. Olaf Stapledon. Borgo Press, 1986. ISBN 978-0-916732-55-4Oxford University Calendar, 1915, p.182 After a brief stint as a teacher at Manchester Grammar School he worked in shipping offices in Liverpool and Port Said from 1910 to 1913.
During World War I he served as a conscientious objector with the Friends' Ambulance Unit in France and Belgium from July 1915 to January 1919. On 16 July 1919 he married Agnes Zena Miller (1894–1984), an Australian cousin. They had first met in 1903, and later maintained a correspondence throughout the war. They had a daughter, Mary Sydney Stapledon (1920–), and a son, John David Stapledon (1923–). In 1920 they moved to West Kirby.
Stapledon was awarded a PhD in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1925 and used his thesis as the basis for his first published prose book, A Modern Theory of Ethics (1929). However, he soon turned to fiction in the hope of presenting his ideas to a wider public. The relative success of Last and First Men (1930) prompted him to become a full-time writer. He wrote a sequel, Last Men in London, and followed it up with many more books of both fiction and philosophy.[ref]"Olaf Stapledon". J. L. Campbell, Sr., in E. F. Bleiler, ed.

In 1940 the family built and moved into Simon's Field, in Caldy, in the Wirral. After 1945 Stapledon travelled widely on lecture tours, visiting the Netherlands, Sweden and France, and in 1948 he spoke at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław, Poland. He attended the Conference for World Peace held in New York in 1949, the only Briton to be granted a visa to do so. In 1950 he became involved with the anti-apartheid movement. After a week of lectures in Paris, he cancelled a projected trip to Yugoslavia and returned to his home in Caldy, where he died very suddenly of a heart attack.
On Stapledon's religious views, he was an agnostic.[tpl]cite book|title=Olaf Stapledon: Speaking for the Future|year=1994|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815602811|page=388|author=Robert Crossley|quote=In a lecture to the New Renascence School in London, he reiterated the central paradox of his own spiritual life: "Agnosticism, far from destroying religion, is the gateway to live religion." ...In a 1949 anthology on religion, Olaf gave simple, precise expression to a problem he had wrestled with all his life: the emotional inadequacy of atheism and the intellectual unacceptability of theism. Spirit, for him, meant a character of aspiration, not a substance attributed to souls or deities.[/tpl]
Stapledon was cremated at Landican Crematorium, and then his widow and their children scattered his ashes on the sandy cliffs overlooking the Dee Estuary, a favourite spot of his that features in more than one of his books. Stapledon Wood, on the south-east side of Caldy Hill, is named after him.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cheshirenow.co.uk/caldy_hill.html | title=Cheshire Now - Caldy Hill | accessdate=16 January 2013 [/tpl]

The "supermind" composed of many individual consciousnesses forms a recurring theme in his work. Star Maker contains the first known description of what are now called Dyson spheres. Freeman Dyson credits the novel with giving him the idea, even stating in an interview that "Stapledon sphere" would be a more appropriate name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meaningoflife.tv/transcript.php?speaker=dyson |title=MeaningofLife.tv |publisher=MeaningofLife.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] Last and First Men features early descriptions of genetic engineering and terraforming. Sirius describes a dog whose intelligence is increased to the level of a human being's.
Stapledon's fiction often presents the strivings of some intelligence that is beaten down by an indifferent universe and its inhabitants who, through no fault of their own, fail to comprehend its lofty yearnings. It is filled with protagonists who are tormented by the conflict between their "higher" and "lower" impulses. According to Gregory Benford, it also reflects his Marxist political views,“His Marxism, which remained his only irrational faith throughout his life, told him that surely the United States could never be a positive influence.” Benford, Gregory (1999), Forward to: Olaf Stapledon, Last and First Men (Series: SF Masterworks); London: Gollancz Books; pg x. (though Stapledon himself explicitly rejected Marxism)“I am not a Marxist, but I have learned much from Marxists, and I am not anti-Marxist... Marxism and Christianity spring from the same emotional experience, but each in its way misinterprets, falsifies.” quoted in Geoghegan, Vincent, Socialism and Religion: Roads to Common Wealth. as well as then-contemporary intellectual fashions (e.g. the belief in extrasensory perception).
Last and First Men, a "future history" of 18 successive species of humanity, and Star Maker, an outline history of the Universe, were highly acclaimed by figures as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell,
