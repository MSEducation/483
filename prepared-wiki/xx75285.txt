Attercliffe Chapel, also known as the Hill Top Chapel, is a Gothic chapel in Attercliffe, now a suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.  The chapel was constructed in 1629, when Attercliffe was a township separate from Sheffield, although in the same parish.
By the 1840s, the chapel was used only for funeral services.George Calvert Holland, The Vital Statistics of Sheffield, p. 225.
The chapel, surrounded by its cemetery, and lying on the south bank of the River Don, was largely rebuilt in 1909, but retains its period atmosphere. It is Grade II listed.
As of 2014, the Sheffield congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales meets at the Chapelwww.sheffieldpres.org.uk/
