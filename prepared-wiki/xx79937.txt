[tpl]nihongo|Kirby's Dream Land|星のカービィ|Hoshi no Kābī|"Kirby of the Stars"[/tpl], is a 1992 third party developed platforming video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy handheld video game console. It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America. It is both the first video game in the Kirby series and the debut of the Kirby character. Kirby's Dream Land was designed by Masahiro Sakurai, at HAL Laboratory who intended for Kirby's Dream Land to be a simple game that could be played by beginning gamers. As the inaugural Kirby title, Kirby's Dream Land created many conventions that would appear in later games in the series, including Kirby's basic moves. However, Kirby's trademark "copy" ability would not appear until Kirby's Adventure, released less than one year later. Kirby's Dream Land was re-released for the 3DS's Virtual Console service in 2011. It is also one of the games included in Kirby's Dream Collection, which was released to celebrate Kirby's 20th anniversary.

==Gameplay==

The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly.  Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.

==Development==

Kirby's Dream Land was developed by Masahiro Sakurai of HAL Laboratory. Kirby was a dummy character that the developers used until they could define a more sophisticated image. The designers grew to like Kirby so much that they decided to keep him instead of using a more advanced character. He was originally named [tpl]nihongo|Popopo|ポポポ[/tpl], and Kirby's Dream Land was titled [tpl]nihongo|Twinkle Popo|ティンクル・ポポ[/tpl]. Eventually, he was renamed Kirby and the game was renamed Kirby of the Stars. During the development of what was then referred to as Twinkle Popopo, Popopo/Kirby's colour had not been decided upon. Masahiro Sakurai wanted him to be pink, while Shigeru Miyamoto felt that he should be yellow. Eventually, Nintendo decided to make him pink. Although pink is still Kirby's main colour, later games have shown Kirby in a wide variety of colours, including yellow. When Kirby of the Stars was first released in Japan, it featured Kirby in pinkscale. However, Nintendo of America designed the North American box art and advertisements with a white Kirby based on the game's grey-scale visuals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/info/kirby101/index2.htm |title=Welcome to Kirby's Rainbow Resort! - Creation |accessdate=2007-03-06 |publisher=Gamespy.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090414061949/http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/info/kirby101/index2.htm|archivedate=April 14, 2009[/tpl]
The visuals are presented in two dimensions using pixelated sprites and environments. They are in black and white, like all Game Boy video games. The grey-scale visuals caused confusion with the North American box art, resulting in Nintendo of America presenting Kirby as being white. The music was composed by Jun Ishikawa. He was the only composer for this game,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/kirbys-dream-land |title=Kirby's Dream Land for Game Boy - MobyGames |accessdate=2007-06-24 |publisher=MobyGames.com[/tpl] and has been a regular composer in the Kirby series.

In an article detailing various Kirby series video games, IGN stated that it was a decent platformer, but also very basic compared to later titles.[tpl]cite web |title=Kirby Compared |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/913/913846p1.html |date=2008-09-26 |publisher=IGN.com |accessdate=2008-10-01[/tpl] IGN's Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harris included Kirby's Dream Land in their wishlist for a hypothetical "Virtual Console" for the Nintendo 3DS, commenting that its inclusion would be based on nostalgia rather than it feeling "new and sensational". They also added that original characters like Kirby were the stars of the Game Boy rather than established characters such as Link, Mario, Samus Aran, and Pit.[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/101/1012415p1.html |title=The DSi Virtual Console Wishlist - DS Feature at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl] They would again praise Kirby's Dream Land for being an original game in their "History of the Game Boy" article, adding that while "attitude" was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured "breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere".[tpl]cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/100/1007864p3.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Game Boy - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Retro.ign.com |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it "basic" compared to later titles in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/articles/100/1009097p1.html |title=GameSpy: Game Boy 20th Anniversary Celebration, Day 1: Then and Now - Page 1 |publisher=Ds.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl] Nintendo Power editors George and Bob shared roughly similar opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and well thought out concept, while Bob stated that it is deceptively simple looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/info/np/ |title=Nintendo Power |accessdate=2007-03-26 |publisher=Gamespy.com[/tpl] GamesRadar listed Kirby's Dream Land and its sequel as two of the titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/12-classic-game-boy-and-game-boy-color-games-we-want-on-3ds/a-20110119172340571046 |title=12 classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games we want on 3DS |publisher=GamesRadar |date=Jan 19, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-27[/tpl]
Kirby's Dream Land has since spawned dozens of sequels across more than a half-dozen video game consoles. The first direct sequel was Kirby's Adventure, which was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System console. It introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which has been used in the majority of games following it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-100-nes-games/27.html |title=27.
