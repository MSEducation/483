Terah or Térach ([tpl]Hebrew Name 2|תֶּרַח|תָּרַח|Téraḥ|Táraḥ|Téraḥ|Tāraḥ|"Ibex, wild goat", or "Wanderer; loiterer"[/tpl]) is a biblical figure in the book of Genesis,  son of Nahor, son of Serug and father of the Patriarch Abraham, all descendants of Shem's son Arpachshad.  Terah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible[tpl]Bibleref2|Genesis|11:26-27|NIV|Genesis 11: 26, 27[/tpl]; [tpl]Bibleref2|1Chronicles|1:17-27|NIV|1 Chronicles 1:17-27[/tpl] and in the New Testament.[tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|3:34-36|NIV|Luke 3:34-36[/tpl]

==Genesis narrative==

Most of what is told about Terah is recorded in [tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|11:26-28|NIV|[/tpl]. Terah's father was Nahor, son of Serug, descendants of Shem.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|v.10|NIV|v.10[/tpl] They and many of their ancestors were polytheistic.[tpl]Bibleref2|Joshua|24:2|NIV|Joshua 24:2[/tpl] Regarding his children, Terah had three sons: Abram (better known by his later name Abraham), Haran, and Nahor II.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:26|NIV|v.26[/tpl] His daughter Sarai, by a second wife, was also his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram.[tpl]Bibleref2|Genesis|11:29|NIV|Genesis 11:29[/tpl] The entire family, including grandchildren, lived in Ur of the Chaldees.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:31|NIV|v.31[/tpl] One of his grandchildren was Lot whose father Haran died before the family left Ur.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:28|NIV|v.28[/tpl] 
Terah's son Abram had an encounter with God, who directed him to take the entire family, leave Haran and move to the land of Canaan.[tpl]Bibleref2|Genesis|11:31|NIV|Genesis 11:31[/tpl] Terah coordinated the journey, intending to go to this new land, but stopped in the city of Haran,[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:31|NIV|v.31[/tpl] along the way, where he died at the age of 205.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Genesis|11:32|NIV|v.32[/tpl]

==Jewish tradition==

===When Terah begot Abram===

[tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|11:26|NIV|[/tpl] states that Terah lived 70 years, and he begot Abram, Nachor, and Haran. Rashi on Genesis (37:1) comments on the subsequent elaboration on the story of Abraham that Abraham was the gem of the chronology of Genesis 11 which the Torah wanted to focus on. In the Jewish tradition, Genesis (11:26) teaches that Terah was 70 years old when he begot Abram. The Talmud Avodah Zara 9A says that Abraham was 52 years old at year 2000 AM (Anno Mundi), which means that he was born in the year 1948 AM. Rashi ad loc explains this based on Abram being born when Terah was 70. While it is a given in Jewish tradition that Genesis (11:26) relates that Abram was born when Terach was 70, upon which the current Jewish year is based on, there is yet a question whether Abram was born first as listed, or perhaps last, and is listed first as the wisest similar to Shem, Ham, and Jafeth where Shem was the youngest but wisest. Seder Olam Chapter 2 holds that Abram was the eldest, but the Talmud Sanhedrin 69B leaves the above question open.

===Terah's occupation===

Terah was a wicked Numbers Rabbah 19:1; 19:33 idolatrous priestMidrash HaGadol, Bereishis 11:28 who manufactured idols.Eliyahu Rabbah 6Eliyahu Zuta 25 Abram, in opposition to his father’s idol shop, smashed his father’s idols and chased customers away. Terah then brought his unruly son before Nimrod, who threw him into a fiery furnace, yet Abram miraculously escaped.Bereishis Rabbah 38:13 The Zohar says that when God saved Abram from the furnace, Terah repentedZohar, Bereshit 1:77b and Rabbi Abba B. Kahana said that God assured Abram that his father Terah had a portion in the World to Come.Genesis Rabbah'' 30:4; 30:12
Rabbi Hiyya's relates this account: 

===Leader of the journey===

Terah is identified as the person who arranged and led the family to embark on a mysterious journey to Canaan. It is shrouded in mystery to Jewish scholars as to why Terah began the journey and as to why the journey ended prematurely. It is suggested that he was a man in search of a greater truth that could possibly be found in the familiarSforno, Bereishit 12:5 land of Canaan, and that it was Abram who picked up the torch to continue his father's quest, that Terah himself was unable to achieve.

===When Abram leaves Haran===

It is believed[tpl]who|date=April 2014[/tpl] that Abram left Haran before Terah died as an expression that he would not be remiss in the Mitzvah, of honoring a parent, by leaving his aging father behind.Compare Rashi, Bereishis 11:32 with Bereishis Rabbah 39:7 The significance of Terah not reaching Canaan, was a reflection of his character, a man who was unable to go “all the way”. Though on a journey in the right direction, Terah fell short at arriving to the divine destination — in contrast to Abram, who did follow through and achieved the divine goal, and was not bound by his father’s idolatrous past. Abram's following God’s command to leave his father, thus absolved him from the Mitzvah of honoring parents, and as Abraham, he would go on to create a new lineage distinct from his ancestors.(Haggadah shel Pesach) - Levene, Osher C. People of the Book, (ISBN 1568714467, ISBN 978-1-56871-446-2), 2004, p. 79-80

==Islamic tradition==

In some Islam sects, Abraham's father is believed to have been an ignorant man,Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir, Abraham and his father who refused to listen to the constant advice of his wise son. In fact, the earliest story involving Abraham in the Qur'an is his discussion with his father. The name given for this man in the Qur'an ([tpl]cite quran|6|74|style=ref|b=n[/tpl]) is Āzar ([tpl]lang-ar|آزر[/tpl]), though Arab genealogists related the name of Abraham's father as Tāraḥ ([tpl]lang-ar|تارح[/tpl]). Even though the name is different in Islamic tradition to that in the Hebrew Bible, there is no doubt that the same figure is spoken of in both texts.[tpl]cn|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Abraham's advice===

As a father, Azar required his son's most sincere advice. Abraham, after receiving his first revelations from God, invited his father to the way of Islam. Abraham explained to him the faults in idolatry,[tpl]Cite quran|19|44|s=ns[/tpl] and why he was wrong to worship objects which could neither hear nor see.[tpl]Cite quran|19|42|s=ns[/tpl] From the Quran 74/6 "And O Muhammad, when Abraham said to his father Azar: Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error." 
Abraham told his father that he had indeed received revelations from God, knowledge which his father did not possess,[tpl]Cite quran|19|43|s=ns[/tpl] and told him that belief in God would grant him immense rewards in both this life and the hereafter. Abraham concluded his preaching by warning Azar of the grave punishment he would face if he did not mend his ways.[tpl]Cite quran|19|45|s=ns[/tpl] When Abraham offered his father the guidance and advice of God, he rejected it, and threatened to stone him to death.[tpl]Cite quran|19|46|s=ns[/tpl] Abraham prayed for his father[tpl]Cite quran|19|47|s=ns[/tpl] to be forgiven by God, and although he continued to seek forgiveness, it was only because of a promise that he had made earlier to him. When it became clear that Azar's unrelenting hatred towards pure monotheism would never be fought, Abraham dissociated himself from him.[tpl]Cite quran|9|114|s=ns[/tpl]

===Wreckage of the idols===

The Qur'an states that the people of Abraham were idolaters. When Abraham had become older, he decided to finally teach his community a lesson. He said to himself that he had a plan for their idols, whilst they would be gone away.[tpl]Cite quran|21|57|s=ns[/tpl] The Qur'an goes onto narrate that Abraham subsequently broke the idols, all except the largest, which he kept intact.[tpl]Cite quran|21|58|s=ns[/tpl] When the people returned, they began questioning each other over the wreckage, until some of the people remembered that the youth, Abraham, had spoken of the idols earlier.[tpl]Cite quran|21|60|s=ns[/tpl] When Abraham arrived, the people immediately began to question him, asking him whether he had anything to do with the broken idols. Abraham then, in a clever taunt, asked the people as to why they do not ask the largest of the idols, which, they believed, could indeed hear and speak.[tpl]Cite quran|21|63|s=ns[/tpl] The people of Abraham were then confounded with shame, and admitted that the idols were incapable of anything.[tpl]Cite quran|21|65|s=ns[/tpl]

===Abraham is thrown into the fire===

After the incident of the idol wreckage, the people of Abraham, while having admitted their fault, are said to have ignored Abraham's warning and instead retaliated by throwing him into a fire and exclaiming "protect your gods".[tpl]Cite quran|21|68|s=ns[/tpl] Although the natural nature of fire is one of intense heat, God commanded the flame to be cool and peaceful for Abraham.[tpl]Cite quran|21|69|s=ns[/tpl] Abraham, as a result, remained unhurt both physically and spiritually, having survived the fire of persecution. The people continued to taunt and persecute him, but to no avail, as the Qur'an says that it was they "that lost most".[tpl]Cite quran|21|70|s=ns[/tpl]

==Christian tradition==

The Christian views of the time of Terah come from a passage in the New Testament at [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|7:2-4|NIV[/tpl] where Stephen said some things that contrast with Jewish Rabbinical views. He said that God appeared to Abraham in Mesopotamia, and directed him to leave the Chaldeans — whereas most Rabbinical commentators see Terah as being the one who directed the family to leave Ur Kasdim from [tpl]bibleref2|Genesis|11:31|NLT[/tpl]: “Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram’s wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran’s child) and left Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan.”
