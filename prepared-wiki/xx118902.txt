The Cuban Kite (Chondrohierax wilsonii) is a  bird of prey in the family Accipitridae which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles and harriers. It is endemic to Cuba.
This species is classified as critically endangered by BirdLife International. The current population is estimated 50 to 249 mature birds. After a last confirmed sighting in 2001 and an unconfirmed sighting in 2004 Cuban ornithologist Nils Navarro Pacheco took a photograph of one individual in 2009.
The Clements Checklist and the AOU consider it as subspecies of the Hook-billed Kite. A molecular phylogenetics analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggests that it warrants species status having diverged from the mainland lineage approximately 400,000 to 1.5 million years ago.
