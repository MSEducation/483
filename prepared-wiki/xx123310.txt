Football DataCo is a British company in the football (soccer) industry that grants licences to third parties (such as newspapers) allowing them to reproduce certain intellectual property (such as fixture lists and statistics) owned by the UK's four professional football leagues: the Premier League, The Football League, the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Football League.
Many of Football DataCo's activities are contracted out to the Press Association (PA). Thus, PA Sport handles applications for and distributes fixture lists and produces the Actim statistics service on behalf of Football DataCo.
Football DataCo is wholly owned by Premier League and The Football League.

==Fees==

Football DataCo charges a standard fee for the reproduction of fixture lists, which currently stands at: £266 plus VAT to print the fixtures of one English club.
Newspapers printing the fixtures of all clubs are be charged around £3,931 plus VAT by DataCo for a date ordered listing.
The money accrued by Football DataCo for the rights to this data is distributed to league clubs on an egalitarian basis, approximately:

==Controversy==

The company has been racked by controversy in the UK media, after a 2004 European Court of Justice ruling that the Premier League and Football League cannot use the European Database Directive to demand payment from media and pools companies for the publication of fixture lists. Football DataCo refute the ruling, arguing that a legal precedent was set in the UK back in 1959, when the Football League won a landmark copyright victory against Littlewoods, claiming income from the pools company for their use of the fixtures list.
Staunch opponents of Football DataCo argue that the ruling is long out of date, and needs to be brought more inline with the advances in information collection and delivery that we are seeing with the World Wide Web.
Small, independently owned football fan sites have been badly hit by Football DataCo, who even charge non-profit making enterprises the standard fee for use of single club fixture data unless adopted by a club as a "Nominated Fanzine" in which case the charge is £1.00 plus VAT.  This has meant that many fanzines have been threatened with removal of the fixtures by Football DataCo.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/dec/21/newmedia.comment | title = Fanzine fight for the right to print fixtures | accessdate =16 October 2008 | date = 21 December 2005 | publisher = The Guardian | location=London | first=David | last=Conn[/tpl]
The company has also challenged many not-for-profit websites over their use of football club badges on their websites.
