[[Stovner]]

CATEGORIES: Boroughs of Oslo

Stovner is a district located to the far north east of the city of Oslo, Norway. Historically, Stovner was the name of a farm in the municipal borough "Østre Aker". Østre Aker merged with Oslo in 1948, both instigated and followed by a massive expansion of the city settlement. Today's Stovner borough is constructed atop the home fields of the Stovner farm, the first record of which dates back to the 14th century, as well as on the fields of several other farms that were situated in the area covered by the borough. The bulk of the modern high-rise structures were built by Selvaag and completed in the first half of the 1970s, together with several schools, a subway line into central Oslo, and an administrative center for the district. The last three stations of Grorudbanen — Rommen, Stovner and Vestli — are in the Stovner borough.
