Perry Scott Walker (October 30, 1969 in Mesa, Arizona – January 31, 2004 in Apache Junction, Arizona) was a professional boxer.
Walker's nickname was "The Pink Cat", and he gained some attention in the 1990s boxing scene for wearing pink boxing trunks and slicked-back hair, the latter a tribute to his idol, James Dean. He is best known for winning a ten round decision over hall-of-fame champion Alexis Argüello, ending Arguello's ill-conceived bid at a comeback in 1995. Walker fought another hall-of-famer Julio César Chávez in 1996 in a nationally televised bought, losing in a second-round knockout. Later in his career, Walker won the WBC Continental Americas light welterweight title over Francisco Cuesta on July 17, 1995. He retired with a record of 25–7–1 (13 KO's).
Walker was found dead in his home of unspecified causes. He is a member of the Arizona Boxing Hall of Fame.
