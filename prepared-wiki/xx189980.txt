==History==

Felts Mills was sited on one of several natural falls on the Black River and first settled with the construction of a grist mill in about 1800.http://jefferson.nygenweb.net/rutdp.htm An improved dam was erected in 1821, and a stone mill in the following year.  In 1824, John Felt constructed the large sawmills that gave the town its name. In 1889, the Taggart Paper Company built a large paper mill on an island across the river, ruins of which are still visible today.Rafter, G.
