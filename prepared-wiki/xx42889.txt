Before vaccines, an average of 178,171 cases were reported in the U.S., with peaks reported every two to five years; more than 93% of reported cases occurred in children under 10 years of age. The actual incidence was likely much higher. After vaccinations were introduced in the 1940s, incidence fell dramatically to less than 1,000 by 1976. Incidence rates have increased since 1980. In 2012, rates in the United States reached a high of 41,880 people; this is the highest it has been since 1955 when numbers reached 62,786.http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html

The study found the number of exemption varies widely among communities but tends to be highly clustered, in some schools more than ¾ of parents filed for exemptions not to vaccinate their children.  The data suggest vaccine refusal based on nonmedical reason and personal belief may have been one of several factors, in addition to less long lasting effect of the current vaccine and most vaccinated adults and older children have not received a booster shot, contributed to the California outbreak in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/25/226147147/vaccine-refusals-fueled-californias-whooping-cough-epidemic|title=Vaccine Refusuals Fueled California’s Whooping Cough Epidemic|author=Shute, Nancy|publisher=NPR|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|displayauthors=8|last1=Atwell|first1=Jessica|last2=Van Otterloo|first2=Josh|last3=Zipprich|first3=Jennifer|last4=Winter|first4=Kathleen|last5=Harriman|first5=Kathleen|last6=Salmon|first6=Daniel|last7=Halsey|first7=Neal|last8=Omer|first8=Saad|title=Nonmedical Vaccine Exemptions and Pertussis in California, 2010|journal=Pediatrics|volume=132|issue=4|pages=624–630|year=2013|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|doi=10.1542/peds.2013-0878|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/09/24/peds.2013-0878.full.pdf+html[/tpl]

==History==

B. pertussis was isolated in pure culture in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who are also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell pertussis vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was grown in pure culture in 1906. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925, the Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell pertussis vaccine on a wide scale.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baker JP, Katz SL |title=Childhood vaccine development: an overview |journal=Pediatr. Res. |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=347–56 |year=2004 |pmid=14630981 |doi=10.1203/01.PDR.0000106317.36875.6A[/tpl]
He used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea. In 1942, the American scientist Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component of the vaccine, the Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular pertussis vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis into the culture medium. Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan since 1981.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sato Y, Kimura M, Fukumi H |title=Development of a pertussis component vaccine in Japan |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8369 |pages=122–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6140441 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)90061-8[/tpl] Later versions of the acellular pertussis vaccine used in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.
The complete B. pertussis genome of 4,086,186 base pairs was sequenced in 2004.[tpl]cite journal | author = Parkhill J. et al. | year = 2003 | title = Comparative analysisof the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 32–40 [/tpl]

==Society and culture==

Much of the controversy surrounding the DPT vaccine in the 1970s and 1980s related to the question of whether the whole-cell pertussis component caused permanent brain injury in rare cases, called pertussis vaccine encephalopathy. Despite this possibility, doctors recommended the vaccine due to the overwhelming public health benefit, because the claimed rate was very low (one case per 310,000 immunizations, or about 50 cases out of the 15 million immunizations each year in the United States), and the risk of death from the disease was high (pertussis killed thousands of Americans each year before the vaccine was introduced).
No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between administration of the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile epilepsy. Eventually evidence against the hypothesized existence of pertussis vaccine encephalopathy mounted to the point that in 1990, the Journal of American Medical Association called it a "myth" and "nonsense".
However, before that point, criticism of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized anecdotal reports of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to anti-DPT movements in the 1970s.[tpl]cite journal |author=Geier D, Geier M |title=The true story of pertussis vaccination: a sordid legacy? |journal=Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=249–84 |year=2002 |pmid=12211972 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/57.3.249[/tpl] The negative publicity and fear-mongering caused the immunization rate to fall in several countries, including the UK, Sweden, and Japan. In many cases, a dramatic increase in the incidence of pertussis followed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gangarosa EJ, Galazka AM, Wolfe CR, Phillips LM, Gangarosa RE, Miller E, Chen RT |title=Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9099 |pages=356–61 |year=1998 |pmid=9652634 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)04334-1[/tpl]
Unscientific claims about the vaccine pushed suppliers of the vaccines out of the market. In the United States, low profit margins and an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s.
In 1982, the television documentary "DPT: Vaccine Roulette" depicted the lives of children whose severe disabilities were inaccurately blamed on the DPT vaccine by reporter Lea Thompson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-22/news/29571400_1_anti-vaccine-activists-dtp-vaccine-children-vaccinated|title=At last: Ignorance inoculation|author=Rachel K. Sobel|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=22 May 2011[/tpl] The negative publicity generated by the documentary led to a tremendous increase in the number of lawsuits filed against vaccine manufacturers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Evans G |title=Update on vaccine liability in the United States: presentation at the National Vaccine Program Office Workshop on strengthening the supply of routinely recommended vaccines in the United States, 12 February 2002 |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=42 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S130–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16447135 |doi=10.1086/499592[/tpl] By 1985, manufacturers of vaccines had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of the DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading to shortages around the country. Only one manufacturer of the DPT vaccine remained in the U.S. by the end of 1985. To avert a vaccine crisis, Congress in 1986 passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smith MH |title=National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act |journal=Pediatrics |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=264–9 |year=1988 |pmid=3399300[/tpl] The majority of claims that have been filed through the NCVIA have been related to injuries allegedly caused by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.
The concerns about side effects led Yuji Sato to introduce an even safer acellular version of the pertussis vaccine for Japan in 1981. The acellular pertussis vaccine was approved in the United States in 1992 for use in the combination DTaP vaccine. Research has shown that the acellular vaccine has a rate of adverse events similar to that of a Td vaccine (a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine containing no pertussis vaccine).[tpl]cite journal |author=Pichichero ME, Rennels MB, Edwards KM, et al. |title=Combined tetanus, diphtheria, and 5-component pertussis vaccine for use in adolescents and adults |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=24 |pages=3003–11 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15933223 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.24.3003 [/tpl]
