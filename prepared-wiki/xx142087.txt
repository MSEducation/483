The Jewang Un'gi, or Songs of Emperors and Kings, is a historical poem composed by Yi Seung-hyu (李承休) in 1287, in the late Goryeo period.  Comprising two volumes, it depicts the history of Korea from Dangun to King Chungnyeol, and is the second-oldest text recounting the legend of Dangun.http://books.google.com/books?id=AVw_C0SZkZ4C&pg=PA56  The title is sometimes alternatively translated Rhymed Chronicles of Emperors and Kings. 
Yi composed the text after retiring from government service to the Cheoneunsa monastery on Duta-san mountain in Samcheok, in present-day Gangwon province.http://books.google.com/books?id=mJwzAQAAIAAJ
The first edition of the work was printed in 1295-1296 in Jinju, while Yi was still alive.  Both extant texts, however, are from a revised woodcut edition printed in 1360 in Gyeongju.  On April 1, 1965, the version kept in Uiwang city was designated South Korean National Treasure No. 418.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=12,04180000,31&queryText=*&requery=0|title=Treasure 418|author=Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea|accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl]  Another version, held at the Samseong Museum of Publishing in Seoul, was designated National Treasure No. 1091 in 1991.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=12,10910000,11&queryText=*&requery=0&mc=EN_03_02|title=Treasure 1091|author=Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea|accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl]
