</ref> [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."<ref>[tpl]cite book | title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life | first1=Rosen | last1=Robert |date=November 1991 | isbn=978-0-231-07565-7 [/tpl]</ref>
A systems view of life treats environmental fluxes and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm |title=The Ecosystemic Life Hypothesis |accessdate=2009-08-28 |first=Daniel A. Fiscus |date=April 2002 |publisher=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America[/tpl] and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As Harold J. Morowitz (1992) explains it, life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species.[tpl]cite book | last1=Morowitz | first1=Harold J. | year=1992 | title=Beginnings of cellular life: metabolism recapitulates biogenesis | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-300-05483-1 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC [/tpl] He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly biochemical or physical one. Robert Ulanowicz (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.[tpl]cite book | first1=Robert W. | last1=Ulanowicz | first2=Robert E. | last2=Ulanowicz | title=A third window: natural life beyond Newton and Darwin | publisher=Templeton Foundation Press | year=2009 | isbn=1-59947-154-X | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ [/tpl]
Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of dynamic systems theory.Baianu, I. C.: 2006, "Robert Rosen's Work and Complex Systems Biology", Axiomathes 16(1-2):25-34. The latter is often called also systems biology and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology, called relational biology,* Rosen, R.: 1958a, "A Relational Theory of Biological Systems". Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics 20: 245-260.* Rosen, R.: 1958b, "The Representation of Biological Systems from the Standpoint of the Theory of Categories.", Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics 20: 317-341. is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a category theory of biological relations, and also an algebraic topology of the functional organization of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex networks of metabolic, genetic, epigenetic processes and signaling pathways.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obey a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE, and Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian D ynamic. The Quarterly Review of Biology 58(2): 185-207. Published by: The University of Chicago PressMichod RE. (1999) Darwinian Dynamics: Evolutionary Transitions in Fitness and Individuality.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey  ISBN 0691050112, 9780691050119  The Darwinian dynamic was formulated by first considering how macroscopic order is generated in a simple non-biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short, replicating RNA molecules.  The underlying order generating process for both types of system was concluded to be basically similar.[tpl]cite journal | title = The Darwinian Dynamic | last = Vol 58, No. 2 | first = Harris Bernstein, Henry C.

==Origin==

Evidence suggests that life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years,[tpl]cite book | first1=Clare | last1=Milsom | first2=Sue | last2=Rigby | title=Fossils at a Glance | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=2009 | isbn=1405193360 | page=134 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OdrCdxr7QdgC&pg=PA134 [/tpl] with the oldest physical traces of life dating back 3.7 billion years. In a National Institutes of Health study, the authors hypothesize that if biological complexity increased exponentially during evolution, life in the universe may have begun nearly 10 billion years ago[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sharov |first1=Alexei A. |last2=Gordon| first2=Richard |title=Life Before Earth| url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.3381.pdf |date=28 March 2013 |journal=arXiv|arxiv=1304.3381v1 |accessdate=16 April 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=12 June 2006 |issue=  |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17|pmc=1526419[/tpl] - billions of years before the Earth existed, suggesting that Earth was seeded by panspermia or directed panspermia. All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their common descent; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a universal common ancestor, from simple organic molecules via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism. Models have been divided into "genes-first" and "metabolism-first" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Coveney | first1=Peter V. | first2=Philip W. | last2=Fowler | title=Modelling biological complexity: a physical scientist's perspective | journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface | year=2005 | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=267–280 | doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0045 [/tpl]
There is no current scientific consensus as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the following observations:
Living organisms synthesize proteins, which are polymers of amino acids using instructions encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Protein synthesis entails intermediary ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins;[tpl]cite book | last1=Senapathy | first1=Periannan | authorlink=Periannan Senapathy | title=Independent birth of organisms | location=Madison, Wisconsin | publisher=Genome Press | year=1994 | isbn=0964130408 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ [/tpl] the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.[tpl]cite book | last1=Eigen | first1=Manfred | first2=Ruthild | last2=Winkler | title=Steps towards life: a perspective on evolution (German edition, 1987) | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1992 | page=31 | isbn=019854751X | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Steps_towards_life.html?id=R7QTAQAAIAAJ [/tpl]
However, since genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the chicken or the egg. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Barazesh | first1=Solmaz | title=How RNA Got Started: Scientists Look for the Origins of Life | journal=Science News | date=May 13, 2009 | url=http://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/05/13/how-rna-got-started-scientists-examine-the-origins-of-life | accessdate=2012-05-25 [/tpl]
Therefore, a possibility, first suggested by Francis Crick,[tpl]cite book | last1=Watson | first1=James D. | title=Prologue: early speculations and facts about RNA templates | pages=xv–xxiii | work=The RNA World | editor1-first=R. F. | editor1-last=Gesteland | editor2-first=J. F. | editor2-last=Atkins | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York | year=1993 [/tpl] is that the first life was based on RNA, which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the catalytic properties of some proteins. This is called the RNA world hypothesis, and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them. The catalytic properties of RNA had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first proposed,[tpl]cite journal | first1=Walter | last1=Gilbert | title=Origin of life: The RNA world | journal=Nature | volume=319 | issue=618 | date=February 20, 1986 | doi=10.1038/319618a0 |bibcode = 1986Natur.319..618G | pages=618 [/tpl] but they were confirmed by Thomas Cech in 1986.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Cech | first1=Thomas R. | title=A model for the RNA-catalyzed replication of RNA | pages=4360–4363 | volume=83 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA | year=1986 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/83/12/4360.abstract | accessdate=2012-05-25 | issue=12 | bibcode=1986PNAS...83.4360C | doi=10.1073/pnas.83.12.4360[/tpl]
One issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA.Cech, T.R. (2011). The RNA Worlds in Context. Source: Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0215.

Geological findings in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance in the ocean before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pasek|first=Matthew A.|coauthors=et at.|title=Evidence for reactive reduced phosphorus species in the early Archean ocean|journal=PNAS|date=18 June 2013|volume=110|issue=25|pages=10089–10094|doi=10.1073/pnas.1303904110|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10089|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] It is hypothesized that Schreibersite-containing meteorites from the Late Heavy Bombardment could have provided early reduced phosphorus, which could react with prebiotic organic molecules to form phosphorylated biomolecules, like RNA.

As a consequence of these microbial activities, the physical-chemical environment on Earth has been changing on a geologic time scale, thereby affecting the path of evolution of subsequent life. For example, the release of molecular oxygen by cyanobacteria as a by-product of photosynthesis induced global changes in the Earth's environment. Since oxygen was toxic to most life on Earth at the time, this posed novel evolutionary challenges, and ultimately resulted in the formation of our planet's major animal and plant species. This interplay between organisms and their environment is an inherent feature of living systems.
All life forms require certain core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning.  These include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental macronutrients for all organisms[tpl]cite news | first1=Robert Lee | last1=Hotz | title=New link in chain of life | work=Wall Street Journal | date=December 3, 2010 | publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342.html?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode | quote="Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."

The inert components of an ecosystem are the physical and chemical factors necessary for life — energy (sunlight or chemical energy), water, temperature, atmosphere, gravity, nutrients, and ultraviolet solar radiation protection.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cmapsnasacmex.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1025200161109_2045745605_1714&partName=htmltext |title=Essential requirements for life |accessdate=2009-07-14 |publisher=CMEX-NASA[/tpl] In most ecosystems, the conditions vary during the day and from one season to the next.

Beyond these zones are the "zones of intolerance", where survival and reproduction of that organism is unlikely or impossible. Organisms that have a wide range of tolerance are more widely distributed than organisms with a narrow range of tolerance.
To survive, selected microorganisms can assume forms that enable them to withstand freezing, complete desiccation, starvation, high levels of radiation exposure, and other physical or chemical challenges. These microorganisms may survive exposure to such conditions for weeks, months, years, or even centuries. Extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life is commonly found. They excel at exploiting uncommon sources of energy. While all organisms are composed of nearly identical molecules, evolution has enabled such microbes to cope with this wide range of physical and chemical conditions.

There are two primary types of cells. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, although they have circular DNA and ribosomes. Bacteria and Archaea are two domains of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the eukaryotes, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuoles. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material.

Cells reproduce through a process of cell division in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of fission in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In eukaryotes, a more complex process of mitosis is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for mutations), and both are capable of further division following an interphase period.[tpl]cite book | first1=Joseph | last1=Panno | title=The Cell | series=Facts on File science library | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=0816067368 | pages=60–70 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&pg=PA60 [/tpl]
Multicellular organisms may have first evolved through the formation of colonies of like cells. These cells can form group organisms through cell adhesion. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specialties, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed clonally or from a single germ cell that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells.
Cells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. Cell signaling coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling, or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the endocrine system. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated nervous system.[tpl]cite book | display-authors=1 | first1=Bruce | last1=Alberts | first2=Alexander | last2=Johnson | first3=Julian | last3=Lewis | first4=Martin | last4=Raff | first5=Keith | last5=Roberts | first6=Peter | last6=Walter | chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | location=New York | publisher=Garland Science | year=2002 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ | accessdate=2012-06-12 | isbn=0-8153-3218-1 [/tpl]

==Classification==

The first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of vertebrates and invertebrates respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds (mammals), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and amphibians), birds, fishes and whales. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: cephalopods, crustaceans, insects (which included the spiders, scorpions, and centipedes, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most molluscs and echinoderms) and "zoophytes." Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.[tpl]Cite news |title=Aristotle -biography |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]
The exploration of the American continent revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, Carolus Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title= Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0962-8436&volume=359&issue=1444&spage=611[/tpl] Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning. By consistently using this system, Linnaeus separated nomenclature from taxonomy.
The fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon Vermes in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. Copeland classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Copeland, H.F. |year=1938 |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=383 |doi=10.1086/394568 |jstor=2808554[/tpl] The problem was eventually solved by Whittaker, when he gave them their own kingdom in his five-kingdom system.

As new discoveries enabled detailed study of cells and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of cell biology and microbiology were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in protozoa as animals and protophyta/thallophyta as plants, but were united by Haeckel in the kingdom Protista; later, the prokaryotes were split off in the kingdom Monera, which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the Archaea. This led to the six-kingdom system and eventually to the current three-domain system, which is based on evolutionary relationships. However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, et al. |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

As microbiology, molecular biology and virology developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and viroids. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into "species" based on their biology and genetics, but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Van Regenmortel MH |title=Virus species and virus identification: past and current controversies |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16713373 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2006.04.002[/tpl]
