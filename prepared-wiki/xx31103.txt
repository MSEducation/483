</ref> Samaritans offers support through over 20,600 trained volunteers (2011) and is entirely dependent on voluntary support. The name was not originally chosen by Chad Varah: it was part of a headline to an article in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper on 7 December 1953 about Varah's work.<ref>[http://www.samaritans.org/images/sams-mirrorarticle.gif Samaritans.org]</ref>
In 2004, Samaritans announced that volunteer numbers had reached a thirty-year low, and launched a campaign to recruit more young people (specifically targeted at ages 18â€“24) to become volunteers. The campaign was fronted by Phil Selway, drummer with the band Radiohead, himself a Samaritans volunteer.

===Chad Varah breaks with Samaritans===

In 2004, Varah announced that he had become disillusioned with the Samaritans. He said, "It's no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service, it was to be emotional support".Anthony J. Jordan "The Good Samaritans, Memoir of a Biographer". pp.7-20. Westport Books ISBN 978-0-9524447-5-6.
Samaritans' vision is that fewer people die by suicide.[ref]

==Samaritans' work==

The core of Samaritans' work is a telephone helpline, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Samaritans was the first 24 hour telephone helpline to be set up in the UK. In addition, the organisation offers a drop-in service for face-to-face discussion, undertakes outreach at festivals and other outdoor events, trains prisoners as "Listeners" to provide support within prisons, and undertakes research into suicide and emotional health issues.
Since 1994, Samaritans has also offered confidential email support. Initially operating from one branch, the service is now provided by 198 branches and co-ordinated from the organisation's head office. In 2011 Samaritans received over 206,000 emails, including many from outside the UK, and aims to answer each one within 24 hours.
In 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value,[tpl]cite web | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/116-euro-numbers | title=Harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value (116XXX numbers) | author=Ofcom | publisher=Office of Communications | date=2010-07-27 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100727000915/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/116-euro-numbers | archivedate=2010-07-27 | deadurl=no[/tpl] allocating 116 123 to Samaritans. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines.
In 2011 Samaritans received 5,020,006 calls for help, by phone, email, text, letter, minicom, Typetalk, face-to-face at a branch, through their work in prisons, and at local and national festivals and other events.Samaritans Facts and Figures
Samaritans stresses that the service it provides is not counselling, and it will not give advice. Although Samaritans volunteers are trained in many of the same techniques as professional counsellors, they neither judge nor tell people what to do. By listening and asking questions, the Samaritans volunteers help people explore their feelings and work out their own way forward. 
Samaritans do not denounce suicide, and it is not necessary to be suicidal to contact Samaritans. In 2011, nearly 80% of the people calling Samaritans did not express suicidal feelings. Samaritans believes that offering people the opportunity to be listened to in confidence, and accepted without prejudice, can alleviate despair and make emotional health a mainstream issue.

==Confidentiality==

Samaritans have a strict code of caller confidentiality, even after the death of a caller. Unless the caller gives consent to pass on information, confidentiality will be broken only in rare circumstances, such as when Samaritans receives bomb or terrorism warnings, to call an ambulance because a caller appears to be incapable of making rational decisions for him or herself, or when the caller is threatening volunteers or deliberately preventing the service being delivered to other callers.Samaritans Caller Privacy and Data Protection Statement

==International reach==

Through its email service, Samaritans' work has extended well beyond the UK and Ireland, as messages are received from all around the world.
Samaritans' international reach is through Befrienders Worldwide, an organisation of over 400 centres in 38 countries offering similar activities. Samaritans took on and renamed the Befrienders International network in 2003, a year after it collapsed. Some members of Befrienders Worldwide also use the name Samaritans; this includes centres in the USA, India, Hong Kong, Serbia and Zimbabwe, among others.
The Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) combines Samaritans (through Befrienders Worldwide) with the other 2 largest international services (IFOTES & Lifeline), and plans a combined international network of helplines. In their roles as emotional support service networks, they have all agreed to develop a more effective and robust international interface.
