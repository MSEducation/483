[[Crew]]

CATEGORIES: Social groups

A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization. A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title Crewman.
Crew also refers to the sport of rowing, where teams row competitively in racing shells.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 [/tpl]
Crew is used colloquially to refer to a small, tight-knit group of friends or associates engaged in criminal activity.  Also used in reference to the traditional "unit" of criminals under the supervision of a caporegime in the American Mafia.  However, the term is not specific to (Mafia-affiliated) organized crime. Crew can also refer simply to a group of friends, unrelated to crime or violence.
