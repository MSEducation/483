[[Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems in number theory, Algebraic number theory, Additive number theory

In additive number theory, the Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem, named after Thoralf Skolem, Kurt Mahler, and Christer Lech, states that the indices of the null elements of a linear recurrence sequence are the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions.  The proofs of this result use p-adic analysis.
