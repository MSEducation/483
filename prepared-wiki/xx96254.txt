The Nunc dimittisNunc dimittis servum tuum: now lettest thou thy servant depart; Minnie Gresham Machen, "The Bible in Browning" The Macmillan Company, 1903 [tpl]IPA|/nʊŋk dɪˈmɪtɪs/[/tpl] (also Song of Simeon or Canticle of Simeon) is a canticle from a text in the second chapter of Luke  named after its first words in Latin, meaning 'Now you dismiss...'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11159a.htm|title=Nunc Dimittis|work=Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl] ([tpl]bibleref|Luke|2:29–32|4[/tpl]), often used as the final song in a religious service.
According to the narrative in  Luke, Simeon was a devout Jew who had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour.  When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of consecration of the firstborn son (not the circumcision, but rather after the time of Mary's purification: at least 40 days after the birth), Simeon was there, and he took Jesus into his arms and uttered words rendered variously as follows.

==Liturgy and musical settings==

The Nunc Dimittis is the traditional 'Gospel Canticle' of Night Prayer (Compline), just as Benedictus and Magnificat are the traditional Gospel Canticles of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer respectively. Hence the Nunc Dimittis is found in the liturgical night office of many western denominations, including Evening Prayer (or Evensong) in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer of 1662, Compline (A Late Evening Service) in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer of 1928, and the Night Prayer service in the Anglican Common Worship, as well as both the Roman Catholic and Lutheran service of Compline. In eastern tradition the canticle is found in Eastern Orthodox Vespers. One of the most well-known settings in England is a plainchant theme of Thomas Tallis.
Among Lutheran churches, the Nunc Dimittis may be sung following the reception of the Eucharist.Lutheran Service Book, Concordia Publishing House, 2005.
Many composers have set the text to music, usually coupled in the Anglican church with the Magnificat, as both the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis are sung (or said) during the Anglican service of Evening Prayer according to the Book of Common Prayer, 1662, in which the older offices of Vespers (Evening Prayer) and Compline (Night Prayer) were deliberately merged into one service, with both Gospel Canticles employed. In Common Worship, it is listed among "Canticles for Use at Funeral and Memorial Services"The Church of England - Common Worship - Canticles for Use at Funeral and Memorial Services and a setting of it by Charles Villiers Stanford was sung at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher as the recessional.[tpl]cite news|title=Margaret Thatcher: the funeral Order of Service|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9992142/Margaret-Thatcher-the-funeral-Order-of-Service.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=17 April 2013[/tpl]
