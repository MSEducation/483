[[Logistic map]]

CATEGORIES: Chaotic maps

The logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The map was popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May,May, Robert M. 1976. "Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics." Nature 261(5560):459-467. in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation first created by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst."[tpl]MathWorld | urlname=LogisticEquation | title= Logistic Equation[/tpl]
Mathematically, the logistic map is written
where:
This nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects.
However, as a demographic model the logistic map has the pathological problem that some initial conditions and parameter values lead to negative population sizes.  This problem does not appear in the older Ricker model, which also exhibits chaotic dynamics.

==Behavior dependent on r==

By varying the parameter r, the following behavior is observed:
