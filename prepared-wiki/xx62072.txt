Strawberries, originally titled Strawberries for Pigs, is the fifth studio album by English punk rock band The Damned. It was released in October 1982 by record label Bronze.

==Background==

Captain Sensible takes prominent backing vocals several times, as well as lead vocals on "Life Goes On" and "Don't Bother Me".
Paul Gray decided to call it quits in February 1983, later that year replacing Billy Sheehan in UFO, and Bryn Merrick joined the band to replace Gray for their March 1983 club tour.
Sensible left The Damned after the Nun Tour (named after David Vanian's nun-dressed backup singers on the tour) for Strawberries and played a "last gig" (until The Damned's 10th Anniversary gig at Finsbury Park in 1986) at Brockwell Park on 4 August 1984. Roman Jugg took over Sensible's role on guitar and keyboards. Bronze Records, their label at the time, collapsed and released the band from their contract. Roman Jugg entered the band at this time, and marked the start of the Jugg era, which also lead to further experiments with the band's sound, including loops and sampling.
Describing the album, Trouser Press wrote "Eclectic and inconsistent but well-produced ... and boasting some fine tunes ..., Strawberries shows Sensible's increasing pop prominence ... and Vanian's willingness to explore a stylistic pallette with no debt to punk."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=damned |title=trouserpress.com :: Damned |last1=Robbins |first1=Ira |last2=Pattyn |first2=Jay |work=trouserpress.com |accessdate=26 May 2013[/tpl]

==Track listing==

==Release==

Strawberries was released in October 1982.
Limited editions included a strawberry-scented lyric insert.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic was favourable: "Recuperating a bit from The Black Albums uneven impact while still aiming to try whatever they want in studio, ... is by turns sprightly and cheerful, dark and dramatic, energetic and snarling, or all that and more at once, ... and defies usual expectations to be yet another good rock album from the band."

==Reissue==

On 7 January 2005, Castle Records re-released Strawberries in the United Kingdom on CD.
