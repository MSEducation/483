James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce [tpl]small|OM GCVO PC FRS FBA[/tpl] (10 May 1838 – 22 January 1922) was a British academic, jurist, historian and Liberal politician.

==Background and education==

Bryce was born in Arthur Street, Belfast, County Antrim, the son of James Bryce, LL.D., of Glasgow, by his wife Margaret, daughter of James Young of Whiteabbey, County Antrim. The first eight years of his life were spent residing at his grandfather’s Whiteabbey residence, often playing for hours on the tranquil picturesque shoreline. John Annan Bryce was his younger brother.thepeerage.com James Bryce, 1st and last Viscount Bryce He was educated under his uncle Reuben John Bryce at the Belfast Academy,H.A.L. Fisher James Bryce, p. 13 at Glasgow High School, the University of Glasgow, the University of Heidelberg and Trinity College, Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1862, and called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, in 1867.

==Academic career==

Bryce went to the bar and practised in London for a few years,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] but he was soon called back to Oxford as Regius Professor of Civil Law, a position he held between 1870 and 1893. From 1870 to 1875 he was also Professor of Jurisprudence at Owen's College, Manchester.  His reputation as an historian had been made as early as 1864 by his work on the Holy Roman Empire. In 1872 he travelled to Iceland to see the land of the Icelandic sagas as he was a great admirer of Njáls saga. In 1876, he climbed above the tree line on Mount Ararat and found a slab of hand-hewn timber, four feet long and five inches thick, which he believed was from Noah's Ark.noahsarksearch.com James Bryce

==Political career==

Bryce was an ardent Liberal in politics, and in 1880 he was elected to parliament for the Tower Hamlets constituency in London.[tpl]rayment-hc|t|2|date=January 2014[/tpl] In 1885 he was returned for South Aberdeen, where he was re-elected on succeeding occasions and remained a Member of Parliament until 1907.[tpl]rayment-hc|a|1|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Bryce's intellectual distinction and political industry made him a valuable member of the Liberal Party. As soon as the late 1860s, he acted as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] In 1885 he was made Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under William Ewart Gladstone, but he had to leave office after the electoral defeat the same year. In 1892 he joined Gladstone's last cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster[tpl]London Gazette |issue=26319 |date=23 August 1892 |startpage=4801 [/tpl] and was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=26318 |date=19 August 1892 |startpage=4742 [/tpl] In 1894 he was appointed President of the Board of Trade in the new cabinet of Lord Rosebery,[tpl]London Gazette |issue=26518 |date=1 June 1894 |startpage=3181 [/tpl] but had to leave this office with that whole Liberal cabinet as soon as 1895.
The Liberals were to remain out of office for the next ten years. In 1897, after a visit to South Africa, Bryce published a volume of Impressions of that country, which had considerable weight in Liberal circles when the Second Boer War was being discussed. He was one of the harshest critics of British repressive policy against Boer civilians in the South African partisan War. Taking the risk of being very unpopular for a certain moment, he condemned the systematic burning of farms and the imprisonment of old people, women and children in British concentration camps.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The "still radical" Bryce was made Chief Secretary for Ireland in Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet in 1905 - in which he remained throughout 1906.[tpl]cite web |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |first=Christopher |last=Harvie |authorlink=Christopher Harvie |title=James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce (1838–1922) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32141 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 January 2014[/tpl]

==Ambassador to the United States==

However, even this time Bryce's cabinet post was held only for a brief period, because as soon as February 1907 he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States of America.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=27995 |date=15 February 1907 |startpage=1065 [/tpl] He kept this diplomatic office until 1913 and was very efficient in strengthening the Anglo-American friendship. Bryce made many personal friends in American politics, amongst them US President Theodore Roosevelt.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The German ambassador in Washington, Graf Heinrich von Bernstorff, later admitted how relieved he felt that Bryce was not his competitor for American sympathies during the World War period, when Bernstorff managed to secure the neutrality of the USA at least until 1917.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
As an author, Bryce quickly became well known in America for his 1888 work, The American Commonwealth. The book thoroughly examined the institutions of the United States from the point of view of a historian and constitutional lawyer, and it at once became a classic. In developing material for his book, Bryce painstakingly reproduced the travels of Alexis de Tocqueville, writer of Democracy in America (1835–40). Although Tocqueville emphasized the egalitarian nature of early-19th-century America, Bryce was dismayed to find vast inequality a half-century later, stating "Sixty years ago, there were no great fortunes in America, few large fortunes, no poverty. Now there is some poverty ... and a greater number of gigantic fortunes than in any other country of the world"Viscount James Bryce Bryce, The American Commonwealth, p. 745 and "As respects education ... the profusion of…elementary schools tends to raise the mass to a higher point than in Europe ... but there is an increasing class that has studied at the best universities. It appears that equality has diminished this regard and will diminish further."Viscount James Bryce Bryce, The American Commonwealth, p. 746

==First World War==

After his retirement as ambassador and his return to Great Britain he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Bryce, of Dechmount in the County of Lanark, in 1914.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=28797 |date=30 January 1914 |startpage=810 [/tpl] Thus he became a member of the House of Lords, the powers of which had been curtailed in the Liberal Parliamentary Reform of 1911. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Lord Bryce was commissioned by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to give the official Bryce Report on alleged German atrocities in Belgium. The report was published in 1915, and was damning of German behaviour against civilians; Lord Bryce's accounts were confirmed by Vernon Lyman Kellogg, director of the American Commission for Relief in Belgium, who told the New York Times that the German military enslaved hundreds of thousands of Belgian workers, and abused and maimed many of them in the process.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Bryce also strongly condemned the Armenian Genocide that took place in the Ottoman Empire mainly in the year 1915. Bryce was the first to speak on that subject in The House of Lords, in July 1915, and later, with the assistance of the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, he produced a documentary record of the massacres, published by the British government in 1916 as the Blue Book. In 1921, Lord Bryce wrote that the Armenian genocide had also claimed half of the population of Assyrians in the Ottoman Empire, as similar cruelties were perpetrated upon them.Travis, Hannibal. "Genocide in the Middle East: The Ottoman Empire, Iraq, and Sudan." Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2010, 2007, pp. 237–77, 293–294.Travis, Hannibal.

During the last years of his life, Bryce served at the International Court at The Hague, supported the establishment of the League of Nations and published a book about Modern Democracy in 1921 that was rather critical of post-war democracy; specifically, he strongly opposed the new right to vote for women.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

==Honours and other public appointments==

Bryce received numerous academic honors from home and foreign universities. In September 1901 he received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College.[tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 September 1901 |page_number 7 |issue=36570| [/tpl]
He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1894.
In earlier life he was a notable mountain climber, ascending Mount Ararat in 1876, and publishing a volume on Transcaucasia and Ararat in 1877; in 1899–1901 he was president of the Alpine Club. From his Caucasian journey he brought back a deep distrust of Ottoman rule in Asia Minor and a distinct sympathy for the Armenian people.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In 1882, Bryce established the National Liberal Club whose members, in its first three decades, included fellow founder, Prime Minister Gladstone, George Bernard Shaw, David Lloyd George, H. H. Asquith and  many other prominent Liberal candidates and MP's such as  Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell.[tpl]cite web|title=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=DELL%2F2%2F3|url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=DELL%2F2%2F3|title=General Correspondence - Meeting at National Liberal Club  - 1914.
