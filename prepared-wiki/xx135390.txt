Evanston Davis Street, also called simply Evanston, is a commuter railroad station in downtown Evanston, Illinois, USA.  It is served solely by Metra's Union Pacific/North Line with trains going south to Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago and as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin.  In Metra's zone-based fare system, Davis Street is in zone C. The station is next to the Davis station of the Chicago Transit Authority's Purple Line, where numerous CTA and Pace buses also stop.  Between the two stations is 909 Davis Street, a six-story building, with a kiss-and-ride loop for car drop-off.
Davis Street station, at Davis Street and Maple Avenue, has two elevated platforms.  Northbound trains stop at the west platform and southbound trains stop at the east platform. The ticket agent's office is on the east platform. At ground level, there is a restaurant called Chef's Station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/contemporary/chefs-station-evanston/138154/content |title=Chef's Station - Evanston, IL 60201 / Metromix Chicago |accessdate=2008-12-17 [/tpl]  Just to the east of the Davis CTA station is the 12-story Sherman Avenue Garage.
This is the closest Metra station to most of the buildings on Northwestern University's Evanston campus, with the notable exception of Ryan Field, which is closer to the Central Street station.
