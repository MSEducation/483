It was once a primarily black neighborhood, and is named for its many original residents who were of Bahamian ancestry.
The entrance to the village on Petronia Street has an open air flea market, shops and restaurants, and has recently become a small tourist attraction.
It contains the city of Key West's public swimming pool.
It is wise to be wary in most areas of Key West after dark, especially outside of heavily trafficked tourist areas, and especially when alone and/or impaired by alcohol or drugs.  Bahama Village is no exception to this cautionary rule.  Bahama Village was known for open-air drug dealing in days gone by, but police coverage is now a constant.
