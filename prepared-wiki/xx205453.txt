Stanley Keith Runcorn FRS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2002.0023[/tpl]  (19 November 1922 â€“ 5 December 1995) was a British physicist whose paleomagnetic reconstruction of the relative motions of Europe and America revived the theory of continental drift and was a major contribution to plate tectonics.

==Biography==

He was born in Southport, Lancashire and graduated in engineering from the University of Cambridge in 1942.
After a period in radar research during the World War II, he joined the Physics Department at the University of Manchester where he did research on aspects of the Earth's magnetic field, taking his Ph.D. under Patrick Blackett in 1949.[ref]Powell, T.E. and Harper, P.

(1922-1995), geophysicist https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/recordsandarchives/Public/Runcorn,%20Professor%20Stanley%20Keith%20FRS%20catalogue%20of%20papers%20Volume%201.pdf, College Archives, Imperial College London,  2002[/ref] This led to his interest in palaeomagnetism, the study of the magnetism of rocks, which he pursued first at the Geophysics Department at the University of Cambridge and later at Newcastle University, where he was appointed to the chair of Physics in 1956. At Newcastle Runcorn developed a strong research group in geophysics, and made substantial contributions to various fields, including convection in the Earth and Moon, the shape and magnetic fields of the Moon and planets, magnetohydrodynamics of the Earth's core, changes in the length of the day, polar wandering, continental drift and plate tectonics.
Runcorn received many honours, including Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1965, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Fleming medal of the American Geophysical Union. He was also a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science. He served as the Sydney Chapman Endowed Chair in Physical Sciences at the University of Alaska from 1989 to 1995. After his retirement in 1988 he continued to be active in various lines of research until his untimely death in San Diego in 1995.

==Circumstances of Death==

Runcorn was murdered in his hotel room in San Diego during a lecture trip to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Police found that he had been strangled and found evidence of injuries to the head.Walter Sullivan, "Leading Expert in Geophysics Is Found Slain in Hotel Room", New York Times, (7 December 1995) Paul Cain, a professional kick-boxer, was later convicted and sentenced to a term of at least 25 years."Kick-boxer jailed for death of geophysicist," Nature, v.389, p.657 (16 October 1997)  Prosecutors argued that Cain killed Runcorn after stealing his wallet and credit cards, having targeted him as an elderly gay man and therefore easy victim.  Cain was tried three times in all.  The first trial ended with a deadlocked jury; the second with a conviction that was overturned on appeal, on grounds that testimony from Cain's two previous wives as to his violent temper should not have been admitted in evidence.Ben Fox, "Man claims childhood abuse led him to murder renowned UAF scientist," Peninsula Clarion (28 February 2000)
