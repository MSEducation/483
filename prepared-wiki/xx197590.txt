The Victoria Viaduct, originally known as the Victoria Bridge, is a stone arch rail viaduct spanning the River Wear in North East England, built as part of the Durham Junction Railway under the supervision of Thomas Elliot Harrison.

==History and design==

The bridge was constructed as part of the Durham Junction Railway, which had been sanctioned by act of parliament in 1834; the act allowed for traffic tolls on a bridge over the Wear, including tolls for road and foot crossing.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|pp=224-5[/tpl] A [tpl]convert|170|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] iron bridge suitable for passage by rail, foot and road vehicle was designed by John Green of Newcastle, but instead a stone arch bridge designed by James Walker was chosen.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=227[/tpl] The contract to build the bridge was given to John Gibb & Son. of Aberdeen.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=268[/tpl]
The design was based upon the Alcántara Bridge in Spain. Construction began 17 March 1836 and was completed on 28 June 1838, the date of the coronation of Queen Victoria; as a result it was called 'Victoria Bridge'. The cost of construction was £40,338 5s. 10d.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=318[/tpl]In The Theory, Practice, and Architecture of Bridges of Stone, Iron, Timber.. the contracted cost is given as £34,619 and the actual cost as £38,000.[tpl]harv|Weale|Hann|Hosking|Stevenson|1843|pp=cxxii[/tpl]
The bridge was [tpl]convert|810|ft|9|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|23|ft|4|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in width, with a height above water level of the top point of the arches of approximately [tpl]convert|120|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] It was constructed entirely of locally quarried Penshaw sandstone, excluding the quoins stones of the main arches, made of aberdeen granite.[tpl]sfn|Brenner|1843|p=97[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Weale|Hann|Hosking|Stevenson|1843|pp=cxxi[/tpl] The viaduct carried a double track railway, and had a walkway on either side for pedestrians.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=319[/tpl]
The main arches had spans of [tpl]convert|100|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]; [tpl]convert|160|ft|abbr=on[/tpl];  [tpl]convert|144|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]; and [tpl]convert|100|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. At either end of the viaduct were sets of three smaller spans of [tpl]convert|20|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]#tag:ref|Walker's original design had full arches at either end, and a total length of 135ft – the design was modified to replace both of the end arches with three smaller arches. Walker was unhappy with this modification,[tpl]harv|Tomlinson|1915|p=319[/tpl] and the architect Charles Barry was also critical of the change.[tpl]citation|url=http://archive.org/details/thomassopwithwit00rich| title = Thomas Sopwith : with excerpts from his diary of fifty-seven years |year =1891|publisher  =Longmans, Green & Co.|last = Richardson|first= Benjamin Ward|authorlink =Benjamin Ward Richardson |pages = 138–9[/tpl]|group="note"[/tpl] The main arches were semicircular with the exception of the main 160 ft span, which was a circular segment, spanning 160 ft with a rise of 72 ft. The three main piers and one of the arch abutments were founded on bedrock, the river pier required excavation to a depth of [tpl]convert|24|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] below the river bed to obtain that footing. One arch abutment was founded on [tpl]convert|14|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|10|in|abbr=on[/tpl] diameter scotch fir piles, spaced at [tpl]convert|3|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Above the first [tpl]convert|5|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] the piers contained voids to minimise mass.[tpl]sfn|Brenner|1843[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Weale|Hann|Hosking|Stevenson|1843|pp=cxxi[/tpl]In Account of the Victoria Bridge, Erected Across the River Wear [tpl]harv|Brenner|1843[/tpl] an erroneous span width of 60ft is given for one of the main arches
The bridge and line opened in August 1838.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|1915|p=318[/tpl] As built it was one of the largest bridges in Europe, being exceeded in arch length by the River Dee bridge at Chester, and in height by the Alacantra bridge, but not by other structures in both dimensions.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AsQhAAAAMAAJ|title = The Gentleman's Magazine| volume =165 (X of new series)| year = 1838|editor-first = Sylvanus|editor-last = Urban|publisher = William Pickering / John Bowyer Nichols and Son|page = 429| date = Sep 1838[/tpl]
Passenger trains on the line and viaduct ceased in 1964 following the Beeching Axe. The bridge continued to carry freight, and was renovated in 1989/90. After closure of the freight terminal at  Follingsby in 1991 the line and bridge were mothballed.[tpl]citation| url  =http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/bridges/gallery/victoria.html| title = Victoria Viaduct| work = www.forgottenrelics.co.uk[/tpl] The structure was grade II* listed in 1985.[tpl]citation| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1354978&searchtype=mapsearch| title= VICTORIA RAILWAY BRIDGE| work = list.english-heritage.org.uk| publisher = English Heritage[/tpl]
