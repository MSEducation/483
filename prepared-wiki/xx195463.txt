Uvas Creek is a [tpl]convert|29.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl]U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed July 29, 2011 mainly southward-flowing stream originating on Loma Prieta peak of the Santa Cruz Mountains, in Santa Clara County, California, United States. The creek descends through Uvas Canyon County Park into Uvas Reservoir near Morgan Hill, and on through Uvas Creek Preserve and Christmas Hill Park in Gilroy.  Upon passing U.S. Highway 101 it is known as Carnadero Creek[tpl]gnis|254714|Carnadero Creek[/tpl] (also known as lower Uvas Creek), shortly before the confluence with the Pajaro River at the Santa Clara County - San Benito County boundary.

==History==

Uvas Creek got its name from the 1842 Rancho Las Uvas Mexican land grant.  The Spanish name for grapes, "uvas", is preserved in a number of place names, all apparently referring to the abundance of wild grapes (Vitis californica) along the area's main watercourses.[tpl]cite book |title=California Place Names |author=Erwin Gustav Gudde |page=C-351 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-22djGNuhwC&pg=SL3-PA351&lpg=SL3-PA351&dq=geographic+place+names+uvas+creek&source=bl&ots=-LJBZzXPHT&sig=-N3UxB-_9Dj3gbqVFWccqBUgP1Q&hl=en&ei=LaYzToabC8ndiAKB85W6CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=uvas%20creek&f=false |accessdate=2011-07-29 [/tpl] "Carnadero" probably means "butchering place".[tpl]cite book |title=California Place Names |author=Erwin Gustav Gudde |page=67 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kqwt5RlMVBoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gudde's+place+names&hl=en&ei=cRmATubbHLPRiAKG8bC6Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=carnadero%20creek&f=false |accessdate=2011-09-25 [/tpl]

==Watershed and Course==

The Uvas Creek watershed drains the eastern slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains in southern Santa Clara County. On the upper section of the creek is Uvas Canyon County Park. Uvas Reservoir, built in 1957, drains [tpl]convert|32|sqmi[/tpl] and is [tpl]convert|7.5|mi[/tpl] upstream of the City of Gilroy and [tpl]convert|10.5|mi[/tpl] upstream of the Pajaro River confluence. Significant tributaries include Croy Creek,[tpl]gnis|221877|Croy Creek[/tpl] Little Uvas Creek,[tpl]gnis|227395|Little Uvas Creek[/tpl] Little Arthur Creek,[tpl]gnis|227185|Little Arthur Creek[/tpl] Bodfish Creek[tpl]gnis|219577|Bodfish Creek[/tpl] and Gavilan Creek.[tpl]gnis|252146|Gavilan Creek[/tpl] Below Uvas Reservoir the creek is very low gradient. After Uvas Creek crosses Highway 101 and becomes Carnadero Creek (aka lower Uvas Creek) it is joined from the right by Gavilan Creek, Tick Creek and then Tar Creek. Uvas Creek is the only stream in the Pajaro River watershed, and in Santa Clara County, whose water right specifies minimum winter and summer releases for maintaining fish resources.[tpl]cite report |title=Fishes of the Pajaro River System |author=Jerry J.

==Ecology==

Uvas Creek supports a self-sustaining population of steelhead that is part of the Southern Central California Coast Distinct population segment (DPS), which is listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act.[tpl]cite report |title=Updated status of federally listed ESUs of West Coast salmon and steelhead, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NWFSC-66 |authors=T. P. Good, R.S. Waples, and P. Adams (editors) |year=2005 |pages=598 |publisher=U.S. Dept. Commerce |url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Publications/Biological-Status-Reviews/upload/SR2005-allspecies.pdf |accessdate=2011-07-29 [/tpl] The year before Uvas Creek Dam was constructed in 1957, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) agreed with the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOU) to maintain flows sufficient to protect Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations below Uvas Reservoir and to collect and truck returning adults above the dam to spawn upstream, however this latter promise was not kept.[tpl]cite thesis |title=Distribution, Abundance, Growth and Hasbitat Use of Steelhead in Uvas Creek, CA (Master's Thesis) |author=Joel M. Casagrande |publisher=San Jose State University |year=2010 |url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4747&context=etd_theses&sei-redir=1#search=%22uvas%20creek%20watershed%22 |accessdate=2011-07-29 [/tpl]
A non-profit volunteer organization called CHEER (Coastal Habitat Education and Environmental Restoration) founded by Herman Garcia, transports steelhead stranded in drying pools to reaches of Uvas Creek that are perennial. In 2008, Garcia's organization transported more than 23,000 steelhead, a dramatic number compared to the 100-200 fish reported in the entire Pajaro River system in 1991.[tpl]cite news |title= A lot to CHEER About |author=Chris Bone |newspaper=Gilroy Dispatch |date=2009-03-02 |url=http://www.cheercentral.org/the-news/67-a-lot-to-cheer-about |accessdate=2011-09-25 [/tpl] Two tributaries of Uvas Creek are also steelhead spawning and rearing streams, Bodfish and Little Arthur Creeks.
The northwest to southeast orientation of Uvas Reservoir is in line with prevailing winds which drive the warm surface layer (epilimnion) down into the cool bottom layer (hypolimnion), so that by late summer the bottom water is warm and anoxic. The result is that no wild or planted trout survive the summer in the reservoir. Landlocked steelhead above Uvas Dam take the rainbow trout form, and genetic studies of these fish in upper Uvas Creek above Uvas Road show that they are of native, and not hatchery stock.
Other native fish species in the Uvas Creek watershed include Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Riffle sculpin (Cottus gulosus), Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), and Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and Hitch (Lavinia exilicauda) are also present, but are relatively scarce. Non-native fish are uncommon in Uvas Creek.
