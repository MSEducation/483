Cobb Education Television, or Cobb edTV, is the local-access educational television cable TV channel in Cobb County, Georgia.
Cobb edTV was established in April 2004, and is a partnership between the Cobb County School District, Chattahoochee Technical College, Marietta City Schools, Kennesaw State University, Southern Polytechnic State University, and formerly North Metro Technical College (now merged with Chattahoochee).
Cobb edTV can be found on Comcast analog TV channel 24 for subscribers throughout Cobb County as a part of their basic cable package, and in the clear on QAM digital TV channel 81.24 for digital basic.  In the Smyrna area, Cobb edTV is available on Charter cable channel 95.
The network features continuous programming, broadcasting educational courses and workshops 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This was originally from the Annenberg Channel (until that TV network ceased at the end of September 2008).  From the beginning of October 2008, some programming comes from GPB Education instead.  Network programming is preempted by news and information programs produced by students and staff of Cobb County's education entities.  Cobb edTV also features scrolling "bulletin board" announcements on a crawl, and regularly scheduled rebroadcasts of Cobb County School District meetings and work sessions.
