CATEGORIES: 896 deaths, Frankish bishops, Archbishops of Milan, 9th-century archbishops, Year of birth unknown

Anselm II Capra (died 896) was the Archbishop of Milan from 882 until his death. He was the leader of the West Frankish party against the East Frankish in the Italian politics of his day. He opposed Berengar of Friuli and supported crowning the Frank Guy III of Spoleto as King of Italy after the deposition of Charles the Fat. He eventually prevailed, by his ecclesiastic influence winning over the pro-German bishops, such as Wibod of Parma.
