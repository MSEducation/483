[[Kickflip]]

CATEGORIES: Skateboarding tricks

The Kickflip is a skateboarding trick where the rider ollies and kicks his/her foot out and flips the board 360 degrees along its long axis with his/her toes, allows the board to spin all of the way around, and then catches it and lands.
It was the first of many modern flip tricks to be invented by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s. In March of 2011, the first kickflip in surfing was landed by Zoltan "The Magician" Torkos.

==Origin==

In the 1970s freestyle skateboarders learned to flip the board over beneath them by lifting an edge of the board with the top of one toe. While the board flipped completely over, It did not gain much clearance from the ground, and the setup required the rider to stand more parallel to the direction of motion, with both feet facing the nose. Very well known and commonly performed today, the kickflip is a basic skateboarding trick. However it is hard to learn and beginners often take quite a long time to acquire it. Once they have mastered the trick on flat ground, many skateboarders like to up the stakes and start taking this recently-learned maneuver down obstacles. They also start combining it with other tricks such as kickflip to frontside boardslide.
In 1983[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Rodney Mullen invented the modern form of the trick,[tpl]cite journal|title=Charles Kazhila - From the Ground Up|journal=ON Video Magazine|year=2002|issue=Winter, 2002[/tpl] initially naming it the "magic flip"[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]. He first would use his relatively new flatground ollie to leave the ground, then, instead of lifting an edge with a toe, he initiated the flip by sliding his front foot off the top of the board.
Mullen's kickflip technique gave him more control in several areas: the height of the clearance, the initiation time and speed of the flip, and the board's direction during the flip. This technique was quickly adopted by freestyle skaters and later by street skaters, introducing skateboarding to the era of flip tricks, many of which Rodney Mullen also created.

==Execution==

To perform a kickflip, the rider ollies into the air, and lifts the back foot from the board while simultaneously sliding the front foot off the skateboard diagonally forward and towards the heel of the foot. This front foot motion, sometimes called "the flick" [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl], spins the board, flipping it completely over. Before landing, the rider stops the spin by returning the feet to the board as it nears its original position.
The board revolves around its longitudinal axis, like an aileron roll. To understand this motion and the direction of rotation, imagine stepping backwards off of a skateboard, leaving it in front of you, then rolling it over on the ground toward you; during the kickflip, the board spins similarly, but in mid-air beneath the rider. During a heelflip, a similar trick, the board rotates in the opposite direction.

==Variations==

Once a skateboarder masters the kickflip, many variations are possible:
