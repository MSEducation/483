No Kenyan or Ethiopian has won the Women's Steeplechase at the World Championships.  It became quickly obvious that was going to change.  From the gun the three Kenyans and the three Ethiopians formed a pack that separated from the rest of the field.  At he beginning of the 6th lap Sofia Assefa, running at the back of the back, tripped over a barrier and fell, losing several seconds to the field.  She got back up and tried to catch back up to the pack.  Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi was the first to fall out the back, passed by Assefa.  But Milcah Chemos Cheywa and Lydiah Chepkurui were on the front of train, stringing out the Ethiopians.  Chemos, running determined after two successive bronze medals, led out the final lap, with Assefa chasing her teammates.  Chemos held her slight lead all the way to the finish.  Assefa caught Hiwot Alayew just before the water jump and continued to gain on Chepkurui.  At the last barrier it looked like Assefa had the momentum to go by, but she seemed to lose a step after landing, Chepkuri ran away to the silver and Assefa making an impressive comeback to get bronze.
