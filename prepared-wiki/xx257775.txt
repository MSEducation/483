CATEGORIES: Mango cultivars

The Rosigold (or Rosy Gold) mango is a named, early season mango cultivar that was selected in south Florida.

==History==

Rosigold is of Southeast Asian heritage,http://www.virtualherbarium.org/tropicalfruit/mangotrees.html and may have been a seedling of a Saigon-type mango. A 2005 pedigree analysis estimated that Rosigold was a seedling of the Ono mango.http://www.fshs.org/Proceedings/Password%20Protected/2005%20v.%20118/118/192-197.pdf
Due to its low growth habit, Rosigold has been promoted in Florida as a mango for home growers with limited space, as well those who desire an early fruiting variety. Rosigold is now sold as nurserystock and often marketed as a 'condo mango' because it can be grown and maintained in a pot.
Rosigold trees are planted in the collections of the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Centerhttp://trec.ifas.ufl.edu/crane/pdfs/TREC-Fruit-Collections.pdf in Homestead, Florida as well as the Miami-Dade Fruit and Spice Park,http://fruitandspicepark.org/friends/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=43&Itemid=29 also in Homestead.

==Description==

The fruit averages under a pound in weight and is oblong in shape with a smooth surface. The apex is bluntly pointed and the fruit lacks a beak. At maturity the skin is yellow in color, sometimes containing an orange-red blush. The flesh is orange-yellow in color, fiberless, and has a rich, sweet flavor. It contains a polyembryonic seed. Rosigold's fruit production is considered good. The fruit begin ripening in March in Florida, making Rosigold one of the earliest ripening cultivars.
The trees have a small growth habit and can be maintained at 8 feet in height with pruning.
