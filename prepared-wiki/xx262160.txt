Edwin A. Finckel (born 23 December 1913 - 2001) was a jazz performer and arranger and a composer of songs and classical music.

==Biography==

Finckel was born in Washington D.C. as the youngest of six children. His father was a patent attorney and both his parents were musical. All of his five elder siblings received musical training but Edwin was left to his own devices with regard to music, but his artistic talents won him a scholarship at the Corcoran School of Art. He didn't give up his interest in art but he also found access to a piano and within a year he had taught himself to play, albeit unconventionally and without the ability to read music. Finckel took to jazz although he also showed skill as a tennis player while still a teenager.Edwin Finckel, artistled.com, accessed 1 January 2011
Finckel was well regarded for his ability to improvise music and he went on to arrange others and later compose over 200 of his own melodies. He was appearing professionally as a teenager and he went on to introduce string instruments into his arrangement for big bands.[tpl]cite news|last=Holden|first=Steven|title=Edwin Finckel, 83, Composer, Jazz Pianist and Music Educator|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/10/arts/edwin-finckel-83-composer-jazz-pianist-and-music-educator.html|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 May 2001[/tpl] His best known song may be Where is the One which was recorded by Frank Sinatra on his Where Are You? album.

At the school, he gave private lessons, conducted the choir and orchestra, and wrote much of the music that the children sing every morning and at special events.The school also employed his wife, Helen, as a secretary. Edwin retired after his 39 years and his position was taken up by Mr. F. Allen Artz. Finckel continued to perform Jazz but in his forties he also wrote classical music. His son David is a professional cellist who performed and recorded his father's composition for piano and cello Of Human Kindness with his wife Wu Han.Edwin Finckel: Music for Cello, David Finckel and Wu Han, ArtistLed, 2001, accessed January 2011
