Kennedy, who was aware of his brother's particular interest in them.
Mrs. Kennedy requested that two Catholic priests remain with the body until the official funeral. A call was made to The Catholic University of America, and Msgr. Robert Paul Mohan and Fr.

==Lying in state==

On Sunday afternoon about 300,000 people watched a horse-drawn caisson, which had borne the body of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Unknown Soldier, carry Kennedy's flag-covered casket down the White House drive, past parallel rows of soldiers bearing the flags of the 50 states of the Union, then along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Rotunda to lie in state.[tpl]cite news|title=300,000 Join in Tributes to Kennedy As Notables Arrive for Funeral Today|date=November 25, 1963|page=A1|first=Alfred|last=Friendly|newspaper=The Washington Post|authorlink=Alfred Friendly[/tpl] The only sounds on Pennsylvania Avenue as the cortège made its way to the Capitol were the sounds of the muffled drums and the clacking of horses' hooves, including the riderless horse Black Jack.
The widow, holding her two children by the hand, led the public mourning for the country.[tpl]harvnb|White|1965|p=16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Mrs. Kennedy Leads Public Mourning|first=Marjorie|last=Hunter|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 1963|page=1[/tpl] In the rotunda, Mrs. Kennedy and her daughter Caroline knelt beside the casket, which rested on the Lincoln catafalque.[tpl]harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=81[/tpl] Three-year-old John Jr. was briefly taken out of the rotunda so as not to disrupt the service. Mrs. Kennedy maintained her composure as her husband was taken to the Capitol to lie in state, as well as during the memorial service.
Brief eulogies were delivered inside the rotunda by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana, Chief Justice Earl Warren, and Speaker McCormack.[tpl]harvnb|Mudd|2008|p=131[/tpl]
Kennedy was the first president in more than 30 years to lie in state in the rotunda, the previous one being the only president to ever serve as chief justice, William Howard Taft, in 1930.[tpl]cite news|title=Kennedy is 6th President to Lie in Capitol Rotunda|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=7|author=United Press International[/tpl] He was also the first Democrat to lie in state at the Capitol.[tpl]cite news|title=Body to Lie in State Today at Capitol|first=Philip|last=Warden|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=3[/tpl]

The original plan was for the rotunda to close at 9:00 p.m. and reopen for an hour at 9:00 the next morning.[tpl]harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=91[/tpl] Because of long lines however, police and military authorities decided to keep the doors open. At 9:00 p.m., when the rotunda was supposed to close, both Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy returned to the rotunda again.[tpl]harvnb|Heymann|1998|p=352[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Mrs. Kennedy Revisits Bier|date=November 25, 1963|author=Associated Press|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=1[/tpl] More than half the mourners came to the rotunda after 2:45 a.m., by which time 115,000 had already visited.

As Kennedy lay in state, foreign dignitaries—including heads of state and government and members of royal families—started to arrive in Washington to attend the state funeral on Monday.[tpl]cite news|title=Officials of Nearly 100 Lands in U.S.—They Will Meet Johnson|first=Max|last=Frankel|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 1963|page=1|authorlink=Max Frankel[/tpl] Secretary of State Dean Rusk and other State Department personnel went to both of Washington's commercial airports to personally greet foreign dignitaries.[tpl]cite news|last=Duscha|first=Julius|title=Kings, Presidents and Premiers Here|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 25, 1963|page=A1|authorlink=Julius Duscha[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Rusk|first=Dean|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Rusk|editor2-first=Daniel S.|editor2-last=Papp|title=As I Saw It|year=1990|publisher=W.

==Funeral==

As people were viewing the casket, military authorities held meetings at the White House, at MDW headquarters, and at Arlington National Cemetery to plan Monday's events.[tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|p=198[/tpl] First, they decided that the public viewing should end at 9:00 a.m. EST and that the ceremonies would begin at 10:30 a.m. EST.[tpl]cite news|title=Funeral Processtion to Begin at 10:30 a.m.|date=November 25, 1963|author=Associated Press|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=1[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|p=205[/tpl]  On Sunday evening the State Department issued its Official Narrative of Events for November 25:
Unlike Sunday's procession, which was led by only the muffled drum corps,[tpl]cite news|title=President's Body Lies in the Capitol|first=Michael|last=Pakenham|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 25, 1963|page=1[/tpl] Monday's was expanded to include other military units.[tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|pp=200, 203[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|United Press International|American Heritage Magazine|1964|p=139[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Riderless Horse an Ancient Tradition|date=November 26, 1963|first=Jack|last=Raymond|newspaper=The New York Times|page=10[/tpl] Military officials also agreed to requests from Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy. They agreed that the Marine Band should lead the funeral procession, which would include two foreign military units—pipers from the Scottish Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) marching from the White House to St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, a group of 26 Irish Defence Forces cadets—at the request of Mrs. Kennedy—performing silent drill at the grave site, and placement of an eternal flame at the grave.[tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|pp=201, 202, 205[/tpl] The cadets came from the  Curragh Camp, County Kildare.[tpl]cite news|title=Why Irish Guards Were Invited|newspaper=The Boston Globe|first=Brendan|last=Malin|date=November 26, 1963|page=15[/tpl] The cadets traveled with Irish President Éamon de Valera, and together they paid tribute to Kennedy's Irish ancestry.

The day's events began at 8:25 a.m.,[tpl]cite news|title=Timetable of the Kennedy Funeral and Procession|date=November 26, 1963|newspaper=New York Times|page=4[/tpl] when the MPDC cut off the line of mourners waiting to get into the rotunda.

Earlier that morning the State Department also issued the following directive:

===Procession to cathedral===

After Jacqueline Kennedy and her brothers-in-law, Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, visited the rotunda, the coffin was carried out onto the caisson. At 10:50, the caisson left the Capitol.[tpl]harvnb|United Press International|American Heritage Magazine|1964|p=100[/tpl] Ten minutes later, the procession began, making its way back to the White House. As the procession reached the White House, all the military units except for the Marine company turned right off Pennsylvania Avenue and onto 17th Street.[tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|p=206[/tpl] A platoon of the Marine company turned in the northeast gate and led the cortege into the North Portico.
At the White House, the procession resumed on foot to St. Matthew's Cathedral, led by Jacqueline Kennedy and the late president's brothers, Robert and Edward (Ted) Kennedy. They walked the same route that John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy often used when going to Mass at the cathedral.[tpl]harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=139[/tpl] This also marked the first time that a first lady walked in her husband's funeral procession.[tpl]harvnb|NBC News|1966|pp=126, 139[/tpl] The two Kennedy children rode in a limousine behind their mother and uncles.[tpl]harvnb|United Press International|American Heritage Magazine|1964|p=114[/tpl] The rest of the Kennedy family, apart from the president's father, Joseph P.

The new president Lyndon B. Johnson, his wife Lady Bird, and their two daughters Luci and Lynda also marched in the procession. Johnson had been advised not to do so because of the potential risk in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. Johnson recounted his experiences in his memoirs, saying, "I remember marching behind the caisson to St. Matthew's Cathedral. The muffled rumble of drums set up a heartbreaking echo."[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Lyndon|title=The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency, 1963-1969|year=1971|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|location=New York[/tpl]
Merle Miller quoted him as having said, "Walking in the procession was especially one of the most difficult decisions I had to make," but it was something he "could do, should do, would do, and did so." When he moved into the Oval Office the next day, there was a letter from Mrs. Kennedy on his desk[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=Merle|title=Lyndon: An Oral Biography|location=New York|publisher=Putnam|year=1980|authorlink=Merle Miller[/tpl] in which she thanked him for marching in the procession.
Not since the funeral of Britain's King Edward VII, in 1910, had there been such a large gathering of presidents, prime ministers, and royalty at a state funeral.[tpl]harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=140[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Duscha|first=Julius|title=Mighty World Rulers Pay Humble Tribute|work=The Washington Post|date=November 26, 1963|page=A1[/tpl] In all, 220 foreign dignitaries, including 19 heads of state and government, and members of royal families from 92 countries, five international agencies, and the papacy attended the funeral.[tpl]harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=93[/tpl] Most of the dignitaries passed unnoticed, following respectfully behind the former first lady and the Kennedy family during the relatively short walk to the cathedral along Connecticut Avenue.
As the dignitaries marched, there was a heavy security presence because of concerns for the potential assassination of so many world leaders,[tpl]cite news|title=Net of Security Blankets Washington|first=Alfred E.|last=Lewis|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 26, 1963|page=A12[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Maximum Security At Funeral|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 26, 1963|page=20|author=Associated Press[/tpl] the greatest being for French President Charles de Gaulle.[tpl]cite news|title=Security for de Gaulle Is Tightest in Big Four|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 26, 1963|page=C13[/tpl] Under Secretary of State George Ball manned the operations center at the State Department with the goal of ensuring that no incident occurred.[tpl]cite book|title=November 22: The Day Remembered|author=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=1990|isbn=0-87833-711-3[/tpl]

There was no coverage in East Germany, where television audiences had only a soccer match to watch.
The widow, wearing a black veil, led the way up the steps of the cathedral holding the hands of her two children, with John Jr., whose third birthday fell on the day of his father's funeral, on her left, and Caroline on her right. Because of the funeral and the day of mourning, the widow postponed John Jr.'s birthday party until December 5, the last day the family was in the White House.[tpl]cite news|author=United Press International|title=Mrs. Kennedy Gives Son A Delayed Birthday Party|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1963|page=18[/tpl]

===Funeral Mass at cathedral===

About 1,200 invited guests attended the funeral Mass in the cathedral. The Archbishop of Boston, Richard Cardinal Cushing, celebrated the Pontifical Requiem Low Mass at the cathedral where Kennedy, a practicing Catholic, often worshipped.[tpl]cite news|title=Cardinal Buries a Dear Friend|newspaper=The Boston Globe|first=Louis|last=Cassels|date=November 26, 1963|page=1|agency=United Press International[/tpl] Cardinal Cushing was a close friend of the family who had witnessed and blessed the marriage of Senator Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier in 1953. He had also baptized two of their children, given the invocation at President Kennedy's inauguration, and officiated at the recent funeral of their infant son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy.[tpl]harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=94[/tpl]
At the request of the First Lady, the Requiem Mass was a Low Mass[tpl]harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=126[/tpl]—that is, a simplified version of the Mass, with the Mass recited or spoken and not sung. Two months later, Cardinal Cushing offered a pontifical Solemn High Requiem Mass at Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston, with the city's orchestra and choir singing Mozart's Requiem setting.[tpl]cite news|title=Boston Symphony Plays for Requiem Honoring Kennedy|first=John H.|last=Fenton|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 20, 1964|page=1[/tpl]
There was no formal eulogy at the Low Requiem Mass. (The first presidential funeral to feature a formal eulogy was that of L.B.J. in 1973.)[tpl]cite news|title=Eternal flame burns at Kennedy gravesite|last=Spivak|first=Alvin|agency=United Press International|date=November 26, 1963|quote=At the mass, the Most Reverend Philip Hannan, auxiliary bishop of Washington, read from the fallen president's inaugural address and from his favorite biblical passages.

Hannan, decided to read selections from Kennedy's writings and speeches. The readings included a passage from the third chapter of Ecclesiastes: "There is an appointed time for everything...a time to be born and a time to die...a time to love and a time to hate...a time of war and a time of peace." He then concluded his remarks by reading Kennedy's entire Inaugural Address.[tpl]harvnb|United Press International|American Heritage Magazine|1964|p=142[/tpl]
Jacqueline Kennedy requested that Luigi Vena sing Georges Bizet's "Agnus Dei", as he had at her wedding to John F. Kennedy ten years prior. Instead, he was told to sing Pie Jesu and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria after the offertory.[tpl]cite book|last=Manchester|first=William|year=1967|title=The Death of A President|location=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|page=548|authorlink=William Manchester[/tpl] For a few moments, she lost her composure and sobbed as this music filled the cathedral.

===Burial===

The casket was borne again by caisson on the final leg to Arlington National Cemetery for burial.[tpl]harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=96[/tpl] Moments after the casket was carried down the front steps of the cathedral, Jacqueline Kennedy whispered to her son, after which he saluted his father's coffin;[tpl]cite news|title=A little soldier's salute|last=Andrews|first=Robert M|agency=United Press International|date=November 25, 1963[/tpl] the image, taken by photographer Stan Stearns,[tpl]cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=Stan Stearns, 76; Captured a Famous Salute|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2012|page=B10|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/us/stan-stearns-who-caught-jfk-jrs-salute-on-film-dies-at-76.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print[/tpl] became an iconic representation of the 1960s. The children were deemed to be too young to attend the final burial service, so this was the point where the children said goodbye to their father.[tpl]cite news|title=Mrs. Kennedy Maintains a Stoic Dignity Throughout Final Hours of Public Grief|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=5|first=Anthony|last=Lewis|authorlink=Anthony Lewis[/tpl]
Virtually everyone else followed the caisson in a long line of black limousines passing by the Lincoln Memorial and crossing the Potomac River. Many of the military units did not participate in the burial service and left just after crossing the Potomac.[tpl]harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1971|p=210[/tpl] Because the line of cars taking the foreign dignitaries was long, the last cars carrying the dignitaries left St. Matthew's as the procession entered the cemetery.[tpl]cite news|title=Funeral Traffic Delays Leaders|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=8|author=United Press International[/tpl] The burial services had already begun when the last car arrived.[tpl]cite news|title=America Buries a Martyred President|date=November 26, 1963|first=Merriman|last=Smith|authorlink=Albert Merriman Smith|agency=United Press International|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=1[/tpl] Security guards walked beside the cars carrying the dignitaries, with the one carrying the French president having the most—10.
At the end of the burial services, the widow lit an eternal flame to burn continuously over his grave. At 3:34 p.m. EST, the casket containing his remains was lowered into the earth as "Kennedy slipped out of mortal sight—out of sight but not out of heart and mind." Kennedy thus became only the second president to be buried at Arlington, after William Howard Taft, which meant that, at that time, the two most recent presidents to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda were buried at Arlington.[tpl]harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=149[/tpl] Kennedy was buried at Arlington exactly two weeks to the day he last visited there, when he came for Veterans Day observances.[tpl]cite news|title=Kennedy Visited Arlington Nov. 11|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=10|author=Associated Press[/tpl]
