==Reception==

IGN gave Midnight Bowling for WiiWare a 4.9/10, highly praising the presentation and Party Mode, but felt Gameloft "dropped the ball" with the controls, citing an "awful swing mechanic" that leaves it "almost impossible to roll the ball consistently and successfully".IGN: Midnight Bowling Review WiiWare World gave it a 2/10, citing the same control issues as IGN and stating it "throws everything Wii Sports did so well control-wise out of the window, replacing it with its own very weird control scheme"EU WiiWare Update: Midnight Bowling and Potpourrii that may leave the player "wondering if this is some sort of cartoonish bowling inspired game that is not really bowling".WiiWare World Midnight Bowling Review
