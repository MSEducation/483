Kerry Lee Wood (born June 16, 1977) is a retired American Major League Baseball pitcher. During his career he played for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees. Wood first came to prominence as a twenty-year old rookie when he recorded twenty strikeouts in a one-hit shutout against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest single-game pitching performance in Major League Baseball history.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/22206628/happy-15th-anniversary-kerry-woods-20-strikeout-gamehttp://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/24585/kerry-wood-and-the-greatest-game-pitched The game also made Wood the co-holder of the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game (20), and earned Wood the nickname Kid K. He was later named the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year. Wood would go on to record over 200 strikeouts in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003, and holds several MLB strikeout records.
Though he struggled with injuries throughout his career, Wood was twice named an All-Star.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=134268#gameType='R'&sectionType=career&statType=2&season=2012&level='ALL' |title=Kerry Wood Stats, Video Highlights, Photos, Bio |publisher=mlb.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-05-18[/tpl] Wood transitioned to a relief pitching in 2007 due to continued struggles with injuries, ultimately reviving his career as a closer. During his career Wood was placed on the disabled list 14 times in 13 major league seasons, which included missing the entire 1999 season due to Tommy John surgery. After a slow start to the 2012 season, Wood retired on May 18, 2012.http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/chicago-cubs-pitcher-kerry-wood-retire-051812

==Early life==

Wood became a phenomenon while attending MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, for his first three seasons of high school baseball. He continued his domination of batters at Grand Prairie High School in his final season as a high school player.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=134268 |title=The Official Site of The Chicago Cubs: Team: Player Information : Biography and Career Highlights |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl]

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs===

====1995-1997====

The Chicago Cubs drafted Wood as the fourth overall selection in the 1995 Amateur Draft. He spent three years playing in the Minor Leagues. His best season in the Minors came in 1996, when he posted a 10-2 record for the Daytona Cubs.[tpl]cite web|work=The Baseball Cube|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/W/kerry-wood.shtml|title=Kerry Wood - Pitching Statistics|accessdate=August 5, 2007[/tpl] He also played for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.  In 1997 he led all minor league pitchers in walks, with 131.[tpl]cite web|url=http://minors.baseball-reference.com/pitch_leaders.cgi?yid=1997&lvl=&lid=&sort=BB |title=Batting Leaders - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Minors.baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl]

====1998====

Wood made his first appearance in the Major Leagues on April 12, 1998. In his fifth career start, on May 6, he threw a one-hit, no walk, 20-strikeout shutout against the Houston Astros, tying Roger Clemens' record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson's single-game rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980.  Wood allowed only two baserunners: Ricky Gutiérrez on an infield single and Craig Biggio on a hit by pitch. Gutiérrez's single, off third baseman Kevin Orie's glove, was close enough that some fans lobbied to have it changed in scoring to an error, which would have given Wood a no-hitter. Regardless, it was one of the most dominating pitching performances in major league history, garnering a game score of 105 – the highest number ever calculated for a pitcher in a nine-inning game.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/sports/playmagazine/0603play-wood.html?ref=sports|work=The New York Times|title=My Right Arm|first=Buzz|last=Bissinger|date=June 3, 2007|accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN199805060.shtml|work=baseball-reference.com|title=Wednesday, May 6, 1998, 1:20, Wrigley Field|date=May 6, 1998|accessdate=May 13, 2013[/tpl]
Wood finished the 1998 season with a 13–6 record; despite missing the last month of the season with elbow soreness, he easily won the National League Rookie of the Year award. He pitched one game in the playoffs, losing against the Atlanta Braves.

====1999–2003====

During spring training of 1999, Wood underwent Tommy John surgery to repair damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, missing the entire season.
Wood returned in 2000 and struggled to an 8–7 record, but the following season, he returned to form. In 2001, Wood went 12-6 with a 3.36 ERA. The following season, Wood finished 12–11 with a 3.67 ERA, but perhaps more important was the fact he did not miss a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched and 33 starts. He rang up 217 strikeouts in both seasons.
In 2003, Wood continued to improve, setting career highs with 266 strikeouts, 14 wins (as part of a 14–11 record), a 3.20 ERA, and two shutouts. He threw the fastest fastball in the majors among starters, averaging 95.4 miles per hour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=4&season=2003&month=0 |title=Major League Leaderboards » 2003 » Pitchers » Pitch Type Statistics | FanGraphs Baseball |publisher=Fangraphs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl]  He also walked 100 batters and surrendered 24 home runs, also career highs, but was selected as a National League All-Star and helped lead the Cubs to the playoffs as one half of "Chicago Heat" along with fellow pitcher Mark Prior.
Wood earned two wins in the Divisional Series against the Atlanta Braves and was the starter in Game 3 of the 2003 National League Championship Series, which the Cubs won in extra innings. However, the Cubs lost in seven games to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In the decisive Game 7, Wood hit the first home run by a pitcher in an NLCS game since another Cub, Rick Sutcliffe, did so in Game 1 in 1984. However, the Marlins won the game 9-6. Wood was the losing pitcher and the Cubs were eliminated.

====2004–2006====

Wood went just 8-9 during the 2004 season and was sidelined for nearly two months with a strained triceps.
In 2005, Wood continued to struggle. On August 31, 2005, Wood underwent surgery and missed the remainder of the season. During Spring Training in 2006, Wood suffered several injuries which required an additional surgery (on his knee). On May 18, 2006, Wood returned to the Cubs' pitching rotation when he started and lost a home game against the Washington Nationals. In June, Wood returned to the DL with a sore shoulder. The following month, the Cubs announced that Wood had sustained a partially torn rotator cuff which was likely to keep him from pitching again for the rest of the year. At the end of the 2006 season, the Cubs exercised their option on Wood's contract and bought out the remaining $13M.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070328&content_id=1863890&vkey=spt2007news&fext=.jsp |title=Wood determined to get back on mound|publisher= MLB.com|author=Muskat Carrie |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-05-18[/tpl]

====2007–2008====

With his long history of injuries and inability to stay in the starting rotation, Wood accepted the Cubs' offer to return as a relief pitcher in 2007. Wood attempted to sustain a regular throwing schedule and appearances during Spring Training games. However, Wood was placed on the 15-day DL with soreness in his elbow and was then moved to the 60-day DL. Wood considered retiring if he continued to have pain in his throwing arm.[tpl]cite news|last=Costa |first=Brian |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304023804575566521474628274.html?mod=WSJ_NY_Sports_LEFT_LEADNewsCollection |title=The Long Walk From Chicago |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl] He began playing catch on May 21.

Wood was a major contributor to the Cub's NL Central Division Championship down the stretch in late September, earning a win and 8 holds. Wood filed for free-agency on November 11, 2007, though he suggested that he wanted to remain in pinstripes for the 2008 season. Despite multi-year offers from other teams, Wood agreed to a one year, $4.2 million deal with the Cubs.[tpl]cite web|last=Muskat|first=Carrie|title=Wood to return with Cubs in 2008|work=MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=2007-11-26|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071126&content_id=2307408&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc|accessdate=2007-11-26[/tpl]
