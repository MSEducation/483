Savage River is a national park in Tasmania (Australia), 233Â km northwest of Hobart. It is the largest undisturbed area of temperate rainforest in Australia.
The Savage River National Park was created as part of the Regional Forestry Agreement in 1999 to allow natural processes to continue undisturbed, consequently visitors will find there are no recreational facilities or developments inside the reserve. The reserve is approximately 5% of the greater Tarkine area, and is a habitat rich in tiger snakes and very heavily leech infested.
