[tpl]nihongo|Excel Saga|エクセル♥サーガ|Ekuseru Sāga[/tpl] is a manga series written and illustrated by Rikdo Koshi. It has been serialized in Young King OURs since 1995, and its individual chapters were collected and published in tankōbon volumes by Shōnen Gahosha. The series follows the attempts of Across, a "secret ideological organization," to conquer the city of Fukuoka as a first step towards world domination. The titular character of the series, Excel, is a key member of the group working towards this goal, while the city is defended by a shadowy government agency led by Dr. Kabapu.
The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Victor Entertainment, which was taglined [tpl]nihongo|Quack Experimental Animation|へっぽこ実験アニメーション|Heppoko Jikken Animēshon[/tpl]. Directed by Shinichi Watanabe and featuring animation from J.C.Staff, the series premiered on TV Tokyo in 1999. TV Tokyo only aired twenty-five of the series' twenty-six episodes, with the finale having been intentionally made too violent and obscene for public broadcast. As such, it was only included in the DVD release of the series, although it has since been broadcast in other markets.
The series has enjoyed some critical success coupled with respectable sales.

==Plot==

Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world. The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and officers Excel and Hyatt. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who is also their emergency food supply, and are later joined by Elgala, another Across officer. Living in the neighboring apartment are three guys:  Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, and other building dwellers such as co-worker Matsuya, and later Ropponmatsu, who all work for the Department of City Security under Dr. Kabapu, who intends to stop Across. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.

==Production==

The series was created by Rikdo Koshi and based on a dojinshi he had previously created while in high school named [tpl]nihongo|Municipal Force Daitenzin|市立戦隊ダイテンジン|Shiritsu Sentai Daitenjin[/tpl]. Excel Saga was created as an evolution of Daitenzin in order to develop the character of Excel, as well as to laugh off the vision of a depressed and pessimistic view of the world.[tpl]cite news|title=Interview with Rikdo Koshi|work=Excel Saga DVD Volume 5|publisher=ADV Films[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/anime-expo-press-panel-koushi-rikudo_article_86057.html|title=Anime Expo - Press Panel with Koushi Rikudo|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=December 28, 2009[/tpl] Excel Saga is set in Fukuoka City and the names of characters and organisations are derived from local locations and buildings.[tpl]cite book|title=Excel Saga vol.2|last=Koshi|first=Rikdo |authorlink=Rikdo Koshi|year=2003|publisher=Viz media|isbn=1-56931-989-8 |page=202[/tpl]
Victor Entertainment contacted Shōnen Gahosha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the two companies approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was "conveyed just as words," and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the "swirling, talking cosmos." He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that "Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan".[tpl]cite journal| author=Unattributed|date=November 2002|title=Interview with Excel Saga director Shinichi Watanabe|journal=Newtype USA|volume=1|issue=1|pages=84–8[/tpl] The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted as long as they kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=293|accessdate=December 8, 2009|date=June 17, 2002|title=Review - Excel Saga DVD 1|last= Crandol |first=Mike|publisher=Anime News Network[/tpl] Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen to play the role of Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that "she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond." He also says, "at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting "amazing" and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.

==Reception==

Since its August 2003 release in North America, the manga has been among the 50 top-selling graphic novels on three occasions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/3875.html |title=Top 50 Graphic Novels Actual--October 2003 |publisher=ICv2.com |accessdate=December 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/4106.html|title=Top 50 Graphic Novels Actual--December 2003|publisher=ICv2.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/4432.html|title=Top 100 Graphic Novels Actual--February 2004|publisher=ICv2.com |accessdate=December 28, 2009[/tpl] 
The English-language reviews of the Excel Saga anime were broadly positive and enthusiastic. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network puts it in the same class as Airplane!, National Lampoon, Tex Avery, and Monty Python, adding that the "combination of character-based humor, outrageous slapstick farce, and a plot that is engaging if only for how weird it is make for a thoroughly enjoyable comedic experience".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=293 |accessdate=June 1, 2006|date=June 17, 2002|title=Review - Excel Saga DVD 1|last=Crandol|first=Mike|publisher=Anime News Network[/tpl] A contrary opinion is expressed by Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict, who says the series is "occasionally clever and funny," but that "much of it is gratingly obnoxious".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/excelsagacoll.php|title=Review - Excel Saga: Imperfect Collection|last=Pearce|first=Joel|date=September 9, 2004|accessdate=June 20, 2006|publisher=DVD Verdict[/tpl] Many reviewers express displeasure with middle and later episodes, saying they were "more of the same," that they had stale humor, that they were tiresome, or even painfully unfunny.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=4445|title=Excel Saga #5: Secrets and Lies (2000)|last=Cunningham|first=Joel|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|date=February 24, 2003|accessdate=June 3, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=390 |accessdate=June 1, 2006|date=January 14, 2001|title=Review - Excel Saga DVD 4|last=Crandol|first=Mike|publisher=Anime News Network[/tpl] Episodes fourteen through sixteen, starring the Ropponmatsus, bear the brunt of this criticism, but several reviewers consider episode seventeen, Animation USA, to be one of the best.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2003/02/reviews/02/|date= February 2003|last=Arnold|first=Adam|publisher= Animefringe|title = Animefringe Reviews: Excel Saga Vol.4: Doing Whatever It Takes|accessdate=June 12, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=4124|title=Excel Saga #4: Doing Whatever It Takes (2000)|last=Cunningham|first=Joel|publisher= Digitally Obsessed|date=January 13, 2001|accessdate=June 12, 2006[/tpl]
Reviewers also agree that the series suffers from too much filler in its later episodes, with Crandol describing the show as spinning its wheels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=442 |accessdate=June 1, 2006|date=March 10, 2003|title=Review - Excel Saga DVD 5 |last = Crandol|first=Mike|publisher=Anime News Network[/tpl] Yegulalp reserves his harshest words for the unaired Going Too Far, calling it "pure, idiotic, wretched excess." He goes on to say that the episode has "the feeling of trying to deliberately enrage the audience by resorting to the only tactics left: genuinely offensive subject matter." Joel Cunningham at Digitally Obsessed disagrees, saying that the episode succeeds just in time, "with one of the series' funnier sight gags".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=4714|title=Excel Saga #6: Going Way Too Far (2000)|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|date=April 8, 2003| last=Cunningham|first=Joel|accessdate=June 3, 2006[/tpl]
The series generally receives high marks for technical aspects. Cunningham feels the animation is flat-out gorgeous, but Crandol considers it merely above average. In the latter's opinion, its quality wanes as the series progresses and increasingly relies on super-deforming the characters for comedic effect.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=3856|title=Excel Saga #1: The Weirdness Begins (1999)|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|date=January 14, 2001|last=Cunningham|first=Joel|accessdate=June 6, 2003[/tpl] ADV's release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly the Vid-Notes). Reviewers especially appreciated the English voice acting: Crandol calls it brilliant, and several note that Calvello and Wolcott were each able to capture Mitsuishi's Excel. Pearce, in contrast, found the English cast to be pretty bad and its Excel to be "dental drill shrill".
Akadot's reviewer of the manga writes that "some of the strange events go on a little too long and do not have the impact that they do animated," but that Rikdo's Excel Saga is "graced with fantastic visuals and a hilarious story," and that the English edition is "a masterpiece of the translator's skill."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.akadot.com/article.php?a=129 | title = Excel Saga | publisher = Akadot | date=September 16, 2003 | accessdate = June 3, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404172828/http://www.akadot.com/article.php?a=129 |archivedate=April 4, 2004[/tpl] Barb Lien-Cooper from Comic World News concurs that the manga cannot keep pace with the anime, but she finds Excel herself to be wittier in the manga and that the manga's plots make more sense than the anime's.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comicworldnews.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?column=reviews&page=84|last=Lien-Cooper|first=Barb|title=Excel Saga Volume 3 | publisher=Comic World News|accessdate=June 29, 2003[/tpl] A reviewer of the French edition also praises Rikdo's work, noting that it is an "...easy read without problems of clarity".Full quotation [tpl]fr icon[/tpl]: "En ce qui concerne la mise en page, celle-ci est particulièrement dynamique avec un enchaînement impressionnant de cases les unes sur les autres et qui laissent, malgré le nombre, une lecture facile et sans problèm de clarté."
