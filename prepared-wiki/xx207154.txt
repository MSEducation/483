The album was produced by former band member Jon English.
Four Moments features dramatic arrangements, seamlessly flowing with its impeccable musicianship displaying influences of European progressive rock bands Genesis, King Crimson, Focus and Yes. Millo, in a 2002 interview, reflected on the creation of the album:
[tpl]quote|"I began conceiving the various melodic phrases over a period of time and became excited by the idea of writing and ultimately performing an orchestral style piece. I knew I was on to something special and I wanted the world hear it. Sebastian Hardie was the perfect band for this ... At rehearsals we then took the ideas and began to assemble them, it wasn't long before we were ready to perform what was to become the 'Four Moments' album."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.progressor.net/interview/mario_millo.html |publisher=ProgressoR |title=Mario Millo interview |date=2002-05-21 |accessdate=2008-07-25 [/tpl]|Mario Millo|2002-05-21[/tpl]
According to Millo: "Glories Shall Be Released" was partly inspired by a boyhood friend's drug experiences - his distorted sense of reality and subsequent suicide, "Rosanna" was named for Millo's older sister who was an emotional support, and "Openings" evolved from the band's jamming.
