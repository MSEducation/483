The women's 100 metres at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Luzhniki Stadium on 11–12 August.Start list
In the first round, English Gardner ran away from her third heat with a 10.94.  It only took 11.41 to make the semifinal round.  The semis were decidedly faster, the first semi was slowest in 11.08, the other two under 11, with the fastest time qualifier Alexandria Anderson at 11.01.
In the final, there was no doubt who would win as Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce shot out of the block leaving nothing but a pink streak (hair and shoes) for her competitors to see from behind.  Her .22 victory was just short of the gap Flojo had 25 years earlier.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2390594/World-Athletics-Championships-2013-Shelly-Ann-Fraser-Pryce-wins-100m-Katarina-Johnson-Thompson-lies-sixth-heptathlon.html|title=Fraser-Pryce obliterates field to win 100m gold as Britain's Johnson-Thompson lies sixth entering second day of Heptathlon |date=12 August 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 August 2013 [/tpl]
The battle for second was close as Murielle Ahouré edged defending champion Carmelita Jeter.  Jeter's 10.94 was the same as Gardner's time in the heats.  But Gardner only had 10.97 left for the final to miss a medal.http://ibnlive.in.com/news/fraserpryce-wins-womens-100-meters-at-world-championships/413776-5-138.html  Slow reacting Kerron Stewart gave up .06 at the start line but lost the silver medal by only .04.http://www.iaaf.org/competitions/iaaf-world-championships/14th-iaaf-world-championships-4873/results/women/100-metres/final/result#resultheader
