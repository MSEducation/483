CATEGORIES: Norfolk, Non-metropolitan counties, Kingdom of East Anglia

Norfolk [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔr|f|ə|k[/tpl] is a low-lying county in the East of England. It has borders with Lincolnshire to the west, Cambridgeshire to the west and southwest and Suffolk to the south. Its northern and eastern boundaries are the North Sea coast and to the north-west the county is bordered by the Wash. The city of Norwich is the county town of Norfolk which is the fifth largest ceremonial county in England, with an area of 5,371 km² (2,074 sq mi).
Of the 34 non-metropolitan English counties, Norfolk is the seventh most populous, with a population of 859,400. However, as a largely rural county it has a low population density: 401 per square mile (or 155 people per square kilometre). Norfolk has about one-thirtieth the population density of central London, the tenth lowest density county in the country, with 40% of the county’s population living in the four major built up areas of Norwich (213,000), Great Yarmouth (63,000), King's Lynn (46,000) and Thetford (25,000).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| work= | publisher=ONS | accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]  The Broads, a well known network of rivers and lakes, is located towards the county's east coast, extending south into Suffolk. The area has the status of a National Park and is protected by the Broads Authority.http://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/index.html Historical sites, such as those in the centre of Norwich, also contribute to tourism.

==History==

Norfolk was settled in pre-Roman times, with camps along the higher land in the west where flints could be quarried.John Barwell, n.d. "A History of Norfolk." A Brythonic tribe, the Iceni, inhabited the county from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD. The Iceni revolted against the Roman invasion in 47 AD, and again in 60 AD led by Boudica. The crushing of the second rebellion opened the county to the Romans. During the Roman era in Norfolk roads and ports were constructed throughout the county and farming took place.
Situated on the east coast, Norfolk was vulnerable to invasion from Scandinavia and Northern Europe, and forts were built to defend against the Angles and Saxons. By the 5th century the Angles, after whom East Anglia and England itself are named, had established control of the region and later became the "north folk" and the "south folk", hence, "Norfolk" and "Suffolk". Norfolk, Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia, which later merged with Mercia and then Wessex. The influence of the Early English settlers can be seen in the many place names ending in "-ton", and "-ham". Endings such as "-by" or "-thorpe" are also common, indicating Danish place names: in the 9th century the region again came under attack, this time from Danes who killed the king, Edmund the Martyr. In the centuries before the Norman Conquest the wetlands of the east of the county began to be converted to farmland, and settlements grew in these areas. Migration into East Anglia must have been high as by the time of the Conquest and Domesday Book survey it was one of the most densely populated parts of the British Isles. During the high and late Middle Ages the county developed arable agriculture and woollen industries. Norfolk's prosperity at that time is evident from the county's large number of mediaeval churches: of an original total of over one thousand, 659 survive, more than in the whole of the rest of Great Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Medieval-Churches-in-Norfolk |title=Medieval Churches in Norfolk :: Geograph Britain and Ireland |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2013[/tpl] The economy was in decline by the time of the Black Death, which dramatically reduced the population in 1349. Over one-third of the population of Norwich died during a plague epidemic in 1579.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_salisbury.shtml |title=Voices of the Powerless: Boils and Buboes|date=29 August 2002 |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |accessdate=3 November 2008[/tpl] By the 16th century Norwich had grown to become the second largest city in England, but in 1665 the Great Plague again killed around one third of the population.Anon, 2002. Norfolk History. During the English Civil War Norfolk was largely Parliamentarian. The economy and agriculture of the region declined somewhat. During the Industrial Revolution Norfolk developed little industry except in Norwich and was a late addition to the railway network.
In the 20th century the county developed a role in aviation. The first development in airfields came with the First World War; there was then a massive expansion during the Second World War with the growth of the Royal Air Force and the influx of the American USAAF 8th Air Force which operated from many Norfolk Airfields. During the Second World War agriculture rapidly intensified, and it has remained very intensive since with the establishment of large fields for growing cereals and oil seed rape.
Norfolk's low-lying land and easily eroded cliffs, many of which are chalk and clay, make it vulnerable to the sea, the most recent major event being the North Sea flood of 1953. The low-lying section of coast between Kelling and Lowestoft Ness in Suffolk is currently managed by the Environment Agency to protect the Broads from sea flooding. Management policy for the North Norfolk coastline is described in the North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan which was published in 2006 but has yet to be accepted by the local authorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.north-norfolk.gov.uk/coastal/default_5265.asp|title=Shoreline Management Plan|publisher=north-norfolk.org|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608020113/http://www.north-norfolk.gov.uk/coastal/default_5265.asp  |archivedate = 8 June 2008[/tpl] The Shoreline Management Plan states that the stretch of coast will be protected for at least another 50 years, but that in the face of sea level rise and post-glacial lowering of land levels in the South East, there is an urgent need for further research to inform future management decisions, including the possibility that the sea defences may have to be realigned to a more sustainable position. Natural England have contributed some research into the impacts on the environment of various realignment options. The draft report of their research was leaked to the press, who created great anxiety by reporting that Natural England plan to abandon a large section of the Norfolk Broads, villages and farmland to the sea to save the rest of the Norfolk coastline from the impact of climate change.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article3642929.ece|work=The Times |location=London |title=Climate change: surrender a slab of Norfolk, say conservationists|first=Valerie|last=Elliott|date=29 March 2008|accessdate=14 May 2008 [/tpl]

==Economy and industry==

In 1998 Norfolk had a Gross Domestic Product of £9,319 million, making it 1.5% of England's economy and 1.25% of the United Kingdom's economy. The GDP per head was £11,825, compared to £13,635 for East Anglia, £12,845 for England and £12,438 for the United Kingdom. In 1999–2000 the county had an unemployment rate of 5.6%, compared to 5.8% for England and 6.0% for the UK.Office for National Statistics, 2001. Regional Trends 26 ch:14.7 (PDF). Accessed 3 January 2006.
Important business sectors include tourism, energy (oil, gas and renewables), advanced engineering and manufacturing, and food and farming.
Much of Norfolk's fairly flat and fertile land has been drained for use as arable land. The principal arable crops are sugar beet, wheat, barley (for brewing) and oil seed rape. The county also boasts a saffron grower.Norfolk saffron Retrieved 13 March 2014 Over 20% of employment in the county is in the agricultural and food industries.Invest in Norfolk, Agriculture and Food.
Well-known companies in Norfolk are Aviva (formerly Norwich Union), Colman's (part of Unilever) and Bernard Matthews Farms. The Construction Industry Training Board is based on the former airfield of RAF Bircham Newton. The BBC East region is centred on Norwich, although it covers an area as far west as Milton Keynes; the BBC does however provide BBC Radio Norfolk solely for the county.
New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership has been recently established by business leaders to help grow jobs across Norfolk and Suffolk. They have secured an enterprise zone to help grow businesses in the energy sector and established the two counties as being a centre for growing services and products for the green economy.
To help local industry in Norwich, Norfolk, the local council offered a wireless internet service but this has now been withdrawn following the end of the funding period.Hayes Computing Solutions (HCOMS) ::[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===

Norfolk has a completely comprehensive state education system, with secondary school age from 11 to 16 or in some schools with sixth forms, 18 years old. In many of the rural areas, there is no nearby sixth form and so sixth form colleges are found in larger towns. There are twelve independent, or private schools, including Gresham's School in Holt in the north of the county, Thetford Grammar School in Thetford which is Britain's fifth oldest extant school, Langley School in Loddon, and several in the city of Norwich itself, namely Norwich School and Norwich High School for Girls. The King's Lynn district has the largest school population. Norfolk is also home to Wymondham College, the UK's largest remaining state boarding school.

===Tertiary education===

The University of East Anglia is located on the outskirts of Norwich and Norwich University of the Arts is based in seven buildings in and around St George's Street in the city centre, next to the River Wensum.
The City College Norwich and the College of West Anglia are colleges covering Norwich and King's Lynn as well as Norfolk as a whole. Easton College, [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] west of Norwich, provides agriculture-based courses for the county, parts of Suffolk and nationally.
University Campus Suffolk also run higher education courses in Norfolk, from multiple locations including Great Yarmouth College.University Campus Suffolk-Great Yarmouth college Retrieved 30 June 2011

==Politics==

===Local===

Norfolk is under the control of Norfolk County Council and is also divided into seven local government districts, Breckland District, Broadland District, Great Yarmouth Borough, King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, North Norfolk District, Norwich City and South Norfolk District. As of 2014 the Conservatives control five of the six districts outside Norwich, while Norwich and Great Yarmouth are controlled by Labour.
The county is traditionally a stronghold for the Conservatives, who have always won at least 50% of Norfolk's constituencies since 1979. The countryside is mostly solid Conservative territory, with a few areas being strong for the Liberal Democrats. From 1995 to 2007, South Norfolk was run by the Liberal Democrats but the district switched back to the Conservatives in a landslide in 2007.
Norfolk's urban areas are more mixed, although Norwich and central parts of Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn are strong for the Labour Party. This said, Labour's dominance in Norwich has recently been stemmed by the Green Party, who are now the official opposition on Norwich City Council and also hold several divisions within the city on Norfolk County Council.
Norfolk County Council, which was under Conservative control since 1997, became under no overall control following the 2013 election which resulted in 20 seats being lost by the Conservatives and 14 gained by UKIP. There are currently 40 Conservative councillors, 15 UKIP, 14 Labour, 10 Liberal Democrats, 4 Green Party and one independent.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21840020 | work=BBC News | title=Norfolk council results | date=29 April 2013[/tpl]  Although it had been expected for the Conservatives to form a minority administration or seek a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, both scenarios failed to materialise. Eventually, a rainbow alliance between Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and UKIP was formed, with the cabinet comprising solely of Labour and Liberal Democrats.

===Norwich Unitary Authority dispute===

In October 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a Local Government White Paper inviting councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007 Norwich submitted its proposal, which was rejected in December 2007 as it did not meet the criteria for acceptance. In February 2008, the Boundary Committee for England (from 1 April 2010 incorporated in the Local Government Boundary Commission for England) was asked to consider alternative proposals for the whole or part of Norfolk, including whether Norwich should become a unitary authority, separate from Norfolk County Council. In December 2009, the Boundary Committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of Norfolk, including Norwich.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=3679 |title=Local Government White Paper, Strong and Prosperous Communities |publisher=Norfolk County Council |accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norwich.gov.uk/site_files/pages/City_Council__Unitary_Council__The_business_case.html |title=The business case for unitary Norwich |publisher=Norwich City Council |accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1509022 |title=Proposals for future unitary structures: Stakeholder consultation |publisher=Communities and Local Government |accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lgbce.org.uk/__documents/lgbce-documents/draftfinal-reports-and-consultation-papers/2009/norfolk-sr-final-dec09.pdf |title=Our advice to the Secretary of State on unitary local government in Norfolk (PDF Document) |publisher=The Boundary Committee |date=7 December 2009[/tpl]

Following the 2010 general election, Eric Pickles was appointed Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on 12 May 2010 in a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government. According to press reports, he instructed his department to take urgent steps to reverse the decision and maintain the status quo in line with the Conservative Party manifesto.[tpl]Cite news|title=Government chief moves to axe Norwich unitary plans |first=Shaun |last=Lowthorpe |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |date=14 May 2010 |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/content/edp24/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=xDefault&itemid=NOED13%20May%202010%2019%3A12%3A43%3A450 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/159177711|title=Pickles stops unitary councils in Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] However, the unitary plans were supported by the Liberal Democrat group on the city council, and by Simon Wright, LibDem MP for Norwich South, who intended to lobby the party leadership to allow the changes to go ahead.[tpl]Cite news|title=New bid to end unitary plans |newspaper=Yarmouth Mercury |date=17 May 2010 |url=http://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/content/yarmouthmercury/news/story.aspx?brand=GYMOnline&category=news&tBrand=GYMonline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED17%20May%202010%2009%3A50%3A04%3A040 [/tpl]
The Local Government Act 2010 to reverse the unitary decision for Norwich (and Exeter and Suffolk) received Royal Assent on 16 December 2010. The disputed award of unitary status had meanwhile been referred to the High Court, and on 21 June 2010 the court (Mr. Justice Ouseley, judge) ruled it unlawful, and revoked it. The city has therefore failed to attain permanent unitary status, and the previous two-tier arrangement of County and District Councils (with Norwich City Council counted among the latter) remains the status quo.[tpl]Cite news|title=September by-elections for Exeter and Norwich|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 July 2010|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-10687867 | date=19 July 2010[/tpl]

===Westminster===

Following the May 2010 General Election, Norfolk is represented in the House of Commons by seven Conservative Members of Parliament and two Liberal Democrats. The Labour Party have lost the urban areas of Norwich and Great Yarmouth in recent elections, leaving them with no Commons representative in East Anglia; the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke being a high level casualty in the 2010 election.

==Transport==

Norfolk is one of the few counties in England that does not have a motorway. The A11 connects Norfolk to Cambridge and London via the M11. From the west there only two routes from Norfolk that have a direct link with the A1, the A47 which runs into the East Midlands and to Birmingham via Peterborough and the A17 which runs into the East Midlands via Lincolnshire. These two routes meet at King's Lynn which is also the starting place for the A10 which provides West Norfolk with a direct link to London via Ely, Cambridge and Hertford . The Great Eastern Main Line is a major railway from London Liverpool Street Station to Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Norwich International Airport, offers flights within Europe including a link to Amsterdam which offers onward flights throughout the world.

==Dialect, accent and nickname==

The Norfolk dialect is also known as "Broad Norfolk", although over the modern age much of the vocabulary and many of the phrases have died out due to a number of factors, such as radio, TV and people from other parts of the country coming to Norfolk. As a result, the speech of Norfolk is more of an accent than a dialect, though one part retained from the Norfolk dialect is the distinctive grammar of the region.

==Tourism==

Norfolk is a popular tourist destination and has several major examples of holiday attractions. There are many seaside resorts, including some of the finest British beaches, such as those at Great Yarmouth, Waxham, Cromer and Holkham.
