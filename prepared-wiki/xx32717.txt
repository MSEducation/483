[[Middlesex County, Connecticut]]

CATEGORIES: Middlesex County, Connecticut, 1785 establishments in Connecticut, 1960 disestablishments in Connecticut

Middlesex County is a county located in the south central part of the U.S. state of Connecticut.  It was created in May 1785 from portions of Hartford County and portions of New London County.  As of 2010, the population was 165,676.
As is the case with all eight of Connecticut's counties, there is now no county government, and no county seat. In Connecticut, towns are responsible for all local government activities, including fire and rescue, snow removal, and schools. In a few cases, neighboring towns will share certain resources, e.g. water, gas, etc.  Middlesex County is merely a group of towns on a map, and no longer has any particular authority.

==Government==

Middletown was the county seat of Middlesex County from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. There is no government in Middlesex County other than the Middlesex County Judicial District. All county functions other than courts and county sheriff's departments were discontinued in 1960, and again in 2000 when the county sheriff's departments were reorganized as the State of Connecticut Judicial Marshal, due to political corruption in the county sheriff's departments. Joseph E. Bibisi was the last person ever to serve as high sheriff of Middlesex County.
