Minuscule 69 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), δ 505 (Soden),[tpl]cite book|last=Gregory|first=Caspar René|authorlink=Caspar René Gregory|title=Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testament|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/diegriechischen00greggoog#page/n61/mode/2up|year=1908|publisher=J. C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung|location=Leipzig|page=50[/tpl] known as Codex Leicester, or Codex Leicestrensis, is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament on paper and parchment leaves. The manuscript palaeographically has been assigned to the 15th century. Some leaves of the codex were lost. The text-type is  eclectic. It has been examined and collated by many palaeographers and textual critics. Although it is of late date, its text is remarkable from the point of view of textual critic. There are no marginalia. It is carelessly written with breathings and accents often given wrongly.

==Description==

===Contents===

The codex contains the entire New Testament with four lacunae (Matthew 1:1-18:15; Acts 10:45-14:17; Jude 7-25; Apocalypse 19:10-22:21) on 213 leaves ([tpl]×|37.8|27|cm[/tpl]). The text of the manuscript skips from Acts 10:45 to 14:17 without a break; possibly a scribe rewrote it from a defective manuscript. The codex is written on 91 leaves of parchment and 122 of paper.According to Scrivener 83 leaves of vellum and 130 of paper. Usually two parchment leaves are followed by three paper leaves. The paper was very poor quality.Bruce M. Metzger, "Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Palaeography", Oxford University Press, Oxford 1981, p. 138. It is so bad that four of the leaves were written only on one side.
The leaves are arranged in quarto (four leaves in quire). There are catchwords from quire to quire and the first half of each quire the leaves are numbered (2nd, 3rd, 4th).
The original order of books was: Pauline epistles, Acts of the Apostles, Catholic epistles, Revelation of John, Gospels. The Pauline epistles precede Acts of the Apostles (like in Codex Sinaiticus). This order was changed by a binder: Gospels, Pauline epistles, Acts, Catholic epistles, and Apocalypse.
The text of Rev 18:7-19:10 is a fragmentary.[ref]

It has some non-biblical additional material like: An explanation of the Creed and the Seven Councils (fol. 159v), the Lives of the Apostles (fol. 160v), Limits of the Five Patriarchates (fol. 161r) like codices 211 and 543.

It contains Prolegomena to the Hebrews, the tables of the κεφαλαια (tables of contents) precede the three later Gospels with very unusual variations, but without corresponding numbers of the κεφαλαια (chapters) at the margin. There is no division into chapters or sections, no references to the Eusebian Canons, no liturgical markings at the margin. The marginal notes are often illegible. It contains subscriptions at the end of each book. In subscriptions are given numbers of στιχοι and numbers of ρηματα.
The headings of the Gospels are titled as in codex 178 — εκ του κατα Μαρκον.[ref]

===Scribal habit===

The text is written in one column per page, 37-38 lines per page.[ref]

The writing is rather rough and inelegant. It was written by a strange hand, epsilon being recumbent and so much like alpha, that it is not clear which was intended. The accents are placed over the succeeding consonant of the vowel. "The whole style of writing resembling a careless scrawl" (Scrivener). There are numerous marginal notes written by a beautiful hand. This hand wrote words Ειμι Ιλερμου Χαρκου at the top of the first page. The hand of the corrector is nearly old as the scribe.
The name ιησους is always written at full length up to John 21:15, where we meet with ις, and in 41 other places, 19 of which are in the Acts. The nomina sacra are contracted in a usual way (δαδ, ις, κς, ουνος, ανος, χς, ιηλ, ιλημ, σηρ, πηρ, μηρ, πνα, στρος, and παρνος). The abbreviation χς (χρισος) once was used for χρηστος.
Ferrar enumerated 1129 errors of itacism in the codex: ο for ω (190 occurrences), ω for ο (126), η for ει (93), ει for η (104), ι for ει (77), ει for ι (62), η for ι (87), ι for η (46), ε for αι (73), αι for ε (72), ε for η (24), η for ε (20), υ for η (27 – rare elsewhere), η for υ (28), ου for ω (13), ω for ου (16), οι for ι (3), ι for οι (3), η for ευ (1 – in Luke 12:16), υ for ι (15), ι for υ (14), υ for η (6), υ for ε (1), υ for οι (4), υ for ει (3), οι for υ (4), οι for η (9), ο for ου (3), η for οι (3). There is also θ for τ (after σ) in Mark 10:40 and Luke 11:7.
N ephelkystikon is rarely omitted.
There are some unusual for late mediaeval manuscripts grammar forms: ειπαν (twice only – Matthew 26:35; Luke 20:2), ηλθατε (Matthew 25:36), εξηλθατε (Matthew 26:55; Mark 14:48; Luke 7:24.25.26; 22:52), εισηλθατε (all instances), ανεπεσαν (John 6:10), παραγενομενος (Luke 14:21).
In some cases the accusatives are written with ending -αν for -α, e.g. νυκταν, θυγατεραν, χειραν. The gender is sometimes altered, verbs in -αω or -οω are formed as those in -εω (e.g. επηρωτουν, Luke 3:10; 20:27; επετιμουν, Luke 18:15; ετολμουν; ερωτουν; εμβριμουμενος and others). The augment is often omitted after Luke 11:44, but all before Luke 9, and there is a double augment in ηπηντησαν (John 4:51).

==Text==

Textually codex 69 is very remarkable; it belongs to Family 13, as very important member of this group—according to some scholars even the most important. The Greek text of the Gospels of this codex is representative of the Caesarean text-type. Aland placed it in Category III. It was confirmed by the Claremont Profile Method.[ref]
</ref>
In Pauline epistles and Catholic epistles its text is a Byzantine. Aland placed it in Category V.[ref]
