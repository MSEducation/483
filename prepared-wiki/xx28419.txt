Tatra is a vehicle manufacturer in Kopřivnice, Czech Republic. The company was founded in 1850 as Schustala & Company, later renamed Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft when it became a wagon and carriage manufacturer. In 1897, Tatra produced the first motor car in central Europe, and one of the first cars in world, the Präsident automobile. In 1918, it changed its name to Kopřivnická vozovka a.s., and in 1919 started to use the Tatra badge named after the nearby  Tatra mountains in Slovakia. 
Tatra is the third oldest car maker in the world after Daimler and Peugeot.[tpl]Cite book| author=Margolius, Ivan and Henry, John G. | title=Tatra - The Legacy of Hans Ledwinka | location=Harrow | publisher=SAF | year=1990 | isbn=0-946719-06-3[/tpl] During World War II Tatra was instrumental in the production of trucks, and tank engines for the German war effort. Production of passenger cars ceased in 1999, but the company still produces a range of primarily all-wheel-drive 4×4, 6×6, 8×8, 10×10, and 12×12 trucks. The brand is mainly known as a result of the legendary Czech truck racer Karel Loprais: in 1988–2001 he won the world's hardest off-road race Dakar Rally as many as six times with the Tatra 815. At the time of his sixth victory, he was the most successful driver in the history of the Dakar.

==Early years==

Ignác Šustala (1822–1891), founder of the company in Kopřivnice, Moravia, started the production of horse-drawn vehicles in 1850. In 1891 he branched out into railroad car manufacture, naming the company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft, and employed Hugo Fischer von Roeslerstamm as technical director in 1890. After the death of Šustala, von Roeslerstamm took over running the company and in 1897 he bought a Benz automobile. Using this for inspiration, the company made its first car, the Präsident, which was exhibited in 1897 in Vienna. Orders were obtained for more cars and under the direction of engineers Hans Ledwinka and Edmund Rumpler,Wise, David Burgess. "Rumpler: One Aeroplane which Never Flew", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Vol. 17, p.1964. ten improved cars were made.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Wise says they collaborated on the original Präsident|date=February 2010[/tpl]
The first car to be totally designed by Ledwinka came in 1900 with the Type A with rear-mounted 2714 cc engine and top speed of [tpl]convert|40|km/h|mi/h[/tpl], 22 units were built. This was followed by the Type B with central engine in 1902 but then Ledwinka left the company to concentrate on steam engine development. He returned in 1905 and designed a completely new car, the Type S with 3308 cc 4-cylinder engine. Production was badly hit in 1912 with a 23-week strike and Hugo Fischer von Roeslerstam left the company.

==Tatra concept==

After World War I Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau was renamed Kopřivnická vozovka, and in 1919 the name Tatra was given to the car range. Leopold Pasching took over control and in 1921 Hans Ledwinka returned again to develop the revolutionary Tatra 11. The new car, launched in 1923 featured a rigid backbone tube with swinging semi-axles at the rear giving independent suspension. The engine, front-mounted, was an air-cooled two-cylinder unit of 1056 cc. 
The Tatra 11 was replaced in 1926 by the similar Tatra 12 which had four-wheel brakes. A further development was the 1926 Tatra 17 with a 1,930 cc water-cooled six-cylinder engine and fully independent suspension.
In 1927 the company was renamed Závody Ringhoffer-Tatra a.s..

==Prewar streamliners==

Tatra's specialty was luxury cars of a technically advanced nature, going from aircooled flat-twins to fours and sixes, culminating (briefly) with the OHC 6 litre V12 in 1931.G.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) In the 1930s, under the supervision of Austrian engineer Hans Ledwinka, his son Erich and German engineer Erich Übelacker, and protected by high tariffs and absence of foreign assemblers,G.N. Georgano. Tatra began building advanced, streamlined cars after obtaining licences from Paul Jaray, which started in 1934 with the large Tatra T77, the world's first production aerodynamic car. The average drag coefficient of a 1:5 model of the fastback Tatra T77 was recorded as 0.2455.Bohumír Mimra, 'Vývojové směry moderního automobilismu', SIA 1936, Technická práce na Ostravsku 1926 - 1936, Moravská Ostrava 1936, p. 593.  It featured (as did almost all subsequent big Tatras) a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 engine, which was in technical terms very sophisticated for the time.

==Tatra and the conception of the Volkswagen Beetle==

Both Hitler and Porsche were influenced by the Tatras.Willson, Quentin The Ultimate Classic Car Book. New Your, New York: DK Publishing Inc., 1995. ISBM 0-7894-0159-2. Pages 214-215 Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia. He had also dined numerous times with Ledwinka. After one of these dinners Hitler remarked to Porsche, "This is the car for my roads".Car Wars, Jonathan Mantle, Arcade Publishing, 1997 From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs,[tpl]cite web|title=Brief History of Tatra|url=http://www.ukcar.com/history/Tatra/index.html|work=UKCAR|accessdate=27 January 2011[/tpl] and Porsche admitted "Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine" while designing the Volkswagen. There is no doubt that the Beetle bore a striking resemblance to the Tatras, particularly the Tatra V570. The Tatra T97 of 1936 had a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat. Another similarity between this Tatra and the Beetle is the central structural tunnel. Tatra launched a lawsuit, but this was stopped when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Tatra was forced to stop producing the T97. The matter was re-opened after World War II and in 1961 Volkswagen paid Ringhoffer-Tatra 3,000,000 Deutsche Marks in an out of court settlement.

==War years==

After the 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, Tatras continued in production, largely because Germans liked the cars. Many German officers met their deaths driving heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle. At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the 'Czech Secret Weapon' for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel; at one point official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving Tatras.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0%2C28804%2C1658545_1658498_1657833%2C00.html|title=1961 Corvair/Rear-engine cars|accessdate=2008-06-10|work=time.com | date=2007-09-07[/tpl]

==Postwar management==

The factory was nationalised in 1945 almost three years before the Communist Party came to power and renamed to Tatra Národní Podnik. Although production of prewar models continued, a new model, the Tatra T600 Tatraplan was designed—the name celebrating the new Communist planned economy and the aeroplane inspiration (Colloq. Czech: aeroplán). It went into production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the Skoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, leaving Tatra free to concentrate on trucks, buses and railway equipment.

==The Tatra T603==

A mere three years later, amid much dissatisfaction among officialdom about the poor-quality official cars imported from Russia, Tatra was again given permission to produce a luxury car, the Tatra T603. A fair successor to the prewar cars, it was also driven by a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 and had the company's trademark aerodynamic styling. Uniquely, the Tatra T603 featured three headlights, and the first prototypes had a central rear stabilising fin, though this was lost for production. It was also fitted with almost American-style thick chrome bumpers with bullets (a.k.a. Dagmar bumpers). Almost entirely hand-built, Tatras were not for everybody; normal citizens could not buy them. They were reserved for Party elites, communist officials, factory presidents and other notables, as well as being exported to most other communist nations as official cars. Even Cuban president Fidel Castro had a white Tatra T603, custom-fitted with air conditioning.
Tatra T603s were built until 1975, a twenty-year era as one of Communism's finest cars. Numerous improvements were made over this time, but not all the new cars built in this period were actually new but rather reconditioned. When a new Tatra replaced an old, the old vehicle was returned to the factory. There, it was upgraded to modern condition, refinished, dubbed new and sent out again as a putatively new vehicle to replace another older Tatra. This makes it hard to trace the history of surviving vehicles.

==1970s makeover—the Tatra T613==

In 1968 a replacement was developed; the Tatra T613. It was styled by the Italian styling house of Vignale and was a more modern, less rounded shape. It was not until 1973 that the car went into production, and volume production did not begin until the following year. Although the layout remained the same, the body was all new, as was the engine, being equipped with four overhead camshafts, a higher capacity motor (3495 cc) and an output close to [tpl]convert|165|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. In addition, it had been moved somewhat forward for improved balance. These cars were built in five series and went through several modifications until production ceased in 1996. It is a tribute to Vignale's styling that they did not look dated until rather late in that time period. Over 11,000 cars were built, and sales slowed to a trickle of just a few dozen per year towards the end of production as Tatras began to seem more and more outdated.

==1990s Tatra T700==

The Tatra T700 was a large luxury car released in 1996 by Tatra, essentially a heavily restyled version of the Tatra T613 model it replaced.
The T700 was offered as both a saloon and coupé with either a 3.5 or 4.4 litre 90° air-cooled V8 petrol engine.
The model was neither successful nor produced in large numbers, and production halted in 1999. The T700 was the last passenger car made by Tatra, which then concentrated on commercial vehicles.

==1990s Tatra MTX V8==

The Tatra MTX V8 was the fastest Czech car of all time. Production started in 1991 in Kopřivnice. Under the hood lies a Tatra 623 V8 motor, injection version making 225 kW at 6500 rpm. 0–100 km/h will take 5.6 seconds. Maximum speed is 265 km/h. It is the work of legendary Czech designer Václav Král. Only 5 units of this car were ever produced.

==Tatra in the West==

Unlike most Soviet Bloc manufacturers, Tatra enjoyed modest sales success in Western Europe, where its truck line had a reputation for simplicity and durability. No effort was made to distribute Tatra's unusual automobiles in the West, though a small number did find their way to collectors in Western Europe, and even to the United States. The fall of the Soviet Union did not help Tatra's fortunes, as the company made no inroads in Western Europe's already crowded automobile market. Worse, the introduction of competitors, such as Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot into the Czech Republic, further eroded Tatra's sales. Production of the T700 ended in 1999.
Among western collectors Tatra automobiles remain largely unknown. The largest display of Tatra vehicles in the United States is at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. The museum's eclectic automobile collection contains 12 Tatra models, including a T-613 ambulance. When talk show host and car collector Jay Leno visited the museum, the founder picked him up in a 1947 Tatra T-87, prompting Leno to purchase one himself. Leno soon become an advocate for the brand. In the United States the few Tatra clubs are closely associated with Citroen clubs, as many Tatra collectors also collect Citroën DS series cars.
A Tatra T87 is on exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

==Trucks==

===1898–1914 Beginning===

The first truck manufactured at Kopřivnice in 1898Tatra history milestones[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] was a flatbed[tpl]cite web|last=Prospector |first=Gold |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitty1948/2447261277/ |title=Picture of replica first Tatra truck |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2008-04-27 |accessdate=2010-09-16[/tpl] with 2 liquid-cooled side-by-side-mounted two-cylinder Benz engines each at 2.7 L capacity with total power output of 8.8 kW (12 hp) placed after the rear axle and cargo capacity of 2.5 ton. The unique feature of the engines setup was that the engines could be operated sequentially depending on the load requirements. No 1 engine was started via a cranking handle and had a flywheel attached and No 2 engine without the flywheel  was connected via a gear clutch and started by the first engine already running.
The second truck manufactured was once again a flatbed R type of 2.5 ton cargo capacity built in 1909. Powered by liquid-cooled petrol four-cylinder engine of 4.1 L capacity and power output of 18.4 kW (25 hp) with the engine placed above front axle which is the conventional design to this day. The vehicle featured solid rubber tyres and semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension.
In 1910 Tatra manufactured its first bus the Omnibus type SO with total production of 5 units.

===1914–1922 Serial Production===

The first true serial truck production at Tatra was instigated by the beginning of World War I. In the year 1914 there were only 2 trucks made, type T 14/40 HP, however by the 1915 end the production jumped to the total of 105 TL-2 units and the following year 1916 the numbers rose to total of 196 TL-2 and 30 TL-4 truthe time peaked in 1917 with 19 TL-2 and 303 TL-4 models, after that production declined and the similar amount of vehicles of one type manufactured in a year was not achieved or surpassed until 1936 with the T 27 model.
Technically models TL-2 and TL-4 were almost identically designed, in fact TL-4 evolved from TL-2 where both had liquid-cooled OHC engines of max power output of [tpl]convert|25.7|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The TL-2 had a GVM [tpl]convert|2100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|4000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] GCM, TL-4 had [tpl]convert|2700|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] GVM and [tpl]convert|6700|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] GCM respectively. Both types remained in production in small series until 1927. The TL-4 is considered the first truck to come out of NW (Nesselsdorfer Wagen-bau) to carry the name Tatra in 1919.Moderní Uźitkové Automobily Tatra kolektiv vývojove konstrukce N.P.

===1923–1938 Tatra Concept===

After the introduction of Tatra 11 and Tatra 12 cars with their distinctive backbone tube design and swing axles, Tatra introduced its first truck on the same basis,Tatra swings into action 78 years on[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]  the light utility Tatra 13 powered by 2-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine with power output 8.8 kW (12 hp) and [tpl]convert|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] cargo capacity. Further models followed and in 1926 T23 and T24 were introduced nicknamed "bulldogs" which could be considered Tatra's precursors to COE designed trucks. Improved version T13  introduced as T26 with more powerful 4-cylinder flat air-cooled engine and in six-wheeler chassis created capable offroad light utility truck which later evolved into T72 model which  was heavily used by Czechoslovakian army at the time and was also manufactured under license by the French company Lorraine-Dietrich. In 1933 Tatra build limited series of  T25 heavy artillery hauler with 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines. The most popular Tatra truck before World War II was type T27 powered by 4-cylinder petrol or diesel engines and remained in production for nearly 17 years (1930–1947) with total production of 7,620 units,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tatraportal.sk/index.php?ukaz=popisky/t27_en&lang=en |title=Tatra T27 vehicle description. Retrieved 2008-11-29 |publisher=Tatraportal.sk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16[/tpl] by adding an extra axle to the rear the type T28 was created however, it was not successful and only limited production resulted in a mainly bus chassis. In the period from 1931 to 1938 Tatra also built a small utility truck based on the chassis from T30 named Tatra T43 which remain popular with small business owners. T72 model successfully continued the line to T82 built mainly for military in cargo and personnel transport  between 1935 and 1938 and further to T92 and T93 built for Romanian army from 1938 to 1941 which were identical except T93 had also a driven front axle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tatraportal.sk/?ukaz=popisky/t92_en&lang=en |title=Tatra T92 technical specifications.

===1939–1956 The Legend Born===

Following the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia the production at Kopřivnice was annexed by the Germans for the supply of trucks needed by the Wehrmacht. Apart from the existing line up of T27, T92/92 a new heavy truck the T81 commenced production featuring liquid-cooled 12.5 L V8 diesel engine with a power output of [tpl]convert|118|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl], in 6×4 axle configuration. This vehicle evolved in 1942 into the legendary T111 which continued in production until 1962, with the total of 33,690 units made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tatraportal.sk/?ukaz=popisky/t111_en&lang=en |title=Tatra T111 specifications. Retrieved 2008-11-29 |publisher=Tatraportal.sk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16[/tpl] The T111 also featured Tatra's first air-cooled diesel engine, a massive V12 originally designed for the armoured SdKfz 234 Puma. In the latter stages of World War II Tatra was instrumental in the development of air-cooled diesel engines for German tanks. In late 1944 General Heinz Guderian ordered that production of the Type 38(t) Hetzer tank be modified to incorporate a Tatra Type 928 V-8 air-cooled diesel engine, though this order was delayed so production could continue uninterrupted. After the war the T111 contributed heavily to the rebuilding effort in Central and Eastern Europe and a memorial was built at Magadan, Siberia for its exploits in the Far East of the USSR.Tatratech.wz.cz Tatra T111 history, [tpl]cs icon[/tpl] Retrieved 2008-11-29

===1957–1982 Eastern Block Finest===

[tpl]Main|Tatra T138[/tpl][tpl]Main|Tatra T148[/tpl][tpl]Main|Tatra T813[/tpl]
The decision to replace the reliable but ageing T111 was taken in 1952 based on central planning economy of socialist government where directive was made to Tatra N.P. that it should concentrate on the  manufacture of 7 to 10 ton capacity commercial vehicles and in 1956  first  T137 and T138 trucks were exhibited at Czechoslovak machinery expo in Brno.
The production of T111 however continued alongside T138 series until 1962. T138 itself continued   in production until 1969 when it was replaced by improved T148 where designers main target was increase in power output, reliability and product improvements.
In 1967 Tatra began production of one of its famous off-road trucks the T813  using its  modular construction technology; the model incorporated the latest trends in commercial vehicle design such as cab-over-engine (COE) and wide profile tyres. It featured a new V12 engine and all military versions had a central tyre inflation/deflation system as standard equipment. The T813 was designed to tow loads up to 100 ton GCM and it was a familiar sight on the roads in Czechoslovakia hauling large often over-sized loads.

===1982–2008 T815 and Beyond===

Tatra T815 was designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original. After the 53-rd session of CMEA council a directive that Tatra N.P. would be a sole supplier of off road commercial vehicles of T815 was upgraded to T815-2 with minor cosmetic changes and improved ergonomics and safety - the biggest change was the engine emissions accordance the "Euro0" limits and to Euro1 limits in 1993 (turbocharged V8 engine only since this time for the full legislation. As alternative was offered also the Deutz 513 aircooled V8 engine). The next facelift[tpl]cite web|title=Tatra T815 description|url=http://www.tatra-page.kx.cz/Description/T-815.htm|accessdate= 2008-11-29|language=czech[/tpl] in 1997 brought in the new exterior design cabin TerrNo1 with all new interior with better sound and heat insulation however the cabin design is based on the original so it can actually be retrofitted to all T815 built since 1993.[tpl]cite web|title=TerrNo1 cabin|url=http://www.tatra-page.kx.cz/Description/T-815.htm|accessdate= 2008-11-29|language=czech[/tpl] In 2000 the TerrNo1 cabin is face-lifted again and for the first time there is an option to fit liquid-cooled engines.
The TerrNo1 model introduced the "KingFrame" rear axles suspension. Another evolution step T3B engine came with the Euro2 emission limit.
Following further improvements in 2003 T815 gets new Euro3 T3C V8 engine mated to all new 14-speed range+split gearbox as well as option for engines from other suppliers most notably CAT, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Deutz and MTU with its "monster" 22.5 Litre V12 and up to [tpl]convert|610|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] power output!
In September 2006 Tatra introduced its Euro4 compliant turbocharged T3D engine with the SCR[tpl]dn|date=May 2013[/tpl] exhaust technology and in February 2008 the worlds's first Euro 5 compliant aircooled diesel engine based on T3D engine[tpl]cite web|title=Tatra On Air the only aircooled Euro V engine in the world|url=http://www.tatra.cz/en/zajimavosti/Press%20ReleaseEURO5.pdf|format= PDF|accessdate= 2008-11-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

Tatra was also a successful bidder for the Czech Army replacement of aging Praga V3S (with the Tatra I6 aircooled engine - one half of the T111 V12 one) medium off-road truck with T810 which technically is not a "genuine" Tatra as its origin goes back to when former Czech company ROSS, in partnership with Renault Trucks, obtained a contract to supply the army with medium size off-road trucks, the "ROSS R210 6×6". The company however went bankrupt in 1998 and Tatra bought full rights to the design, then modernized  and reintroduced it as T810 while continuing cooperation with Renault.[tpl]cite web|title=Tatra T810|url=http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jmvl/jmvla039.html|accessdate= 2008-11-29[/tpl] Under the deal Renault supplies the cabins and the engines and Praga supplied axles and transmissions for the prototypes; however the whole project has been dogged by controversy due to the way Tatra had obtained the contract, its relationship with supplier Praga and the subsequent court case brought on against it by Praga.[tpl]cite web|title=Praga loses its court bid against Tatra|url=http://www.tatra.cz/en/zajimavosti/zamitnuti_zaloby_Pragy_en.htm| accessdate= 2008-11-29[/tpl]
The serial T810 vehicles are than finally equipped with the new design Tatra rigid axles with the WABCO disc brakes, with the ZF Ecolite transmission and Steyr drop box.

==Recent years==

 
  100px|center Current Tatra production
 
With orders and production almost at a standstill after the fall of Communism Tatra decided to stop building the T613 automobile in 1996. An attempt was made to produce an updated version, the Tatra T700; it was largely based on the old car, with updated body panels and detail. Sales were poor, and having in its history produced a total of 90,000 cars, Tatra finally abandoned their manufacture in 1999 to concentrate on trucks.
The United States Terex Corporation acquired the majority ownership (71%) of Tatra in late 2003.Terex sells its 80 percent share of Tatra. here http://all-tatra.blogspot.com/2006/10/terex-corporation-sells-stake-in-czech.html and Here http://all-tatra.blogspot.com/2006/10/terex-announces-divestiture-of-its.html. As of late 2006, however, majority ownership (80.51%) lies in the hands of Tatra Holdings s.r.o., an international consortium comprising Vectra Limited of UK, Sam Eyde of the U.S., KBC Private Equity of Belgium, Meadowhill s.r.o. of Czech Republic and Ronald Adams of the U.S. On 15 December 2006, a contract was signed between Tatra and the Czech Republic for 556 trucks at roughly $ 130 million, or 2.6 billion  Czech crowns. This contract was signed in lieu of replacement of older military vehicles.
In April 2007, Tatra announced that it had already matched its production in 2006 and produced 1,600 vehicles. In 2007, Tatra plans to produce between 2,300 and 2,500 vehicles. In contrast to previous years, Tatra has increased employment by the hundreds within the past two quarters, has reversed previous errors, and is growing again. Although there have been many struggles in the past decade, the company still remains one of the great prides of Czech industry, and has proven to be a valuable asset to international engineering, with its unique assembly and production methods and designs.
In August 2011, DAF Trucks announced it had built up a 19% stake in Tatra, which will use DAF cabs and PACCAR engines. DAF dealers will sell Tatra off-road trucks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadtransport.com/blogs/big-lorry-blog/2011/08/daf-trucks-grabs-19-stake-in-t.html|accessdate=2011-08-03|title=DAF Trucks grabs 19% stake in TATRA and supplies engines and cabs for new range!

==Israel==

Reportedly following one of Israeli-Arab conflicts, Israel tested some Tatras captured from neighbour Arab armed forces (Egypt). Israel Defense Forces's command was apparently quite impressed with their performance, independence of cooling by air only and their capabilities as military trucks in desert and in wars for long-range raiding operations in such terrains etc., and felt necessary to include these trucks in their arsenal. As direct purchase from oppositely aligned Czechoslovakia was impossible, the lore has it that Israelis used some well-paid services of Nicolae Ceauşescu's Romania in cooperation with an American Company called ATC (American Truck Company) to purchase sand-coloured and military trucks, desert-equipped Tatra trucks too, leading to jokes along the line "Romania has a new desert". Current photos of various Israeli weapon systems, e.g., SPYDER slated, e.g., for India, show new Tatras as the carrier vehicles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
A number of Tatra trucks entered service in the Israeli Army also in many army sectors and as for example anti aircraft missile launcher, with the brand mark of "American Truck Company", under which Tatras were sold on U.S. market and exported to Israel.

==Future==

In February 2008, Tatra announced the world's first (and so far the only) air-cooled engine meeting the new Euro 5 standards. The press release claims 7.5 times lower emissions of particulates and 3.5 times lower emission of nitrogen oxides compared to the previous engine. Further, production of air-cooled engines should significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gasses due to the absence of liquid cooling systems. All Tatra vehicles from February 2008 onwards should use the new engine.Tatra.cz [tpl]cs icon[/tpl]
A month later, Tatra CEO Ronald Adams told The Prague Post Tatra could return to producing passenger cars, saying: 'We would not come back to compete with the large automobile mass producers such as Volkswagen, Škoda, Toyota etc. But we might come back with a replica of the old Tatra cars using a current undercarriage and driveline from one of the major automotive producers.'The Prague Post Online: Business: 10 Questions The company has launched a feasibility study, hoping to produce one thousand replicas of their legendary Tatraplan and 603 cars in 2010.[tpl]cite web|author=21:24 UTC |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/102624 |title=Tatra plans to renew production of its legendary models - 03-04-2008 14:24 UTC - Radio Prague |publisher=Radio.cz |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16[/tpl]
