Pyrocollodion is a smokeless powder invented by Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev discovered it in 1892 and proposed to use it to replace gunpowder in the Russian Navy. This offer was rejected because of cost and efficiency. Pyrocollodion is known to be spontaneously combustible, and explosive. When ignited, it will burn/explode quickly, and with excessive heat output. If ignited in a tight, contained space, it will leave little to no remnants, such as unburned powder, particular kinds of flame scarring, or smoke of any kind. Pyrocollodion is a variant of nitrocellulose.  The natural ingredients found in Pyrocollodion can now be used in the production of cocaine and cigarettes.
