UFC 19: Ultimate Young Guns was a mixed martial arts event held by the Ultimate Fighting Championship on March 5, 1999 at the Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The event was seen live on pay per view in the United States, and later released on home video.  

==History==

UFC 19 featured the first appearance of collegiate wrestler Kevin Randleman, as well as the first televised appearance of former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Chuck Liddell, who had fought at UFC 17 in an alternate untelevised bout. Future referee Dan Miragliotta makes his debut as UFC judge for the event.
In the main event, Guy Mezger fought Tito Ortiz in a rematch of their first fight in the finals of UFC 13, which Mezger won by submission. Ortiz was a late replacement for Vitor Belfort, who was scheduled to face Mezger but was forced to withdraw. The post-fight disrespect shown by Tito Ortiz to Guy Mezger and the Lion's Den led to the long-running rivalry between Ortiz and Lion's Den leader Ken Shamrock.
UFC 19 was part three of what the UFC called "The Road To The Heavyweight Title", a four-part tournament of sorts, held to determine the Heavyweight Champion after the title was vacated by Randy Couture. It was determined that the winner of Kevin Randleman vs. Maurice Smith would face Bas Rutten at UFC 20 for the Undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship Title.
