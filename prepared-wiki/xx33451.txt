[[Uridine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleosides, Pyrimidinediones, Antidepressants

Uridine, a nucleoside, contains an uracil attached to a ribose ring (known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond.
If uracil is attached to a deoxyribose ring, it is known as a deoxyuridine.

==Dietary sources of uridine==

Uridine is one of the four basic components of ribonucleic acid (RNA); the other three are adenosine, guanosine, and cytidine.  Some  foods that contain uridine in the form of RNA are listed below. However virtually none of the uridine in this form is bioavailable, since - as shown by Handschumacher's Laboratory at Yale Medical School in 1981 (Gasser, et al, Science, 1981, 213:777) - it is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels. In infants consuming mothers'milk or commercial infant formulas, uridine is present as its  monophosphate, UMP, and this source of uridine is indeed bioavailable (Carver, Am. J. Clin Nutr 2003; 77:1550S (supplement) and enters the blood.

Consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenosine and guanosine) in blood.  High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout.  Moderate consumption of yeast, about 5 grams per day, should provide adequate uridine for improved health with minimal side effects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Note: It has been suggested that the RNA content of yeast products should be chemically reduced if these products are to be consumed in high amounts (50 grams or more per day) as a source of protein.  However, such processing is expensive and, as of 2008, commonly available brewer's yeast products were not RNA-reduced.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Harvard researchers report that supplementation in rats with a combination of uridine and EPA/DHA omega-3 fatty acids has antidepressant activity.

==Uridine in the Glycolysis Pathway==

Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose.The Entry of Fructose and Galactose into Glycolysis, Biochemistry, Stryer, Berg and Tymoczko, 5th edition. There is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized in the common glucose pathway. 
Once the incoming galactose has been converted into galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), it is involved in a reaction with UDP-glucose, a glucose molecule bonded to a UDP (uridine-di-phosphate) molecule. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, and transfers the UDP to the galactose molecule. The end result is a UDP-galactose molecule and a glucose-1-phosphate molecule. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of the galactose molecule.
