[[Alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor]]

CATEGORIES: Receptors, Ion channels

The alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor, also known as the α3β4 receptor, is a type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, consisting of α3 and β4 subunits.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stauderman KA, Mahaffy LS, Akong M, et al. | title = Characterization of human recombinant neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit combinations alpha2beta4, alpha3beta4 and alpha4beta4 stably expressed in HEK293 cells | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 284 | issue = 2 | pages = 777–89 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9454827| doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9454827[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Xiao Y, Kellar KJ | title = The comparative pharmacology and up-regulation of rat neuronal nicotinic receptor subtype binding sites stably expressed in transfected mammalian cells | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 310 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–107 |date=July 2004 | pmid = 15016836 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.104.066787 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15016836[/tpl] It is located in autonomic ganglia,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8987781 |title=Heterogeneity of nicotinic receptor class and subunit mRNA expression among individual parasympathetic neurons from rat intracardiac ganglia |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl] in adrenal medulla,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481063 |title=Structural and functional diversity of native brain neuronal nicotinic receptors. |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl] in the brain, where activation yields post- and/or presynaptic excitation.
As with other nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the α3β4 receptor is pentameric where m + n = 5. The exact subunit stoichiometry is not known and it is possible that more than one functional α3β4 receptor assembles in vivo with varying subunit stoichiometries.
