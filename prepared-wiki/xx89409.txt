The name Thorpe derives from the Norse for an outlying farmstead, while Salvin refers to 13th century lord of the manor Ralph Salvain. There are earlier references to the settlement though, including a mention in the Domesday Book as Rynkenild Thorp, part of Roger de Busli's Laughton en le Morthen estate. This name refers to the settlement's place on the Roman road of Rynkenild Street, now Packman Lane.

==Thorpe Hall==

Thorpe Salvin contains the ruins of Thorpe Hall, a manor house designed and built by Robert Smythson in 1570. it was built on the site of the previous manor house for the then lord of the manor, Brian Sandford.
In 1636, the hall was bought by Edward Osborne. When his descendant Thomas Osborne became Duke of Leeds, he moved out to a grander property in Kiveton Park, and the hall fell into disuse. It was partially demolished in the 1820s, with only the south front now remaining.
