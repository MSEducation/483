The flag of the United States territory of Guam was adopted on February 9, 1948. http://www.flagandbanner.com/Products/FBPP0000012671.aspThe territorial flag is dark blue with a narrow red border on all sides (border was a later addition). In the center of the flag is the coat of arms; an almond shaped emblem, which depicts a proa sailing in Agana Bay near Hagåtña, and GUAM colored in red letters. The shape of the emblem recalls the slingshot stones used by the islanders' ancestors. The landform at the back depicts the Punta Dos Amantes cliff on Guam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ns.gov.gu/seal.html |title=Seal of Guam, Flag and anthem of Guam U.S.A. |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=Government of Guam [/tpl] Charles Alan Pownall approved the flag's shape in 1948.[tpl]cite web| last = Reynolds| first = Leslie| authorlink = |author2=Deniz Smith| title = Guam Seal and Flag| work = | publisher = Guampedia and University of Guam| date = 2 May 2009| url = http://guampedia.com/guam-seal-and-flag| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2 May 2009   [/tpl]
As a complement to the Guam flag design, and in response to Guam law providing for municipal flags, efforts were made to depict the culture of each Guam municipality on their own flag. These efforts to design 19 unique municipal flags were collaborated through the Mayors' Council with the assistance of illustrative artist Gerard Aflague, a Guam born native. These municipal flag designs reflect unique aspects of each of Guam's municipal villages.
