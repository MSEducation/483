It was created during the mid- and late 1960s in the former Ciskei homeland to house Black people who had been removed from "white" areas for living there "illegally".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] The concrete houses consisted of two or three rooms; sanitation facilities were non-existent. The lucky individuals could obtain employment in King William's Town, paying roughly a quarter of their gross income on transportation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
Between the abject poverty, and active negligence by the South African government, the town became a symbol of apartheid, and the subject of the 1975 documentary Last Grave at Dimbaza.
The town's original name[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2010[/tpl] was changed, due to the inability of the Special Branch to pronounce it correctly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
