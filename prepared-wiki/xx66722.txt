==Description==

Harry Truman (also known as HST within the Navy) is 1,092 ft (333 m) long, 257 ft (78 m) wide and is as high as a twenty-four-story building, at 244 feet (74 m). The super carrier can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft and has a flight deck [tpl]convert|4.5|acre|ha[/tpl] in size, using four elevators that are 3,880 ft² (360 m²) each to move planes between the flight deck and the hangar bay. With a combat load, HST displaces almost 97,000 tons and can accommodate 6,250 crewmembers. Her four distilling units can make 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500 m³) of potable water a day; her food service divisions serve 18,000 meals per day. There are over 2,500 compartments on board requiring 2,520 tons (2.1 MW) of air conditioning capacity (enough to cool over 2,000 homes). The warship uses two Mark II stockless anchors that came from [tpl]USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=8594 |title= T-2s, The End of an Era |first= Joseph |last= Gunder |date= 21 July 2003 |publisher= U.S. Navy |accessdate=19 March 2011 [/tpl] and weigh 30 tons each, with each link of the anchor chain weighing 360 pounds (160 kg). She is currently equipped with three 20 mm Phalanx CIWS mounts and two Sea Sparrow SAM launchers. The ship cost over $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars to manufacture.

===Propulsion===

Two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors are used for propulsion (the ship is capable of steaming more than three million miles before refueling) turning 4 five-bladed screws that weigh 66,220 pounds (30 t) each, driving the ship at speeds over 30 knots (56 km/h).

===Recreation===

While underway, the ship has its own daily newspaper, the "Give 'em Hell Herald",[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] and its own weekly television newscast, "Tru North". In addition, the ship's Morale, Welfare & Recreation (MWR) division collaborates with the public affairs office (PAO) to telecast bingo contests for the crew that award as much as $1,000 and several prizes.

===Awards===

Harry S Truman has been the recipient of numerous awards recognizing the ship's excellence. They include

===Ship's seal and battle flag===

The oval seal was designed by the ship's pre-commissioning crew and is primarily blue and gold. According to the ship's history webpage, a coat of arms "characterizes the global on-station capability of the ship and the United States Navy" and "Truman's name forms the shape of a forward-deployed aircraft carrier prepared to uphold and protect American interests".United States Navy The three flags near the bottom represent the letters "HST".  The 33 gold stars surrounding the seal represent Truman's position as the 33rd President.
The Truman battle flag was also designed by the ship's crew and is a variation of the guidons carried by the companies of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division, such as Battery D, the battery under the command of then Army Capt. Harry Truman during World War I. It consists of crossed cannons on a scarlet background with the phrase "Give 'em hell", a reference to Truman's 1948 reelection campaign.

==Ship history==

===Pre-commissioning and construction===

The keel was laid by Newport News Shipbuilding on 29 November 1993 and the ship was christened on 7 September 1996. HST was authorized and laid down as [tpl]USS|United States[/tpl] but her name was changed in February 1995 at the direction of then Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton.
Three Newport News ship workers died during construction when a pump room filled with methane and hydrogen sulfide gases during a sewage leak on 12 July 1997. They are commemorated by a brass plaque in the tunnel off Hangar Bay No. 1. The ship was christened on 7 September 1996, launched 13 September 1996, and the crew began moving aboard from contract housing in Newport News in January 1998. The ship successfully completed builder's sea trial on 11 June 1998 after a short delay due to noise issues in one of the reactor closure heads. The ship was officially accepted by the Navy on 30 June 1998 and was commissioned on 25 July 1998 at Naval Station Norfolk.Agostinelli, Giampaolo (2003) Where Sea Meets the Sky: Us Navy – Cvw-3 – Uss Harry S Truman Naval Institute Press. p.33.

===Commissioning===

The keynote speaker of the commissioning ceremony was President Bill Clinton. Other notable attendees and speakers were: Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who pushed to have the carrier named after the 33rd president; Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan; Captain Thomas Otterbein, Truman’s first commanding officer; Secretary of Defense William Cohen; and Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton.

===1998–1999===

Truman got underway for the first time as a U.S. Navy carrier in August 1998 to conduct flight deck certifications, an evolution designed to test the ship’s ability to successfully launch and recover aircraft. That was followed by numerous at sea periods for various training evolutions.

===2000 Maiden deployment===

The Maiden deployment of Harry S Truman began on 28 November 2000 with Carrier Air Wing 3 (CVW-3) embarked. After transiting the Suez Canal, the air wing flew 869 combat sorties in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW), including a strike on Iraqi integrated air defense system sites on 16 February 2001, in a sanctioned response to Iraqi surface-to-air missile fire against United Nations Security Council coalition forces. Combat operations ended on 27 April and the ship returned to the U.S. on 23 May 2001. She then entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va., for her first Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) on 5 September.

===2002–2003===

On 1 October 2004, as part of a Navy-wide series of redesignations, Truman's immediate superior in command (ISIC) changed to Carrier Strike Group Ten. The ship set out from Norfolk on her third extended deployment on 13 October 2004, and visited Souda Bay, Crete, before relieving [tpl]USS|John F.

Truman and Carrier Air Wing 3 launched 2,577 sorties, totaling nearly 13,000 flight hours, flying combat missions over Iraq and maritime security operations before being relieved by [tpl]USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|6[/tpl] Carrier Strike Group in the Persian Gulf on 19 March 2005. Despite plans to cross the equator and visit South Africa, diplomatic issues caused her instead to transit the Suez Canal, stopping in Portsmouth, England, prior to returning home on 18 April 2005.
On 1 September 2005, in response to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, Truman set sail for the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast. She arrived in the Gulf of Mexico on 4 September and served as the flagship for the Naval task force. While the ship's strike group (Carrier Strike Group 10) commander, Rear Adm. Joseph Kilkenny, was appointed deputy commander of Joint Task Force Gulf Coast (also known as JTF Katrina & Rita), the ship remained anchored in the gulf and provided fresh desalinated water for the relief effort via helicopter (the actual command hub for the JTF was [tpl]USS|Iwo Jima|LHD-7|6[/tpl]).
