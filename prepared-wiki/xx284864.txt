==Programs==

===Rehabilitation Initiative===

Uplift Humanity India works with American-Indian teachers in the United States to write its curriculum used for teaching children in India. The latest curriculum, titled "One Step Forward,"[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-18/vadodara/40656203_1_bal-gokulam-juveniles-teenagers |title= US teens on mission uplift |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] features lessons in life skills, self-esteem, honesty, and other values that have helped the juveniles secure steady jobs and futures. Students who previously committed minor crimes and participated in Uplift Humanity India's programs have gone on to earn steady incomes.[tpl]cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-18/vadodara/40656203_1_bal-gokulam-juveniles-teenagers |title= US teens on mission uplift |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] Starting in 2012, family planning and women's rights were added to the curriculum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-12/vadodara/32647399_1_juveniles-teenagers-programme |title= US teens complete 2nd programme at Bal Gokulam |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]
Each summer, Uplift Humanity India sends groups of 15-20 high school and college students selected from across the United States to one of its programs in India. Once there, the students learn the specifics of the curriculum and start teaching in small groups in observation homes for about one month. Lessons are not conducted in a lecture format - rather, teaching is done in a participative manner that emphasizes role playing, games, and video-based lessons.
Beginning in 2011 at the Bal Gokulam facility in Vadodara, the rehabilitation initiative has since expanded to juvenile centers in Indore and Hyderabad.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=7&edlabel=TOIA&mydateHid=03-07-2011&pubname&edname&articleid=Ar00700&format&publabel=TOI |title= US teens light up Vadodara kids' lives |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]

===Uplift Continuation Program===

In August 2013, Uplift Humanity India announced the launch of its Uplift Continuation Program beginning in October, which will provide continuing educational support to the children in the observation homes throughout the year. This effectively extends the program so that juveniles and orphans can receive training even when the American students are not visiting in the summer. These programs involve more technology training and vocational skills training that to help the children find a career in the future.

===Other Programs===

Uplift Humanity India's Books Behind Bars program has donated more than 1000 books to jails in Newark, New Jersey and observation homes in India.

Every year, as part of its summer program, the organization also offers educational scholarships to the top-performing students. These scholarships are used for continuing education and to help the children pursue job or career training. To date, the scholarships have totaled 1.5 lakh Rupees.
