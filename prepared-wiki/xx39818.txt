Miloš Obilić ([tpl]lang-sr-cyr|Милош Обилић[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|mîloʃ ôbilit͡ɕ|pron[/tpl]; died 1389) was a medieval Serbian knight in the service of Prince Lazar, during the invasion of the Ottoman Empire. He is not mentioned in contemporary sources, but he features prominently in later accounts of the Serbian defeat at the Battle of Kosovo as the legendary assassin of the Ottoman sultan Murad I. Although he remains anonymous in the extant sources until the 18th century, the dissemination of the story of Murad's assassination in Florentine, Serbian, Ottoman and Greek sources suggests that versions of it circulated widely across the Balkans within half a century after the event.
It is not certain whether Obilić actually existed, but Lazar's family - strengthening their political control - "gave birth to the myth of Kosovo", including the story of Obilić.[tpl]cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=32[/tpl] He became a major figure in Serbian epic poetry, in which he is elevated to the level of the most noble national hero of medieval Serbian folklore. Along with the martyrdom of Prince Lazar and the alleged treachery of Vuk Branković, Miloš's deed became an integral part of Serbian traditions surrounding the Battle of Kosovo. In the 19th century, Miloš also came to be venerated as a Saint in the Serbian Church.

==Name==

There were several versions of the hero's surname, but folk-epics almost always used variants of "Kobilić" until the eighteenth century. "Obilić" was first used in 1754 by Vasilije Petrović in his History of Montenegro as Obilijević and in 1765 in its final form Obilić by Pavle Julinac. These are derived from the Serbian words obilan, "plenty of", obilje, "wealth, abundance".[tpl]citation| last=Jireček| first=Konstantin Josef|author-link=Konstantin Josef Jireček| year=1967| title=Geschichte der Serben| volume=2|language=German|page=http://books.google.ba/books?ei=wU1FT_mgGZDR4QTRkYGSAw&id=G5JpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Julinac+Jirecek&q=Julinac+&redir_esc=y#search_anchor120| url=[/tpl]: [tpl]quote|In Ragusa gab es eine Familie Kobilić (einer war 1390 Visconte von Breno), in Trebinje im 14.-15.

It was proposed by Noel Malcolm that the surname may have been derived from the term kopil/copil of possibly Vlach and Albanian origin which means "child" or "bastard child".[tpl]cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: a short history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GGQ_AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 January 2013|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780333666128|page=73|quote=Similarly, 'Kobilic' or 'Kobilovic' may have arisen from the Vlach and Albanian word 'copil' or 'kopil', which, as already mentioned, means 'child' or 'bastard child'.[/tpl] Milorad Ekmečić, however, argues that Malcolm ignored the fact that the same word exists in the Serbian language.[tpl]cite book |last=Ekmečić |first=Milorad |authorlink=Milorad Ekmečić |title=Response to Noel Malcolm's book Кosovo.

The hero's first name, Miloš, is a Slavic given name recorded from the early Middle Ages among the Bulgarians, Czechs, Poles, and Serbs. It is derived from the Slavic root mil-, "merciful" or "dear", which is found in a great number of Slavic given names.[tpl]Citation| last=Miklosich| first=Franz| author-link=Franz Miklosich| year=1860| title=Die Bildung der slavischen Personennamen| publisher=Aus der kaiserlich-königlichen Hoff- und Staatdruckerei| place=Vienna| language=German| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=185EAAAAcAAJ| pages=76–77| separator=.[/tpl]

==Earliest sources==

The earliest sources on the Battle of Kosovo, which generally favour the cult of Prince Lazar, do not mention Miloš or his assassination of the sultan. The assassination itself is first recorded by Deacon Ignjatije on 27 June 1389, only 12 days after the battle.[tpl]cite book|title=Историјски гласник: орган Друштва историчара СР Србије|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ny9NAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2013|year=1994|publisher=Друштво|page=9|quote=најстарији помен, настао свега 12 дана после битке,[/tpl] The assassination of sultan Murad and one of his sons was also mentioned in the instructions of the Venetian Senate issued to Andrea Bembo on 23 July 1389, although Venetians were uncertain if news about the assassination were true.[tpl]cite book|author1=Colin Heywood|author2=Colin Imber|title=Studies in Ottoman History in Honor of Professor V.L.

Another Italian account, Mignanelli's 1416 work, asserted that it was Lazar who killed Ottoman sultan.[tpl]cite book|author=Sima M. Ćirković|authorlink=Sima M.

The assassin's first appearance in Serbian sources is in the biography of Stefan Lazarević, Lazar's son, by Constantine the Philosopher, written in the 1440s. The hero, still anonymous, is described as a man of noble birth whom envious tongues had sought to defame before the prince. To prove his loyalty and courage, he left the front line on the pretext of being a deserter, seized the opportunity to stab the sultan to death and was killed himself shortly afterwards. The initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the Serbian legend as it evolved in later times.

==Ottoman and Greek sources==

The loss of the sultan also made an impression on the earliest Ottoman sources. They usually describe how Murad was unaccompanied on the battlefield and an anonymous Christian who had been lying among the corpses stabbed him to death. In the early 15th century, for instance, the poet Ahmedi writes that "suddenly one of the Christians, who was covered in blood and apparently hidden among the enemy dead, got up, rushed to Murad and stabbed him with a dagger."Ahmedi, ed. Olesnicki, "Turski izvori o Kosovskom bo ju."Glasnik skopskog naucnog drustva 14 (1934): 60-2, as cited by Emmert below. One historian from Edirne, Oruc Bey, explains the lack of protection by saying that the army was preoccupied with pursuing the enemy in rear flight and introduces an element of deception: the Christian "had promised himself as a sacrifice and approached Murad, who was sitting alone on his horse. Pretending he wished to kiss the sultan's hand, he stabbed the sultan with a sharp dagger."Oruc, Tevarih I Al-i Osman, as cited by Emmert.
Since about the late 15th century, Greek sources also begin to record the event. The Athenian scholar Laonicus Chalcondyles (d. c. 1490) claims to draw on Greek traditions when he refers to Murad's killer as Miloes, "a man of noble birth who voluntarily decided to accomplish the heroic act of assassination. He requested what he needed from Prince Lazar, and then rode off to Murad's camp with the intention of presenting himself as a deserter. Murad, who was standing in the midst of his troops before the battle, was eager to receive the deserter. Miloes reached the sultan and his bodyguards, turned his spear against Murad, and killed him." Writing in the second half of the same century, Michael Doukas regarded the story as worthy of inclusion in his Historia Byzantina. He relates how the young nobleman pretended to desert the battle, was captured by the Turks and professing to know the key to victory, managed to gain access to Murad and kill him.
In 1976, Miodrag Popovic suggested that the narrative elements of secrecy and stratagem in the Serbian tradition were all introduced from Turkish sources, soughing to defame the capabilities of their Christian opponents by attributing the death of the Murat to "devious" methods..[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/soi/Vol_3/_HTML/Greenawalt.html|title=Kosovo Myths: Karadzic, Njegos, and the Transformation of Serb Memory|last=Greenawalt|first=Alexander|publisher=York University|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] Thomas A. Emmert agress with him.
Emmert says that Turkish sources mentioned the assassination several times, while Western and Serbian sources didn't mention it until much later. He thinks that Serbians knew about the assassination, but decided not to mention it in their first accounts for unknown reasons.[tpl]harvnb|Emmert|1996[/tpl] "It is important to note that neither this chronicle nor any of the other early Serbian accounts of the battle attributes Murad's death to the hand of an assassin (...) The theme of assassination, which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from Florence and Siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century Turkish sources for the battle, would eventually become a central element in the Serbian epic. (...) It is surprising that the assassination of Murad is not recorded in any of the Serbian cult sources for the battle. Why the Serbian authors would fail to speak of the assassin if they knew of him is unclear, (...). Whatever the reason for this silence, it appears from later sources that the story of Murad's assassination was clearly known in Lazar's principality. " 
In 1512 Ottoman historian Mehmed Nesri wrote a detailed account of the battle that became the source for later Ottoman and Western descriptions of the battle. Nesri's account took several elements from popular Serbian tradition, such as the Serbian name. Nesri painted the assassination in a bad light, in order to make Christians look bad.

==Serbian traditions==

Miloš Obilić is a major hero of the Serbian legend of Kosovo, whose central part is the Battle of Kosovo. According to the legend, Miloš was a son-in-law of the Serbian Prince Lazar. A quarrel broke out between his wife and her sister who was married to Vuk Branković, about superiority in valour of their respective husbands. As a consequence of this, Branković took offence and picked a fight with Miloš. Filled with hate, Branković maligned Miloš to Lazar, saying that he conspired with Turks to betray the prince. At Lazar’s supper on the eve of the battle, the prince reproached Miloš for disloyalty. To prove his loyalty, Miloš went into the Turkish camp feigning defection. At a favourable moment, he stabbed and killed the Turkish Sultan Murad, whose attendants then executed Miloš. The legend then goes on to describe events regarding the battle.[tpl]Citation| last=Ređep| first=Jelka| year=1991| title=The Legend of Kosovo| journal=Oral Tradition| volume=6| issue=2–3| publisher=Center for Studies in Oral Tradition| place=Columbia, Missouri| issn=1542-4308| url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/6ii-iii/redep| separator=.[/tpl]
There are two main views about the creation of the Kosovo legend. In one view, its place of origin lies is the region in which the Battle of Kosovo was fought. In the other view, the legend sprang up in more westerly Balkan regions under the influence of the French chansons de geste. Serbian philologist Dragutin Kostić stated that the French chivalric epics had in fact no part in the formation of the legend, but that they "only modified the already created and formed legend and its first poetic manifestations". The nucleus from which the legend developed is found in the cultic literature celebrating Prince Lazar as a martyr and saint, written in Moravian Serbia between 1389 and 1420. Especially important in this regard is Discourse on Prince Lazar composed by Serbian Patriarch Danilo III. The legend would gradually evolve during the subsequent centuries.
The tale of the maligned hero who penetrated the Turkish camp and killed Sultan Murad, is found in the Life of Despot Stefan Lazarević written in the 1430s by Konstantin the Philosopher. The hero's name is not mentioned in this work. The theme of the quarrel between Lazar's son-in-laws was first recorded in Herzegovina in the mid-15th century. Lazar’s supper on the eve of the battle and his reproach of Miloš are mentioned in texts from the 16th century. The argument between Lazar's daughters over the valor of their husbands, was first recorded by Mavro Orbin in 1601. The fully developed legend of Kosovo, with all of its elements, is recorded in the Tale of the Battle of Kosovo composed around the beginning of the 18th century in the Bay of Kotor or Old Montenegro. This was a very popular text, whose copies were continuously produced for some 150 years in an area stretching from the south of ex-Yugoslavia to Budapest and Sofia. The Tale played a notable role in the awakening of national consciousness of the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy, which began in the first half of the 18th century.
The first author to refer to Murad's killer by his full name is Konstantin Mihailović, a Serbian Janissary from the village of Ostrovica, near Rudnik, who wrote his Memoirs of a Janissary or Turkish Chronicle in ca 1497. In a passage intended to infer a moral lesson about disloyalty from the Serbian defeat at Kosovo, Mihailović identifies Miloš Kobica[tpl]Citation |last=Mihailović|first=Konstantin|authorlink= Konstantin Mihailović |title= Turska istorija ili kronika (Турска историја или кроника (Memoirs af a Janissary)) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x4A6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA144&dq=skanderbeg&hl=en&ei=0MKsTYHrGMzQ4waSttz9Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B3&f=false|volume=18|year= 1865 |origyear=1490—1501 |publisher= Glasnik Srpskoga učenog društva (Serbian Learned Society) |language= Serbian |page=77 |quote= Ту је онда Милош Кобица убио цара Мурата[/tpl] as the knight who on the fateful last Friday of the battle slew Murad. The next time a name is given in the sources is three decades later, in 1530, when the (Slovene) monk Benedikt Kuripečič (Curipeschitz) wrote memoirs of his travels through the Balkan Peninsula. His visit to Murad's tomb in Kosovo Polje provides the occasion for the story of the knight whom he names Miloš Kobilović. Kuripešić elaborates on the humiliation and fall out favour which Miloš endured before the battle, his last dinner with Lazar and his nobles, his admittance to Murad's tent, the brutal murder and his own death on attempting to escape on horseback. The monk, though not explicit about his sources, writes that Miloš was a celebrated figure in the popular traditions of Serbs, who sing about his heroic exploits on the border. He recorded some legends about the Battle of Kosovo and mentions epic songs about Obilić in regions far from Kosovo, like Bosnia and Croatia.[tpl]cite book|author=Pavle Ivić|authorlink=Pavle Ivić|title=Istorija srpske kulture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r3FpAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 September 2013|year=1996|publisher=Dečje novine|page=160|quote=Бенедикт Курипечић. пореклом Словенаи, који између 1530. и 1531. путује као тумач аустријског посланства, у свом Путопису препричава део косовске легенде, спомиње епско певање о Милошу Обилићу у крајевима удаљеним од места догађаја, у Босни и Хрватској, и запажа настајање нових песама.[/tpl]
In Serbian epic poetry and song (e.g. "Radul-bey and Bulgarian King Šišman" and the song "Dušan's Wedding"), Miloš Obilić is often grouped along with other literary creations like Karadjordje, Vuk Karadžić and Njegoš as Serbs of Dinaric originwho distinguished themselves as the great moral and/or intellectual minds of the past in contradistinction to Bulgarian contemporaries, who could claim no such status.[tpl]harvnb|Gavrilović|2003|p=722[/tpl] citing Cvijić. In the poem "Obilić Dragon's Son", Miloš is given a mythical ancestry as the son of a dragon to emphasise his superhuman strength on a physical and spiritual level; in this, he joins the ranks of many other heroes of Serbian poetry who fought against Turkish oppression and are claimed to have been descendants of a dragon.[tpl]harvnb|Gavrilović|2003|=725 and see p. 721[/tpl]
Albert Lord of Harvard University stated in 1982 that Albanian epic songs about the Battle of Kosovo were not translations of the Serbian epic songs, as was previously thought. Lord argues that the two traditions emerged more or less independent of each other. According to him, major elements of the Albanian tale of the assassination of Sultan Murad cannot be found in the corresponding Serbian accounts, while these elements can be traced to Albanian folklore. The Serbian and the Albanian traditions came into contact in the region of Sandžak, where they were fused.[tpl]Citation| last=Lord| first=Albert| author-link=Albert Lord| year=1984| chapter=The Battle of Kosovo in Albanian and Serbocroatian Oral Epic Songs| title=Studies on Kosova| series=East European Monographs| volume=155| isbn=9780880330473| separator=.[/tpl]

==Later legends==

===19th century===

It was not until the early 19th century that Miloš was also venerated as a saint in the Serbian Church. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813), a fresco of Miloš as a haloed, sword-bearing saint was painted in Prince Lazar's narthex in the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos (Greece). The historian Rade Mihaljcic suggests that the cult was a popular movement which originated among the Serbs south of the Sava and Danube during the Ottoman period.
Later in the same century, the heroic figure of Miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem The Mountain Wreath (1847) by Petar Petrovic Njegoš, prince of Montenegro. The poem praises the assassin's valour in battle, calling him "the victim of a noble feeling, / An all powerful military genius, / A dreadful thunder that smashes crowns".
The prince-poet also instituted the Obilić medal for courage.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Today===

This event and the Battle of Kosovo itself has become embedded in the Serbs'national consciousness, history, and poetry. Njegoš's tales, including Miloš, inspired later generations of Serbs - and Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.[tpl]cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7|page=64[/tpl]
In 1913, the Medal of Miloš Obilić was awarded by King Peter I, to soldiers for the acts of great personal courage, or for personal courage demonstrated on the battlefield. It was given during the Balkan wars, World War I, and during World War II, to members of the Yugoslav Army or allied forces and was discontinued with the end of the war.
In the late 1980s, religious nationalists began to breathe further life into the figure of Miloš and the Kosovo Myth.[tpl]harvnb|Sells|1996|pp=89–90[/tpl] Special inspiration was taken from Njegoš's The Mountain Wreath, with its portrayal of Lazar as a Christ-like martyr and Obilić as the Serb sacrificing himself to prove his loyalty and seek retribution.[tpl]harvnb|Sells|1996|pp=79, 89–90[/tpl] A key event which gave expression to this idea was the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo (Vidovdan) on 28 June 1989, which was held at the Gazimestan plain, near the site of the battle.[tpl]harvnb|Sells|1996|pp=68, 79[/tpl] Obilić's feat has been cited as a source of inspiration in public speeches by political leaders, notably President Milošević, who referred to him in his Gazimestan speech on the occasion of the battle anniversary.[tpl]harvnb|Judah|2000|p=56[/tpl] His regime often alluded to Obilić frequently in comparison to Milosević, who was proclaimed the "saviour of the nation".[tpl]harvnb|Stevanovic|2004|pp=174[/tpl]
Religious nationalist use of the Obilić/Kosovo legend culminated in attempts to encourage and justify aggression against Bosnian Muslims, notably the Bosnian genocide of the early nineties. During the atrocities of the time, nationalists supporting the Republika Srpska wore patches of the Battle of Kosovo, and medals with Milos’ name (the Medal of Miloš Obilić) were awarded to soldiers who had taken part in the atrocities,[tpl]harvnb|Sells|1996|pp=79[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Emran Qureshi|author2=Michael Anthony Sells|title=The New Crusades: Constructing the Muslim Enemy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=15NpAEv8c-MC&pg=PA385|accessdate=29 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12667-0|pages=385|quote=Obilić became the role model par excelence for Serbian religious nationalists.

One such song was directed at Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović, in which the first-person speaker would boast that he will slay the president just as Miloš slew the sultan.
