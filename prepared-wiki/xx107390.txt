Sir John Alexander Boyd, KCMG (April 23, 1837 â€“ November 23, 1916) was a Canadian lawyer and judge. Educated at Upper Canada College, the University of Toronto, Boyd began his career in 1860 when he was articled to David Breakenridge Read. Later, his decision in Regina v. St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Company was to have a long-lasting influence on the interpretation of First Nations land claims in Canada.
Boyd was Chancellor of the High Court of Justice of the Province of Ontario.
He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) during the visit to Canada of TRH the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) in October 1901.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=27364 |date=11 October 1901 |startpage=6640 [/tpl]
In 1903, Boyd and William Glenholme Falconbridge were appointed to a Royal Commission to investigate charges of bribery brought forward by Robert Roswell Gamey against the Liberal Government of the time. Although the commission found no proof for these allegations, the provincial Conservatives won the general election that followed two years later.
