Rosemary Clooney (May 23, 1928 – June 29, 2002) was an American singer and actress. She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the novelty hit "Come On-a My House", which was followed by other pop numbers such as "Botch-a-Me", "Mambo Italiano", "Tenderly", "Half as Much", "Hey There" and "This Ole House", although she had success as a jazz vocalist.  Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly due to problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her White Christmas co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business.  She continued recording until her death in 2002.

==Early life==

Clooney was born in Maysville, Kentucky, the daughter of Marie Frances (née Guilfoyle) and Andrew Joseph Clooney. She was one of five children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/01/arts/rosemary-clooney-legendary-pop-singer-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Rosemary Clooney, Legendary Pop Singer, Dies at 74|author=Severo, Richard|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 July 2012|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl] Her father was of Irish and German descent and her mother was of Irish and English ancestry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/george-clooney/index.html |title=Ancestry of George Clooney |publisher=Genealogy.com |accessdate=2012-04-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] She was raised Catholic. When Clooney was fifteen, her mother and brother Nick moved to California. She and her sister Betty remained with their father.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]  The family resided in the John Brett Richeson House in the late 1940s.
Rosemary, Betty and Nick all became entertainers. (In the next generation, some of her children, including Miguel Ferrer and Rafael Ferrer, and her nephew, George Clooney, also became respected entertainers.) In 1945, the Clooney sisters won a spot on Cincinnati, Ohio's radio station WLW as singers. Her sister Betty sang in a duo with Rosemary for much of the latter's early career.

==Career==

Clooney's first recordings, in May 1946, were for Columbia Records. She sang with Tony Pastor's big band. Clooney continued working with the Pastor band until 1949, making her last recording with the band in May of that year and her first as a solo artist a month later, still for Columbia. In 1951, her record of "Come On-a My House", produced by Mitch Miller, became a hit. It was her first of many singles to hit the charts—despite the fact that Clooney hated the song passionately. She had been told by Columbia Records to record the song, and that she would be in violation of her contract if she did not do so.  Clooney recorded several duets with Marlene Dietrich and appeared in the early 1950s on Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town series on CBS. Clooney also did several guest appearances on the Arthur Godfrey radio show, when it was sponsored by Lipton Tea. They did duets as he played his ukelele and other times she would sing one of her latest hits.
In 1954, she starred, along with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Vera-Ellen, in the movie White Christmas. She starred, in 1956, in a half-hour syndicated television musical-variety show The Rosemary Clooney Show. The show featured The Hi-Lo's singing group and Nelson Riddle's orchestra. The following year, the show moved to NBC prime time as The Lux Show Starring Rosemary Clooney but only lasted one season. The new show featured the singing group The Modernaires and Frank DeVol's orchestra. In later years, Clooney would often appear with Bing Crosby on television, such as in the 1957 special The Edsel Show, and the two friends made a concert tour of Ireland together. On November 21, 1957, she appeared on NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, a frequent entry in the "Top 20" and featuring a musical group called "The Top Twenty." In 1960, Clooney and Crosby co-starred in a 20-minute CBS radio program aired before the midday news each weekday.
Clooney left Columbia Records in 1958, doing a number of recordings for MGM Records and then some for Coral Records. Finally, toward the end of 1958, she signed with RCA Victor Records, where she stayed until 1963. In 1964, she went to Reprise Records, and in 1965 to Dot Records. 
Upon her recovery from a nervous breakdown in 1968, Clooney signed with United Artists Records in 1976 for two albums. Beginning in 1977, she recorded an album a year for the Concord Jazz record label,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/Rosemary-Clooney/ |title=Rosemary Clooney: Concord Music Group |publisher=Concord Music Group, Inc. |location=Beverly Hills, California |accessdate=December 13, 2013|archiveurl= http://archive.is/TvBrC |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |deadurl=no[/tpl] which continued until her death. This was in contrast to most of her generation of singers who had long since stopped recording regularly by then.  In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Clooney did television commercials for Coronet brand paper towels, during which she sang a memorable jingle that goes, "Extra value is what you get, when you buy Coro-net." James Belushi later parodied Clooney and the commercial while as a cast member on NBC's Saturday Night Live in the early 1980s. Clooney sang a duet with Wild Man Fischer on "It's a Hard Business" in 1986, and in 1994 she sang a duet of Green Eyes with Barry Manilow in his 1994 album, Singin' with the Big Bands.
In 1995, Clooney guest-starred in the NBC television medical drama ER (starring her nephew, George Clooney); for her performance, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. On January 27, 1996, Clooney appeared on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion radio program. She sang "When October Goes" – lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Barry Manilow (after Mercer's death) – from Manilow's 1984 album 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe, and discussed what an excellent musician Manilow is.A Prairie Home Companion With Garrison Keillor http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19960127/
In 1999, Clooney founded the Rosemary Clooney Music Festival, held annually in Maysville, her hometown."Rosemary Clooney to help rescue ailing theater"[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl], Showbuzz, CNN.com, June 10, 1999. Retrieved on January 1, 2008 She performed at the festival every year until her death. Proceeds benefit the restoration of the Russell Theater in Maysville, where Clooney's first film, The Stars Are Singing, premiered in 1953.
She received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===

Her sister Betty died suddenly of a brain aneurysm in 1976.  She subsequently started a foundation in memory of and named for her sister. During this time she wrote her first autobiography, This for Remembrance: the Autobiography of Rosemary Clooney, an Irish-American Singer, written in collaboration with Raymond Strait and published by Playboy Press in 1977.[tpl]cite book |last= Clooney |first= Rosemary |coauthor= Raymond Strait |title= This for remembrance : the autobiography of Rosemary Clooney |publisher= Playboy Press |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-671-16976-9[/tpl] She chronicled her unhappy early life, her career as a singer, her marriage to Ferrer and mental health problems, concluding with her comeback as a singer and her happiness. Her good friend Bing Crosby wrote the introduction. Katherine Coker adapted the book for Jackie Cooper who produced and directed the television movie, Rosie: the Rosemary Clooney Story (1982) starring Sondra Locke (who lip syncs Clooney's songs), Penelope Milford as Betty and Tony Orlando who played Jose Ferrer.
In 1983, Rosemary and her brother Nick co-chaired the Betty Clooney Foundation for the Brain-Injured, addressing the needs of survivors of cognitive disabilities caused by strokes, tumors and brain damage from trauma or age.

Ferrer and Clooney had five children: Miguel (born February 7, 1955), Maria (born May 29, 1956), Gabriel (born December 1, 1957), Monsita (born October 13, 1958) and Rafael (born March 23, 1960). They divorced for the first time in 1961.
Ferrer and Clooney remarried on November 22, 1964 in Los Angeles; however, the marriage again crumbled while Ferrer was carrying on an affair with the woman who would become his last wife, Stella Magee. Ms. Clooney found out about the affair, and she and Ferrer divorced for the last time in 1967.
In 1968, her relationship with a young drummer ended after two years, and she became increasingly dependent on pills after a punishing tour.
She married her longtime friend, a former dancer, Dante DiPaolo in 1997 at St. Patrick's Church in Maysville, Kentucky.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
