==History==

===Pre-history===

Football was introduced to Vietnam in 1896 by the French. It was first introduced in Cochinchina (Nam Kỳ); it later spread to other parts of Vietnam. The Vietnamese learned the game from the French before creating their own teams. On July 20, 1908, the first Vietnamese football teams with Vietnamese players had their first match where Phú Mỹ team defeated team Chợ Đũi with the score of 2-0. In 1928, Vietnam picked out the best team to compete in their first tournament in Singapore.

They had their first match against China PR where they lost 5-3 under head coach Truong Tan Buu. They participated in the first GANEFO competitions at Indonesia in 1962 and Cambodia in 1966.
The North team was the national team of Democratic Republic of Vietnam between 1945 and 1975. The team ceased to exist when the North and South regions combined into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Most of North Vietnam's international games were played against other socialist countries.
