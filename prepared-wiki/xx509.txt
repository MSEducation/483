The Columbia's heavy flow and extreme elevation drop over a short distance, [tpl]convert|2.16|ft/mi[/tpl], give it tremendous capacity for hydroelectricity generation. In comparison, the Mississippi drops less than [tpl]convert|0.65|ft/mi[/tpl]. The Columbia alone possesses one-third of the United States's hydroelectric potential.[tpl]cite book |last= Harden |first= Blaine |title= A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia |year= 1996 |publisher= W.W.

The largest of the 150 hydroelectric projects, the Grand Coulee Dam and the Chief Joseph Dam, are also the largest in the United States[tpl]cite web | title = Renewable Energy Sources: A Consumer's Guide | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy: Energy Information Administration |year = 2004 | url = ftp://ftp.eia.doe.gov/brochures/brochure/renew05/renewable.html | accessdate = 2007-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Chief Joseph Dam and Rufus Woods Lake | publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |date = November 19, 2003 | url = http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/report/chj.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-03[/tpl] and among the largest in the world.
Inexpensive hydropower supported the emergence of an extensive aluminum industry, which draws tremendous amounts of power. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17 percent of the world's aluminum and 40 percent of the aluminum produced in the U.S. But the commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry. By 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80 percent of its production capacity, and by 2003, the entire United States produced only 15 percent of the world's aluminum, with many smelters along the Columbia having gone dormant or out of business.
Power remains relatively inexpensive along the Columbia, and in recent years high-tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power.
Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.
In 1941, the BPA hired Oklahoma folksinger Woody Guthrie to write songs for a documentary film promoting the benefits of hydropower. In the month he spent traveling the region Guthrie wrote 26 songs, which have become an important part of the cultural history of the region.

==Ecology and environment==

===Fish migration===

The Columbia supports several species of anadromous fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and fresh water tributaries of the river. Sockeye salmon, Coho and Chinook (also known as "king") salmon, and steelhead, all of the genus Oncorhynchus, are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn.[tpl]cite web | title = Managing the Columbia River system to help fish| publisher = Bonneville Power Administration | url = http://efw.bpa.gov/IntegratedFWP/bg120106.pdf| year = 2006 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-09-04[/tpl] White sturgeon, which take 15 to 25 years to mature, typically migrate between the ocean and the upstream habitat several times during their lives.[tpl]cite web| title = White Sturgeon | url = http://www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_wsturg_fact.html | publisher = Pacific Coast Marine Habitat Program | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2009-09-04[/tpl]
Salmon populations declined dramatically after the establishment of canneries in 1867. By 1908, there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon. In that year, the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of Citizens' Initiatives limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers. Then in 1948, another initiative banned the use of seine nets (devices already used by Native Americans, and refined by later settlers) altogether.Smith, Courtland L.: Seine fishing  in the Oregon Encyclopedia
Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate.[tpl]cite book | last=Mueller | first=Ted | title=Fire, Faults, and Floods: A Road and Trail Guide Exploring the Origins of the Columbia River Basin | publisher=University of Idaho Press | location=Moscow, Idaho | year=1997 | page=229 | isbn = 978-0-89301-206-9[/tpl] In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.[tpl]cite web|title = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon | url = http://www.uppercolumbiasturgeon.org/ | publisher = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative | year=2007| accessdate = 2009-09-04[/tpl]
Not all fish have suffered from the modifications to the river; the northern pikeminnow (formerly known as the squawfish) thrives in the warmer, slower water created by the dams. Research in the mid-1980s found that juvenile salmon were suffering substantially from the predatory pikeminnow, and in 1990, in the interest of protecting salmon, a "bounty" program was established to reward anglers for catching pikeminnow.
In 1994, the salmon catch was smaller than usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among commercial fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. U.S. government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18 years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canadian border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed in part to the fishing ban.
Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first proposed the removal of several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called for the removal of certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227 major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, notably in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs currently limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5 million spring and summer Chinook Salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.

===Pollution===

In southeastern Washington, a [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] stretch of the river passes through the Hanford Site, established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project. The site served as a plutonium production complex, with nine nuclear reactors and related facilities located on the banks of the river. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived isotopes were not affected by this retention, and several terabecquerels entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000 curies of radioactive material into the Columbia.[tpl]cite web | last = Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility | title = Hanford History | date = 2007–2008| url = http://www.psr.org/chapters/washington/hanford/hanford-history.html | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s.[tpl]cite web | author = Hanford Health Information Network |year = 2000 | title = An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects | url = http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100823040735/http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html | archivedate = 2010-08-23 [/tpl] Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and Oregon coasts.[tpl]cite news | title = Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds | work = The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 | date = 1992-07-17 | accessdate = 2007-01-29[/tpl]
The nuclear reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War, and the Hanford site is now the focus of the world's largest environmental cleanup, managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency.[tpl]cite web | last = U.S. Department of Energy | authorlink = United States Department of Energy | title = Hanford Overview | year = 2008 | url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/HanfordOverview | accessdate = 2007-01-29[/tpl] Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270 billion US gallons (1 billion m3) of groundwater contaminated by high-level nuclear waste that has leaked out of Hanford's massive underground storage tanks. [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], 1 million US gallons (3,785 m3) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.[tpl]cite web | last = Washington Department of Ecology | authorlink = Washington Department of Ecology | title = Hanford Quick Facts | url = http://www.ecy.wa.gov/features/hanford/hanfordfacts.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812061411/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/features/hanford/hanfordfacts.html | archivedate = 2007-08-12[/tpl]
In addition to concerns about nuclear waste, numerous other pollutants are found in the river. These include chemical pesticides, bacteria, arsenic, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB).
Studies have also found significant levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality is also an important factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.[tpl]cite web | last = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | title = Columbia River Basin: A National Priority | year = 2008| url = http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/ecocomm.nsf/Columbia/Columbia | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl]
Timber industry activity further contaminates river water, notably in the increased sediment runoff that results from clearcuts. The Northwest Forest Plan, a piece of federal legislation from 1994, mandated that timber companies consider the environmental impacts of their practices on rivers like the Columbia.
On July 1, 2003, Christopher Swain of Portland, Oregon, became the first person to swim the Columbia River's entire length, in an effort to raise public awareness about the river's environmental health.

==Watershed==

Most of the Columbia's drainage basin (which, at [tpl]convert|258000|mi2|km2|disp=or[/tpl], is about the size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean drainage basin. The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains.[tpl]cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W. Meinig |title= The Great Columbia Plain |origyear= 1968 |edition= Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classic |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-97485-0 |page= 4[/tpl] Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, Glacier National Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from Western hemlock and Western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609 known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, Bald Eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) divides the waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three freshwater ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up about a third of the total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14 species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35 species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.[tpl]cite book |last= Abell |first= Robin A. |coauthors= David M. Olsen, Eric Dinerstein, Patrick T.

In 2000, about six million people lived within the Columbia's drainage basin. Of this total about 2.4 million people lived in Oregon, 1.7 million in Washington, 1 million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4 million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10 million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing just east of the Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly.[tpl]cite web | last = Bilby | first = Robert | coauthors = Hanna, Susan; Huntly, Nancy; et al. | title = Human Population Impacts on Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife | publisher = Independent Scientific Advisory Board | date = 2007-07-08 | url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/library/isab/isab2007-3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-09-15[/tpl]
Climate varies greatly from place to place within the watershed. Elevation ranges from sea level at the river mouth to more than [tpl]convert|14000|ft|m[/tpl] in the mountains, and temperatures vary with elevation. The highest peak is Mount Rainier, at [tpl]convert|14411|ft|m[/tpl]. High elevations have cold winters and short cool summers; interior regions are subject to great temperature variability and severe droughts. Over some of the watershed, especially west of the Cascade Mountains, precipitation maximums occur in winter, when Pacific storms come ashore. Atmospheric conditions block the flow of moisture in summer, which is generally dry except for occasional thunderstorms in the interior. In some of the eastern parts of the watershed, especially shrub-steppe regions with Continental climate patterns, precipitation maximums occur in early summer.[tpl]cite web |title= Columbia River Water Management Report, Chapter 2 |publisher= U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Water Management Division |year= 2005 |url= http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/crwmg/reports/bluebook/2005/Chapter2%202005.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate= 2008-09-19[/tpl] Annual precipitation varies from more than [tpl]convert|100|in|cm[/tpl] a year in the Cascades to less than [tpl]convert|8|in|cm[/tpl] in the interior.

Several major North American drainage basins and many minor ones share a common border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near the headwaters of the Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.[tpl]cite web | title = Watersheds (map) | publisher = Commission for Environmental Cooperation | year = 2006 | url = http://www.cec.org/naatlas/img/NA-Watersheds.gif |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227060842/http://www.cec.org/naatlas/img/NA-Watersheds.gif |archivedate = 2008-02-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Continental Divides in North Dakota and North America | work = North Dakota Geological Survey Newsletter | last = Gonzalez | first = Mark A. | year = 2003 | url = https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/NEWSLETTER/NLS03/pdf/Divide.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-09-12[/tpl]
Further north along the Continental Divide, a short portion of the combined Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie-Slave-Athabasca watershed, which empties into the Arctic Ocean.

Great Basin watersheds that share a border with the Columbia watershed include Harney Basin, Humboldt River, and Great Salt Lake. The associated triple divide points are Commissary Ridge North, Wyoming,[tpl]cite peakbagger |pid=5429 |name=Commissary Ridge North, Wyoming[/tpl] and Sproats Meadow Northwest, Oregon.[tpl]cite peakbagger |pid=3248 |name=Sproats Meadow Northwest, Oregon[/tpl] To the north, mostly in British Columbia, the Columbia watershed borders the Fraser River watershed.

===Major tributaries===

The river and the low hills are in shade, while the hilltops and a large hillside in the foreground are sunlit.| The Deschutes River at its confluence with the Columbia
The Columbia receives more than 60 significant tributaries. The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia (measured either by discharge or by size of watershed) are the Snake River (mostly in Idaho), the Willamette River (in northwest Oregon), the Kootenay River (mostly in British Columbia), and the Pend Oreille River (mostly in northern Washington and Idaho, also known as the lower part of the Clark Fork). Each of these four averages more than [tpl]convert|20000|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl] and drains an area of more than [tpl]convert|20000|mi2|km2[/tpl].
The Snake is by far the largest tributary. Its watershed of [tpl]convert|108000|mi2|km2[/tpl] is larger than the state of Idaho. Its discharge is roughly a third of the Columbia's at the rivers' confluence, but compared to the Columbia upstream of the confluence the Snake is longer (113%) and has a larger drainage basin (104%).
The Pend Oreille river system (including its main tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its discharge over a third (37%).Calculated mainly with data from: [tpl]cite web|url=http://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/search.jsp|title=Water-resources data for the United States, Water Year 2007|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]
