==History==

It was established in December 1946, and it was formed in 1956 by Seibu Department Stores, a group company of Seibu Railway. In 1980, Seiyu launched its private brand Mujirushi-Ryōhin (commonly known as MUJI outside Japan). MUJI was transferred to Ryohin-Keikakuhttp://ryohin-keikaku.jp/eng/corporate/history/index.html in 1990, and is not part of Seiyu.
On December 31, 2003, Seiyu and Walmart signed a partnership agreement in which Walmart would teach global supply chain practices.[tpl]cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The World is Flat|year=2006|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-29279-9|pages=166[/tpl] Numazu, Japan was the site of the first Seiyu store using Walmart methods.
