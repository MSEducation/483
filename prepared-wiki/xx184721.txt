On 3 December 2010 he scored the third goal in a 3–1 win over Internazionale with a free kick. He concluded the season with 11 goals equal to Lazio's best midfielder's goal scorer in one season, superstar Czech international Pavel Nedved. In 2012-13 Hernanes lived arguably his best season in Europe also thanks to a very good season of SS Lazio which would win the Coppa Italia in a showdown final against lifelong rivals A.S. Roma.
On October 7, 2012 Hernanes scored a scenic goal with a dipping 30-metre free kick against Pescara, on April 8, he scored one of best Serie A history goals on his left foot but later missed a crucial penalty as ten man Lazio drew with derby rivals A.S. Roma. During the 2013-2014 season Hernanes scored an unbelievable last-gasp goal against Udinese in his last match wearing the S.S. Lazio jersey.
During the winter transfer window indeed Hernanes left S.S. Lazio and joined Internazionale. Few minutes after what resulted to be his last training at S.S. Lazio, while heading home in his car the midfielder was stopped just right outside the training center by some unaware S.S. Lazio autograph hunters. Hernanes pulled up to them and after taking some pictures with the supporters bursted out crying and gave away his football boots to the fans without providing further explanations. The moment, which would eventually go viral on social networks and sport news, was caught and recorded by the fans who then realized that Hernanes would be leaving S.S. Lazio within hours and thanked the player for what he had achieved with the team and for his human values assuring him his name would go down in S.S. Lazio history.[tpl]YouTube|npASETLRyRI[/tpl] That same night Hernanes admitted to receiving more than 10.000 texts from S.S. Lazio fans who were expressing their solidarity to him and tributing him for his strong attachment to the team. According to Lazio supporters indeed Hernanes never wanted to leave S.S. Lazio but the president Claudio Lotito put him in the condition to leave so that the club could cash out his transfer.
