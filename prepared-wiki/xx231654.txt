[[Car supermarket]]

CATEGORIES: Auto dealerships

A car supermarket, also called a multi-make car dealer,auto superstore or car hypermarket, is a large independently owned, non francised motor car retail outlet. It may sell a mixture of used and new cars from various brands, especially new-to-three year old mass-market and ex-fleet vehicles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Most use a "no-haggle" pricing model. 
Car supermarkets typically have in excess of 350 cars in one location, and the largest ones have up to 4,000 cars. This compares to less than 100 - 200 cars in stock for an average dealer forecourt, and allows consumers to find a wider choice while reducing the need for aggressive sales techniques. The vehicles are typically priced lower than in smaller car dealerships, based on volume sales and economies of scale. Examples of car supermarkets are CarMax and AutoNation in the US, Wilsons of Epsom, Motorpoint, Cargiant, UnbeatableCar and Carcraft in the UK.
Unlike auto rows where multiple dealerships are clustered together, car supermarkets are a single company offering a spread of vehicles from most of the major manufactures, whilst some dealership groups advertise as having a large choice of vehicles in Group stock, often this translates to a small number of vehicles per location and should not be regarded as a car supermarket.
