Clawed lobsters comprise a family (Nephropidae, sometimes also Homaridae) of large marine crustaceans. They have long bodies with muscular tails, and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.geog.mcgill.ca/climatechange/ReportsMap/lobsterRpt.pdf |format=PDF |title=Homarus americanus, American lobster |date=27 June 2007 |publisher=McGill University[/tpl] Commercially important species include two species of Homarus from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi – the northern-hemisphere genus Nephrops and the southern-hemisphere genus Metanephrops. Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word "lobster" in their names, the unqualified term "lobster" generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae.[tpl]cite book |author=Thomas Scott |year=1996 |title=ABC Biologie |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110106619 |chapter=Lobster |page=703 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LorrYj5pkKYC&pg=PA703[/tpl] Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters. The closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.

==Description==

Lobsters are invertebrates with a hard protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, lobsters must moult in order to grow, which leaves them vulnerable. During the moulting process, several species change colour. Lobsters have 10 walking legs; the front three pairs bear claws, the first of which are larger than the others.[tpl]cite book |editor=Mark W. Denny & Steven Dean Gaines |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of tidepools and rocky shores |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25118-2 |author=Carlos Robles |chapter=Lobsters |pages=333–335 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uufQnE7MzMkC&pg=PA333 |accessdate=2013-07-27[/tpl] Although, like most other arthropods, lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical, some genera possess unequal, specialised claws.
Lobster anatomy includes the cephalothorax which fuses the head and the thorax, both of which are covered by a chitinous carapace, and the abdomen. The lobster's head bears antennae, antennules, mandibles, the first and second maxillae, and the first, second, and third maxillipeds. Because lobsters live in a murky environment at the bottom of the ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. The lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina. In contrast, most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators (lenses) and a concave retina.[tpl]cite journal |author=M. F. Land |title=Superposition images are formed by reflection in the eyes of some oceanic decapod Crustacea |journal=Nature |year=1976 |volume=263 |pages=764–765 |doi=10.1038/263764a0 |pmid=995187 |issue=5580[/tpl] The abdomen includes swimmerets and its tail is composed of uropods and the telson.
Lobsters, like snails and spiders, have blue blood due to the presence of haemocyanin which contains copper.[tpl]cite web |url=http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/cda/11-14/biology/copch31pg1.html |title=Copper for life – Vital copper |publisher=Association for Science Education[/tpl] In contrast, vertebrates and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich haemoglobin. Lobsters possess a green hepatopancreas, called the tomalley by chefs, which functions as the animal's liver and pancreas.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=b314101b&JournalCode=JA |doi=10.1039/b314101b |title=Arsenic speciation in marine certified reference materials |year=2004 |author=Shona Mcsheehy & Zoltán Mester |journal=Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry |volume=19 |pages=373–380 |issue=3[/tpl]
Lobsters of the family Nephropidae are similar in overall form to a number of other related groups. They differ from freshwater crayfish in lacking the joint between the last two segments of the thorax,[tpl]cite journal |author=Dale Tshudy & Loren E. Babcock |year=1997 |title=Morphology-based phylogenetic analysis of the clawed lobsters (family Nephropidae and the new family Chilenophoberidae) |journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=253–263 |jstor=1549275[/tpl] and they differ from the reef lobsters of the family Enoplometopidae in having full claws on the first three pairs of legs, rather than just one. The distinctions from fossil families such as Chilenophoberidae are based on the pattern of grooves on the carapace.

==Longevity==

Large lobsters are estimated to have aged up to 60 years old, although determining age is difficult.[tpl]cite journal |author=T. Wolff |journal=Crustaceana |volume=34 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.2307/20103244 |year=1978 |title=Maximum size of lobsters (Homarus) (Decapoda, Nephropidae)[/tpl]
Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This longevity may be due to telomerase, an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromsomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrate during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and It's Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407-425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 [/tpl] However, unlike most vertebrate, Lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wolfram Klapper, Karen Kühne, Kumud K. Singh, Klaus Heidorn, Reza Parwaresch & Guido Krupp |year=1998 |title=Longevity of lobsters is linked to ubiquitous telomerase expression |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=439 |issue=1–2 |pages=143–146 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01357-X[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/marine-life/400-pound-lobster.htm/printable |title=Is there a 400 pound lobster out there? |author=Jacob Silverman |publisher=howstuffworks[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Consider the Lobster and Other Essays |author=David Foster Wallace |publisher=Little, Brown & Company |year=2005 |isbn=0-316-15611-6 |chapter=Consider the Lobster |chapterurl=http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2004/08/consider_the_lobster?currentPage=1 |authorlink=David Foster Wallace[/tpl]

==Ecology==

Lobsters are found in all oceans. They live on rocky, sandy, or muddy bottoms from the shoreline to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. They generally live singly in crevices or in burrows under rocks.
Lobsters are omnivores and typically eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. They scavenge if necessary, and are known to resort to cannibalism in captivity. However, when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs, this is not necessarily evidence of cannibalism - lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=533 |title=Homarus americanus, Atlantic lobster |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |publisher=MarineBio.org[/tpl] While cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations, it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in Maine, where it is theorized that these first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild can be attributed to a local population explosion among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the Maine lobsters' natural predators.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/03/us-usa-lobster-idUSBRE8B21CH20121203 |title=Cruel new fact of crustacean life: lobster cannibalism |author=Jason McLure |publisher=Reuters |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2012[/tpl]
In general, lobsters are [tpl]convert|25|-|50|cm|0|in[/tpl] long, and move by slowly walking on the sea floor. However, when they flee, they swim backward quickly by curling and uncurling their abdomen. A speed of [tpl]convert|5|m/s|mph[/tpl] has been recorded.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osl.gc.ca/homard/en/faq.html |title=The American lobster – frequently asked questions |publisher=St. Lawrence Observatory, Fisheries and Oceans Canada |date=October 19, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100310113207/http://www.osl.gc.ca/homard/en/faq.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] This is known as the caridoid escape reaction.
Symbiotic animals of the genus Symbion, the only member of the phylum Cycliophora, live exclusively on lobster gills and mouthparts.[tpl]cite journal |author=M. Obst, P. Funch & G. Giribet |year=2005 |title=Hidden diversity and host specificity in cycliophorans: a phylogeographic analysis along the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea |journal=Molecular Ecology |pmid=16313603 |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=4427–4440 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02752.x[/tpl] Different species of Symbion have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the north Atlantic Ocean – Nephrops norvegicus, Homarus gammarus and Homarus americanus.

Lobster recipes include Lobster Newberg and Lobster Thermidor. Lobster is used in soup, bisque, lobster rolls, and cappon magro. Lobster meat may be dipped in clarified butter, resulting in a sweetened flavour.
According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the mean level of mercury in American lobster is 0.31 ppm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm115644.htm |title=Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=December 25, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130306184953/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm115644.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===History===

In North America, the American lobster did not achieve popularity until the mid-19th century, when New Yorkers and Bostonians developed a taste for it, and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after the development of the lobster smack,[tpl]cite book |author=Colin Woodard |url=http://www.colinwoodard.com/lobstercoast |title=The Lobster Coast |publisher=New York: Viking/Penguin |isbn=0-670-03324-3 |year=2004 |pages=170–180[/tpl] a custom-made boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during transport.[tpl]cite web | title=The Lobster Institute: History | work=The Lobster Institute at the University of Maine | url=http://www.lobster.um.maine.edu/index.php?page=52 | accessdate=2012-06-11 [/tpl] Prior to this time, lobster was considered a mark of poverty or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes, and servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article581926.ece |title=How lobster went up in the world |publisher=The Times |date=October 24, 2005 |location=London |author=Mark Henderson |accessdate=May 11, 2010[/tpl] Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/sos/kids/about/lobster.htm |work=All About Maine |title=Lobster |publisher=Secretary of State of Maine |accessdate=July 29, 2013[/tpl] American lobster was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait, and it was not until well into the twentieth century that it was viewed as more than a low-priced canned staple food.[tpl]cite book|first=Paul |last=Johnson |title=Fish Forever: The Definitive Guide to Understanding, Selecting, and Preparing Healthy, Delicious, and Environmentally Sustainable Seafood | chapter=Lobster | publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7645-8779-5|pages=163–175[/tpl]

===Grading===

Caught lobsters are graded as new-shell, hard-shell or old-shell, and because lobsters which have recently shed their shells are the most delicate, there is an inverse relationship between the price of American lobster and its flavour. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate that even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. Hard-shell lobsters with firm shells, but with less sweet meat, can survive shipping to Boston, New York and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour, can be air-shipped anywhere in the world and arrive alive, making them the most-expensive. One seafood guide notes that an eight-dollar lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in Maine is consistently delicious, while "the eighty-dollar lobster in a three-star Paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as flavor".

==Welfare==

The most common way of killing a lobster is by placing it live in boiling water, sometimes after having been placed in a freezer for a period of time.  Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in half lengthwise. Lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (pithing), in the belief that this will stop suffering. However, a lobster's brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death or unconsciousness. The boiling method is illegal in some places, such as in Reggio Emilia, Italy, where offenders face fines of up to €495.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1456270/Italian-animal-rights-law-puts-lobster-off-the-menu.html |title=Italian animal rights law puts lobster off the menu |author=Bruce Johnston |date=March 6, 2004 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |location=London[/tpl]
A device called the "CrustaStun" has been invented to electrocute shellfish such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish before cooking. The device works by applying a 110 volt, 2–5 amp electrical charge to the animal. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/ill-have-my-lobster-electrocuted-please-1824925.html|title=I'll have my lobster electrocuted, please|author=McSmith, A.|publisher=The Independent (Newspaper)|year=2009|accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1324142/CrustaStun-The-humane-gadget-kills-lobsters-single-jolt-electricity.html|title=CrustaStun: The 'humane' gadget that kills lobsters with a single jolt of electricity|author=Anon.|publisher=MailOnline (Newspaper)|year=2010|accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl]

==Fishery and aquaculture==

Lobsters are caught using baited, one-way traps with a colour-coded marker buoy to mark cages. Lobster is fished in water between [tpl]convert|1|and|500|fathom|m|sigfig=1[/tpl], although some lobsters live at [tpl]convert|2000|fathom|m[/tpl]. Cages are of plastic-coated galvanised steel or wood. A lobster fisher may tend as many as 2,000 traps. Around the year 2000, due to overfishing and high demand, lobster aquaculture expanded.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.uwphoto.no/articles_folder/lobster_farming_in_Norway.htm |author=Asbjørn Drengstig, Tormod Drengstig & Tore S. Kristiansen |publisher=UWPhoto ANS |title=Recent development on lobster farming in Norway – prospects and possibilities[/tpl] As of 2008, no lobster aquaculture operation had achieved commercial success, due mainly to the fact that lobsters eat each other (cannibalism) and the slow growth of the species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gma.org/lobsters/trivia.html |title=Riddles, Trivia and More |publisher=Gulf of Maine Research Institute |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |date=February 24, 2012[/tpl]
