According to the opening credits, Grand Canyon is "a pictorial interpretation of Ferde Grof√©'s Grand Canyon Suite", much as the animated segments in Fantasia are pictorial representations of music, and the film is strongly related to its soundtrack.
The film has no live actors, no dialogue, and no narration, only musical accompaniment.
