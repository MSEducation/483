==Writing and inspiration==

During an interview for The Guardian on 13 December 2010, Li said of the song:
 "A lot of people think it's about sex. ... But it's about power. I was reading the Murakami book The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, where she goes into this guy's mind by making him fantasize about her, so it's kind of like powerplay. As soon as a woman does anything, they seem to hit a nerve and it's back to sex. At least men seem to think that."[tpl]cite web |last=Nicholson |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/13/lykke-li-interview-twilight-kanye-west |title=Lykke Li: 'I'm intense, and I get psychopathic, too' |work=The Guardian |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011[/tpl]
