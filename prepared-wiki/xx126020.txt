The Ozark Wildcat was a wooden roller coaster at Celebration City in Branson, Missouri. As of December, 2012, Ozark Wildcat still stands. Ozark Wildcat's coaster train was sold to Dollywood.

==Rider Experience==

Once riders were carried out of the station, they entered a slow helix turn and the train went up into the chain lift. After the lift, a short dip was followed by a steep helix turn-drop. Many bunny-hops provided plenty of "air-time" while the padded seats of the coaster still provided a smooth ride. A large, fast, helix and a sudden drop proclaimed the final act before the train rolled into the train shack, turned 90 degrees to the right, and entered the loading station. The safety restraints automatically released, and after detaching precautionary seat belts, riders were free to exit the ride.
