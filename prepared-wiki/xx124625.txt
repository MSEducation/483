The following is a partial list of border incidents involving North Korea since the Korean Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953, ended large scale military action of the Korean War.  Most of these incidents took place near either the Korean Demilitarized Zone or the Northern Limit Line. This list includes engagements on land, air, and sea, but does not include alleged incursions and terrorist incidents that occurred away from the border.
Many of the incidents occurring at sea are due to border disputes.  In 1977 North Korea claimed an Exclusive Economic Zone over a large area south of the disputed western maritime border, the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea.[tpl]cite report |url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/mcrm/korea_north.pdf |title=Maritime Claims Reference Manual - Korea, Democratic People's Republic of (North Korea) |date=June 23, 2005 |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |id=DoD 2005.1-M |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120915174104/http://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/mcrm/korea_north.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15[/tpl] This is a prime fishing area, particularly for crabs, and clashes commonly occur.
