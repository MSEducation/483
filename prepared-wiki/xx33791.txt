In ancient Latvia, Ziemassvētki (Winter holiday) was a festival, celebrated on 22 December, which was one of the two most important holidays, the other being Jāņi. Ziemassvētki celebrated the Winter Solstice.[tpl]Citation |last= Mellēna|first= Māra|year=2000 |title= Latvian Seasonal Holidays|publisher= The Latvian Institute|publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.rsu.lv/eng/images/Documents/Publications/Latvian_Seasonal_Holidays.pd|accessdate=October 4, 2013 [/tpl] The two weeks before Ziemassvetki are called Veļu laiks, the "season of ghosts." Three postage stamps were issued on 3 December 2005 to commemorate this festival.
During the festival, candles are lit for Dieviņš and a fire is kept burning until the end, when its extinguishing signals an end to the unhappiness of the previous year.  During the ensuing feast, a space at the table is reserved for Ghosts, who was said to arrive on a sleigh.  During the feast, certain foods are always eaten: bread, beans, peas, pork and pig snout and feet.  Carolers (Budeļi) go door to door singing songs and eating from many different houses.  Celebrants believe that during the feast ghosts arrive on a sleigh.
