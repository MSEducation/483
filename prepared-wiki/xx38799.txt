Eta Canis Majoris (η CMa, η Canis Majoris) is a star in the constellation Canis Major.  It has the traditional name Aludra. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
The name Aludra originates from the Arabic: عذرا al-‘aðrā "the virgin".  This star, along with ε CMa (Adhara), δ CMa (Wezen) and ο2 CMa (Thanih al Adzari), were Al ʽAdhārā (ألعذاري), the Virgins.

AEEA opinion is, δ Velorum is member of [tpl]lang|zh|天社[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|zh-Latn|Tiān Shè[/tpl]), meaning Celestial Earth God's Temple asterism and ω Velorum is not member of any asterisms. 天社 (Tiān Shè) is westernized into Tseen She and R.H.Allen used the term Tseen She for Chinese name of η Carinae.

==Properties==

Aludra shines brightly in the skies in spite of a large distance from Earth due to being intrinsically many times brighter (absolute magnitude) than the Sun.  A blue-white supergiant of spectral type B5Ia, Aludra has a luminosity 176,000 times and a diameter around 80 times that of the sun.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jerzykiewicz, M.; Molenda-Zakowicz, J.|year=2000|title=Empirical Luminosities and Radii of Early-Type Stars after Hipparcos|journal=Acta Astronomica|volume=50|pages=369–80 |url=http://acta.astrouw.edu.pl/Vol50/n3/pap_50_3_5.pdf|bibcode=2000AcA....50..369J[/tpl] It has only been around a fraction of the time our Sun has, yet is already in the last stages of its life.  It is still expanding and may become a red supergiant, or perhaps has already passed that phase, but in either case it will become a supernova within the next few million years.
Aludra is classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +2.38 to +2.48 over a period of 4.7 days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=5506 |title=Eta Canis Majoris |author =Watson, Christopher |date=3 May 2013 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]

==Namesakes==

Both USS Aludra (AF-55) and USS Aludra (AK-72), a Crater class cargo ship, were United States Navy vessels named after the star.
