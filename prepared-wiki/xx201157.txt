==History==

Berliner Tor S-Bahn station opened in 1906.
The original Berliner Tor U-Bahn station was designed by the architect, Erich Elingius, and built between 1908 and 1910, opening on 1 March 1912. It had a brick wall on the North, and some glass walls on the South.
During the Battle of Berlin in 1943, the damage to the station was so great that the U-Bahn was no longer able to serve the line. On 19 January 1948, the station re-opened as a terminus for trains to Barmbek via Schlump, and from 1 July 1949, trains continued again to Mundsburg.
From 1962 to 1964, a new station complex was built to the North of the old one, and it opened on 10 May 1964, after which the old building was demolished.[tpl]Cite web | last =Schomacker | first =Marcus | title =Berliner Tor | work =Hamburgs S-Bahnhöfe: Die City-S-Bahn | publisher =Marcus Schomacker | date = 20 August 2008 | url =http://www.hamburger-untergrundbahn.de/met-hh-bta.htm | accessdate =13 January 2011 [/tpl] Between 1964 and 1966, the station was expanded from two platforms to four.
