A general circulation model (GCM), a type of climate model, is a mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean and based on the Navier–Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for complex computer programs commonly used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of global climate models along with sea ice and land-surface components. GCMs and global climate models are widely applied for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and projecting climate change.  Versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were originally created by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html |title=: The First Climate Model |publisher=NOAA 200th Celebration |year=2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010 [/tpl] These computationally intensive numerical models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical, chemical, and sometimes biological equations.

==Note on nomenclature==

The initialism GCM stands originally for general circulation model.  Recently, a second meaning has come into use, namely global climate model.  While these do not refer to the same thing, General Circulation Models are typically the tools used for modelling climate, and hence the two terms are sometimes used as if they were interchangeable. However, the term "global climate model" is ambiguous, and may refer to an integrated framework incorporating multiple components which may include a general circulation model, or may refer to the general class of climate models that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically with differing levels of detail.

==History: general circulation models==

In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips's work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.  By the early 1980s, the United States' National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s.[tpl]cite web|last=Collins|first=William D. |title=Description of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0)|url=http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/description/description.pdf|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|accessdate=3 January 2011|coauthors=et al.|date=June 2004[/tpl]  In 1996, efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types, which led to more realistic forecasts.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.geog.ucla.edu/~yxue/pdf/1996jgr.pdf |title=Impact of vegetation properties on U.S. summer weather prediction|page=7419|author=Xue, Yongkang and Michael J.

Now, gravity waves are required within global climate models to simulate regional and global scale circulations accurately, though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated.[tpl]cite book|page=188|title=A climate modelling primer|author=McGuffie, K. and A.

==Atmospheric vs oceanic models==

There are both atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) and oceanic GCMs (OGCMs). An AGCM and an OGCM can be coupled together to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (CGCM or AOGCM). With the addition of other components (such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land), the AOGCM becomes the basis for a full climate model. Within this structure, different variations can exist, and their varying response to climate change may be studied (e.g., Sun and Hansen, 2003).

==Modelling trends==

A recent trend in GCMs is to apply them as components of Earth system models, e.g. by coupling to ice sheet models for the dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and one or more chemical transport models (CTMs) for species important to climate. Thus a carbon CTM may allow a GCM to better predict changes in carbon dioxide concentrations resulting from changes in anthropogenic emissions. In addition, this approach allows accounting for inter-system feedback: e.g. chemistry-climate models allow the possible effects of climate change on the recovery of the ozone hole to be studied.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theozonehole.com/climate.htm |title=Tango in the Atmosphere: Ozone and Climate Change |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |accessdate=20 April 2010 |date=February 2004 |first=Jeannie |last=Allen [/tpl]
Climate prediction uncertainties depend on uncertainties in chemical, physical, and social models (see IPCC scenarios below).[ref]
</ref> Progress has been made in incorporating more realistic chemistry and physics in the models, but significant uncertainties and unknowns remain, especially regarding the future course of human population, industry, and technology.
Note that many simpler levels of climate model exist; some are of only heuristic interest, while others continue to be scientifically relevant.

==Model structure==

Three-dimensional (more properly four-dimensional) GCMs discretise the equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time. They also contain parameterisations for processes – such as convection – that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly. More sophisticated models may include representations of the carbon and other cycles.
A simple general circulation model (SGCM), a minimal GCM, consists of a dynamical core that relates material properties such as temperature to dynamical properties such as pressure and velocity. Examples are programs that solve the primitive equations, given energy input into the model, and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction, so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are the ones most strongly attenuated. Such models may be used to study atmospheric processes within a simplified framework but are not suitable for future climate projections.
Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere (and typically contain a land-surface model as well) and impose sea surface temperatures (SSTs). A large amount of information including model documentation is available from AMIP.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/index.php |title=Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project |publisher=The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=21 April 2010 [/tpl] They may include atmospheric chemistry.
A GCM contains a number of prognostic equations that are stepped forward in time (typically winds, temperature, moisture, and surface pressure) together with a number of diagnostic equations that are evaluated from the simultaneous values of the variables. As an example, pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the hydrostatic equation to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest. The pressure diagnosed in this way then is used to compute the pressure gradient force in the time-dependent equation for the winds.
Oceanic GCMs (OGCMs) model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may or may not contain a sea ice model. For example, the standard resolution of HadOM3 is 1.25 degrees in latitude and longitude, with 20 vertical levels, leading to approximately 1,500,000 variables.
Coupled atmosphere–ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) (e.g. HadCM3, GFDL CM2.X) combine the two models. They thus have the advantage of removing the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface. These models are the basis for sophisticated model predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the IPCC.
AOGCMs represent the pinnacle of complexity in climate models and internalise as many processes as possible. They are the only tools that could provide detailed regional predictions of future climate change. However, they are still under development. The simpler models are generally susceptible to simple analysis and their results are generally easy to understand. AOGCMs, by contrast, are often nearly as hard to analyse as the real climate system.

===Model grids===

The fluid equations for AGCMs are discretised using either the finite difference method or the spectral method. For finite differences, a grid is imposed on the atmosphere.  The simplest grid uses constant angular grid spacing (i.e., a latitude / longitude grid), however, more sophisticated non-rectantangular grids (e.g., icosahedral) and grids of variable resolutionC.

See also Christiane Jablonowski, Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) for Weather and Climate Models page (Retrieved 24 July 2010) are more often used.NCAR Command Language documentation: Non-uniform grids that NCL can contour (Retrieved 24 July 2010) The "LMDz" model can be arranged to give high resolution over any given section of the planet. HadGEM1 (and other ocean models) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for ENSO. Spectral models generally use a gaussian grid, because of the mathematics of transformation between spectral and grid-point space. Typical AGCM resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude: the Hadley Centre model HadCM3, for example, uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude, giving a grid of 96 by 73 points (96 x 72 for some variables); and has 19 levels in the vertical. This results in approximately 500,000 "basic" variables, since each grid point has four variables (u,v, T, Q), though a full count would give more (clouds; soil levels). HadGEM1 uses a grid of 1.875 degrees in longitude and 1.25 in latitude in the atmosphere; HiGEM, a high-resolution variant, uses 1.25 x 0.83 degrees respectively. These resolutions are lower than is typically used for weather forecasting.[tpl]cite web|title=Mesoscale modelling|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/science/creating/hoursahead/mesoscale.html|accessdate=5 October 2010[/tpl] Ocean resolutions tend to be higher, for example HadCM3 has 6 ocean grid points per atmospheric grid point in the horizontal.
For a standard finite difference model, uniform gridlines converge towards the poles. This would lead to computational instabilities (see CFL condition) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles. Ocean models suffer from this problem too, unless a rotated grid is used in which the North Pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass. Spectral models do not suffer from this problem. There are experiments using geodesic grids and icosahedral grids, which (being more uniform) do not have pole-problems. Another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a Cartesian cube such that it covers the surface of a sphere.[tpl]cite web|title=Gridding the sphere|url=http://mitgcm.org/projects/cubedsphere/|work=MIT GCM|accessdate=9 September 2010[/tpl]

===Flux buffering===

Some early incarnations of AOGCMs required a somewhat ad hoc process of "flux correction" to achieve a stable climate (not all model groups used this technique).  This resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models each having a different implicit flux from the other component than the other component could actually provide. If uncorrected this could lead to a dramatic drift away from observations in the coupled model. However, if the fluxes were 'corrected', the problems in the model that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised and that might affect the model sensitivity. As a result, there has always been a strong disincentive to use flux corrections, and the vast majority of models used in the current round of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not use them. The model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary are various, but include improved ocean physics, improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean, and more physically consistent coupling between atmosphere and ocean models.
Confidence in model projections is increased by the improved performance of several models that do not use flux adjustment. These models now maintain stable, multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate change projections.[tpl]cite web|title=IPCC Third Assessment Report - Climate Change 2001 - Complete online versions|url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/309.htm|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl]

===Convection===

Moist convection causes the release of latent heat and is important to the Earth's energy budget. Convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models, and hence it must be parameterized. This has been done since the earliest days of climate modelling, in the 1950s. Akio Arakawa did much of the early work, and variants of his scheme are still used,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/arakawa.htm |title=Arakawa's Computation Device |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl] although there are a variety of different schemes now in use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://grads.iges.org/reps/rep27/colarep27.html |title=COLA Report 27 |publisher=Grads.iges.org |date=1996-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/amip/10Tbl2.10.html |title=Table 2-10 |publisher=Pcmdi.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://rainbow.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/cmip/table4.html |title=Table of Rudimentary CMIP Model Features |publisher=Rainbow.llnl.gov |date=2004-12-02 |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl]  Clouds are typically parametrized, not because their physical processes are poorly understood, but because they occur on a scale smaller than the resolved scale of most GCMs. The causes and effects of their small scale actions on the large scale are represented by large scale parameters, hence "parameterization". The fact that cloud processes are not perfectly parameterized is due in part to a lack of understanding of clouds, but not due to some inherent shortcoming of the method.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of the Atmosphere |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl]

===Output variables===

Most models include software to diagnose a wide range of variables for comparison with observations or study of processes within the atmosphere.  An example is the 1.5-metre temperature, which is the standard height for near-surface observations of air temperature.  This temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from the surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures.  Other software is used for creating plots and animations.
