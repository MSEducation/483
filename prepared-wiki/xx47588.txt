The Sudbury Valley School was founded in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sudburypress.com/home?page=shop.product_details&product_id=38|title=Announcing a New Schoolâ€¦|author=Greenberg, D. |year=2007|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press[/tpl] United States. There are now over 35 schools based on the Sudbury Model in the United States, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The model has three basic tenets: educational freedom, democratic governance and personal responsibility. It is a private school, attended by children from the ages of 4 to 19.
At the Sudbury Valley School, students individually decide what to do with their time, and learn as an aside to their personal efforts, interactions and ordinary experience, rather than through classes or a standard curriculum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sudval.org/01_abou_02.html |title=Sudbury Valley School: About Us |accessdate=2009-02-28 [/tpl]

==Facilities==

Following the educational philosophy, the school facilities are somewhat different from most schools. The furnishings of the school as much as one would expect in a home; comfortable chairs, couches, books lining the walls. There are no traditional classrooms and no traditional classes; instead children are free to explore any subject or talk to any staff member about an interest, as part of educating themselves.Hara Estroff Marano: Psychology Today Magazine: Education: Class Dismissed. May/Jun 2006.

==Curriculum==

The school has no required academic activities, and no academic expectations for completion of one's time at the school. Students are free to spend their time as they wish.The Sudbury Valley School Handbook.

==Government==

Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equals. The corporation is wholly owned and operated by the School Meeting, in which each student and each elected member of the staff has one vote.How the School is Governed, from the school's web pageThe By-Laws of the Sudbury Valley School, Inc.

==Staff==

There is no tenure at Sudbury Valley School. The School Meeting, with each participant receiving one vote, hires staff, as part of its duties in running the school. Every year, in the spring, elections are held for next year's staff. Anyone who wants to serve has to place their names in nomination. The School Meeting debates the school's staff needs, and discusses each candidate in turn. There is an election with secret paper ballots which is open to all students and staff. Staff are not chosen solely through this election; rather, staff candidates must meet a threshold of support in the election in order to be hired, but they are hired at a School Meeting.

==Alumni==

Sudbury Valley School has published two studies of their alumni over the past forty years. They have learned, among other things, that about 80% of their students have graduated from college,[tpl]cite web |url=http://sudburypress.com/home?page=shop.product_details&product_id=31 |title=Legacy of Trust |author=Greenberg, D |coauthors=Sadofsky, M |year=1992 |publisher=The Sudbury Valley School Press[/tpl] and that they have gone on to become successful in many areas of life.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sudburypress.com/home?page=shop.product_details&product_id=40 |title= The Pursuit of Happiness: The Lives of Sudbury Valley Alumni|last= Greenberg|first= D,|coauthors=Sadofsky, M.; Lempka, J. |year= 2005 |publisher= Sudbury Valley School Press|location= United States|isbn= 1-888947-25-X[/tpl] There have, as yet, been no formal studies of graduates of other Sudbury schools, but anecdotally, they seem to have similar results.Greenberg, D.
