[[Kutin language]]

CATEGORIES: Adamawa languages, Languages of Cameroon

Kutin is a member of the Duru branch of Savanna languages. Most Nigerian speakers moved to Cameroon when the Gashaka-Gumti National Park was established.
Blench (2004) considers the three varieties, Peere, Potopo (Kotopo), and Patapori, to be separate languages.
