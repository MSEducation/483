[[List of actors considered for the James Bond character]]

CATEGORIES: James Bond lists, Lists of actors by role

This is a list of actors who were considered for the role of James Bond, both officially (auditioned by the film producers) and unofficially (supported by fans and celebrities) considered for the role of agent 007.

==Considered==

Both Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were linked to the role at least a decade before taking it but declined for various reasons.
Dalton was offered the role in 1967 at the age of 21 and finally took the role 20 years later. Dalton denied the offer again in 1979 because he felt the plot directions of the Bond films were becoming less realistic and more dependent on gadgetry and repeated plot formulas.
Both Roger Moore and Dalton also did not accept the role for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, feeling that they did not want to be viewed as the man who replaced Sean Connery. Pierce Brosnan was chosen as Bond for The Living Daylights, but had to leave the role because the show Remington Steele had been renewed, as Brosnan played the lead role. The role then went to Dalton. Brosnan made his debut as Bond in GoldenEye.

==In Bond films==

The following actors were considered for the role of James Bond, but were cast supporting or opposing characters.
Colin Salmon was also rumoured to be one of many actors to replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, a role that would go to Daniel Craig. Had he been chosen for the role, Salmon would have been the first black Bond. Brosnan has backed Salmon as a possible successor to Craig.[tpl]cite news |title=Pierce Brosnan backs first black James Bond |author=James Lachno and PA |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 April 2013 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/9991891/Pierce-Brosnan-backs-first-black-James-Bond.html |location=London[/tpl]
