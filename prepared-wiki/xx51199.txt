The Terminator series is a science fiction franchise encompassing a series of films and additional media concerning battles between Skynet's artificially intelligent machine network, and John Connor's Resistance forces and the rest of the human race.
Skynet's most well-known products in its genocidal goals are the various terminator models, such as the original "Terminator" character, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first film. Schwarzenegger also portrayed other Terminator characters; however, it is made clear that these are different units. The latest film in the franchise is Terminator Salvation, released in 2009 while Terminator: Genesis, the reboot of the series, is due for release in 2015.

==Premise==

The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the human race and the self-aware artificial intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film as a U.S. strategic defense computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware and, on perceiving all humans as a threat, seeks to wipe out humanity itself. It initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia, ensuring a devastating counter strike and a nuclear holocaust, wiping out much of humanity instantly. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability, which includes the Terminators used against individual human targets, and proceeds to fight a war against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have organized militarily into the Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of time travel, and both it and the Resistance seek to use it to win the war by preventing or forestalling their present timeline.
=== Judgment Day === 
In the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical Day of Judgment) is referred to as the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, decides to exterminate mankind, and launches the attack on Russia. Due to the element of time travel and the consequent ability to change the future, several dates are given for Judgment Day during the franchise. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines shows that the Judgment Day holocaust has been postponed to July 25, 2004. In Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Judgment Day was delayed to April 21, 2011, due to the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in T2.
The passing of the final date for Judgment Day on April 21, 2011, prompted BBC News to pose the question, "How close were the Terminator films to the reality of 2011?", comparing how far present day technology and society had developed compared to the predictions of the franchise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13159616|title=How close were the Terminator films to the reality of 2011?|date=April 21, 2011|work=BBC News[/tpl]

==Films==

===The Terminator===

The Terminator is a 1984 science fiction film released by Orion Pictures, co-written and directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. It is the first work in the Terminator franchise. In the film, machines take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops cyborg assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named John Connor starts the Tech-Com resistance to defeat them and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor, before he is born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded. With the fate of humanity at stake, John sends soldier Kyle Reese back to protect his mother and ensure his own existence.
=== Terminator 2: Judgment Day === 
Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the 1991 sequel to the original Terminator film released by TriStar Pictures. It is co-written, directed, and produced by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick. After the machines failed to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attempting to kill him as a child with a more advanced terminator, the T-1000. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, identical to the one from the previous film. After eleven years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the machines used on her: prevent Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it.

===Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines===

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is the 2003 sequel to Terminator 2 released by Warner Bros. domestically and Columbia Pictures internationally, directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken. As a result of the destruction of Cyberdyne at the end of T2, the Skynet takeover has been postponed, not averted. In a last attempt to ensure a victory by the machines, a new terminator, the T-X, is sent back to kill as many of John Connor's future lieutenants as possible, including John Connor and his future wife Kate Brewster. After the future Connor is terminated by a version of his previous protector, Kate reprograms it and sends it back to save them both from the T-X.

===Terminator Salvation===

Terminator Salvation is the fourth installment of the Terminator film series, made by The Halcyon Company and again distributed by Warner and Columbia, and with an original release on May 21, 2009.

===Cultural impact===

The Terminator franchise has had a significant impact on popular culture, most notably James Cameron’s original films, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The film franchise placed #17 on the top 25 greatest film franchises of all time by IGN[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/749/749005p1.html|title=Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #17|publisher=IGN|work=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=December 4, 2006[/tpl] and is also in the top 25 grossing franchises of all time. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the Terminator franchise is the sixth highest rated franchise on the site behind the Toy Story franchise, the Dollars trilogy, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the Mad Max franchise, and the Star Wars trilogy, but in front of the Indiana Jones franchise.
The Terminator has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "Culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/30/DDB91515MB.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Library of Congress adds 'Terminator' to archive | date=December 31, 2008[/tpl] The American Film Institute (AFI) has also recognized both films on a number of occasions:  the line "I'll be back" from The Terminator placed as the 37th best movie quote of all time, while "Hasta la vista, baby" from Part 2 ranked 76th on the same list. The Terminator character from The Terminator was voted the 22nd villain of all time; meanwhile, the T-800 (of the same likeness) in Terminator 2: Judgment Day was voted the 48th hero of all time on the 100 Heroes and Villains list; this is the only time the same character has appeared thusly on the two opposing lists. In the 100 Years...100 series list, the Terminator franchise was voted the 42nd most thrilling of all time. Finally, Terminator 2: Judgment Day ranked 8th on AFI's top 10 list in the science fiction genre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/PageServer?pagename=100YearsList |title=American Film Institute: |publisher=Connect.afi.com |accessdate=January 14, 2012[/tpl]
Both films were subject to numerous pop culture references, such as the use of "I’ll be back" in countless other media, including different variations of the phrase by Arnold himself in many of his subsequent films, including The Running Man,The Terminator (1984) - Connections - IMDb and several cameo appearances by Robert Patrick as the T-1000, in The Last Action Hero and Wayne's World. The Simpsons have also spoofed both films, and the T-1000 in particular, on a number of occasions.Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) - Connections - IMDb
In terms of critical reception, the first two films also stand out. Terminator 2 is thus far the only film in the series to garner attention of the Academy Award (6 nominations and 4 wins).[tpl]IMDb title|103064|Terminator 2: Judgment Day|section=awards[/tpl] In addition to being rated highly among top critics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com |title=Movies | Movie Trailers | Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 14, 2012[/tpl] Total Film has rated The Terminator the 72nd best film ever made, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day the 33rd. Both films are consistently featured on IMDb’s Top 250 list.IMDb Top 250 - IMDb
All four Terminator films have had very respectable box office gross, though after James Cameron left the series it saw diminishing returns in subsequent films. The Terminator made $78 million worldwide, far surpassing its $6 million budget and becoming a major sleeper hit. Terminator 2: Judgment Day grossed approximately $520 million globally, becoming a major blockbuster and the top-grossing film of 1991. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines did not fare as well, with $433 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2003. Terminator Salvation grossed an estimated $371 million worldwide, a figure below industry expectations and the lowest of any of the sequels in the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=terminator.htm |title=Terminator Moviesat the Box Office |publisher=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=January 14, 2012[/tpl]
