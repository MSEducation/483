Amos Marsh, Jr. (May 7, 1939 – 1992) was a professional American football running back in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions.  He played college football at Oregon State University. Amos attended, and graduated from high school at Wallowa High School in Wallowa, Oregon, as did his brother Frank. Frank also went on to play professional football and then into professional basketball.

==Early years==

Marsh was the starting running back at Wallowa High School, contributing to the team's Tu-Valley football co-championship in 1957. Which was a three way tie with Enterprise  and Union, but only Wallowa advanced to the state playoffs after a vote by the league's school superintendents.
As a sprinter and long jumper in track, Marsh helped Wallowa win the 1957 State Class "B" title. During those years, he developed a famous rivalry with Jim Puckett from Cove High School. The two raced in the 100 yard dash competition, with Puckett winning every contest, making Marsh the 100-yard dash state runner up three times (1956–1958). The 100-yard dash is no longer practiced and was run from 1927 to 1977.
In his senior year, he was part of the East–West Shrine Game.

==College years==

Marsh accepted an Oregon State University track and field scholarship, where he competed as a sprinter, hurdler and a broad jumper. In college, he repeatedly beat Puckett, who ran representing the University of Oregon.
He also played football as a wingback, halfback, split end and kicker. He was part of the No. 6 ranked University of Southern California upset 14-0 at the Los Angeles Coliseum on September 16, 1960. The Trojans were ranked No. 1 in the preseason by Playboy magazine and it was the last time an OSU team experienced victory at USC.
As a senior, he was shifted to split end but didn't experience much success, caching only 10 passes.

==Professional Football==

===Dallas Cowboys===

Marsh was signed as a rookie undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys in 1961, because they were impressed by his speed. Back then his nicknames were "Moose" and "Forward Marsh".
He started his career as a wide receiver and special teams player. In 1962 to take advantage of his size and speed, he was moved to fullback, playing alongside Don Perkins where he became one of the league top 10 rushers with 802 yards and a 5.6 yards average per carry.http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?tabSeq=0&statisticCategory=RUSHING&conference=null&season=1962&seasonType=REG&d-447263-s=RUSHING_YARDS&d-447263-o=2&d-447263-n=1 That year he also set the franchise record for the longest kickoff return with 101 yards, a record that was broken by Alexander Wright 29 years later in 1991.http://www.nfl.com/player/amosmarsh/2520185/profile The play came against the Philadelphia Eagles, when the Cowboys became the first NFL team in history to produce two 100-yard plays in the same game: a 100 yard interception return for a touchdown by strong safety Mike Gaechter and the 101 yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Marsh.http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=76BB7174-C56C-26C0-31BC6B43D54204AC
Marsh's production regressed during the following years, leading the Cowboys to trade him to the Detroit Lions in 1965 after the team acquired fullback J.D. Smith.http://archives.newspaperarchive.com/FreePdfViewer.aspx?img=110255226&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=7 The team eventually selected Walt Garrison with the fifth round draft choice they obtained.

===Detroit Lions===

Playing as a fullback in 1965, he led the Lions in rushing with 405 yards.

===Atlanta Falcons===

After three seasons with the Lions, he was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in 1968, retiring before the season started.

==Personal life==

He died in 1992 after suffering a series of strokes, because of his diabetes condition. He was 53 years old.
