HMS ''Jutland'' (D62) was a later or 1943 Battle-class fleet destroyer of the United Kingdom's Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the First World War. The first Jutland was launched in 1945, but was cancelled that same year. Her sister-ship, Malplaquet - named after a battle between Britain and France during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709 - was renamed Jutland just prior to her launch on 20 February 1946, and was commissioned on 30 July 1947. The original Jutland was finally broken up in 1957 at Rosyth. 
In September 1948, Jutland, in company with the two carriers [tpl]HMS|Theseus|R64|6[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Vengeance|R71|6[/tpl], as well as two of her sister-ships and a frigate, deployed on a cruise mainly to South Africa, visiting a number of ports on the way. After the group's visit to South Africa, they performed a number of naval exercises before returning to the UK in December. 
In 1950 Jutland was temporarily laid-up, but the following year she returned to active service, seeing service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1952, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, Jutland visited the Middle East, during the troubles in Egypt. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth IISouvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden and was subsequently placed in Reserve, along with a number of her sister-ships. In 1957, Jutland joined the Home and subsequently the Mediterranean Fleets as part of the 7th Destroyer Squadron. The following year, during a daytime exercise off Malta, Jutland collided with her sister-ship [tpl]HMS|Dunkirk|D09|6[/tpl], causing minor damage. 
Jutland was broken up at Faslane in 1965.
