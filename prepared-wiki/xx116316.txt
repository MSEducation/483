Louvre Atlanta is an art collaboration showing exhibits from the Louvre in Paris at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta from October 2006 to 2009. The High museum is holding related programs including lectures and art-making workshops. 
Three major sponsors include Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines, and United Parcel Service, all based in or immediately outside of Atlanta. The total budget for Louvre Atlanta is estimated at $18 million. This includes a $6.4 million payment by the High which will go towards the restoration of the Louvreâ€™s 18th-century French decorative arts galleries. 
Louvre Atlanta was conceived by the museums' directors, Michael Shapiro and Henri Loyrette, who had organized the High's 1999 Impressionism presentation: Paintings Collected by European Museums.
