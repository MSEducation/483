Wilden (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played in major cricket matches for Kent in 1751.

==Career==

Wilden played in two major matches in 1751 for Kent against the All-England Eleven. On 20 and 21 May, he was a member of the Kent team that lost by 9 runs at the Artillery Ground.Ashley-Cooper, p.68.Waghorn, pp.47â€“49.  A return match was arranged at the same venue on 22 May and All-England won by an innings and 9 runs, with Wilden again a member of the Kent team.
Wilden is only recorded on those two occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Wilden.
