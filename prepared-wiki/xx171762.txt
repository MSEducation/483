[[Non-stop decay]]

CATEGORIES: Gene expression

Non-stop decay is a cellular mechanism of mRNA surveillance to detect mRNA molecules lacking a stop codon and prevent these mRNAs from translation. The non-stop decay pathway releases ribosomes that have reached the far 3' end of an mRNA and guides the mRNA to the exosome complex for degradation.
