Frankfurter Büro Center ([tpl]lang-en|Frankfurt Office Centre[/tpl]), also known as FBC, is a 40-storey, [tpl]convert|142|m|abbr=on[/tpl] skyscraper in the Westend-Süd district of Frankfurt, Germany.

==Background==

The construction of the skyscraper was stuck in 1975 through the oil crisis in the shell. Until 1979 there was significant because of the construction cost and risk letting a buyer. The ECE project development company reached an agreement with owners and artisans, and developed a construction program for completion and technical improvement as well as a rental concept. In 1981 the tower was approximately [tpl]convert|52000|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of gross floor area (40 upper and 2 underground levels) is finally finished.
Richard Heil from Frankfurt is the architect. The building was owned from 1985 to 2007 the basic value fund, an open real estate of the Dresdner Bank subsidiary DEGI. Zum 30. April 2007 were from a total of approximately [tpl]convert|47600|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of office space to around [tpl]convert|17000|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in the EC - 19 OG nicht vermietet. OG is not rented out. Thus, the occupancy rate was approximately 65 percent. The building's anchor tenant is main German offices of the international law firm, Clifford Chance.
On the square in front of the tower was set up in 1997 a [tpl]convert|21|m|abbr=on[/tpl] sculpture of the artist Claus Bury.
