Relegation is determined by a quotient of the total points earned in the Liga de Ascenso divided by the total amount of games played over the past three seasons of the Liga de Ascenso (for clubs that have not been the Liga de Ascenso all three season, the last consecutive seasons of participation are taken into account). The club with the lowest quotient is relegated to the Segunda División Profesional for the next season.
