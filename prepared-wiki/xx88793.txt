[[Scott domain]]

CATEGORIES: Domain theory, Order theory

In the mathematical fields of order and domain theory, a Scott domain is an algebraic, bounded complete cpo. It has been named in honour of Dana S. Scott, who was the first to study these structures at the advent of domain theory. Scott domains are very closely related to algebraic lattices, being different only in possibly lacking a greatest element. They are also closely related to Scott information systems, which constitute a "syntactic" representation of Scott domains.
While the term "Scott domain" is widely used with the above definition, the term "domain" does not have such a generally accepted meaning and different authors will use different definitions; Scott himself used "domain" for the structures now called "Scott domains". Additionally, Scott domains appear with other names like "algebraic semilattice" in some publications.

==Definition==

Formally, a non-empty partially ordered set (D, ≤) is called a Scott domain if the following hold:

==Properties==

The property of being bounded complete is equivalent to the existence of infima of all non-empty subsets of D. It is well known that the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema and thus makes a partially ordered set into a complete lattice. Thus, when a top element (the infimum of the empty set) is adjoined to a Scott domain, one can conclude that:
Consequently, Scott domains are in a sense "almost" algebraic lattices.
Scott domains become topological spaces by introducing the Scott topology.

==Explanation==

This definition in terms of partial data allows an algebra to be defined as the limit of a sequence of increasingly more defined partial algebras — in other words a fixed point of an operator that adds progressively more information to the algebra. For more information, see Domain theory.
