Anil Radhakrishna Kumble  ([tpl]audio|Anil_Kumble.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl] ; ಕನ್ನಡ : ಅನಿಲ್ ಕುಂಬ್ಳೆ; born 17 October 1970) is a former international cricketer and captain of the Indian cricket team. A right-arm leg spin (leg break googly) bowler, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and remains the third-highest wicket taker—only behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne—as of 2012. Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, rather relied much on pace and accuracy. His ability to make the ball bounce with subtle variations in pace made him a tough bowler to face for the batsmen; thus earning him the sobriquet "Jumbo". Kumble was selected as the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1993 and one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year three years later.
Born in Bangalore, Karnataka, Kumble developed an early interest in cricket as he grew up watching players like B. S. Chandrasekhar before becoming a full-fledged cricketer. He made his First-class debut at the age of 19 while representing Karnataka. Soon he was picked up for the Austral-Asia Cup in 1990 before making his Test debut against England later that year. Since then he has represented the Indian Test team on more than 132 Test matches and was responsible for many of India's victories. Kumble became a part of the regular ODI team during the early 1990s and held some of the best performances during this time; which included his six for 12 (six wickets for 12 runs) against the West Indies. The year 1996 proved to very successful for him as he was selected for the World Cup and emerged out as the most successful bowler of the tournament; he played seven matches and captured 15 wickets at an average of 18.73. In 1999 while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all the ten batsmen in a Test match innings.[tpl]cite news|last=Lal|first=Kuldip|title=Kumble takes all 10 wickets as India rout Pakistan|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/PAK_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/PAK_IND_T2_04-08FEB1999_AFP_MR/PAK_IND_T2_07FEB1999_AFP_MR.html|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=ESPN Cricinfo|date=7 February 1999[/tpl] In the event he became the second player to achieve this feat after Jim Laker of England.[tpl]cite news|author=Ayanjit Sen|title= Kumble reaps reward for commitment|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/4061169.stm|publisher=BBC|date=2 December 2004|accessdate=9 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Garg| first = Chitra| title = Indian Champions Profiles Of Famous Indian Sportspersons| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Fq1wdzqhu6kC&pg=PA128| accessdate = 14 May 2012| year = 2010| publisher = Rajpal & Sons| isbn = 978-81-7028-852-7| pages = 128– [/tpl]

==Style and technique==

Kumble is a right-arm leg spinner (legbreak googly) with an unorthodox style, most famous for his flipper.[tpl]cite news|last=Sharada|first=Tarun|title=Anil Kumble's jumbo journey|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-21/features/27971165_1_anil-kumble-jim-laker-pakistan|accessdate=16 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=21 November 2007[/tpl] and a right-hand batsman[tpl]cite web|title=Anil Kumble – Player Profile|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/30176.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo[/tpl] He started his career as a fast bowler,[tpl]cite web|title=Kumble – a spinner with a fast bowler’s attitude|url=http://cricket.yahoo.com/blogs/yahoo-cricket-columns/kumble-spinner-fast-bowler-attitude-27.html|publisher=Yahoo Cricket|author=Partab Ramchand[/tpl] which gave him a useful faster delivery. His unique bowling style can be attributed to matting pitches in Bangalore which assist top-spin and over-spin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/08/12/sckumb112.xml|title=Persistent Anil Kumble's rich harvest|author=Scyld Berry|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 August 2007 | location=London | date=12 August 2007[/tpl]
Kumble is one of the 4 bowlers, alongside Richard Hadlee, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, and the only Indian bowler ever, to have taken 5 wickets in a Test innings more than 30 times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;filter=advanced;orderby=five_wickets;template=results;type=bowling;wicketsmin1=5;wicketsval1=wickets|title=Combined Test, ODI and T20I records: Most five-wicket hauls in a career|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=12 September 2011[/tpl] He also holds the world record for the largest number of caught-and-bowled dismissals in tests, 35 – which forms 5.65% of his total wickets.[tpl]cite web|title=Anil Kumble Fielding Records|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/30176.html?class=1;template=results;type=fielding;view=dismissal_list|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl] He is also one of 4 Indian bowlers to have conceded over 250 runs in a Test match, although he took 12 wickets in that match.[tpl]cite web|title=4th Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2003/04|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64062.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl] He is known for bowling tirelessly, having bowled 72 overs in a Test innings once.[tpl]cite web|title=1st Test India vs Sri Lanka Aug, 97|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63762.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl] He is also remembered for his tenacity in bowling even when injured, especially after an incident in a match against West Indies where, despite having his broken jaw being heavily taped, he came back and took the wicket of Brian Lara.[tpl]cite book| last = Fraser| first = David| title = Cricket and the Law The Man in White Is Always Right| url = http://books.google.com/?id=P3mOV7kXwn4C&pg=PA215| accessdate = 18 May 2012| year = 2005| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-7146-5347-1| pages = 215– [/tpl]
Kumble relies more on accuracy, variations and bounce rather than spinning the ball.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070407/saturday/main1.htm|title= Jumbo spinner|author=Abhijit Chatterjee|newspaper=The Tribune|accessdate=9 August 2007[/tpl] Sambit Bal, the editor of Cricinfo, wrote, "That he Kumble has been an unusual spinner has been said many times before. It has also been said, a trifle unfairly, that he is a unidimensional bowler. Palpably, he has lacked the turn of Warne and Murali, but his variety has been subtler, far more apparent to batsmen than to viewers. He has shown that not only turn and flight that can deceive the batsman but also the changes of length and pace. He has been a cultured practitioner of his unique craft and a master of nuances."
