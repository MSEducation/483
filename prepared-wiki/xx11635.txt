[[VSE (operating system)]]

CATEGORIES: IBM mainframe operating systems, IBM ESA/390 operating systems

z/VSE (''Virtual Storage Extended'') is an operating system for IBM mainframe computers, the latest one in the DOS/360 lineage, which originated in 1965. It is less common than prominent z/OS and is mostly used on smaller machines. Primary z/VSE development occurs in IBM's BÃ¶blingen labs in Germany.

==Overview==

DOS/360 originally supported 24-bit addressing. As the underlying hardware evolved, VSE/ESA acquired support for 31-bit addressing. IBM released z/VSE Version 4 in 2007. z/VSE Version 4 requires 64-bit z/Architecture hardware and supports 64-bit real mode addressing. The latest z/VSE version is z/VSE 5.1 (available since 2011), which introduced 64 bit virtual addressing and memory objects (chunks of virtual storage), that are allocated above 2 GB. The latest shipping release (as of June 2013) is z/VSE 5.1.2. 
IBM recommends that z/VSE customers run Linux on zSeries alongside, on the same physical system, to provide another 64-bit application environment that can access and extend z/VSE applications and data via Hipersockets using a wide variety of middleware. CICS, one of the most popular enterprise transaction processing systems, is extremely popular among z/VSE users and now supports recent innovations such as Web services. DB2 is also available and popular.
Job Control Language (JCL) is z/VSE's batch processing interface. There is also another, special interface for system console operators. z/VSE, like z/OS systems, had traditionally supported 3270 terminal user interfaces. However, most z/VSE installations have at least begun to add Web browser access to z/VSE applications.  z/VSE's TCP/IP is a separately priced option for historic reasons, and is available in two different versions from two vendors. Both vendors provide a full function TCP/IP stack with applications, such as telnet and ftp. One TCP/IP stack provides IPv4 communication only, the other IPv4 and IPv6 communication. In addition to the commercially available TCP/IP stacks for z/VSE, IBM also provides the Linux Fastpath method which uses IUCV socket connections to communicate with a Linux guest, also running on the mainframe. Using this method the z/VSE system is able to fully exploit the native Linux TCP/IP stack.http://enterprisesystemsmedia.com/article/the-z-vse-fast-path-to-linux-on-system-z

==Older z/VSE versions==

Since z/VSE 3.1, Fibre Channel access to storage devices is supported, although only on IBM's Enterprise Storage Server (ESS) and its successors.  z/VSE 3.1 is still compatible with 31-bit mainframes, as opposed to z/VSE 4. This version was supported to 2009.[tpl]cite web|title=Bringing you up-to-date with z/VSE V4|url=ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/zos/vse/pdf3/zvse41/lvc/Bringing_you_up-to-date_with_zVSE_V4.pdf|page=14|accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl] z/VSE 4.2 is no longer supported since October 2012.
A previous generation, VSE/ESA 2.7, is no longer supported since February 28, 2007.
