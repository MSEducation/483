==Racing career==

===1996: two-year-old season===

Bint Allayl made her debut in a five-furlong maiden race at York in May. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, she reportedly had "every chance" but was beaten a neck by Pipalong,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=251103&r_date=1998-05-12&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=York maiden result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] a filly who went on to be a Group One winning sprinter. It was to be her only defeat. Two weeks later, she reappeared in the Listed National Stakes at Sandown. She was held up by Dettori before being sent past the odds-on favourite, Speedy James, a furlong from the finish. She immediately went clear and scored a three and a half length victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=251856&r_date=1998-05-26&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=National Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]
She was then moved up to Group Three class for the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot where she was again matched against Pipalong. She had already been described in the press as "arguably the season's fastest two-year-old",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/blood-sweat-and-yearlings-1164946.html |title=Blood, sweat and yearlings - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=14 June 1998 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] while Channon was reported to believe that she was the best juvenile he had trained.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-ascot-thins-out-the-royal-throng-1164067.html |title=Racing: Ascot thins out the Royal throng - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=10 June 1998 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] Dettori settled her just behind the leaders, then moved her into the lead a furlong out. She once again went quickly clear of her opponents and won by two lengths from Pipalong, who ran on from well off the pace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=252735&r_date=1998-06-17&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Queen Mary Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]
It was more than two months before Bint Allayl appeared for her final start, the Lowther Stakes at York, although she was reported to be working impressively at home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bint+Allayl+impresses+in+workout.-a061442233 |title=Bint Allayl impresses in workout. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] In the York race, she ran over six furlongs for the first time and the field was considered a strong one,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-dettori-finds-a-new-song-in-lochangel-1173080.html |title=Racing: Dettori finds a new song in Lochangel - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=21 August 1998 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] with her opponents including the Princess Margaret Stakes winner Mythical Girl and Wannabe Grand, who had won the Cherry Hinton Stakes. Ridden by Mick Kinane Bint Allayl was held up in the early stages before moving easily up to take the lead a furlong out and win by a length and three-quarters from Wannabe Grand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=253835&r_date=1998-08-20&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Lowther Stakes result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] After the race, she was made favourite for the 1,000 Guineas, a position she still held at the time of her death.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-roche-hangs-up-his-boots-1174206.html |title=Racing: Roche hangs up his boots - Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=26 August 1998 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]

===Death===

Despite a strong belief in the press that Bint Allayl would join the Godolphin Racing team, her owner decided to keep the filly in England with Mick Channon. During the winter, she required surgery on an injured hock but appeared to have fully recovered. On 24 February 1999, Bint Allayl was injured when cantering during light exercise at West Ilsley. She received emergency veterinary treatment, but examinations revealed that she had suffered an untreatable "spiral fracture of her left-fore humerus". She was euthanized that evening.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-channons-great-classic-hope-is-dead-1072948.html |title=Channon's great Classic hope is dead |publisher=The Independent |date=24 February 1999 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]
