Hardware Ranch wildlife Management Area is owned by the State of Utah and managed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. It is located in the Blacksmith Fork Canyon, about [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Hyrum, Utah.

Horse-drawn sleigh rides and a visitor center are offered from mid December to February.

==History==

Hardware Ranch Wildlife Management Area (WMA) is owned by the State of Utah and managed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.  Neighboring properties are the National Forest, although the actual WMA is not part of the National Forest.
Hardware Ranch WMA is not a working ranch, it is a WMA set aside primarily for big game animals such as elk, moose and deer but it is also home to many other species.  Habitat and wildlife management along with education are the primary focus of management at HWRWMA.  The elk that visit Hardware Ranch WMA are wild elk, they come and go as they please, and are not fenced, farmed or ranched. Cattle and sheep are allowed to graze on the WMA through a competitive contracting process.  These animals are limited to certain areas of the WMA and certain time frames to best assist in the habitat management of the WMA.
The state of Utah purchased the ranch in 1946 from the Box Elder Hardware Company,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HkIOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0H8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3586,3058248&dq=hardware-ranch|title=Hardware Ranch Solving Cache Elk Problems|last=Miller|first=Hack|publisher=Deseret News, The|pages=A14|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] using money from the Wildlife Restoration Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wildlife.utah.gov/hardwareranch/history.php|title=History of Hardware Ranch|publisher=Utah Division of Wildlife Resources|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl] The original size of the ranch was [tpl]convert|7560|acre|km2 sqmi[/tpl], but acquisitions by the state enlarged it to about [tpl]convert|19000|acre|km2 sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kutv.com/content/outdoors/story.aspx?content_id=2dc6ad14-ad94-4f51-9053-f60f0577a8d4|title=Travel Guide: Hardware Ranch|last=Eakle|first=Adam|date=2008-01-13|publisher=KUTV|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] During the first year only 120 Rocky Mountain Elk were fed over the winter, but in 2008 that number is between 500 and 600.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wildlife.utah.gov/hardwareranch/about.php|title=About Hardware Ranch|publisher=Utah Division of Wildlife Resources|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl]
