Bangerz is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Miley Cyrus; it was released on October 4, 2013 by RCA Records. Opting to re-establish her music career instead of focusing on her film career as originally planned, Cyrus began planning the project in 2012. Work continued into 2013, at which time she left her previous label Hollywood Records and subsequently joined RCA Records. Described by Cyrus as "dirty south hip-hop", Bangerz represents a musical departure from her earlier work, which she has grown to feel "disconnected" from. As executive producers, Cyrus and Mike Will Made It collaborated with hip hop producers including Cirkut, Pharrell Williams, and will.i.am to achieve Cyrus' desired new sound. Their efforts resulted in a primarily pop record, with lyrical themes that revolve largely around romance. It features guest vocals from several new partners, including pop singer Britney Spears and rappers Big Sean, French Montana, Future, Ludacris, and Nelly.
Bangerz received mixed to positive reviews from Contemporary music critics, who appreciated its overall production and originality, but were ambivalent towards Cyrus' public persona. The record debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 270,000 copies. In doing so, it became Cyrus' fifth non-consecutive number-one album, including earlier soundtracks in which she performed as her former titular character Hannah Montana. It was the third-highest opening week for a female artist in 2013, behind Beyoncé by Beyoncé and Prism by Katy Perry. Bangerz was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after moving one million units. The album additionally reached the peak position in Australia, Ireland, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, and charted strongly on record charts in additional international territories.
"We Can't Stop" was released as the lead single from Bangerz on June 3, 2013, and peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The second single "Wrecking Ball" was released on August 25, 2013, and became Cyrus' first single to peak in the top position in the United States. Its accompanying music video currently holds the Vevo record for most views in the first 24 hours of its release, and the record for being the fastest video to reach 100 million views on the service. "Adore You" was serviced as the third single from the record on December 17, 2013; it has peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. A remix of the track produced by Cedric Gervais was released on March 3, 2014. Promotional efforts for Bangerz continued to associate Cyrus with an increasingly provocative image, an effort first begun with her third record, Can't Be Tamed (2010). She garnered widespread media attention through a controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, and was later the host and musical guest during an episode of Saturday Night Live. Furthermore, Cyrus began her international Bangerz Tour on February 14, 2014.

==Background and production==

In 2012, Cyrus announced plans to focus on her film career, effectively putting her musical endeavors on hiatus. That year, she appeared in the films LOL and So Undercover. She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film Hotel Transylvania, but dropped out of the project to coordinate a musical comeback.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/69288/Miley-Cyrus-Drops-Out-Of-Film-Role-To-Make-Pop-Comeback|title=Miley Cyrus Drops Out Of Film Role To Make Pop Comeback|author=Shaun Kitchener|publisher=Entertainmentwise.

She described the music as "dirty south hip-hop" and combining the genres of hip-hop and country, which she felt was a "good hybrid".

I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually thought I did at the time."[tpl]cite AV media|people=Ellen DeGeneres, Miley Cyrus|year=2013|title=Miley Discusses Her Relationship with Liam Hemsworth|medium=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH3HQg5UoC0|accessdate=October 12, 2013|time=1:06 minutes|publisher=The Ellen DeGeneres Show|location=Burbank, California[/tpl]
The record opens with the pop ballad "Adore You", which lyrically addresses a lover through lyrics including "We were meant to be/In holy matrimony". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly opined that the track allowed Cyrus to showcase her vocal abilities. "We Can't Stop" is an ( R&B,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1565618/miley-cyrus-we-cant-stop-premieres-listen-to-the-new-single|title=Miley Cyrus' 'We Can't Stop' Premieres: Listen To The New Single|author=Jason Lipshutz|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2013[/tpl] song that lyrically discusses the events of a house party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/we-cant-stop-lyrics-miley-cyrus.html|title=Miley Cyrus - We Can't Stop Lyrics|publisher=MetroLyrics.

"4x4" features hip hop recording artist Nelly, and lyrically discusses the story of a "female rebel" looking to find bail for her romantic partner. Subtle country music elements are present throughout the song. "My Darlin'" features Future; Cyrus' vocal abilities were complimented, though were deemed to be overpowered by a "sea of blinking synths and unthawed crooning". "Wrecking Ball" is a synthpop ballad speaking of a failed relationship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Miley-Cyrus-appears-naked-in-Wrecking-Ball-music-video-Poll/9241777|title=Miley Cyrus appears naked in 'Wrecking Ball' music video (Poll)|author=Corinne Heller|publisher=On the Red Carpet|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=September 22, 2013[/tpl]
The seventh track "Love Money Party" features Big Sean, and incorporates a "grimy, haunted-house beat". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that Cyrus appeared more comfortable with rapping in the recording, compared to an earlier performance on the Mike Will Made It single "23". "Get It Right" is a "stylish breeze" that sees the inclusion of "whistling ... and a chopped guitar lick". It was described as being reminiscent of "Twisted" by Usher and "Kickin' In" by Adam Lambert, all three of which were produced by Pharrell Williams. Cyrus stated that "Drive" was inspired by "needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship." Her comments were assumed to reference her engagement to Hemsworth by the media.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/09/miley-cyrus-reveals-the-moment-she-knew-her-engagement-was-over/|title=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/09/miley-cyrus-reveals-the-moment-she-knew-her-engagement-was-over/|author=Michael Rothman|publisher=ABC News. American Broadcasting Company|date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl] The tenth track "FU" features French Montana, and according to Catucci, blends "starry Adele-style sass and a French Montana verse into expertly inlaid dubstep wub-wubs".> He went on to describe "Do My Thang" as a "ripping dance track", while Lipshutz recognized influences from "gooey synthesizers and snapping percussion". "Maybe You're Right" incorporates drum instrumentation with "hints of gospel influence", and was also questioned to be addressing Hemsworth. The thirteenth and final track "Someone Else" combines hip hop and synthpop styles, and lyrically discusses Cyrus' evolving public image.

==Critical reception==

Bangerz received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 21 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares provided a favorable review, opining that it "accomplishes the mission" of "selling Cyrus as an independent woman", further commenting that the incorporation of several genres within the project "introduces Miley as an A-list pop star." Jason Lipshutz of Billboard complimented the album for being "fiercely individual", but stated that the "dramatic breakup songs" became repetitive. Lipshutz stated that the album is "neither the best nor worst pop album" released in 2013, and stated power ballad songs like "Wrecking Ball" would increase her career longevity. Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly described Bangerz as being "utterly fresh" and a "pop blitz from a hip hop blue print", and stated that Cyrus had visibly transitioned from her former persona established by the Disney Channel.
Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times noted that the album favored a "grittier, hip-hop-inspired vibe" instead of the "glossy electro-pop" from her previous material, and further opined that "We Can't Stop" "still astounds; it might be the calmest, most clear-eyed rebel yell since Janet Jackson's "Control." Rolling Stone[tpl]'[/tpl]s Jon Dolan complimented the album's the "wide-ranging production", labeling it a "Rihanna-meets-Gaga-meets-Pink-meets-Britney party grenade of a record". Writing for Fact, Tom Lea provided a more mixed review of Bangerz, calling it a "hot mess of country, Southern hip-hop and more", but concluded that the record contained "more--ahem--bangers than clangers."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/10/04/miley-cyrus-bangerz|title=Bangerz|author=Tom Lea|work=Fact|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013[/tpl] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian shared a similar sentiment, but also opined that the overall record held "more hits than misses". John Murphy of MusicOMH described the tracks as being "rather run of the mill material", but nonetheless complimented Cyrus' promotional efforts for making the record "one of the most anticipated pop albums of the year".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/miley-cyrus-bangerz|title=Miley Cyrus – Bangerz|author=John Murphy|publisher=MusicOMH|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013[/tpl]
Kitty Empire from The Observer was more negative of Bangerz, opining that the project "feels stitched together in the dark, and the attention-seeking begins to grate."

==Impact==

Bangerz and its promotional events have been largely credited with establishing a sexually-provocative image for Cyrus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2013/10/16/miley-cyrus-bangerz-and-the-plot-to-kill-hannah-montana/|title=Miley Cyrus, Bangerz And The Plot To Kill Hannah Montana|author=Zack O'Malley Greenburg|work=Forbes|publisher=Forbes, Inc.|date=October 16, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl] Zack O'Malley Greenburg from Forbes noted that her performances, music videos, and public behavior received "plenty of condemnation along with all the attention" in the lead-up to the record; he suggested that this was intentionally done so "will never again buy any products related to Cyrus–or her former alter-ego, tween sensation Hannah Montana." John Murphy from MusicOMH stated that Cyrus' performance at the MTV Video Music Awards became "the seismic event that ensured we'd never recall 2013 without thinking of her", further opining that the anticipation it built for Bangerz made it "impossible not to admire her PR operation."
Andrew Unterberger of Billboard felt that Bangerz developed the maturing image for Cyrus that her third album Can't Be Tamed (2010) failed to accomplish. He suggested that she had "no true backup plan" for creating a new public persona in 2010, and stated that she "now feels firmly in control of her music and her image" in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5747935/miley-cyrus-cant-be-tamed-revisited-why-her-first-rebellion-didnt|title=Miley Cyrus' 'Can't Be Tamed' Revisited: Why Her First Rebellion Didn't Work|author=Andrew Unterberger|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] Marlow Stern from The Daily Beast shared a similar sentiment, stating that Cyrus "is completely in control of what she’s doing" after her recent controversies, which he described as "pure artistic calculation born out of mild desperation", and has successfully done "just about anything to gain our attention".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/07/miley-cyrus-s-album-bangerz-is-totally-schizo-and-catchy-as-hell.html|title=Miley Cyrus’s Album ‘Bangerz’ Is Totally Schizo and Catchy as Hell|author=Marlow Stern|newspaper=The Daily Beast|publisher=The Newsweek Daily Beast Company|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] Zack O'Malley Greenburg of Forbes commented that despite widespread criticism of "chasing YouTube views and record sales at the expense of her image", the "new Cyrus" appears "marketable as ever." Writing for Glamour, Mickey Woods compared the promotional "era" for Bangerz to those of Britney Spears' and Christina Aguilera's third and fourth studio albums Britney (2001) and Stripped (2002), respectively, in that "both albums by these legends were wildly experimental", adding that Cyrus' project "will probably be retrospectively deemed iconic, maybe even classic."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/10/we-love-miley-cyrus-new-album.html|title=We Love Miley Cyrus' New Album, Bangerz, and 6 Reasons You Should Too!|author=Mickey Woods|work=Glamour|publisher=Condé Nast|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013[/tpl] Mark Jacobs of V likened the album to Control (1986) by Janet Jackson, in that Cyrus was "an artist coming into her own" in a fashion similar to Jackson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/970/the-emancipation-of-miley|title=The Emancipation of Miley|author=Mark Jacobs|work=V|publisher=Visionaire|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=February 26, 2014[/tpl]
Patrick Ryan of USA Today commented that Cyrus' collaborations with Mike Will Made It contributed to his new-found prominence, stating that Mike Will Made It's position as an executive producer has helped him "jump to the forefront as an interesting character ... in an era where a lot of producers have fallen behind the scenes again". From a commercial standpoint, however, Suzanne Cowie of Babble suggested that Cyrus' opening-week sales figures and subsequent decline supported the idea that the studio album format is reaching its end, having used her example to exemplify that "consumers are only interested in the single". She further opined that they do not "have the time to sit and listen through to an album in its entirety", and credited the rise of digital downloads with promoting a less engaging listening process, where consumers "not connected in any way with the band/singer and their hopes for the record."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.babble.com/entertainment/is-the-album-dead-as-album-sales-plummet-we-look-at-the-top-10-best-selling-albums-of-all-time/|title=Is the Album Dead?
