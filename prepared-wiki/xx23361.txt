This species was recorded in 1937 by Rahm from a hot spring near Nagasaki in Japan.

The type specimen has also been lost, so the status of this class is considered dubious.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nelson, Diane R. |year=2002 |title=Current Status of the Tardigrada: Evolution and Ecology |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=652–659 |doi=10.1093/icb/42.3.652[/tpl]
