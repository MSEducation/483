==Football career==

An unsuccessful youth graduate at F.C. Porto, Fausto began his professional career with Académica de Coimbra, but never appeared officially for the team, going on to serve loans at third division clubs G.D. Tourizense and Anadia FC.
In July 2008 he moved to Bulgaria with PFC Lokomotiv Mezdra in the A PFG, appearing regularly and failing to score in the league as the club finished in eighth position, and sharing teams with compatriot Tozé Marreco. In the following years he played in Cyprus and Switzerland, without no impact whatsoever.
