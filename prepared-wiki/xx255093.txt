Philip Kim is a condensed matter physicist known for study of quantum transport in carbon nanotubes and graphene, including observations of quantum Hall effects in graphene.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/scientificamerican0408-90[/tpl]

==Academic career==

Kim studied physics at Seoul National University and earned his bachelor's degree in 1990 and a master's degree in 1992, and a doctorate in applied physics at Harvard University in 1999 under the supervision of Charles Lieber. He worked at the University of California, Berkeley as a Miller Research Fellow until 2001, when he joined the faculty at Columbia University.

==Research==

Kim and coworkers have made important contributions in the field of nanoscale low-dimensional materials. In 1999, he and Lieber published a highly cited paper on electrostatically controlled carbon nanotube NEMS devices.[tpl]Cite journal|last = Kim| first=P.|author2=Lieber, C.M. |year = 1999|title = Nanotube nanotweezers|journal = Science|volume = 286|doi = 10.1126/science.286.5447.2148|pmid=10591644|issue=5447|pages = 2148–50[/tpl] In Feb. 2005, his group at Columbia reported electrical measurements of thin graphite films produced by an atomic force microscope technique.[tpl]Cite journal|last = Zhang| first=Y.|author2=Small, J.P.|author3= Pontius, W.V.|author4= Kim, P. |year = 2005|title = Fabrication and electric-field-dependent transport measurements of mesoscopic graphite devices|journal = Applied Physics Letters|volume = 86|page = 073104|doi = 10.1063/1.1862334|arxiv = cond-mat/0410314 |bibcode = 2005ApPhL..86g3104Z|issue = 7 [/tpl]
In Sept. 2005, they reported observation of the quantum Hall effect in single graphene layers[tpl]Cite journal|last = Zhang| first=Y.|author2=Tan, Y.-W.|author3= Stormer, H.L.|author4= Kim, P. |year = 2005|title = Experimental observation of the quantum Hall effect and Berry's phase in graphene|journal = Nature|volume = 438|doi = 10.1038/nature04235|pmid=16281031|issue=7065|bibcode=2005Natur.438..201Z|arxiv = cond-mat/0509355|pages = 201–4 [/tpl] simultaneously with the group of Andre Geim, and in 2007, the two groups jointly published observations of the quantum Hall effect in graphene at room temperature.[tpl]Cite journal|last = Novoselov| first=K.S.|author2=Jiang, Z.|author3=Zhang, Y.|author4=Morozov, S.V.|author5=Stormer, H.L.|author6=Zeitler, U.|author7=Maan, J.C.|author8=Boebinger, G.S.|author9=Kim, P.|author10= Geim, A.K. |year = 2007|title = Room-Temperature Quantum Hall Effect in Graphene|journal = Science|volume =315|page =1379|doi = 10.1126/science.1137201|pmid=17303717|bibcode=2007Sci...315.1379N|issue = 5817[/tpl] Kim's group authored an influential paper in 2007 describing a transport gap introduced by lithographic patterning of graphene to form nanoribbons. This was an important proof of principle in the development of graphene electronics as it allowed on-off switching of the graphene devices by a factor of 1000  at low temperature.[tpl]Cite journal|last = Han| first=M.Y.|author2=Özyilmaz, B.|author3= Zhang, Y.|author4= Kim, P. |year = 2007|title = Energy Band-Gap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbons|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 98|page = 206805|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.206805|bibcode=2007PhRvL..98t6805H|arxiv = cond-mat/0702511|issue = 20 [/tpl] In Feb. 2009, his group and coworkers have synthesized the large-scale graphene films by CVD method. He indicated that the quality of CVD-grown graphene is comparable to that of mechanically cleaved graphene, as observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect in CVD-grown graphene.[tpl]Cite journal|last = Kim|first = Kuen Soo|author2=et al.|title = Large-scale pattern growth of graphene films for stretchable transparent electrodes|year=2009|doi = 10.1038/nature07719|journal = Nature|volume=457|pmid = 19145232|issue = 7230|bibcode=2009Natur.457..706K|pages = 706–10[/tpl] The group reported observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in suspended graphene in Nov. 2009.[ref][tpl]Cite journal|last = Bolotin| first=K.I.|author2=Ghahari, F.|author3= Shulman, M.D.|author4= Stormer, H.L.|author5= Kim, P. |year = 2009|title = Observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene|journal = Nature|volume = 462|doi = 10.1038/nature08582|pmid=19881489|issue=7270|bibcode = 2009Natur.462..196B|pages = 196–9 |arxiv = 0910.2763 [/tpl]
Note that similar results obtained by a group led by Eva Andrei appear in the same issue.[/ref]

==Honors and awards==

Kim received a National Science Foundation Early Career Development Award in 2004. In 2006, he was named as one of the "Scientific American 50", a list of individuals/organizations honored for their contributions to science and society during the preceding year.[ref]
