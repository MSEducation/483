==Get Engaged Tour==

In the months after the passing of Proposition 8, Marriage Equality USA sponsored a statewide poll to determine opinions on same sex marriage. Polling data was presented in over forty cities in a town hall forum dubbed the "Get Engaged Tour". At the events participants were presented the results of the statewide polling data, as well as an opportunity to discuss next steps in moving forward with an effort to bring about marriage equality.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/25/MNC118UVLJ.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | title=Same-sex marriage backers weigh ballot date | date=27 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Munger|first=Kel|title=Find your power|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/find-your-power/content?oid=1178654|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=News Review|date=9 March 2009[/tpl]
