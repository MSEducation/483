East Tennessee Christmas is an Christmas album by guitarist Chet Atkins, released in 1983. He had recorded a Christmas release previously for RCA but that was 22 years earlier. He covers some of the same territory on this release but with a smoother production.

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album "... an accomplished but unremarkable holiday effort. Much of the album sounds too slick, and the song selection is a little too predictable for its good, making the record itself sound like it is something Atkins had done before... the overall album makes little impression, and only dedicated Atkins fans will need to add this to their collection.
