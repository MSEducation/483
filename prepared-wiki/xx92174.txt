Minot International Airport 
 is in Ward County, North Dakota, two miles north of the city of Minot, which owns it. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport.
Delta Air Lines has five daily flights to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. Some are Delta Connection, but in 2013 Delta has mainline flights to Minneapolis-St. Paul, unusual for a city as small as Minot. Some flights are on larger two-class aircraft. Delta alone will be providing 528 seats per day to Minot; North Dakota's booming oil industry has spurred demand for larger aircraft.
United Airlines became Minot's second airline in June 2010, starting with two daily flights to Denver International Airport; it now has four. United also flies three times-weekly charters to Houston, Texas.
Allegiant became the airport's third airline, with twice-weekly direct flights to Las Vegas on October 22, 2010. Allegiant then added twice-weekly service to Phoenix-Mesa. The number of flights to both destinations fluctuates depending on demand, and can be has high as five flights per week. Passenger loads have stayed high.
Frontier Airlines, with an announcement on August 15, 2012, became the airport's fourth airline and started service November 5, 2012 with one flight four days per week to Denver. The original Frontier Airlines served Minot, on a route that connected it with Saskatoon, Regina and Denver, prior to that airline's bankruptcy and halting of operations in 1986.
Customs service is available for aircraft arriving from Canada and other countries. Minot International has no scheduled passenger airline service out of the country, but receives its international title (like many other airports) because of this customs service. The TSA fully searches all passengers and carry-on luggage prior to boarding, rather than using a selective process as is the case at major airports.
The airport offers pay parking and car rental services. Concessions are inside security and the "Hangar Grill" recently opened on the second floor.[tpl]cite web |url = http://whyflyminot.com/about/ | title = About the Airport | publisher = Minot International Airport[/tpl]

==Growth and future==

Minot's growth in population and economy, along with the enormous influx of workers and residents due to the oil boom in western North Dakota, have increased passenger numbers at Minot International Airport tremendously. Though Minot is the fourth largest city in North Dakota, it is now the third-busiest.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.kfyrtv.com/News_Stories.asp?news=57158 | title = New Minot Airport Terminal Survey Complete | work = KFYR-TV | date = May 18, 2012 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120521201454/http://www.kfyrtv.com/News_Stories.asp?news=57158 | archivedate = May 21, 2012[/tpl] While the airport is only twenty years old, it was designed for roughly 100,000 passengers.Link text, additional text. This has put strain on airport infrastructure and resulted in makeshift changes such as temporary long term parking, additional hold-room areas, and other similar measures.
Minot International's current situation and forecasted growth over the next twenty years warranted a study to identify alternatives to deal with that growth. Ultimately it was decided that the best option was a new terminal to be built directly east of the current terminal. Design of the new terminal building was completed in May 2013. The new terminal design will include four to six gates, room for up to four car rental companies, additional restaurant space, additional check in areas for future new airlines, and greatly expanded parking facilities for short term, long term, and rental car parking.
Growing passenger numbers, parking issues, and the possibilities of new airlines and destinations make a new terminal at Minot International Airport a top priority. The projected $40 million terminal joins a list of other major improvements over the next three years which include additional apron, a new taxiway, a new Snow Removal Equipment building, additional parking and a new access road, with total investment around $98 million to cope with increased traffic.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.minotdailynews.com/page/content.detail/id/565203/Airport-s-expansion-needs-get-more-pressing.html?nav=5010 | title = Airport’s expansion needs get more pressing | work = Minot Daily News | date = May 1, 2012[/tpl]
