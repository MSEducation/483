Cyril the Swan is a fictional giant swan, the official mascot of Swansea City A.F.C.
Cyril was voted Best Mascot by readers of the BBC's Match of the Day magazine.  His antics have got him into trouble with the police on several occasions (mainly for fighting with other mascots and stewards), and he has been accused of bringing the game into disrepute.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/326489.stm|title=Dancing swan in hot water|date=23 April 1999|publisher=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/327065.stm |title=Dancing swan has wings clipped|date=23 April 1999|publisher=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article141434.ece |title=Cyril the Swan is nicked|date=5 October 2001|publisher=thesun.co.uk|location=London|first=Charles|last=Yates[/tpl]
