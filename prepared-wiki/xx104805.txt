[[Hypoallergenic dog breed]]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Allergology

The name Hypoallergenic dog breed is commonly used to refer to a dog breed (or crossbreed) that is more compatible with allergic persons than other breeds. However, prominent allergen researchers have claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain dog breeds are hypoallergenic[tpl]Cite news|author=Nicholas Bakalar|date=11 June 2011|work=NYT|accessdate=11 June 2008|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/the-myth-of-the-allergy-free-dog|title=The Myth of the Allergy-Free Dog[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author=Kathleen Masterson|title=Do Hypoallergenic Dogs Exist?

==The myth==

Though some studies suggest the possible existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds, there is too much variability to conclude that such a breed exists. According to researchers, claims about the existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds may have been fueled by unsubstantiated articles on the internet. In a recent interview, Christine Cole Johnson, Senior Staff Scientist at the Henry Ford Hospital & Health System, referring to the findings of her article in the July 2011 issue of the American Journal of Rhinology and Allergy, explained that it was unclear where the name hypoallergenic dog breed came from, and asserted that the existence of such a breed was just a myth. The significant allergens are proteins found in the dog's saliva and dander.[tpl]Cite journal|author=McLean AC, Glovsky MM, Hoffman DR, Ghekiere LM |title=Identification of allergens in dog dander extract.

==Scientific findings==

Breeds that shed less are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog's dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1067/mas.2002.125044 |title=Pets and allergies: Minimizing the reaction |date=May 2002 |last1=Bassett |first1=Clifford W. |journal=Asthma Magazine |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=31–2[/tpl] However, protein expression levels play a major role and amount of shedding alone does not determine degree of allergic reaction. "Even if you get a hairless dog, it's still going to produce the allergen," Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, chair of the Indoor Allergen Committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology is quoted in the newsmagazine U.S. News & World Report as saying.[tpl]Cite news|first=Amanda |last=Gardner |date=14 November 2008 |title=First Family Will Have Tough Time Finding Hypoallergenic Dog |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/11/14/first-family-will-have-tough-time-finding.html |work=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] How hypoallergenic a particular dog is for a particular person may vary with the individual dog and the individual person.[tpl]Cite news|first=Denise |last=Grady |date=5 February 1997 |title=Nonallergenic Dog?

If a person is allergic, they may be best able to tolerate a specific dog, possibly of one of the hypoallergenic breeds. Dr. Thomas A. Platts-Mills, head of the Asthma and Allergic Disease Center at the University of Virginia, explained that there are cases in which a specific dog (not breed) might be better tolerated by a specific person, for unknown reasons. "We think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another," Dr. Platts-Mills said.
All dogs shed, and all dogs produce dander and saliva in some degree.[tpl]cite web|first=Jeffrey |last=Adelglass |title=Dog & Cat Allergy |url=http://www.entdocs.org/catallergy.htm |publisher=Allergy Testing & Treatment Center |quote=No dog is considered non-allergenic because all dogs produce dander, saliva, and urine which are the offending allergens |accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] As noted above, the amount of the allergenic protein present on the dander and in saliva varies by breed. Also, the amount of the allergen can be reduced or eliminated in individual dogs by treatments such as bathing.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Hodson T, Custovic A, Simpson A, Chapman M, Woodcock A, Green R |title=Washing the dog reduces dog allergen levels, but the dog needs to be washed twice a week |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=581–5 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10200004 |doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(99)70227-7[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(96)80697-X |title=479 Avoidance of dog allergen f 1 with the dog in situ: Washing the dog and use of a HEPA air filter |date=January 1996 |first1=R. |last1=Green |first2=A. |last2=Custovic |first3=A. |last3=Smith |first4=M. D. |last4=Chaoman |first5=A. |last5=Woodcock |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=97 |page=302[/tpl] But for most breeds, when not regularly bathed, even a dog who sheds very little or has little dander can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pet-allergy/DS00859/DSECTION=causes |title=Pet allergy: Causes |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl]

==Effect of size==

Size may be a factor in determining hypoallergenicity. It is possible that the total body surface area of the dog is more indicative of reduced production of allergens than its breed.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Salo PM, Arbes SJ, Crockett PW, Thorne PS, Cohn RD, Zeldin DC |title=Exposure to multiple indoor allergens in US homes and its relationship to asthma |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=678–684.e2 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18255132 |pmc=2376121 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.12.1164[/tpl]
Smaller dogs will also leave fewer environmental pollutants containing dog dander and dog allergens (reduced fecal matter, urine and saliva). Small hairless dogs may be less likely to cause allergic reactions "because it's so easy to bathe them and the dander falls off them."[tpl]Cite news|first=Pamela |last=Fayerman |date=13 November 2008 |title=Obama's unlikely quest for 'hypoallergenic dog' |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=ccf0bb0f-f440-473a-9637-fbddf0671c51 |work=The Vancouver Sun |accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] Dogs may leave behind urine, saliva and fecal matter as allergen sources.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Wright AL |title=Early dog exposure: potential pathways to allergic disease |journal=Clinical and Experimental Allergy |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1568–71 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18647316 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.03057.x[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Park JH, Spiegelman DL, Gold DR, Burge HA, Milton DK |title=Predictors of airborne endotoxin in the home |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=109 |issue=8 |pages=859–64 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11564624 |pmc=1240416 |doi=10.2307/3454831[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Randall A, Hillier A, Cole LK, Kwochka KW, Needham G, Wassom DL |title=Quantitation of house dust mites and house dust mite allergens in the microenvironment of dogs |journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=1580–8 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14672439 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.1580[/tpl] Dogs with access to the outdoors may introduce outdoor allergens such as mold and pollen with larger animals tracking in more of these allergens.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Custovic A, Simpson BM, Simpson A, et al. |title=Current mite, cat, and dog allergen exposure, pet ownership, and sensitization to inhalant allergens in adults |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=402–7 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12589363 |doi=10.1067/mai.2003.55[/tpl] It is well established that most individuals with dog allergy also suffer with additional environmental allergies.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Abraham CM, Ownby DR, Peterson EL, et al. |title=The relationship between seroatopy and symptoms of either allergic rhinitis or asthma |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1099–104 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17416408 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.01.024[/tpl] Individuals with dog allergy may also be at increased risk for human protein hypersensitivity with cross-reactivity of dog dander allergen and human seminal fluid.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Basagaña M, Bartolomé B, Pastor C, et al. |title=Allergy to human seminal fluid: cross-reactivity with dog dander |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=233–9 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18061650 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.10.008[/tpl]

==Expert recommendations==

Researchers have shown that frequently bathing dogs reduces the amount of allergen related protein on the fur or hair of the dog and the amount of airborne allergen. Bathing a dog at least twice a week will minimize or even eliminate the reaction of an allergic person to a dog.
Frequent cleaning and vacuuming of the home, using air filters, restricting the dog to certain rooms, and adopting a small dog that can easily be given frequent baths are all recommended by the Humane Society of the United States to control allergens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/allergies_to_pets/ |title=Allergies to Pets |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] Scientific research has repeatedly shown that good cleaning practices in the home remove allergens from the environment.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(03)80414-1 |title=The long-term effect of environmental control measures on mite, cat, and dog allergen levels |date=February 2003 |first1=A. |last1=Simpson |first2=B. |last2=Simpson |first3=M. |last3=Craven |first4=A. |last4=Custovic |first5=A. |last5=Woodcock |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=111 |pages=S132–3[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Arlian LG, Neal JS, Morgan MS, Rapp CM, Clobes AL |title=Distribution and removal of cat, dog and mite allergens on smooth surfaces in homes with and without pets |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=296–302 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11686421 |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62243-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(96)80696-8 |title=478 Major dog allergen can f 1: Distribution in homes, airborne levels and particle sizing |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=97 |issue=1 Part 3 |first1=A. |last1=Custovic |first2=R. |last2=Green |first3=C.

Many allergists suggest that a dog not be introduced to the environment of a dog allergic individual.  While "allergy shots" can reduce many individuals' dog-allergic reactions, the most common approach remains avoidance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
There have been recent studies suggesting early introduction of pets to home may reduce the likelihood of developing sensitization.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Munir AK, Kjellman NI, Björkstén B |title=Exposure to indoor allergens in early infancy and sensitization |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=177–81 |date=August 1997 |pmid=9275137 |doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(97)70221-5[/tpl] There are reports of individuals who will become less sensitive with continued exposure to a pet in the environment. But allergists warn that pet owners cannot rely on a breed being non-allergenic just because a particular allergic pet owner can tolerate a specific dog of that breed.
