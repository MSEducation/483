CATEGORIES: Dessert sauces

Wet walnuts or just walnut topping is a dessert topping made from walnuts and maple syrup. Sometimes simple syrup or corn syrup is substituted for (or used in combination with) the maple syrup.  Wet walnut topping is similar in some respects to pralines, except that the walnuts are always served in syrup, rather than as individual pieces.
Wet walnuts are most commonly served with ice cream.  They are often available as an ice cream topping at ice cream parlors in the United States.
Wet walnuts  (United Kingdom) are  fresh walnuts which have not been dried for keeping. Also called green walnuts.
