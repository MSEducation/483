CATEGORIES: Gardenia, Flowers

Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania.
The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730-1791), a Scottish-born American naturalist.[ref]Ellis, John (1759). http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstl.1759.0084 "An Account of the Plants Halesia and Gardenia: In a Letter from John Ellis, Esq; F. R. S. to Philip Carteret Webb, Esq; F. R. S."

==Cultivation and uses==

Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in size in some species.
Gardenia jasminoides (syn. G. grandiflora, G. Florida) is cultivated as a house plant. This species can be difficult to grow because it originated in warm humid tropical areas. It demands high humidity to thrive and bright (not direct) light. It flourishes in acidic soils with good drainage and thrives on F temperatures (20-23 C)http://www.uri.edu/ce/factsheets/sheets/gardenia.html during the day and 60 F (15-16 C) in the evening. Potting soils developed especially for gardenias are available. G. jasminoides grows no larger than 18 inches in height and width when grown indoors. In climates where it can be grown outdoors, it can attain a height of 6 feet. If water touches the flowers, they will turn brown.Reader's Digest. Success with House Plants. The Reader's Digest Association, Inc. New York/Montreal. 217
In China and Japan, Gardenia jasminoides is called zhīzi (栀子) and kuchinashi (梔), respectively. Its blossom is used as a yellow dye, used on fabric and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called hwangpomuk). Its fruits are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their clearing, calming, and cooling properties.http://www.sacredlotus.com/herbs/get.cfm/chinese_herb/zhi_zi_gardenia_cape_jasmine_fruit

It is the national flower of Pakistan.
Several species occur on Hawaii, where gardenias are known as na[tpl]okina[/tpl]u or nānū.
Crocetin is a chemical compound found in gardenia fruit (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis). In high concentrations, it has protective effects against retinal damage in vitro and in vivo.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Yamauchi | first1 = M | last2 = Tsuruma | first2 = K | last3 = Imai | first3 = S | last4 = Nakanishi | first4 = T | last5 = Umigai | first5 = N | last6 = Shimazawa | first6 = M | last7 = Hara | first7 = H | title = Crocetin prevents retinal degeneration induced by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses via inhibition of caspase activity | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 650 | issue = 1 | pages = 110–9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 20951131 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.09.081[/tpl]
