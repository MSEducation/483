The [tpl]nihongo|Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme|語学指導等を行う外国青年招致事業|Gogaku Shidōtō o Okonau Gaikoku Seinen Shōchi Jigyō[/tpl] or [tpl]nihongo|JET Programme|JETプログラム|Jetto Puroguramu[/tpl] is a Japanese government initiative that brings college (university) graduates—mostly native speakers of English—to Japan as Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs) and Sports Education Advisors (SEAs) in Japanese kindergartens, elementary, junior high and high schools, or as Coordinators for International Relations (CIRs) in local governments and boards of education. JET Programme participants are collectively called JETs.
Participants currently come from a total of 40 countries. As of July 1, 2012, 4,360 participants[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/documents/stats/2012_jet_stats_e.pdf|title=Participants Publications: As of July 1, 2012[/tpl] (in CIR, ALT, and SEA positions) were employed on the programme, making it the world's largest exchange teaching programme. Of that number, about half are from the United States (2,334), with Canada (477), the United Kingdom (432), Australia (262), New Zealand (248), Ireland (107), and South Africa (105) making up the majority of ALTs. The majority of CIRs on the programme come from the United States (102), China (78), and Korea. Holders of Japanese passports may participate in the programme, but must renounce their Japanese citizenship to do so. The focus of the program is on English language learning and teaching, so about 90% of the participants on the programme are ALTs; the remaining 10% are divided between CIRs and SEAs. The number of alumni totals over 57,000 from 54 different countries.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Programme History|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/introduction/history.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]

==History and aims of the programme==

The English Teaching Recruitment Programme was started in 1978 and initially was exclusively for British university graduates. This programme became known as the "British English Teachers Scheme." American teaching assistants were added under the "Mombusho English Fellows Program" beginning in 1977. As more countries were included, the programmes were folded into a single entity, the JET Programme, in 1987. Its aims were revised to "increase mutual understanding between the people of Japan and the people of other nations, to promote internationalisation in Japan's local communities by helping to improve foreign language education, and to develop international exchange at the community level." The total number of JET participants steadily decreased from a high of 6,273 in 2002 down to a low of 4,330 in 2011 before stabilizing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/introduction/history.html|title=History - The JET Programme (as of July 1, 2011)[/tpl]

==Administrative details==

The programme is run by three ministries: the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in conjunction with local authorities. The programme is administered by CLAIR (the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations), and has an annual budget of over 45  billion yen (US$400 million).[tpl]cite web|title=JET Programme Organizations|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/organisations/index.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Review: David L. McConnell, Importing Diversity: Inside Japan's JET Program|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=Summer 2002|volume=42|issue=2|pages=260–263[/tpl]
There is an organization called The Association of Japan Exchange and Teaching (AJET), that provides support for the Programme participants[tpl]cite web|url=http://ajet.net/lang/en/services/ajet-peer-support-group/|title=AJET Peer Support Group - AJET[/tpl] and facilitates communication with the JET Programme sponsors.http://ajet.net/lang/en/about/what-is-ajet/[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] AJET organises events and has a number of publications to assist with teaching in Japan. Some notable publications include Planet Eigo (replacement for Team Taught Pizza[tpl]cite web|url=http://ajet.net/lang/en/ajet-publications/|title=AJET Publications - AJET[/tpl]) and Foxy Phonics.

==Application process==

Participants are also required to attend pre-departure and post-arrival orientations as well as annual mid-year conferences, and may attend a returnee conference during their tenure.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Conferences|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/current/conferences.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]
Participants are placed with a local authority in Japan (the Contracting Organization) which is the employer. There are 47 prefectural governments and 12 city governments, as well as numerous individual city, town and village governments and some private schools designated as Contracting Organisations. While applicants can specify up to three preferred locations, and can request urban, semi-rural or rural placements, they may be placed anywhere in Japan, and placements may not match requests.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Program Terms and Conditions|url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JET/terms_and_conditions.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=ALT Job Description|url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JET/jobs_alt.html|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]
Participants sign a one-year contract, which can be renewed up to four times, for a maximum of five years. Some contracting organizations offer the option of contracting for a total of five years, although some prohibit contracting beyond three years. Before 2006, participants could only contract for up to three years, with the exception of a few positions.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Programme History|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/introduction/history.html|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]
Participants who began their tenure on the program in 2011 or earlier received a salary of ¥3,600,000 per year after tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/faq/faq10rem.html#10.2|title=The JET Programme--Official Homepage of The Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme[/tpl] Participants beginning in 2012 or later are paid on a new salary scale: "3.36 million yen for the first appointment, 3.6 million yen for the second appointment, 3.9 million yen for the third appointment, and for those appointed for a fourth and fifth year, 3.96 million yen for each year." Additionally, this salary is pre-tax (as opposed to post-tax prior to 2011), so participants who are liable for income or residential taxes in Japan must pay taxes.
Participants receive paid airfare to and from Japan paid by the Japanese government, and may receive other benefits such as housing subsidies. Participants are generally forbidden to take paid work outside of their Programme duties.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Program Terms and Conditions|url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JET/terms_and_conditions.html|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]

==Participation==

This table shows the number of participants per year, per country. The number includes both new participants and participants who are continuing for another year (recontracting participants).

==Appointment renewal==

Some JETs elect to stay for the maximum number of consecutive appointments - a sum of four renewal cycles (from 2007–2008) for a total of five years maximum ALT/CIR experience.[tpl]cite web|title=JET Programme 2012 Statistics|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/documents/stats/2012_jet_stats_e.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]

==Developments==

Some JET participants in recent years have been placed in elementary schools, reflecting MEXT's plan to raise the English ability of Japanese students. Some contracting organizations go further and have ALTs periodically work with kindergarten students teaching basic English vocabulary through games and activities. This also brings them exposure to non-Japanese people. Participants occasionally also teach in special schools.
Several prefectures have opted out of the JET Programme in recent years. Some hire individuals directly through advertising or word of recommendation while others use an intermediary dispatch company - usually one of the big English schools such as Heart, Interac, or Altia.JET-Programme.com[tpl]cite web|title=Consulate-General of Japan in Miami FAQ|url=http://www.miami.us.emb-japan.go.jp/en/jetprogramfaq.html#p5|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl]  While direct-hired employees may obtain working conditions similar to the JET Programme, those employed by dispatch companies often have very different working contracts—unpaid holidays or pay-by-the-day contracts are not uncommon. Some dispatch methods used by certain Boards of Education have even been declared illegal by Japanese labor standards authorities (see Assistant Language Teacher).[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
From 2007, the possible stay for some JET participants was extended from three years to five years, subject to certain stipulations. JET participants in their third year are able to re-contract two more times if their work performance, accomplishments and abilities are deemed outstanding by their contracting organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/current/pubs/gih.html|title=CLAIR General Information Handbook[/tpl] However, as in most JET matters, the application process is decided upon by the individual contracting organization.
From 2009, it became possible to apply for an April start.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/pdf/4_JET%202010_Instructions.pdf|title=2010 Application instruction pack[/tpl] This option does not exclude the applicant from being considered from the traditional August start. Successful applicants starting in April are notified in early March (this notice includes their placement). The April start is in line with the start of the Japanese school year.
Since 1998, the Hong Kong government has operated a similar program, known as the Native English-speaking Teacher scheme, which employs about 800 teachers. Korea has also implemented a similar program called EPIK (English Program in Korea).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epik.go.kr/|title=EPIK[/tpl]
In May 2010, the JET programme came up for review by the Government Revitalization Unit, the jigyōshiwake budget review panel, due to the need to cut costs given the state of the economy of Japan.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnston|first=Eric|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100727zg.html|title=Ex-students don't want JET grounded|publisher=The Japan Times|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl] However, the subsequent LDP administration of Shinzo Abe in fact announced its likely expansion.[tpl]cite news|last=Mie|first=Ayako|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/04/23/national/ldp-looks-to-double-jet-programs-ranks-in-three-years/|title=LDP looks to double JET Program’s ranks in three years|publisher=The Japan Times|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=23 May 2013[/tpl]
In February 2012, The Japan Times alleged that one contracting Board of Education had fraudulently deducted payments from JET participants and harassed whistle-blowers of the practice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2012/02/28/general/teacher-outfoxes-board-exposes-bid-to-fleece-jets/|title='Teacher outfoxes board, exposes bid to fleece JETs'|publisher=The Japan Times|date=28 February 2012[/tpl]
