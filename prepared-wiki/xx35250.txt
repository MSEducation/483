[[Anne Hathaway's Cottage]]

CATEGORIES: Shakespeare Birthplace Trust

Anne Hathaway's Cottage is a twelve-roomed farmhouse where  Anne Hathaway, the wife of William Shakespeare, lived as a child in the village of Shottery, Warwickshire, England, about [tpl]convert|1|mi[/tpl] west of Stratford-upon-Avon. Spacious, and with several bedrooms, it is now set in extensive gardens.
The earliest part of the house was built prior to the 15th century. The cottage was known as Newlands Farm in Shakespeare's day and had more than [tpl]convert|90|acre|ha|abbr=off[/tpl] of land attached to it. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible timber framing, typical of vernacular Tudor style architecture. 
After the death of Hathaway's father, the cottage was owned by her brother Bartholomew, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems forced them to sell it. However, it was still occupied by them as tenants when it was acquired in 1892 by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which removed later additions and alterations. In 1969 the cottage was badly damaged in a fire, but was restored by the Trust.Shakespeare Birthplace Trust: Anne Hathaway's Cottage It is now open to public visitors as a museum.
