[[Kimberley Warm Springs]]

CATEGORIES: North West Tasmania, Hot springs of Australia

Kimberley Warm Springs are a geothermal feature and semi-developed visitor site located within the town of Kimberley, north west Tasmania. 
The Springs are located within the Kimberley Warm Springs Reserve managed by Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania. The reserve features a constructed pool, approximately 13m by 20m wide and 1.2m in depth, a sheltered barbecue area, parking and public toilets. Access to the site is from Warm Springs Road off Morrison Street. The site is well signposted within the town.
Water from the springs remains at a constant temperature of 24-25Â°C. The water's chemical composition suggests it gains its heat from hotter sub-surface materials. The dissolved solids content is fairly low and contains mainly bicarbonate and calcium ions.[tpl]cite AHD|19966|Kimberley Warm Springs Reserve[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Thermal spring at Kimberley|author=W.

The clearance of shading vegetation has led to excessive algal growth which is periodically removed as it covers the naturally sandy bottom of the spring.
The spring represents the only one of its kind in the region of north west of Tasmania. The spring is home to an endemic snail and an algae (Pithophora spp.) not previously recorded south of Sydney.
