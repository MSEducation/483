[[Finlandia (vodka)]]

CATEGORIES: Brown-Forman brands, Finnish vodkas

The vodka Finlandia is produced from Finnish-grown six-row barley and pure glacier water. The barley is distilled into a neutral spirit using a continuous multi-pressure distillation system at Altia Corporation's distillery in Finnish village of Koskenkorva. The distilled alcohol is then transported to Rajamäki production plant where it is diluted with water, flavored, and bottled.
Finlandia is available in pure form (alcohol + water) and several flavored versions.
Flavors include cranberry (since 1994), lime (1999), mango (2004), red berry (2004), wild berries (2005), grapefruit (2006), tangerine (2009) and blackcurrant (2009).
Courtesy of its name, Finlandia is widely associated with Finland on the international market.
