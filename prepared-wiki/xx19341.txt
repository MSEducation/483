[[Kilogram per cubic metre]]

CATEGORIES: SI derived units, Units of chemical measurement, Units of density

==Conversions==

1 kg/m3 is equivalent to:
1 g/cm3 = 1000 kg/m3 = 1,000,000 g/m3 (exactly)
1 lb/ft3 ≈ 16.02 kg/m3 (approximately)
1 oz/gal ≈ 7.489 kg/m3 (approximately)

==Relation to other measures==

The kilogram was originally based on the mass of one litre of water, thus the density of water is about 1000 kg/m3 or 1 g/cm3. In chemistry, g/cm3 is more commonly used.
