==Football career==

Jamelli made his professional debuts with hometown side São Paulo Futebol Clube, appearing in seven first division games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://futpedia.globo.com/jogadores/jamelli/jogos/pagina/0/ordem/11|title=Jamelli - todos os jogos|trans_title=Jamelli - all the matches|publisher=Futpédia|language=Portuguese|accessdate=14 April 2009[/tpl] He first made his presence felt with Santos Futebol Clube, scoring 13 goals during two seasons. 
Having attracted the attention of clubs abroad, Jamelli moved to Kashiwa Reysol in Japan but, in January 1998, switched to Spain's Real Zaragoza, as the Aragonese had lost in the previous summer Dani García and Fernando Morientes, both to Real Madrid. Never an undisputed starter he was almost always a very important offensive element, scoring a career-best 13 La Liga goals in 2000–01, precisely the year of the side's domestic cup conquest, where he netted in the final against Celta de Vigo (3–1).
After Zaragoza's relegation, Jamelli started off in the second level, but eventually returned to Brazil in January 2003, joining Sport Club Corinthians Paulista. He ended his career in 2006, after one-season spells with Shimizu S-Pulse, UD Almería, Corinthians, Clube Atlético Mineiro and Grêmio Prudente Futebol.
Jamelli joined Coritiba Foot Ball Club as a technical coordinator. However, on 1 April 2009, he left the post, due to personal problems with coach Ivo Wortmann.Paulo Jamelli está deixando o Coritiba (Paulo Jamelli is leaving Coritiba) [tpl]pt icon[/tpl]
