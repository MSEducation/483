==Career==

Born in Split, Lendrić rose through the ranks of the HNK Hajduk Split Academy. In the 2009–10, his last youth level season, Lendrić was top scorer of the Croatian academy league and was voted best youth player by the Croatian sports daily Sportske novosti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/lendricu-prekipjelo--dosta-je-bilo--igrat-cu-za-bih--ne-znam-sto-da-napravim-da-me-susak-pozove-/924688/|title=Lendrić: Igrat ću za BiH!

He turned professional in July 2010, but failed to break into the first team under coach Stanko Poklepović so he was loaned to HŠK Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] While at Zrinjski Lendrić became top scorer in the 2010–11 Bosnian championship, with 16 goals.
In the summer of 2011 he returned from loan and joined the first team under coach Krasimir Balakov. In June 2012, Lendrić signed a three-year contract with Belgian club Zulte Waregem.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/441580/nogomet-1-hnl/ivan-lendric-u-belgiji-potpisao-trogodisnji-ugovor/ |title=Ivan Lendrić u Belgiji potpisao trogodišnji ugovor |last=Rupnik |first=Borna |date=7 June 2012 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl]
After a moderately successful season at Zulte Waregem, NK Lokomotiva decided to bring the player back to the Croatian First Division in a €500,000 deal. In January 2014 his contract with Lokomotiva was terminated. In February he signed for Kapfenberg SV.
Internationally Lendrić represented Croatia at all youth levels and was part of the squad called up for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup by manager Ivica Grnja, where he scored a goal in Croatia's 2–5 defeat against Nigeria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/newsid=1487164/index.html|title=Lendric relishing golden opportunity|date=5 August 2011|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]
