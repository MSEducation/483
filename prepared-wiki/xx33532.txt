The Quilt is a memorial to and celebration of the lives of people lost to the AIDS pandemic.  Each panel is 3' by 6', approximately the size of the average grave; this connects the ideas of AIDS and death more closely, even though only about 20% of the people lost to AIDS related causes are represented."The AIDS Memorial Quilt."

The NAMES Project Foundation is now headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and has 21 chapters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate organizations world-wide.

===Goal and achievement===

The goal of the Quilt is to bring awareness to how massive the AIDS pandemic really is, and to bring support and healing to those affected by it.  Another goal is to raise funds for community based AIDS service organizations (ASO's), to increase their funding for AIDS prevention and education. As of 1996, more than $1.7 million had already been raised, and the effort continues to this day.[ref]Ellis, Fay. "32,000 Panels in Aids Quilt, 32,000 Victims."

==Panel composition==

Typically very personalized, individual quilt panels are created by the loved ones of someone who has died of AIDS-related causes. Each 3' by 6' panel is the size of a human grave and the panels are donated to The NAMES Project Foundation where they are grouped with other similar panels and assembled into 12' by 12' sections, called "blocks". These blocks can be seen at local displays of The Quilt, typically containing 8 individual panels.
Techniques used in making panels include patchwork, applique, embroidery, fabric painting, collage, spray paint and needlepoint, along with other methods.
Items and materials included in the panels:

===Examples of panels===

Those who submit panels do not have to know the person, but they do have to feel some sort of connection with the individual that they want people to recognize. For example, to memorialize Queen lead-singer Freddie Mercury, there were many panels made, two of which were a solid white background with a blue and black guitar, and "Freddy Mercury" written down the sides in black, with the AIDS ribbon above his name,Freddy Mercury AIDS quilt panel. 23 Feb. 2009 . and a purple silk with "Freddie Mercury," "Queen," and "1946-1991" in silver applique, along with two pictures of Mercury with Queen.Freddie Mercury AIDS Quilt panel. 23 Feb. 2009 .
Many panels were also made for the actor Rock Hudson, one of which consisted of a navy blue background with silver "Rock Hudson" and stars, above a rainbow with the word "Hollywood".Rock Hudson AIDS Quilt panel. 23 Feb. 2009 .
Other panels are made by loved ones and then attached to make one large block.  Some are flamboyant and loud, whereas some are more muted and simple; either way they all carry their own set of emotions.http://imposedblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/aids-quilt-panel-north.jpg. 25 Feb. 2009.

==Recognition and influence==

===Projects inspired by NAMES===

The AIDS Memorial Quilt was the first of its kind as a continually growing monument created piecemeal by thousands of individuals, and today it constitutes the largest piece of community folk art in the world.[tpl]cite news |last= McKinley |first= Jesse |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C01E2DE153FF932A05752C0A9619C8B63 |title=  Fight Over Quilt Reflects Changing Times in Battle Against AIDS |publisher= The New York Times |date= 2007-01-31 |accessdate= 2008-03-25[/tpl] It was seemingly inevitable that The Quilt be followed by a variety of memorials and awareness projects, both AIDS-related and otherwise, that have been inspired by and modeled after The AIDS Memorial Quilt and its caretaker The NAMES Project Foundation. Examples of these include:
