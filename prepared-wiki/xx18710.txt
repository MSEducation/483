[[Partition of unity]]

CATEGORIES: Differential topology, Topology

Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space.  They are also important in the interpolation of data, in signal processing, and the theory of spline functions.  

==Existence==

The existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms:
Thus one chooses either to have the supports indexed by the open cover, or compact supports.  If the space is compact, then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements.
A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff.[tpl]cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-054234-1|pages=40|edition=3rd ed.[/tpl] 
Paracompactness of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity subordinate to any open cover.  Depending on the category which the space belongs to, it may also be a sufficient condition.[tpl]cite book|last=Border|first=Charalambos D.

Thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist. See analytic continuation.

==Variant definitions==

Sometimes a less restrictive definition is used: the sum of all the function values at a particular point is only required to be positive, rather than 1, for each point in the space.  However, given such a set of functions, one can obtain a partition of unity in the strict sense by dividing every function by the sum of all functions (which is defined, since at any point it has only a finite number of terms).

==Applications==

A partition of unity can be used to define the integral (with respect to a volume form) of a function defined over a manifold: One first defines the integral of a function whose support is contained in a single coordinate patch of the manifold; then one uses a partition of unity to define the integral of an arbitrary function; finally one shows that the definition is independent of the chosen partition of unity.
A partition of unity can be used to show the existence of a Riemannian metric on an arbitrary manifold.
Method of steepest descent employs a partition of unity to construct asymptotics of integrals.
Linkwitzâ€“Riley filter is an example of practical implementation of partition of unity to separate input signal into two output signals containing only high- or low-frequency components.
