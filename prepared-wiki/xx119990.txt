Tirigan was the last Gutian ruler in Sumer, who ruled for 40 days before being defeated by Utu-hengal of Uruk, ca. 2050 BC (short chronology).Encyclopædia Britannica, 'Tirigan'The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?simplesearchword=tirigan&simplesearch=translation&searchword=&charenc=gcirc&lists=
"Tirigan ruled for 40 days. 21 kings; they  ruled for { (ms. L1+N1 has:) 124 years and 40 days } { (ms. Su3+Su4 has instead:) 25 years }. Then the army of Gutium was { defeated } { (ms. TL has instead:) destroyed } and the kingship was taken to Unug.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
The enemy troops established themselves everywhere. Tirigan, the king of Gutium …… the mouths of the channels (?). Nobody came out of his city to face him; he already occupied both banks of the Tigris. In the south, in Sumer, he blocked the water from the fields, in the uplands he closed off the roads. Because of him the grass grew high on the highways of the land.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
After departing from the temple of Iškur, on the fourth day he set up camp (?) in Naĝsu on the Surungal canal, and on the fifth day he set up camp (?) at the shrine at Ili-tappê. He captured Ur-Ninazu and Nabi-Enlil, generals of Tirigan sent as envoys to Sumer, and put them in handcuffs.
The victory of Utu-ḫeĝal: c.2.1.6
Then Tirigan the king of Gutium ran away alone on foot. He thought himself safe in Dabrum, where he fled to save his life; but since the people of Dabrum knew that Utu-ḫeĝal was a king endowed with power by Enlil, they did not let Tirigan go, and an envoy of Utu-ḫeĝal arrested Tirigan together with his wife and children in Dabrum. He put handcuffs and a blindfold on him. Before Utu, Utu-ḫeĝal made him lie at his feet and placed his foot on his neck. He made Gutium, the fanged (?) snake of the mountains drink again from the crevices (?), he ……, he …… and he …… boat. He brought back the kingship of Sumer."
