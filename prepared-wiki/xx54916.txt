==Life and career==

Uris was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Jewish American parents Wolf William and Anna (Blumberg) Uris. His father, a Polish-born immigrant, was a paperhanger, then a storekeeper. His mother was first-generation Russian American.Congressional Record, p. 16911 William spent a year in Palestine after World War I before entering the United States. He derived his surname from Yerushalmi, meaning "man of Jerusalem". (His brother Aron, Leon's uncle, took the name Yerushalmi) "He was basically a failure", Uris later said of his father. "I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of being a Jew in Czarist Russia. I think failure formed his character, made him bitter."[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20030624/ai_n11400762|title=Leon Uris, author of 'Exodus', novel of founding of Israel, and other|accessdate=August 11, 2010|publisher=Deseret News|author=Hillel Italie AP national|format=news|date=June 2003[/tpl]
At age six, Uris reportedly wrote an operetta inspired by the death of his dog. Uris attended schools in Norfolk, Virginia and Baltimore, but never graduated from high school, and failed English three times. When Uris was 17 and in his senior year of high school, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and Uris enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He served in the South Pacific, where he was stationed in New Zealand, and fought as a radioman in combat on Guadalcanal and TarawaLeon Uris Biography at nytimes.com from 1942 through 1945. While recuperating from malaria in San Francisco, he met Betty Beck, a Marine sergeant; they married in 1945.
Coming out of the service, he worked for a newspaper, writing in his spare time. Esquire magazine, in 1950, bought an article, and he began to devote himself to writing more seriously.  Drawing on his experiences in Guadalcanal and Tarawa he produced the best-selling, Battle Cry, a novel depicting the toughness and courage of U.S. Marines in the Pacific. He then went to Warner Brothers in Hollywood helping to write the movie, which was extremely popular with the public, if not the critics. He went on to write The Angry Hills, a novel set in war-time Greece.
His best-known work may be Exodus, which was published in 1958. Most sources indicate Uris, motivated by an intense interest in Israel, financed his research for the novel by selling the film rights in advance to MGM and by writing newspaper articles about the Sinai campaign.Leon Uris,  78, Who Wrote Sweeping Novels Like "Exodus," Dies New York Times – June 25, 2003[tpl]cite book|title=The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger|page=255|author=Chris Fujiwara|isbn=0-86547-995-X|year=2009 |publisher=Faber & Faber[/tpl] http://books.google.com/books?id=lM-8-isjOYgC&pg=PA255&dq=Leon+Uris+-inauthor:%22Leon+Uris%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=tTs0S8HpPJOElQTRiaDMAQ&cd=34#v=onepage&q=Leon%20Uris%20-inauthor%3A%22Leon%20Uris%22&f=false[tpl]cite book|title=The Jew in American Cinema|page=217|author=Patricia Erens|publisher=Indiana University Press, 1988|isbn=0-86547-995-X[/tpl] http://books.google.com/books?id=-v2Di_5ShGMC&pg=PA217&dq=Leon+Uris+-inauthor:%22Leon+Uris%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=okA0S8r7Fo3uzQSC19nKAQ&cd=55#v=onepage&q=Leon%20Uris%20-inauthor%3A%22Leon%20Uris%22&f=false It is said that the book involved two years of research, and involved thousands of interviews.[tpl]cite book|title=Contemporary Jewish-American Novelists: A Bio-Critical Sourcebook|page=440|author=Joel Shatzky|coauthor=Michael Taub|isbn=0-313-29462-3|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press[/tpl] Exodus illustrated the history of Palestine from the late 19th century through the founding of the state of Israel in 1948.
