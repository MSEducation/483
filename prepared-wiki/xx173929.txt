She moved on to be director of library services at the University of Aston, and spent some time as a consultant for KPMG.

==Context of change==

A switch from print to digital publishing by the year 2020 is anticipated; which implies that readers will have diminishing physical contact with books, the primary experience and foundation of civilization for the last 500 years. In this context of change, Brindley is committed to ensuring that the Library does not become little more than “a book museum”.[tpl]Cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1294849.ece | title=Could this be the final chapter in the life of the book |newspaper=The Times | date=21 January 2007 | location=London | first1=Jerome | last1=Starkey | first2=Sadie | last2=Gray[/tpl] Brindley's explained: "Most people are aware that a national switch to digital broadcasting is expected by the end of this decade. Less well known is the fact that a similar trend is underway in the world of publishing: by the year 2020, 40% of UK research monographs will be available in electronic format only, while a further 50% will be produced in both print and digital. A mere 10% of new titles will be available in print alone by 2020."[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.bl.uk/news/2005/pressrelease20050629.html | title=British Library predicts 'switch to digital by 2020' | publisher=British Library | date=29 June 2005 [/tpl] 

==Book preservation==

Brindley's BL has long been the conservator of historic print collections and regarded as a place of quiet study; but with the explosion of the internet and electronic publishing, users are increasingly turning their backs on libraries as a physical space, using them as virtual, digital environments instead. In this context, the BL role in warehousing large book collections is at risk.[tpl]Cite news | url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,2240545,00.html | last=Gilbert | first=Natasha | title=Intellectual literacy hour; A new report says libraries will have to change what they do or risk becoming redundant | newspaper=The Guardian | date=15 January 2008 | location=London[/tpl]

==Research==

Brindley accords special priority to the needs of researchers and believes that libraries should also play a key role in helping to teach information literacy skills. In this context, Brindley observed that: "the younger generation is technologically more literate but not more information literate is a challenge that must be tackled by libraries and education more widely. Students who simply want to use Google and take what it says as gospel do a real disservice to the skills people will increasingly need to survive in the digital economy. Libraries add a degree of sophistication, support and richness of content, all of which will encourage creativity, quality research and participation of the citizen in the global digital world that we are in."
