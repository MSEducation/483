[[East San Diego]]

CATEGORIES: History of San Diego, California

East San Diego was an independent, short-lived city that existed from 1912 to 1923 in what is now the City Heights neighborhood of the city of San Diego, California. The town had its own city hall and police department.[tpl]cite web|url=http://russelrayphotos2.com/2013/04/10/san-diego-then-now-the-bank-of-east-san-diego|title=San Diego Then & Now â€” The Bank of East San Diego|work=Russell Ray Photos|accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl] It had a population of about 4,000.
The city of East San Diego called itself the "Golden Rule City" and enacted conservative laws. The city did not allow gambling or alcohol, and enforced a maximum speed of 25 mph on all city streets.  However, an inability to generate enough tax revenue to support city services forced East San Diego to merge with the City of San Diego in 1923.  Boundary Street is a lasting relic of the former border between the two cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://video.kpbs.org/video/2326355514/|title=Episode 56|last=Kramer|first=Ken|date=January 24, 2013|work=About San Diego|publisher=KPBS-TV|accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl]
