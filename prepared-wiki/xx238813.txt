==Directing career==

===1998-2008: Theater and television===

Robinson's career began with theater. In 1998, she directed the play Terms of Abuse; The New York Times Sheridan Morley wrote that "Julie-Anne Robinson's production never quite manages to hold it all together ... what might have made for a highly dramatic 50 minutes on television seems sprawling even as a short evening in the theater."[tpl]cite news |author= Morley, Sheridan |title= A Tale of the Final Betrayal |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/style/04iht-lon.t.html |publisher= The New York Times |date= 1998-02-04 |accessdate=2009-10-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] However, Robinson received favorable reviews for the play Yard, which she directed later the same year. Scriptwriter Kaite O' Reiley earned the Peggy Ramsay Award for writing the play, which takes place in a butcher shop. The Daily Telegraph wrote that under Robinson's direction, "the cast's constant work with flopping slabs of flesh is both fascinatingly naturalistic and humorously gruesome."[tpl]cite news |author= |title= Plenty of meat, but overdone |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4715911/Plenty-of-meat-but-overdone.html |work= |publisher= The Daily Telegraph |date= 1998-10-08 |accessdate=2009-10-10 | location=London[/tpl] Robinson followed with Blagger in 2000; The Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer remarked that it was "notably well-acted under Julie-Anne Robinson's direction" in his review.[tpl]cite news |author= Spencer, Charles |title=  A criminal abundance of clichés |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4720207/A-criminal-abundance-of-cliches.html |work= |publisher= The Daily Telegraph |date= 2009-03-20 |accessdate=2009-10-10 | location=London[/tpl] In 2000, Morley reviewed the play A Place at the Table as "tightly directed by Julie-Anne Robinson".[tpl]cite news |author= Sheridan, Morley |title= A Dark View of Writing for TV |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/23/style/23iht-lon.t_2.html |work= |publisher= The New York Times |date= 2000-02-23|accessdate=2009-10-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
