Strapping Young Lad (occasionally referred to as SYL) is the eponymous third album by Canadian heavy metal band Strapping Young Lad. It was released on February 11, 2003.

==Background==

In December 2001 Townsend announced that, contrary to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album would be released in 2002. He emphasized that he was not "forcing" his product upon fans to generate record sales, arguing that his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavour. Instead, Townsend's motivation was the "creative anger" sparked by the September 11, 2001 attacks and further cultivated during their 2001 tour.[tpl]cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad To Record New Album!|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/strapping-young-lad-to-record-new-album/|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2001-12-21[/tpl] For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote "about half" of the material on the 2001 Foot in Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002.[tpl]cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Axeman Rocks Out On Three Fronts|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/strapping-young-lad-axeman-rocks-out-on-three-fronts/|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2002-01-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The World Makes Way - CoC interviews Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=Chronicles of Chaos|author=McKay, Aaron|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-595_strapping_young_lad.aspx|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2003-06-12[/tpl] After playing a small number of festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.[tpl]cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Enter Studio To Record Third CD|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/strapping-young-lad-enter-studio-to-record-third-cd/|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2002-09-16[/tpl]

==Music==

The album's sound was somewhat of a departure from Strapping Young Lad's previous albums, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing and City. Devin Townsend's vocals contain much more singing than before, and rather than the blinding extreme metal/industrial metal styled songs of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing and City, many of the songs were structured and produced in a manner more akin to traditional death metal. The overall tone is more serious in nature and contains less overt tongue-in-cheek humour than other SYL releases. The raw production style in particular is different from other records Devin has produced.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] The slightly different sound on this album can in part be attributed to the fact that second guitarist Jed Simon plays the vast majority of rhythm guitars. This was due to Townsend's concurrent production and recording of Accelerated Evolution by The Devin Townsend Band, which was released only a few weeks later.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

==Release and critical reception==

Strapping Young Lad was released on February 11, 2003, and became the band's first charting album, entering Billboard's Top Heatseekers at No. 97.[tpl]cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Enter Billboard Heatskeekers Chart|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/strapping-young-lad-enter-billboard-heatseekers-chart/|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2003-02-20[/tpl] The album received moderate critical success. Nate Smith from Rockzone.com called it a "solid addition to the Townsend catalog", but "not an instant classic".[tpl]cite web|title=CD Reviews: Strapping Young Lad - SYL|publisher=Rockzone.com|author=Smith, Nate|url=http://rockzone.com/reviews/syl-st.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-31|year=2003[/tpl] Xander Hoose from Chronicles of Chaos called it "a good album", but said that it is inferior to City.[tpl]cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad - SYL : Review|publisher=Chronicles of Chaos|author=Hoose, Xander|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-2966_strapping_young_lad_syl.aspx|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2003-04-16[/tpl] Alec A. Head of Satan Stole My Teddybear wasn't impressed, writing, "Sadly, the songwriting putters out into a flaccid, heartless, faux-epic quagmire of riffs that have no destination, vocals that lack the ferocity and pure, unadulterated anger and emotion that Townsend exhibited on City, and an altogether forced, cold, and directionless sense of songwriting."Alec A.
