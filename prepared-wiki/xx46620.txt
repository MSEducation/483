[[Timber hitch]]

The timber hitch is a knot used to attach a single length of rope to a cylindrical object.  Secure while tension is maintained, it is easily untied even after heavy loading.[tpl]citation|last=Ashley |first=Clifford W. |title=The Ashley Book of Knots|year= 1944 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn= |page=290[/tpl][tpl]citation|first=Cyrus Lawrence|last=Day|title=The Art of Knotting and Splicing|edition=4th|location=Annapolis|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1986|pages=94–95[/tpl][tpl]Citation|title=The Tree Climber's Companion|last=Jepson|first=Jeff|edition=2nd|year=2000|publisher=Beaver Tree Publishing|location=Minneapolis|page=78[/tpl]
The timber hitch is an old knot.  It is first known to have been mentioned in a nautical source circa 1625[tpl]Citation|title=A Treatise on Rigging c. 1625|editor1=Anderson, R.C.|editor2=Salisbury, W.|publisher=The Society for Nautical Research|series=Occasional Publications No. 6|year=1958|location=London|page=51|quote=The Truss is fastened to the middle of the mayne yearde betwene the Parell with a tymber hitch and from thence goes through a blocke fastened to the mayne mast close to the middle decke and so to the Capstone when you will use him.[/tpl] and illustrated in 1762.

==Usage==

As the name suggests, this knot is often used by lumbermen and arborists for attaching ropes to tree trunks, branches, and logs.Ashley (1944), p. 77  For stability when towing or lowering long items, the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber hitch creates a killick hitch.  This can also prevent the timber hitch from rolling.
This knot is also known as the Bowyer's Knot, as it is used to attach the lower end of the bowstring to the bottom limb on an English longbow.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.longbowarchers.co.uk/knot.html|title=Tying the Bowyers Knot|first=Pip|last=Bickerstaffe|publisher=Grand Affairs Group|year=2010|accessdate=2012-01-02[/tpl]

==Tying==

To make the knot, pass the rope completely around the object. Pass the running end around the standing part, then through the loop just formed. Make three or more turns (or twists) around the working part.  Pull on the standing part to tighten around the object. 
A common error in tying can be avoided by assuring that the turns are made in the working part around itself.[tpl]Citation|last=Asher|first=Harry|title=The Alternative Knot Book|publisher=Nautical Books|location=London|year=1989|isbn=0-7136-5950-5|page=32[/tpl]  When making the hitch in laid rope, the turns should be made with the lay of the rope, that is, in the same direction as the twist of the rope.

==Security==

Although The Ashley Book of Knots states that "three tucks or turns are ample", this work was written prior to the wide use of synthetic fiber cordage.  Later sources suggest five or more turns may be required for full security in modern ropes.[tpl]Citation|last=Budworth|first=Geoffrey|title=The Complete Book of Knots|publisher=Lyons & Burford|year=1997|location=New York, New York|page=47[/tpl]
