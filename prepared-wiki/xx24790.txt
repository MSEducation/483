==Personal life==

Alan Bush was born in Dulwich, London, to Alfred Walter Bush (1869–1935), a director of the manufacturing chemists, W. J. Bush & Co., and his wife, Alice Maud Brinsley (1870–1951).Richard Stoker (2004). Bush, Alan Dudley (1900–1995). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2011-07-15. He was educated first at Highgate School (1911–17) and then at the Royal Academy of Music (1918–22), where he studied composition under Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. Later he studied musicology and philosophy with Johannes Wolf and Friedrich Blumein at the University of Berlin (1929–31), as well as taking composition lessons (1927–32) with John Ireland. He also studied the piano under Benno Moiseiwitsch and Artur Schnabel.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 3 Nov 1995
One of his fellow composition students was Michael Head, who introduced Bush to his younger sister Nancy. They married in 1931. She provided libretti for three of his four full-length operas, three children's operas and other works.

From 1925 to 1978 he taught at the Royal Academy of Music where his compositions included A Homage to William Sterndale Bennett. His academic training, particularly in Berlin, put him in contact with well-known socialist artists from different traditions, such as Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler.
In April 1940 he conducted the British premiere of Aram Khachaturian's Piano Concerto in D-flat with Moura Lympany as soloist.  She had agreed after Clifford Curzon had declined Edward Clark's offer, even though the score was still in manuscript and she had only one month in which to learn the piece.  Clark was a conductor and influential former BBC producer, but was in this instance acting in his capacity as a member of the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR. Bush had been friends with Clark for some years; he was also left-leaning but not a committed Communist like Bush.jstorIvory Classics In 1930 Bush had dedicated his Dance Overture for Military Band to Edward Clark.Alan Bush Trust

==Music and politics==

He was known as an outspoken advocate of Marxism, holding posts as conductor of the London Labour Choral Union and in 1936 was co-founder of the Workers' Music Association, and later its President. Bush composed the music for and conducted the choir at the Pageant of Labour at the Crystal Palace on 15–20 October 1934.Official Book and Programme of the Pageant of Labour, 1934 This influence can also be seen in many of his works, including the operas Wat Tyler (1948–50) and Men of Blackmoor (1954–55), and his piano concerto which has a communist text declaimed by a male chorus in the last movement. A broadcast embargo on signatories to the People's Convention in 1941 that included Bush led to Ralph Vaughan Williams refusing broadcast rights for a new work in protest, even though he did not share the group's political views.
Other works include four symphonies (No. 1 in C; No. 2, The Nottingham;Naxos Music Library - Invaluable Resource for Music Enthusiasts and Collectors No. 3, Byron Symphony and No. 4, Lascaux Symphony); Variations, Nocturne and Finale on an English Sea-song, Op. 60, for piano and orchestra; and Songs of the Doomed. Many of these works were performed first in Eastern Europe.
