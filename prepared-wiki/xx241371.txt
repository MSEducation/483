The Shenyang J-15 (Chinese: 歼-15), also known as Flying Shark ([tpl]zh|s=飞鲨[/tpl], Fēishā), is a carrier-based fighter aircraft in development by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and the 601 Institute for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's aircraft carriers. Rumors initially claimed the aircraft was to be a semi-stealth variant, yet later reports indicate the aircraft is based on the Russian-designed Sukhoi Su-33 and is fitted with domestically produced radars, engines, and weapons. An unfinished Su-33 prototype, the T-10K-3, was acquired from Ukraine sometime in 2001 and is said to have been studied extensively, with development on the J-15 beginning immediately afterward.[tpl]cite news |title=Russia downplays Chinese J-15 fighter capabilities |first=Maria |last=Chapligina |agency=RIA Novosti |date=4 June 2010 |url=http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20100604/159306694.html |accessdate=4 June 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/j-11.htm|title=Chinese Aircraft - J-11 (Su-27 FLANKER)|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2011-07-04[/tpl]Revealing Shenyang J-XX Stealth Fighter of China - What's On Xiamen俄方称中国自研先进战机不顺 仍将回头购俄战机_军事_凤凰网 While the J-15 appears to be structurally based on the Su-33, the indigenous fighter features Chinese technologies as well as avionics from the J-11B program.[tpl]cite web|last=Fulghum|first=David A.|title=New Chinese Ship-Based Fighter Progresses|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/asd/2011/04/27/02.xml&headline=New%20Chinese%20Ship-Based%20Fighter%20Progresses&next=0|work=Article|publisher=Aviation Week|accessdate=27 April 2011[/tpl]

==Design and development==

Russian military experts have downplayed any significant competition from the J-15 in the global arms market, with Col. Igor Korotchenko of the Defense Ministry stating in early June 2010, "The Chinese J-15 is unlikely to achieve the same performance characteristics of the Russian Su-33 carrier-based fighter, and I do not rule out the possibility that China could return to negotiations with Russia on the purchase of a substantial batch of Su-33s." China has actively sought to purchase Su-33s from Russia on numerous occasions—an unsuccessful offer was made as late as March 2009[tpl]cite news |title=China can't buy Sukhoi fighter jets |first=Andrei |last=Chang |agency=United Press International |date=March 4, 2009 |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2009/03/25/China-cant-buy-Sukhoi-fighter-jets/UPI-70711238010376/ |accessdate=4 June 2010 [/tpl]—but negotiations collapsed in 2006 after it was discovered that China had developed a modified versionChina imitates Russian Su-27SK fighter - upiasia.comThe Development of China's Air Force Capabilities | RANDDefence Security Report of the Sukhoi Su-27SK designated the Shenyang J-11B,Chinese version of Russian jet endangers bilateral relations[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3947599&c=ASI&s=AIR|title=Russia Admits China Illegally Copied Its Fighter|publisher=DefenceNews|author=Wendell Minnick|accessdate=2011-07-04 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=NjRRVy6JYW4C&pg=PA309&dq=J-11B+copy&hl=en&ei=dTMQTMj3HIK88gaclJCfCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|title=SIPRI Yearbook 2009:Armaments, Disarmament, and International Security|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=2011-07-04[/tpl] in violation of intellectual property agreements.
The first J-15 prototype is believed to have performed its maiden flight on August 31, 2009, powered by Russian-supplied AL-31 turbofan engines.  Video and still images of the flight were released in July 2010, showing the same basic airframe design as the Su-33.First glimpse of Chinese fighter, or Russian rip-off? In July 2011, it was reported FWS-10H turbofan engine was chosen for J-15 fighter, which has takeoff thrust increased to 12,800 kg, comparing FWS-10 turbofan's 12,500 kg. Other improvements were also made to make it better suited to carrier-based fighter's requirement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/english/J-15-naval-carrier-based-fighter-china.html |title=J15 carrier based fighter, FWS-10 turbofan engine | work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] On May 6, 2010, the aircraft conducted its first takeoff from a simulated ski-jump.
The reliance on ski-jump launches and the lack of Chinese carrier based refueling capabilities are believed to greatly reduce the effective range of the J-15.Gabe Collins and Andrew Erickson. "China’s J-15 No Game Changer."
The J-15 is reported to use different avionics and systems than the Su-33, and uses Chinese-developed technologies, and features various upgrades such as AESA radar, composite and radar absorbent material, MAWS, improved IRST, and new electronics.http://chinese-military-aviation.blogspot.ca/p/fighters-ii.html  An article in the China Signpost believes the J-15 "likely exceeds or matches the aerodynamic capabilities of virtually all fighter aircraft currently operated by regional militaries, with the exception of the U.S. F-22 Raptor",http://www.chinasignpost.com/2011/06/flying-shark%E2%80%9D-gaining-altitude-how-might-new-j-15-strike-fighter-improve-china%E2%80%99s-maritime-air-warfare-ability/ alleging that the J-15 likely possesses a 10% superior thrust-to-weight ratio and a 25% lower wing loading than the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet[tpl]Better source|reason=The article doesn't provide evidence of why the J-15 is superior in the areas it says it is vis-a-vis the F-18|date=November 2012[/tpl] However, one of the authors of that same article described the J-15 in another as no game changer[tpl]cite news|last=Collins & Erickson|first=Gabe & Andrew|title=China’s J-15 No Game Changer|url=http://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2011/06/23/china%E2%80%99s-j-15-no-game-changer/|newspaper=The Diplomat|date=June 23, 2011[/tpl]; Hu Siyuan of the National Defense University PLA China has said that "the current weak point of the J-15 is its Russia-made Al-31 engines which are less powerful than that of the American F-35 fighter".Jian, Yang.

A twin seat variant made its maiden flight on November 4, 2012.  The general designer of J-15 is Mr. Sun Cong (孙聪)."Test Flights of J-15S Flying Shark Tandem Seat Carrier-Borne Fighter ~ Chinese Military Review."
The J-15's chief designer, Sun Cong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has said that the J-15 could match the F/A-18 in bomb load, combat radius and mobility. However, in a similar statement, more work was required in its electronics and combat systems."J-15 fighter able to attack over 1,000 km." He also indicated the lack of mature domestically produced engines as a current weak spot."J-31 may become China's next generation carrier-borne fighter jet."
Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo stated that the aircraft's air combat capabilities were better than that of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. However, he also stated that its ability to attack land and sea targets were slightly inferior to the F/A-18E/F. It is also stated that its electronic equipment meets the standards of those on a fifth generation fighter."J-15 better than U.S. F/A-18 in terms of air action, slightly inferior in terms of attack against sea targets."
