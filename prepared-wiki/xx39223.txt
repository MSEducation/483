Ain't Misbehavin' is a musical revue with a book by Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr., and music by various composers and lyricists.  It is named after the song by Fats Waller (with Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf), "Ain't Misbehavin'".
The musical is a tribute to the black musicians of the 1920s and '30s who were part of the Harlem Renaissance, an era of growing creativity, cultural awareness, and ethnic pride, and takes its title from the 1929 Waller song "Ain't Misbehavin'". It was a time when Manhattan nightclubs like the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom were the playgrounds of high society and Lenox Avenue dives were filled with piano players banging out the new beat known as swing. Five performers present an evening of rowdy, raunchy, and humorous songs that encapsulate the various moods of the era and reflect Waller's view of life as a journey meant for pleasure and play.

Ain't Misbehavin' opened in the Manhattan Theatre Club's East 73rd Street cabaret on February 8, 1978. The cast included Irene Cara, Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, and Ken Page and was staged by Maltby. The New York Times reviewer wrote: "The show moves with the zing and sparkle of a Waller recording-filled with bright melodies and asides."[tpl]cite news| last = Wilson| first = John S.| title = 'Here'Tis'-A Musical Bow to Fats Waller; The Cast| newspaper = The New York Times| pages = C13| date = February 20, 1978| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3071EFF3E5413728DDDA90A94DA405B888BF1D3&scp=2&sq=Ain%27t+Misbehavin%27+&st=p|accessdate = January 17, 2012[/tpl] Its reception was such that it was decided to develop it into a full-scale production. 
The musical opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on May 9, 1978, and transferred to the Plymouth Theatre and then to the Belasco Theatre and closed on February 21, 1982 after 1604 performances and fourteen previews. Maltby was the director, with musical staging and choreography by Arthur Faria. The original cast featured Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlayne Woodard. Luther Henderson adapted Waller's music for the revue and served as the production's original pianist. Replacements later in the run included Debbie Allen, Yvette Freeman, Adriane Lenox, and Alan Weeks. An original cast recording was released by RCA Victor. 
The West End production opened on March 22, 1979 at Her Majesty's Theatre. DeShields and Woodard were joined by Evan Bell, Annie Joe Edwards, and Jozella Reed. It was revived in London in 1995 at the Tricycle Theatre and then the Lyric Theatre, with Debby Bishop, Dawn Hope, Melanie Marshall, Sean Palmer, and Ray Shell.[tpl]cite web | last = | first =| title = Ain't Misbehavin'(London Revival, 1995)| work = broadwayworld.com| publisher = | date =| url = http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Ain't_Misbehavin'_3088/| format =| doi =| accessdate = January 16, 2012[/tpl]  A London revival cast recording was released by First Night.[tpl]cite web| last = Ankeny| first = Jason | title = Ain't Misbehavin': The Fats Waller Musical Show (1995 London Cast Recording)| work = allmusic.com | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/aint-misbehavin-the-fats-waller-musical-show-1995-london-cast-recording-w110341| accessdate = January 16, 2012[/tpl]
On June 12, 1982, NBC broadcast the revue with the original Broadway cast.  
A Broadway revival with the same director, choreographer, and cast as the original 1978 production opened on August 15, 1988 at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 176 performances and eight previews. Frank Rich, in his review for The New York Times, wrote "In their scrupulous re-creation of the Fats Waller show that first electrified Broadway a decade ago, the original cast and creators have conjured the same between-the-wars dream world as before... Though almost bereft of dialogue, this musical anthology expands beyond its form to become a resurrection of a great black artist's soul. Perhaps the key to the musical's approach, as conceived by the director Richard Maltby Jr., is its willingness to let Waller speak simply and eloquently for himself, through his art but without show-biz  embroidery."Rich, Frank. "Review/Theater;A Harlem Legend Lives Again On Broadway". The New York Times. August 16, 1988. Section C; p. 15
