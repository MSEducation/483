[[Labiodental consonant]]

CATEGORIES: Labiodental consonants

In phonetics, labiodentals are consonants articulated with the lower lip and the upper teeth.

==Labiodental consonant in IPA==

The labiodental consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:
The IPA symbol [tpl]IPA|ɧ[/tpl] refers to a sound occurring in Swedish, officially described as similar to the velar fricative x, but one dialectal variant is a rounded, velarized labiodental, less ambiguously rendered as [tpl]IPA|fˠʷ[/tpl]. The labiodental click is an allophonic variant of the (bi)labial click.

==Occurrence==

The only common labiodental sounds to occur phonemically are the fricatives and the approximant. The labiodental flap occurs phonemically in over a dozen languages, but it is restricted geographically to central and southeastern Africa (Olson & Hajek 2003). With most other manners of articulation, the norm are bilabial consonants (which together with labiodentals, form the class of labial consonants).
[tpl]IPA|ɱ[/tpl] is quite common, but in all or nearly all languages in which it occurs, it occurs only as an allophone of [tpl]IPA|/m/[/tpl] before labiodental consonants such as [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/f/[/tpl]. It has been reported to occur phonemically in a dialect of Teke, but similar claims in the past have proven spurious.
The XiNkuna dialect of Tsonga features a pair of affricates as phonemes. In some other languages, such as Xhosa, affricates may occur as allophones of the fricatives. These differ from the German bilabial-labiodental affricate , which commences with a bilabial p. All these affricates are rare sounds.
The stops are not confirmed to exist as separate phonemes in any language. They are sometimes written as [tpl]Unicode|ȹ ȸ[/tpl] (qp and db ligatures). They may also be found in children's speech or as speech impediments[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl].
