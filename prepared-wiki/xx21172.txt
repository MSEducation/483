Kodak is best known for photographic film products. During most of the 20th century Kodak held a dominant position in photographic film, and in 1976, had a 90% market share of photographic film sales in the United States. The company's ubiquity was such that its tagline "Kodak moment" entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that demanded to be recorded for posterity.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9025257/The-end-of-our-Kodak-moment.html|title=The end of our Kodak moment|accessdate=January 20, 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 20, 2012|location=London|first=Jasper|last=Rees[/tpl]
Kodak began to struggle financially in the late 1990s as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in transitioning to digital photography, despite having invented the core technology used in current digital cameras. 2007 was the most recent year in which the company made a profit. As part of a turnaround strategy, Kodak focused on digital photography and digital printing and attempted to generate revenues through aggressive patent litigation.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3394183.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kodak embraces digital revolution | date=January 13, 2004 | accessdate=March 29, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703757504575194331184972428.html| title=At Kodak, Patents Hold the Key to the Future| author=Dana Mattioli| date=April 19, 2010| work=The Wall Street Journal| publisher=Dow Jones & Company| accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl]

==Name==

thumb|left|175px|1900 Kodak adThe letter k was a favorite of Eastman's; he is quoted as saying, "it seems a strong, incisive sort of letter."
He and his mother devised the name Kodak with an Anagrams set. Eastman said that there were three principal concepts he used in creating the name: it should be short, easy to pronounce, and not resemble any other name or be associated with anything else.
It has also been suggested that Kodak originated from the suggestion of David Houston, a fellow photographic inventor who held the patents to several roll film camera concepts that he later sold to Eastman.[tpl]cite web|last=Nemenoff|first=Ben |title=Houston, David Henderson|url=http://www.nd.gov/arts/online_artist_archive/images-pdfs/H/Houston_DavidHenderson.htm|publisher=nd.gov|accessdate=September 5, 2010[/tpl] Houston, who started receiving patents in 1881, was said to have chosen Nodak as a nickname of his home state, North Dakota (NoDak).[tpl]cite book|last=Hammer|first=Mina Fisher |title=History of the kodak and its continuations|year=1940|publisher=The House of little books|page=46[/tpl] "... in 1880 ...

==History==

From the company's founding by George Eastman in 1888, Kodak followed the razor and blades strategy of selling inexpensive cameras and making large margins from consumables — film, chemicals and paper. As late as 1976, Kodak commanded 90% of film sales and 85% of camera sales in the U.S., according to a 2005 case study for Harvard Business School. This seemingly unassailable competitive position would foster an unimaginative and complacent corporate culture.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Rivalry with Fujifilm===

Japanese competitor Fujifilm entered the U.S. market (via Fuji Photo Film U.S.A.) with lower-priced film and supplies, but Kodak did not believe that American consumers would ever desert its brand.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/node/21542796 |title=The last Kodak moment?|publisher=The Economist|date=January 14, 2012 [/tpl] Kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics; Fuji won these sponsorship rights, which gave them a permanent foothold in the marketplace. Fuji opened a film plant in the U.S., and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from Kodak. Fuji went from a 10% share in the early 1990s to 17% in 1997. Meanwhile, Kodak made little headway in Japan, the second-largest market for photo film and paper after the United States.  Fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as Velvia and Provia, which competed successfully with Kodak's signature professional product, Kodachrome, but used the more economical and common E-6 processing machines which were standard in most processing labs, rather than the dedicated machines required by Kodachrome.  Fuji's films soon also found a competitive edge in higher-speed negative films, with a tighter grain structure.
In May 1995, Kodak filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act arguing that its poor performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji. The complaint was lodged by the United States with the World Trade Organization.[tpl]cite web|last=World Trade Organization|title=DS44 Japan — Measures Affecting Consumer Photographic Film and Paper|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds44_e.htm|publisher=WTO|accessdate=January 23, 2012[/tpl] On January 30, 1998, the WTO announced a "sweeping rejection of Kodak's complaints" about the film market in Japan. Kodak's financial results for the year ending December 1997 showed that company's revenues dropped from $15.97 billion in 1996 to $14.36 billion in 1997, a fall of more than 10%; their net earnings went from $1.29 billion to just $5 million for the same period. Kodak's market share declined from 80.1% to 74.7% in the United States, a one year drop of five percentage points that had observers suggesting that Kodak was slow to react to changes and underestimated its rivals.[tpl]cite news|last=Hiltzik |first=Michael |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20111204,0,507980.column |title=Kodak's long fade to black |publisher=latimes.com |date=December 4, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20strategy1/The%20Kodak%20-%20Fuji%20Rivalry.htm |title=The Kodak - Fuji Rivalry | Business Strategy Case Studies | Business, Management Strategies Cases | Case Study |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date= |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pace.edu/emplibrary/tfinnerty.pdf |title=fujicasestudy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl]
Although from the 1970s both Fuji and Kodak recognized the upcoming threat of digital photography, and although both sought diversification as a mitigation strategy, Fuji was more successful at diversification.[tpl]cite journal |year=2012|title= The last Kodak moment?|journal= The Economist|issue=14 January 2012|url= http://www.economist.com/node/21542796|accessdate= 12 June 2012[/tpl]

===Shift to digital===

Although Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, the first of its kind, the product was dropped for fear it would threaten Kodak's photographic film business.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/editorial/kodak-s-last-days-1.42251 |title=Kodak's Last Days |publisher=nst.com |date=February 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl][ref]
