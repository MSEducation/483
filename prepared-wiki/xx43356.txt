==Early life==

Bardem was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, Spain. His mother, Pilar Bardem (born María del Pilar Bardem Muñoz), is an actress, and his father of Cuban descent,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] José Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931–1995), was a businessman involved in environmental work. The two separated shortly after his birth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800023079/bio |title=Javier Bardem Biography – Yahoo!

Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema; he is a grandson of actors Rafael Bardem and Matilde Muñoz Sampedro, and nephew of screenwriter and director Juan Antonio Bardem.[tpl]cite news | last =Rodriguez | first =Rene | title = Javier Bardem Comes Across | work=The New York Times | date =17 December 2000 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/magazine/javier-bardem-comes-across.html | accessdate =12 October 2007 [/tpl] Both his older brother and sister, Carlos and Mónica, are actors. He also comes from a political background, as his uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by Franco for his anti-fascist films. Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother.[tpl]cite web|last=Giltz|first=Michael|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/07/22/2007-07-22_no_one_expects_javier_bardem.html|title=No one expects Javier Bardem|work=Daily News|location=New York|quote ="I was raised Catholic by my grandmother", says Bardem.|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/Pop-Culture/Celebrity-Spotlight/The-Lover-Javier-Bardem/Get-to-Know-Javier-Bardem-Get-more-Men-We-Love-at-ELLE.com|title=The Lover: Javier Bardem|publisher=Elle|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=19 September 2010|first=Holly|last=Millea[/tpl]
As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets. At age six, he made his first film appearance, in Fernando Fernán Gómez's El Pícaro (The Scoundrel).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/23/javier-bardem-as-four-year-old-on-spanish-tv-video_n_800674.html|title=Javier Bardem As Four Year Old On Spanish TV (VIDEO)|date=23 October 2010|work=The Huffington Post[/tpl] He also played rugby for the underage Spanish National Team.[tpl]cite news | last =Pierce | first =Nev | title =Interview with Javier Bardem |publisher=BBC | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/11/27/javier_bardem_the_dancer_upstairs_interview.shtml | accessdate =12 October 2007 [/tpl] Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business.

In 1989, for the Spanish comedy show El Día Por Delante (The Day Ahead), he had to wear a Superman costume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/12/23/javier-bardems-most-embarrassing-job-playing-superman-on-an/|title=Javier Bardem's Most Embarrassing Job – Playing Superman on a 1980s TV Show (VIDEO)|last=Miller|first=Oliver|date=23 December 2010|publisher=TV Squad|accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl] Bardem has confessed to having worked as a stripper (for one day only) during his struggling acting career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://anythinghollywood.com/2008/08/javier-bardem-was-a-stripper/|title=Javier Bardem was a Stripper!|date=13 August 2008|publisher=Anything Hollywood|accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl]

==Career==

Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture, The Ages of Lulu, when he was 20, in which he appeared along with his mother, Pilar Bardem. Bigas Luna, the director of Lulu, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film, Jamón, jamón in 1992, in which Bardem played a would-be underwear model and bullfighter. The film, which also starred a teenaged Penélope Cruz, was a major international success. He then starred again in Luna's next film Golden Balls (1993).
Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in the English-speaking world. In 1997, John Malkovich was the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/cs/interviews/a/javierbardem_2.htm|title=Javier Bardem on John Malkovich and "The Dancer Upstairs"|last=Murray|first=Rebecca|publisher=About.com|accessdate=27 March 2011[/tpl] His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with director Alex de la Iglesia's Perdita Durango, playing a santería-practicing bank robber. After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls in 2000, portraying Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. He received praise from his idol Al Pacino; the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received. For that role, he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of "Witwer" in Minority Report which eventually went to Colin Farrell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/trivia?tr=tr0770324|title=Trivia for Minority Report|year=2002|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl] Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in John Malkovich's directorial debut, The Dancer Upstairs. Malkovich originally had the Spanish actor in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie took so long to obtain financing it gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. "I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English," Bardem has said of Malkovich.
Bardem won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in Mar Adentro (2004), released in the United States as The Sea Inside, in which he portrayed the quadriplegic turned assisted suicide activist Ramón Sampedro. He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summons Tom Cruise's hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime drama Collateral. He stars in Miloš Forman's 2006 film Goya's Ghosts opposite Natalie Portman, where he plays a twisted monk during the Spanish Inquisition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=669|title=Javier Bardem|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|publisher=Empire (magazine)|accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl] In 2007, Bardem acted in two film adaptations: the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men, and the adaptation of the Colombian novel Love in the Time of Cholera with Giovanna Mezzogiorno by Gabriel García Márquez. In No Country for Old Men, he played a sociopathic assassin, Anton Chigurh. For that role, he became the first Spanish actor and Spaniard to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/02/25/us-oscars-bardem-idUSN2416492920080225|title=Javier Bardem becomes first Spanish actor to win Oscar|last=Serjeant|first=Jill|date=25 February 2008|agency=Reuters|accessdate=16 April 2011[/tpl] He also won a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the 2008 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best Supporting Actor. Bardem's rendition of Chigurh's trademark phrase, "Call it, friendo", was named Top HollyWORDIE of 2007 in the annual survey by the Global Language Monitor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/decides/amigo/elpepucul/20080310elpepucul_8/Tes |title="Tú decides, amigo" · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] Chigurh was named No. 26 in Entertainment Weekly magazine's 2008 "50 Most Vile Villains in Movie History" list.50 Most Vile Movie Villains Part 2, Entertainment Weekly.
