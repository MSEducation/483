The Toyota AE85, sold as the Toyota Corolla Levin, Toyota Sprinter Trueno or Toyota Corolla SR5 is a rear-wheel drive sportscoupe manufactured by Toyota from 1983-1987. The AE85 shares its chassis and basic design with the famous AE86, but while the AE86 was designed for performance, the AE85 was designed for economy and differs mainly in its engine.
The inaugural AE85 model's standard equipment included Toyota's 3A-U carburetor-equipped SOHC motor displacing 1286cc(cubic centimeter) and the cable-clutch transmission. It did not incorporate the hydraulic T-50 transmission, nor the limited-slip differential (LSD) and rear disc brakes of the higher-performing AE86 version of the car. Both AE85 and AE86 were available in coupe or hatchback form, and also with the fixed headlight front (Levin) or pop-up lights (Trueno.) Because of their identical outward appearance, the two can sometimes be mistaken. The Corolla Levin was unique to Toyota Japan retail sales channel called Toyota Corolla Store, and the Sprinter Trueno was available new only at Toyota Vista Store locations.
The A Series engines are a family of straight-4 internal combustion engines with displacement from 1.3 L to 1.8 L produced by Toyota Motor Corporation.
The car is known in Japan as the [tpl]nihongo|Hachi-Go|ハチゴー[/tpl], meaning "Eight-Five". The word "trueno" is Spanish for thunder, and "levin" is Old English for "lightning".
It is most famously featured in the manga/anime series Initial D, where Itsuki Takeuchi purchases an AE85 Levin, mistaken for an AE86.
