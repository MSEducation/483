==Life and career==

===AV Debut===

Born in Kobe either February 10, or October 21, 1969, Kimiko Matsuzaka was attending Otsuma Women's University when she was scouted by AV director Toru Muranishi. She made her debut with [tpl]nihongo|Diamond Visual|ダイヤモンド映像|Diayamondo Eizō[/tpl] in 1989.
Her stage name was taken from a combination of "Matsuzaka", from actress [tpl]nihongo|Keiko Matsuzaka|松坂慶子[/tpl], and "Kimiko" from the actress [tpl]nihongo|Kimiko Ikegami|池上季実子[/tpl]. Her bust size was advertised as 110.7 centimeters (43½ inches), but this was a publicity gimmick employing a pun on "ii onna" or "good woman" (110 pronounced "ii o", and "7" resembling the Katakana "[tpl]nihongo2|ナ[/tpl]" – "na"). According to [tpl]nihongo|Motohashi Nobuhiro|本橋信宏[/tpl], her bust size was actually in the upper 90s.
Though large breasts had been admired in Japanese erotic cinema since at least the 1950s, with the popularity of actress Maeda Michiko,[tpl]cite book|author=Anderson, Joseph L. and Donald Richie|year=1982|title=The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (Expanded Edition)|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-00792-6[/tpl], p. 266–267 the success of Matsuzaka, and other large-breasted performers of this time, such as [tpl]nihongo|Reiko Kato|かとうれいこ[/tpl] led the establishment of the Big Bust genre as part of the Japanese AV industry.

===Success===

Originally scheduled for only one video, her debut video, [tpl]nihongo|Dekkaino, Mekke!|でっか～いの、めっけ![/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1989.htm|title=1989|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=AV [tpl]nihongo2|研究所[/tpl] (AV Research Laboratory)|language=Japanese[/tpl] became a huge hit for the Diamond Visual company, selling several thousand copies shortly after its release on February 1, 1989. Capitalizing on this success, Diamond Visual named the first day of the month [tpl]nihongo|"Large Breast Day"|"巨乳の日"|Kyonyu no Hi[/tpl], and released a Kimiko Matsuzaka video on the first day of each month for nearly two years. Noriyuki Adachi singles out Matsuzaka's second AV, 1107 Millimeter Impression, as the one that set the [tpl]nihongo|"Big Bust Boom"|巨乳ブーム|"Kyonyu Boom"[/tpl] "on fire." The storyline of her fifth video, "Daughter!" (released June 1, 1989), had her playing the role of a news reporter. From this point on, she would be cast in a different profession with each appearance. In her following videos she would play a doctor, an attorney, a journalist, a professional golfer, and even a high government official, among other occupations.[tpl]nihongo|Popular Weekly|週刊大衆[/tpl] 12/11/1989 "Heisei no Madonna" – contains a review of all her videos up to #10, Director Kimiko
In late-1989 and mid-1990, she appeared with Kaoru Kuroki in director Toru Muranishi's series of instructional sex videos demonstrating sexual techniques and the use of sexual toys while Kuroki provided the lecture/commentary. By now known internationally as a "queen of pornos", in an interview with Associated Press in mid-1990, it was reported that Matsuzaka made over five times the average salary for a woman her age. Matsuzaka said that she was happy with her career and commented, "I see myself as a success story."[tpl]cite news |title=Japanese Values Changing|agency=Associated Press|work=The Intelligencer|publisher=Calkins Media|location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania|page=27|date=1990-06-19[/tpl]
Beyond her high-profile AV career, Matsuzaka had by now become a mainstream celebrity. She was one of the voice actresses for two volumes of an adult science-fiction anime video ([tpl]nihongo2|妖獣教室[/tpl]), released May 25 and July 27, 1990 by Daiei Film through its "dez" label, and was very active appearing in photo books and weekly magazines, having regular appearances in [tpl]nihongo|Popular Weekly|週刊大衆[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|Tokyo Sports Newspaper|東京スポーツ新聞[/tpl]. With actor/comedian LaSalle Ishii, she recorded the musical vocal duet [tpl]nihongo|Soresore dousuruno?|ソレソレどうするの?[/tpl], which was released on November 25, 1990. Pacific Stars and Stripes reported that Matsuzaka had made several appearances in prime-time television dramas, and was a talkshow regular.[tpl]cite news |title=One Japanese Industry That's Not Thriving; Changing Values Are Impediments to Sex Business|agency=Associated Press|work=Pacific Stars and Stripes|publisher=United States Department of Defense|location=Washington, D.C.|page=9|date=1990-06-18[/tpl] She was also a regular on television variety shows such as [tpl]nihongo|All Night Fuji|オールナイトフジ[/tpl].Dolive February, 1990, p.59

===Retirement===
