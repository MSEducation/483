Marysvale Canyon or Sevier Canyon [tpl]IPAc-en|s|ɛ|ˈ|v|ɪər[/tpl] is a canyon in Piute and Sevier counties in southwest Utah which runs eight miles (13 km) north from just north of Marysvale north to the town of Sevier. It is a steep walled canyon formed by the flow of the meandering Sevier River. The narrow canyon lies between Sargent Mountain on the northeast corner of the Tushar Mountains to the west and the margin of the small Antelope Range of Sevier County to the east. The canyon ends to the north at the intersection of the Sevier River with Clear Creek Canyon which forms the north margin of the Tushars.Richfield, Utah, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1980 To the south the canyon starts about two miles north of Marysvale where the broad Sevier Valley narrows abruptly from a broad five to eight mile wide valley to a narrow gorge.Beaver, Utah, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1980
Points of interest in the canyon are Big Rock Candy Mountain, old mining sites, and the rail tunnels along the old Marysvale Branch of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad that has been converted to a hiking/biking path.
