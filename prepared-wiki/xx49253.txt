==History==

The company was founded in 1937 as OKB-301, a Soviet aircraft design bureau (OKB). The head designer was Vladimir P. Gorbunov. On October, 1945 Semyon Lavochkin was promoted for the head designer of the design bureau. It gained distinction for its family of piston-engined fighter aircraft during World War II, and later shifted to missile and jet fighter designs. The bureau was reorganized in 1960  after its head designer's death and named after him as the NPO Lavochkin. Later, it turned to work on interplanetary probe designs for Luna sample return program, the Lunokhod program, Vega program, Phobos program etc.
In January 2012, officials of Lavochkin faced administrative punishment for not taking into account of designing the computer system after the crash of Russia's Mars moon spacecraft Fobos-Grunt.[tpl]cite news |title=Phobos-Grunt chips supposedly were counterfeit |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c32/330734.html |newspaper=ITAR-TASS |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl]
