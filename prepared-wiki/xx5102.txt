Jack Roosevelt "Jackie" Robinson (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American baseball player who became the first African-American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era.Lamb, p. 6. Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. As the first major league team to play a black man since the 1880s, the Dodgers ended racial segregation that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues for six decades. The example of Robinson's character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement.[tpl]cite journal |journal=World & I |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257–273 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/march/mtpub.asp |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: precursors of the civil rights movement |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Glasser |first=Ira [/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=MLB.com |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&content_id=2529821 |title=One meeting, two men, a changed world |first=Justice B. |last=Hill |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 [/tpl]
In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over 10 seasons, Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 World Series championship. He was selected for six consecutive All-Star Games, from 1949 to 1954,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinja02.shtml |title=Jackie Robinson statistics and history |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 4, 2009[/tpl] was the recipient of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949—the first black player so honored.Nemec & Flatow, p. 201. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. In 1997, MLB "universally" retired his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, MLB has adopted a new annual tradition, "Jackie Robinson Day", on which every player on every team wears #42.
Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first black vice president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.

==Early life==

===Family and personal life===

Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia. He was the youngest of five children born to Jerry and Mallie Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed "Mack"), and Willa Mae.Rampersad, p. 15.Bigelow, p. 225. His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt, who died 25 days before Robinson was born.Eig, p. 7.[tpl]cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/dreamteam/jackierobinson.html |title=White House dream team: Jackie Roosevelt Robinson |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=January 20, 2002 |publisher=Whitehousekids.gov [/tpl] After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California.Rampersad, pp. 15–18[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009[/tpl]Robinson, Jackie, p. 9.
The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family.Eig, p. 8. Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities.Robinson, Rachel, p. 17. As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.Rampersad, pp. 33–35.Eig, p. 10.

===John Muir High School===

In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School (Muir Tech).Rampersad, p. 36. Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics) and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |title=Jackie Robinson biography |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=The Biography Channel [/tpl]
At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the varsity level and lettered in four of them: football, basketball, track, and baseball. He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on the football team, and guard on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the broad jump. He was also a member of the tennis team.Rampersad, pp. 36–37.
In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon.Rampersad, p. 37. In late January 1937, the Pasadena Star-News newspaper reported that Robinson "for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis."Rampersad, p. 39.

===Pasadena Junior College===

After Muir, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.Rampersad, pp. 40–41. On the football team, he played quarterback and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack. As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white. While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.Falkner, p. 44.[tpl]cite news |title=Sports: Jackie Robinson |first=Bob |last=Stone |date=November 23, 1945 |work=Yank, the Army Weekly |volume=4 |issue=23 |format=PDF[/tpl] In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.Robinson, Rachel, p. 20.Rampersad, p. 54.
That year, Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (Omicron Mu Delta), awarded to students performing "outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition."Rampersad, pp. 59–60. Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.Rampersad, p. 47.
An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.Linge, p. 18. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police — gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.Rampersad, pp. 50–51. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.Falkner, p. 51.

===UCLA and afterward===

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,Falkner, p. 49. Robinson transferred to UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.Eig, p. 11.
He was one of four black players on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team; the others were Woody Strode, Kenny Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team's four backfield players.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/970425TeammatesRecall.aspx |title=Teammates Recall Jackie Robinson's Legacy |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |last=Violett |first=B.J. |year=1997 |work=UCLA Today[/tpl] At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football's most integrated team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9389095|title=Kenny Washington |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=October 12, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2007.00412.x |first=Lane |last=Demas |journal=History Compass |title=Beyond Jackie Robinson: racial integration in American college football and new directions in sport history |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=675–690 |year=2007 [/tpl]
In track and field, Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in the Long Jump, jumping [tpl]convert|24|ft|10+1/4|in|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/track_outdoor_champs_records/2006/MD1.pdf |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Outdoor Track and Field: Division I Men's |page=8 |format=PDF[/tpl] Belying his future career, baseball was Robinson's "worst sport" at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his first game he went 4-for-4 and twice stole home.[tpl]cite web |url=http://spotlight.ucla.edu/alumni/jackie-robinson/ |accessdate=April 13, 2009 |publisher=UCLA Athletics |title=Jackie Robinson UCLA Biography[/tpl]
While a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, Rachel Isum, a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career at PJC.Robinson, Jackie, pp. 10–11. In the spring semester of 1941, despite his mother's and Isum's reservations, Robinson left college just shy of graduation.Sources point to various reasons for Robinson's departure from UCLA. Family sources cite financial concerns. [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009[/tpl] In addition, Robinson himself cited his growing disillusionment about the value of a college degree for a black man of his era. Robinson, Jackie, p. 11. Other sources suggest that Robinson was uninterested in academics, and behind on class work at the time he left UCLA. Falkner, p. 45; Eig, p. 13. He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government's National Youth Administration (NYA) in Atascadero, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |title=Black History Biographies Jackie Robinson |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=Gale Cengage Learning[/tpl]Linge, p. xiii.Robinson, Jackie, p. 12.
After the government ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu in fall 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears. After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/09-03-295.pdf |first=Bob |last=Gill |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |journal=The Coffin Corner |title=Jackie Robinson: Pro Football Prelude |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=1–2 |format=PDF |year=1987  |accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl] By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.

==Military career==

In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race-neutral, practically speaking few black applicants were admitted into OCS  until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.[tpl]cite book |publisher=G.P.O. |isbn=1-153-75539-4 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-65 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |year=1981 |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Chapter 2: World War II: The Army |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-02.htm |id=n. 94[/tpl] As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months.Robinson, Jackie, p. 13.

After receiving his commission, Robinson was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st "Black Panthers" Tank Battalion. While at Fort Hood, 2LT Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev. Karl Downs, President of Sam Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson University) in nearby Austin, Texas; Downs had been Robinson's pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ericenders.com/jackieaustin.htm |title=Jackie Robinson, College Basketball Coach |last=Enders |first =Eric |work=Austin American-Statesman |date=April 15, 1997 |accessdate=April 8, 2009[/tpl]

Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody.Robinson, Jackie, p. 19. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed.Robinson, Jackie, pp. 20–21. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action,Brothers In Arms: The Epic Story of the 761St Tank Battalion, WWII's Forgotten Heroes by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton, Broadway Books, 2004, page 57. Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.
By the time of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The experiences Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks.[tpl]cite journal|work=The National Pastime|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-National_Pastime-15.pdf|location=Cleveland, OH|accessdate=15 August 2012|last=Ardolino|first=Frank|pages=68–70|title=Jackie Robinson and the 1941 Honolulu Bears|volume=15|isbn=0-9101237-62-5[/tpl] Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas, thus he never saw combat action.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.loc.gov/topics/baseball/featured/jackierobinson.html |title=Featured Baseball Personalities – Jackie Robinson – Historic Baseball Resources |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=October 6, 2008[/tpl]
After his acquittal, he was transferred to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/robinsnj.html |title=Jackie Robinson A Register of His Papers in the Library of Congress |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |last=McElderry |first=Michael |year=2002 |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081112125650/http://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/robinsnj.html|archivedate=November 12, 2008 [/tpl] While there, Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout.Robinson, Jackie, p. 23. Robinson took the former player's advice and wrote Monarchs' co-owner Thomas Baird.Rampersad, p. 113.

==Post-military==

After his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.Rampersad, p. 114. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games.Eig, p. 16.  Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/site/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleID=20080625_226_B1_pncase451210 |first = Jimmie |last=Tramel |title=Globetrotting tales |work=Tulsa World |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2009[/tpl]

==Baseball career==

===Negro leagues===

In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues.Eig, p. 17. Robinson accepted a contract for $400 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|400|1945[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars[tpl]inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) per month, a boon for him at the time.Robinson, Jackie, p. 24. Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him.Tygiel, p. 63.Bryant, p. 30. The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now communicate only by letter.Robinson, Jackie, p. 25. In all, Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases.[tpl]cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |coauthors=Sammy J. Miller |title=Black Baseball in Kansas City |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2000 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-7385-0842-9[/tpl] He also appeared in the 1945 Negro League All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.[tpl]cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |title=Black Baseball's National Showcase: The East-West All-Star Game, 1933-1953 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |page=457 |isbn=978-0-8032-8000-7[/tpl]
During the season, Robinson pursued potential major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16.Bryant, p. 31. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.Simon, pp. 46–47. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.[ref]
