Sir Stirling Craufurd Moss, OBE (born 17 September 1929) is a former Formula One racing driver from England. An inductee into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, he achieved success in several categories of competition and has been described as "the greatest driver never to win the World Championship".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-mossir.html |title=Sir Stirling Moss |publisher=grandprix.com |accessdate=21 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=English F1 Legend Moss Holds Unique Place in AARWBA Lore |publisher=indianapolismotorspeedway.com |url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/news/3664/English_F1_Legend_Moss_Holds_Unique_Place_In_AARWBA_Lore |date=14 October 2004 |accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Hamilton still on track to greatness |publisher=independent.co.uk |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/james-lawton-hamilton-still-on-track-to-greatness-397525.html |date=22 October 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |location=London[/tpl]

==Early life==

Moss was born in London, the son of Aileen (née Craufurd) and Alfred Moss, a dentist of Bray, Berkshire, where Stirling was raised at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. Alfred was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson.
Moss was educated at independent schools; Shrewsbury House School (Surbiton) Clewer Manor Junior School and the linked senior school Haileybury and Imperial Service College. All were for boys (but the latter are now co-educational except for Shrewsbury) and located at Hertford Heath, near Hertford.

==Racing career==

Moss, who raced from 1948 to 1962, won 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 Formula One Grands Prix. He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including Cooper 500, ERA, Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Vanwall single-seaters, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz sports cars, and Jaguar saloons. Like many drivers of the era, he competed in several formulae, often on the same day.
He preferred to race British cars, stating, "Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one".  At Vanwall, he was instrumental in breaking the German/Italian stranglehold on F1 racing (as was Jack Brabham at Cooper). He remained the English driver with the most Formula One victories until 1991 when Nigel Mansell overtook him after competing in more races.

===1948–1954===

One of the Cooper Car Company's first customers, Moss used winnings from competing in horse-riding events to pay the deposit on a Cooper 500 racing car in 1948. He then persuaded his father, who opposed him racing and wanted him to be a dentist, to let him buy it. He soon demonstrated his ability with numerous wins at national and international levels, and continued to compete in Formula Three, with Coopers and Kiefts, after he had progressed to more senior categories.
His first major international race victory came on the eve of his 21st birthday at the wheel of a borrowed Jaguar XK120 in the 1950 RAC Tourist Trophy on the Dundrod circuit in Northern Ireland. He went on to win the race six more times, in 1951 (Jaguar C-Type), 1955 (Mercedes-Benz 300SLR), 1958 and 1959 (Aston Martin DBR1), and 1960 and 1961 (Ferrari 250 GT).
Also a competent rally driver, he is one of three people to have won a Coupe d'Or (Gold Cup) for three consecutive penalty-free runs on the Alpine Rally (Coupe des Alpes). He finished second in the 1952 Monte Carlo Rally driving a Sunbeam-Talbot 90 with Desmond Scannell and Autocar magazine editor John Cooper as co-drivers.
In 1954, he became the first non-American to win the 12 Hours of Sebring, sharing the Cunningham team's 1.5-liter O.S.C.A. MT4 with American Bill Lloyd.
In 1953 Mercedes-Benz racing boss Alfred Neubauer had spoken to Moss's manager Ken Gregory about the possibility of Moss joining the Mercedes Grand Prix team. Having seen him do well in a relatively uncompetitive car, and wanting to see how he would perform in a better one, Neubauer suggested Moss buy a Maserati for the 1954 season. He bought a Maserati 250F, and although the car's unreliability prevented him from scoring high points in the 1954 Drivers' Championship he qualified alongside the Mercedes frontrunners several times and performed well in the races. 
In the Italian Grand Prix at Monza he passed both drivers who were regarded as the best in Formula One at the time—Juan Manuel Fangio in a Mercedes and Alberto Ascari in a Ferrari—and took the lead. Ascari retired with engine problems, and Moss led until lap 68 when his engine also failed. Fangio took the victory, and Moss pushed his Maserati to the finish. Neubauer, already impressed when Moss had tested a Mercedes-Benz W196 at Hockenheim, promptly signed him for 1955.

===1955===

Moss's first Formula One victory was in the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree, a race he was also the first British driver to win. Leading a 1–2–3–4 finish for Mercedes, it was the first time he beat Fangio, his teammate and arch rival, who was also his friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio sportingly allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio repeatedly, and Fangio always replied: "No. You were just better than me that day."Tremayne, David and Mark Hughes. The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula One. London: Dempsey Parr, 1998, p.169. ISBN 1-84084-037-4. The same year, Moss also won the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Targa Florio (sharing the drive with Peter Collins), and the Mille Miglia.

====Mille Miglia====

In 1955 Moss won Italy's thousand-mile Mille Miglia road race, an achievement Doug Nye described as the "most iconic single day's drive in motor racing history."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735551/The-greatest-race.html|title=The Greatest Race|last=Nye|first=Doug|date=28 May 2005|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl] Motor Trend headlined it as "The Most Epic Drive. Ever."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/1210_1955_mille_miglia_the_most_epic_drive_ever/#ixzz2vIJQp8cR|title=1955 Mille Miglia: The Most Epic Drive. Ever. 1000 Miles on Italian Roads in 10 hours, 7 minutes|last=MacKenzie|first=Angus|date=12 October 2012|work=Motor Trend|publisher=Source Interlink Media|accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]
Moss, then 25 years old, drove one of four factory-entered Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR sports-racing cars. Based on the W196 Grand Prix car, they had spaceframe chassis and magnesium-alloy bodies, and their modified W196 engines ran on a mixture of petrol, benzene, and alcohol.  The team's main race rivals were the factory-entered Ferraris of Piero Taruffi, Eugenio Castellotti, Umberto Maglioli, and Paolo Marzotto.
Journalist Denis Jenkinson passengered as Moss's navigator. He had intended to go with John Fitch, whose idea it had been to take a navigator, but when Mercedes assigned a 300 SL to Fitch, the American agreed to Jenkinson riding with Moss in the faster SLR. Jenkinson had come up with the idea of pace notes in the form of a roller map of the route on which he had noted its hazards—an innovation that helped Moss compete against drivers with greater local knowledge. Jenkinson used hand signals to tell him about the road ahead. Radio communication had proved ineffective when they tried it, because when Moss was fully concentrated on his driving he was oblivious to Jenkinson's voice.  
Fangio, who regarded the race as too dangerous for passengers, drove his SLR  alone, as did Karl Kling. Hans Herrmann drove the fourth car with mechanic Herman Eger as passenger.
The race was a timed event, and competitors started singly at one-minute intervals. Moss's Mercedes left the starting ramp in Brescia at 7:22 a.m. (hence the car's race number 722).  Castellotti's Ferrari left one minute later, and Taruffi's at 7:27. 
After about 90 miles, as Moss approached Padua at [tpl]convert|175|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] he saw in his mirror that Castellotti was closing fast. When Moss misjudged a corner and collided with some straw bales Castellotti went past and built an increasing lead. After 188 miles of racing the Italian had to stop in Ravenna to replace the Ferrari's tyres, and fell behind again. Marzotto's Ferrari started well but the tread separated from a tyre at over [tpl]convert|170|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and he had to withdraw from the race because the spare turned out to be the wrong size.
Nearing the Adriatic coast, Jenkinson's spectacles were blown off by the slipstream when he vomited over the side of the Mercedes; he carried a replacement pair. Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.
When Moss and Jenkinson finally arrived at the finish in Brescia they learned that Castellotti's Ferrari had retired with transmission trouble and they had won. Fangio took second place, nearly 33 minutes slower, his Mercedes delayed by engine trouble and running on only seven cylinders by the end. Maglioli, in the sole surviving factory-entered Ferrari, took 45 minutes longer than Moss and finished 3rd.
Moss's time of  10 hours, 7 minutes and 48 seconds, and his average speed of [tpl]convert|98.53|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for the 1000 miles, set course records that still stand. The race was discontinued two years later.
Before the race, he had taken a "magic pill" given him by Fangio, and he has commented that although he did not know what was in it, "Dexedrine and Benzedrine were commonly used in rallies. The object was simply to keep awake, like wartime bomber crews." After the win, he spent the night and the following day driving his girlfriend to Cologne, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.

===1956–1962===

Moss won the Nassau Cup at the 1956 and 1957 Bahamas Speed Week.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wright|first=Alfred|title=A Long, Loud Huzzah For Nassau|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=12 December 1960|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134782/index.htm|accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl] Also in 1957 he won on the longest circuit ever to hold a World Championship Grand Prix, the [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] Pescara Circuit, where he again demonstrated his mastery of long-distance racing. The event lasted three hours and Moss beat Fangio, who started from pole position, by a little over 3 minutes. 
Moss's sporting attitude cost him the 1958 Formula 1 World Championship. When rival Mike Hawthorn was threatened with a penalty after the Portuguese Grand Prix, Moss defended him. Hawthorn was accused of reversing on the track after spinning and stalling his car on an uphill section. Moss had shouted advice to Hawthorn to steer downhill, against traffic, to bump-start the car. Moss's quick thinking, and his defence of Hawthorn before the stewards, preserved Hawthorn's 6 points for finishing second behind Moss. Hawthorn went on to beat Moss for the championship title by one point, even though he had won only one race that year to Moss's four.
Moss was as gifted in sports cars as in Grand Prix cars. To his victories in the Tourist Trophy, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Mille Miglia he added three consecutive wins (1958–1960) in the gruelling [tpl]convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] race at Germany's Nürburgring, the first two in an Aston Martin (in which he did most of the driving) and the third in a Tipo'' 61 "birdcage" Maserati, co-driving with the American Dan Gurney. The pair lost nearly six minutes when an oil hose blew off, but despite miserable conditions they made up the time and took 1st place.
In the 1960 Formula One season, Moss won the Monaco in Rob Walker's Coventry-Climax-powered Lotus 18.Kettlewell, Mike. "Monaco: Road Racing on the Riviera", in Northey, Tom, editor. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 12, p.1384. Seriously injured in an accident at the Burnenville curve during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, he missed the next three races but recovered sufficiently to win the final one of the season, the United States Grand Prix at Riverside, California.
For the 1961 Formula One season, run under new 1.5-litre rules, Enzo Ferrari fielded the "sharknose" Ferrari 156 with an all-new V6 engine.Kettlewell, p.1384. Moss's  Climax-engined Lotus was comparatively underpowered, but he won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix by 3.6 seconds, beating the Ferraris of Richie Ginther, Wolfgang von Trips, and Phil Hill, and went on to win the partially wet 1961 German Grand Prix. In addition to his skill, two other factors helped compensate for the Lotus's power deficit in these races. The tight circuit at Monaco favored the nimble Lotus, countering the horsepower advantage of the heavier, ill-handling Ferraris; and at the Nürburgring, Moss and manager Ken Gregory took the risky decision to fit rain tyres after a pre-race shower soaked the track. Had the skies cleared and the track dried, the decision would have worked against Moss. The rain returned in the race, and although Moss's tyres rapidly deteriorated he was able to drive away from Hill and Trips to take the win.
In 1962, he crashed his Lotus heavily during the Glover Trophy at Goodwood. The accident put him in a coma for a month, and for six months the left side of his body was partially paralysed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorsportshalloffame.com/halloffame/1990/Stirling_Moss_main.htm|title=International Motorsports Hall of Fame[/tpl]Sterling Moss Goodwood crash He recovered, but retired from professional racing after a private test session in a Lotus 19 the following year, when he lapped a few tenths of a second slower than before. He felt he had not regained his previously instinctive command of the car. He had been runner-up in the Drivers' Championship four years in succession, from 1955 to 1958, and third in each of the next three years.

==Record-breaking==

In the 1950s Moss participated in several successful speed record attempts.

===1950===

At the Autodrome de Montlhéry, a steeply banked oval track near Paris, Moss and Leslie Johnson took turns at the wheel of the latter's Jaguar XK120 to average [tpl]convert|107.46|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on[/tpl] for 24 hours, including stops for fuel and tyres. Changing drivers every three hours, they covered a total of 2579.16 miles. It was the first time a production car had averaged over [tpl]convert|100|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on[/tpl] for 24 hours.

===1952===

Revisiting Montlhéry, Moss was one of a four-driver team, led by Johnson, who drove a factory-owned Jaguar XK120 fixed-head coupé for 7 days and nights at the French track.[tpl]cite journal |last=Nevinson |first=Tim |date=June 2008 |title=Flat out for a week |journal=Thoroughbred and Classic Cars |publisher=Bauer Consumer Media Ltd |accessdate=March 13, 2014[/tpl] Moss, Johnson, Bert Hadley and Jack Fairman averaged [tpl]convert|100.31|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on[/tpl] to take four World records and five International Class C records, and covered a total of [tpl]convert|16851.73|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl].

===1957===

In August  Moss broke five International Class F records in the purpose-built MG EX181 at Bonneville Salt Flats. The streamlined, supercharged car's speed for the flying kilometer was 245.64 mph, which was the average of two runs in opposite directions.[tpl]cite book |last=McComb |first=Wilson |date=1998 |title=MG by McComb  |publisher=Motorbooks International |page=180 |isbn=1855328313 |accessdate=March 13, 2014[/tpl]

==Broadcasting career==

Away from driving, in 1962 he acted as a colour commentator for ABC's Wide World of Sports for Formula One and NASCAR races. He eventually left ABC in 1980.
Moss is narrator in official 1988 Formula One season review along with Tony Jardine.
Moss is the narrator in the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay.

==Return to racing==

In 1980 he made a brief comeback in the British Touring Car Championship with Audi, alongside Martin Brundle. Previously he also competed in the 1974 World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara.Green, Evan. A Boot Full of Right Arms, Cassell Australia, 1975. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure (Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over ⅔ of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road),http://www.stirlingmoss.com/photos/1976-bathurst-1000-stirling-and-jack-brabham and he also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.http://www.motorsporttalk.co.nz/index.php/local/346-denny-hulme-new-zealand-festival-of-motor-racinghttp://www.speedhunters.com/2012/04/leadfoot-festival-taking-on-millens-mile/
More recently he raced in events for historic cars, and campaigned his own OSCA FS 372 during the 2009 season. 
On 9 June 2011 during qualifying for the Le Mans Legends race, Moss announced on Radio Le Mans that he had finally retired from racing, saying that he had scared himself that afternoon. He was 81.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/09/us-motor-racing-moss-idUSTRE7586IC20110609 | work=Reuters | title=Stirling Moss announces retirement at age of 81 | date=9 June 2011[/tpl]

==After his racing career==

In June 2005 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed Moss signed the bonnet of his 1955 Mille Miglia-winning Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. It was the car's final public appearance before retiring to the newly built Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart.
Although occasionally an outspoken critic of Michael Schumacher, in October 2006 Moss ranked him joint fourth with Tazio Nuvolari in the pantheon of all-time greats, behind Juan Manuel Fangio, Ayrton Senna, and Jim Clark.The Stirling Moss Website – News
Moss's 80th birthday, on 17 September 2009, fell on the eve of the Goodwood Revival and Lord March celebrated with an 80-car parade on each of the three days. Moss drove a different car each day: a Mercedes W196 Monoposto, the Lotus 18 in which he had won the 1961 Monaco GP, and an Aston Martin DBR3.
On 7 March 2010 he broke both ankles and four bones in a foot, and also chipped four vertebrae and suffered skin lesions, when he fell down a lift shaft at his home.[tpl]cite news|title=Stirling Moss falls down lift shaft|publisher=TF1 Group; Thomson Reuters|work=Eurosport|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08032010/58/stirling-moss-falls-lift-shaft.html/|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|title=Moss injured in lift accident|publisher=Haymarket Publications|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81925|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010[/tpl] Recovered from his injuries, he appeared in a pre-race BBC interview at the 2010 British Grand Prix meeting at Silverstone and presented Lewis Hamilton with his second-place trophy on the podium. 

===Honours===

He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.
In 1990, Moss was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.
In the New Year Honours 2000 List, Moss was made a Knight Bachelor for services to Motor Racing. On 21 March 2000, he was knighted by Prince Charles, standing in for the Queen who was on an official visit to Australia. As Moss drove his Mercedes away from Buckingham Palace after the ceremony, he was stopped by a palace guard who joked: "Who do you think you are? Stirling Moss?" Moss smiled and replied "Sir Stirling Moss, actually."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/stirling-moss-receives-knighthood-722857.html|title=Stirling Moss receives knighthood|accessdate=9 March 2010|publisher=The Independent|author=AP | location=London | date=21 March 2000[/tpl]
He received the 2005 Segrave Trophy.
In 2006, Moss was awarded the FIA gold medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution to motorsport.Legend Moss receives FIA honour
In December 2008, McLaren-Mercedes unveiled their final model of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. The model was named in honour of Stirling Moss, hence, Mercedes McLaren SLR Stirling Moss, which has a top speed of [tpl]convert|217|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] with wind deflectors instead of a windscreen.

===Moss's biography===

In 1963, noted motorsports author and commentator Ken Purdy published a biographical book entitled All But My Life about Stirling Moss (first published by William Kimber & Co., Ltd., London), based on material gathered through interviews with Moss.

===Popular culture===

For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase "Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/9251916/Sir-Stirling-Moss-interview.html |title=Sir Stirling Moss interview |last=English |first=Andrew |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] As related in the book The Life and Times of Private Eye, Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine Private Eye. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally "hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as "depressingly common" for its satirical cartoons about famous people.
In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show "What's My Line?" (episode with Anita Ekberg).
Moss was one of the celebrities who made cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) chauffeur.
He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content.
Moss is also a supporter of the UK Independence Party.UKIP sprouts as celebrities make a stand on Brussels 

==Quotes==

"I certainly had an appreciation of the danger which to me was part of the pleasure of racing. To me now racing is – the dangers are taken away: if it's difficult, they put in a chicane. So really now the danger is minimal – which is good, because people aren't hurt. But for me the fact that I had danger on my shoulder made it much more exciting. It's rather like if you flirt with a girl, it's more exciting than paying for a prostitute, because while you know you're gonna get it, the other one you don't. And I think with driving a motor car, the danger is a very necessary ingredient. Like if you're cooking, you need salt. You can cook without salt, but it doesn't have the flavour. It's the same with motor racing without danger. For me."Monaco – Race of Kings, (IMC Vision, 2008)
On older drivers: "You don't know how many years they've driven causing accidents! I'm not quite as urgent as I was... I know that my knowledge of road signs, there's some that I might not know which I should know... The other thing I find as I get older I'm less inclined to check the oil and check the tyres and so on, which is very important."BBC – Stirling Moss on elderly drivers

==Driving ban==

In April 1960, Moss was found guilty of dangerous driving. He was fined £50 and banned from driving for twelve months after an incident near Chetwynd, Shropshire when he was test-driving a Mini.[tpl]cite news|title=Twelve months' ban and £50 fine on Stirling Moss|date=14 April 1960|work=The Times|page=6|accessdate=15 August 2011|location=London[/tpl]

==Controversy==

Gay rights campaigners criticized remarks Moss made in a 2013 interview at the Motor Racing Hall of Fame, saying they were "offensive" and "homophobic". Moss had said he would not want a "poofter or anything like that" to play him on screen, and added that he thought "it would be difficult for someone of the other persuasion, who is homosexual, to take on the part, as I have spent my life driving cars and chasing girls." Responding to the criticism, he said: "I’m sorry I’ve caused offence, but I’m disappointed anyone could be so narrow-minded as to take offence. It was not meant to cause any.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9929738/Stirling-Moss-doesnt-want-a-poofter-to-play-him-on-film.html|title=Stirling Moss doesn't want a 'poofter' to play him on film|last=Bowie-Sell|first=Daisy|date=14 March 2013|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/motorhead-uk/sir-stirling-moss-draws-criticism-homophobic-143550458.html|title=Sir Stirling Moss draws criticism for homophobic comment|first=motorsport|date=15 March 2013|work=Yahoo!
