Although the integers are intuitively defined by adding zero and negative integers to the natural numbers, such a construction is not very practicable, because of the number of case distinctions which would be needed in the definition of arithmetical operations. [tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl] Therefore, a more abstract construction, which allows one to define the arithmetical operations without any case distinction, is usually preferred by mathematicians. [tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The integers can thus be formally constructed as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers (a,b).[tpl]cite book |author=Campbell, Howard E. |title=The structure of arithmetic |publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts |year=1970 |isbn=0-390-16895-5 |page=83[/tpl]
The intuition is that (a,b) stands for the result of subtracting b from a. To confirm our expectation that [tpl]nowrap|1 − 2[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|4 − 5[/tpl] denote the same number, we define an equivalence relation ~ on these pairs with the following rule:
precisely when
Addition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers; denoting by (a,b) the equivalence class having (a,b) as a member, one has:
The negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:
Hence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:
The standard ordering on the integers is given by:
It is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.
Every equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form (n,0) or (0,n) (or both at once). The natural number n is identified with the class (n,0) (in other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending n to (n,0)), and the class (0,n) is denoted −n (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class (0,0) a second time since [tpl]nowrap|−0 [tpl]=[/tpl] 0.[/tpl]
Thus, (a,b) is denoted by
If the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.
This notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as  {... −3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
Some examples are:

==Integers in computing==

An integer is often a primitive data type in computer languages. However, integer data types can only represent a subset of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common two's complement representation, the inherent definition of sign distinguishes between "negative" and "non-negative" rather than "negative, positive, and 0". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted int or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).
Variable-length representations of integers, such as bignums, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or 10).

==Cardinality==

If N = {0, 1, 2, ...} then consider the function:
{... (-4,8) (-3,6) (-2,4) (-1,2) (0,0) (1,1) (2,3) (3,5) ...}
If N = {1, 2, 3, ...} then consider the function:
{... (-4,8) (-3,6) (-2,4) (-1,2) (0,1) (1,3) (2,5) (3,7) ...}
If the domain is restricted to Z then each and every member of Z has one and only one corresponding member of N and by the definition of cardinal equality the two sets have equal cardinality.
