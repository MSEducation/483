David Jon Gilmour, [tpl]post-nominals|CBE[/tpl] (born 6 March 1946),  is an English musician, singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known for his work as the guitarist and co-lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It is estimated that as of 2012, the group have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States.For 250 million records sold see: [tpl]cite web|title= Pink Floyd Reunion Tops Fans' Wish List in Music Choice Survey |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aOmothQgn6l4&refer=muse|publisher=Bloomberg Television|date=26 September 2007|accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl]; For 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold see: [tpl]cite web| title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=RIAA|url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl]
In addition to his work with Pink Floyd, Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, and has enjoyed a successful career as a solo artist. He has also been actively involved with many charities. In 2005, Gilmour was appointed CBE for his services to music.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=378[/tpl] He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/outstanding_contribution_title.html |title=Q Awards 2008 Outstanding Contribution |publisher=.qawards.co.uk |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl] In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 14 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time.

==Early life==

David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946, in Cambridge, England.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=115[/tpl] His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who later worked for the BBC. At the time of Gilmour's birth they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, but in 1956 after several relocations the couple moved their family to Grantchester Meadows.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|p=14[/tpl]: the house in Trumpington; [tpl]harvnb|Manning|2006|pp=10–11[/tpl].[tpl]refn|group=n|Gilmour has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catherine.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=14[/tpl][/tpl]
Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock".[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|pp=10–11[/tpl] His enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel", and later "Bye Bye Love" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in guitar. He then borrowed one from his neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, he started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp=18–19[/tpl] At age 11, Gilmour began attending the Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he "didn't enjoy".[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=11[/tpl] While there he met future Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett, and bassist Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, which was also situated on Hills Road.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp=15–17[/tpl]
In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at Cambridge Technical College.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=11[/tpl] Despite not finishing the course, he would eventually learn to speak fluent French.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=11[/tpl] Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=11[/tpl] In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues-rock band Jokers Wild. They recorded a one-sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in London, but only fifty copies of each were made.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=11[/tpl] In August 1965, Gilmour busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the Beatles. They were not successful, getting arrested on one occasion and living a virtually hand-to-mouth existence, which resulted in his requiring treatment for malnutrition.[tpl]harvnb|Manning|2006|p=18[/tpl]: arrested for busking; [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp |title=PINK FLOYD – David Gilmour Photos, Biography, Apparel |publisher=Megapinkfloyd.com |accessdate=9 August 2010[/tpl]: malnutrition. Gilmour and Barrett later trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=18[/tpl]
Gilmour travelled to France in mid 1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the band name Flowers, then Bullitt; they were not successful. After hearing their uninspired covers of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=44[/tpl] In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new gear. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record "See Emily Play", and was shocked to find that Barrett did not seem to recognise him.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=38[/tpl] When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry.[tpl]sfn|Manning|2006|p=44[/tpl]

==Pink Floyd==

In late December 1967, drummer Nick Mason approached Gilmour and asked him if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd. He accepted and soon afterward became their fifth member; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter.[tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=109–111[/tpl]: (primary source); [tpl]harvnb|Povey|2008|p=47[/tpl]: (secondary source). One of the group's business partners, Peter Jenner, commented: "The idea was that Dave would ... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved".[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=107[/tpl] By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult, so Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and Andrew King to discuss the situation.[tpl]harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=90–113[/tpl]: (secondary source); [tpl]harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=78–105[/tpl]: (primary source). During the meeting, Barrett agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 112[/tpl] Waters later admitted: "He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him".[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|pp=90–113, 112[/tpl] Jenner and King, who believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=78–80[/tpl]
After Barrett's departure, Gilmour sang much of Pink Floyd's lead vocals; Waters and keyboard player Richard Wright also occasionally sang lead. After the successes of The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of Animals and The Wall. Wright was fired during the sessions for The Wall, and the relationship between Gilmour and Waters would further deteriorate during the making of the eponymous film, and later during recording sessions for  The Final Cut. The last band performance of The Wall took place on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court, London; it was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's reunion on 2 July 2005, at the Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.[tpl]sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p=185[/tpl]
By the late 1970s, Gilmour began to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd, so in 1978 he channeled his ideas into the eponymous solo album, David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting skills. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, were incorporated into song by Waters, which became "Comfortably Numb", which was included on The Wall.[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=221–222[/tpl] The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cut[tpl]'[/tpl]s virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face, in 1984.[tpl]Cite book| edition = Updated| publisher=Omnibus| isbn = 0-7119-4109-2| last = Miles| first = Barry| coauthors = Andy Mabbett| title = Pink Floyd the visual documentary| location = London| year = 1994[/tpl]  He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters.  He has since admitted that he also used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd.  He toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were promptly dropped from the line-up after revealing Syd Barrett's address on stage.[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=123[/tpl] Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=304[/tpl] When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced The Dream Academy, who had a top ten hit with "Life in a Northern Town".[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=312[/tpl]
In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were "a spent force creatively".[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241, 246[/tpl] Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him.[tpl]sfn|Povey|2008|p=240[/tpl] Gilmour assumed full control of the group and produced A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987 with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright. Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994's The Division Bell. Gilmour explained: "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. That's what I'm trying to do with A Momentary Lapse of Reason; more focus on the music, restore the balance." In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria, which is moored on the River Thames near Hampton Court, and transformed it into a recording studio.[tpl]sfn|Blake|2008|p=318[/tpl] The majority of the two most recent Pink Floyd albums, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo release On an Island, were recorded there.
On 2 July 2005, Gilmour played with Pink Floyd—including Roger Waters—at Live 8. The performance caused a temporary sales increase of Pink Floyd's album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd.[tpl]cite web|title=Pink Floyd gives back|url=http://www.soulshine.ca/news/newsarticle.php?nid=2241|accessdate=2 December 2007[/tpl] Gilmour donated all of his resulting profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8 saying: "Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives." Shortly after, he called upon all artists experiencing a surge in sales from Live 8 performances to donate the extra revenue to Live 8 fund-raising. After the Live 8 concert, Pink Floyd were offered £150 million to tour the United States, but the band turned down the offer.[tpl]cite web|title=Pink Floyd offered millions to tour|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/pink/pink-floyd-offered-millions-to-tour.html|accessdate=2 December 2007[/tpl]
On 3 February 2006, he announced in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that Pink Floyd would most likely never tour or write material together again. He said: "I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don't have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it's over. For me it's much less complicated to work alone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/b/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/gilmo/gilmo/gilmo.html |title=Il requiem di David Gilmour "I Pink Floyd? Sono finiti" |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl]
Regarding agreeing to play at Live 8, he said: "There was more than one reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable relationship between Roger and me that I was carrying along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, "Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out."
In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Syd Barrett, who had died on 7 July of that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyd's first single "Arnold Layne".[tpl]sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=140–141[/tpl] Recorded live at London's Royal Albert Hall, the single featured versions of the song performed by Richard Wright and special guest artist David Bowie.[tpl]sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=140–141[/tpl] The single peaked on the UK Top 75 singles chart at number nineteen.[tpl]cite web|title=Arnold Layne chart position|url=http://acharts.us/song/11777|accessdate=4 December 2007[/tpl]
Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible.[tpl]cite web|last=Booth|first=Robert|title=Pink Floyd's Richard Wright dies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/16/pinkfloyd.popandrock |date= 16 September 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2013|work=The Guardian[/tpl] After his death, his surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. Gilmour said of Wright: "In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound. Like Rick, I don't find it easy to express my feelings in words, but I loved him and will miss him enormously. I have never played with anyone quite like him."[tpl]cite web|author=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gpUJq1E80m4yGRFSq9WNaVNC6jnQ |title=afp.google.com, Pink Floyd's Gilmour mourns bandmate Wright |publisher=Google  |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl]

==Musical style==

Gilmour is primarily regarded as a lead guitarist. His own solo style is often characterized by blues-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends and sustain.[tpl]clarify|date= April 2013[/tpl] In 2011, Gilmour was rated the 14th greatest guitarist by Rolling Stone magazine. In January 2007, Guitar World readers voted Gilmour's solos, "Comfortably Numb", "Time" and "Money" into the top 100 Greatest Guitar Solos ("Comfortably Numb" was voted the 4th, "Time" was voted the 21st and "Money" was voted the 62nd greatest solo of all time).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/100_greatest_guitar_solos_51100?page=0%2C1 |title=100 Greatest Guitar Solos: 51–100 |publisher=Guitar World |accessdate=9 August 2010[/tpl]
Early in his career with Pink Floyd, Gilmour played a multitude of Fender Stratocasters. He recorded one of his guitar solos, for "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2", in one take using no editing or mixing using a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top guitar equipped with P-90 pick-ups.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|pp=75–76[/tpl] In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour's solo on "Comfortably Numb" was voted as one of the  greatest guitar solos of all time in several polls by listeners and critics.David Gilmour's Guitar Solo is Number 1 (Musicjot)/
Although mainly known for his guitar work, Gilmour is also a proficient multi-instrumentalist. He also played bass guitar on many Pink Floyd tracks, keyboards, synthesiser, banjo, lap steel, mandolin, harmonica, and drums on the Syd Barrett solo track "Dominoes". He also plays the saxophone.
Many critics have been very favourable towards Gilmour and his style, music critic Alan di Perna has praised Gilmour's guitar work as being an integral element of Pink Floyd's sound.http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122 Rolling Stone ranked him number 14 in their "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" list and di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 70's, Perna also referred to Gilmour as "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen." In a 2006 interview with Gilmour, he commented on his playing technique: "My fingers make a distinctive sound ... they aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows".
In 2006, writer for Guitar World, Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's playing style as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."
According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on "Money", "Time" and "Comfortably Numb" "cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog." Brown described the "Time" solo as "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... get singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade."

==Solo projects==

Gilmour has recorded four solo albums, all four of which charted in the US Top 40: 2006's On an Island peaked at number 6 in 2006, 2008's Live in Gdansk peaked at number 26, his 1978 self-titled solo debut peaked at number 29 in 1978 and 1984's About Face peaked number 32 in 1984.
Taking time off from Pink Floyd's schedule, Gilmour also took up various roles as a producer, sideman and even concert sound engineer for a wide variety of acts which included former bandmate Syd Barrett, Paul McCartney, Kate Bush, Berlin, John Martyn, Grace Jones, Tom Jones, Elton John, Eric Clapton, B. B. King, Seal, Sam Brown, Jools Holland, Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend, the Who, Supertramp, Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Alan Parsons, Peter Cetera, and various charity groups among others.
In 1985, Gilmour was a member of Bryan Ferry's band. He played on Ferry's album Boys and Girls, as well as the song "Is Your Love Strong Enough" for the US release of the Ridley Scott-Tom Cruise film Legend. A music video for the latter was created, incorporating Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film (released as a bonus on the 2002 "Ultimate Edition" DVD release). Later that year, Gilmour played with Ferry at the London Live Aid concert; his first collaboration with Ferry's keyboard player Jon Carin, later to tour with Pink Floyd.
Gilmour also took part in a comedy skit titled The Easy Guitar Book Sketch with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians Mark Knopfler, Lemmy from Motorhead, Mark King from Level 42, and Gary Moore. Guitar tech Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmour's guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skit."David Gilmour – DVD Draw" – The Phil Taylor Interview In 1994, Gilmour played guitar for the video game Tuneland, along with the addition of Scott Page, a  saxophonist who had frequently worked with Pink Floyd. On 14 December 1999, Gilmour played a show at The Cavern Club in Liverpool with Paul McCartney, Mick Green, Ian Paice & Pete Wingfield.

==Equipment==

Some of the equipment Gilmour has used on his solo or Pink Floyd records and tours include many versions of the Fender Stratocaster, several Les Paul, and other guitar models. His primary stage and studio guitar is a 1969 Fender Stratocaster. Black with a black pickguard, it has white pick-up covers and knobs. It does not have the original neck. The guitar has an added switch that combines the neck and bridge pick-ups. It has a Seymour Duncan SSL-1C (SSL-5 Prototype) bridge pick-up. The guitar strap that Gilmour pairs with this instrument once belonged to Jimi Hendrix.
His main guitar for the post-Roger Waters era Pink Floyd tours was a Candy Apple Red 1984 1957 Stratocaster reissue. It has a set of EMG SA active pick-ups. This guitar still continues to be used for specific songs during Gilmour's live performances.
Gilmour owns a Stratocaster # 0001. This is not the first model made.
Others include:

===Steel guitar===

Throughout his recording career Gilmour has added a different element to his guitar style with his use of steel guitars. A pair of Jedson pedal steel guitars were used frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in Seattle in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of "One of These Days" from "Meddle" and "Breathe" and "Great Gig in the Sky" from The Dark Side of the Moon.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=424[/tpl] Gilmour also owns a Fender Deluxe lap steel, which he used during The Division Bell tour in 1994.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|2005|p=434[/tpl] Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model.

He also uses a  ZB steel model.[tpl]sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=268[/tpl]

===Bass guitars===

Gilmour has played bass both in the studio and onstage, and has played many different bass models including: an Ovation Magnum, a Fender Bass VI, Fender Precision and Jazz bass models and a Charvel fretless (all used during The Wall recording sessions). He also owns a Doug Wilkes built Precision-style single pick-up bass which was used on the 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' sessions. During the 1991 Amnesty International concert Gilmour used a Music Man Fretless Stingray bass while conducting the house band and again during Spinal Tap's performance of "Big Bottom".

===Fender Signature Stratocaster===

In November 2006, Fender Custom Shop announced two reproductions of Gilmour's "Black" Strat for release on 22 September 2008.

Gilmour is an experienced pilot and aviation enthusiast. Under the aegis of his company, Intrepid Aviation, he had amassed a collection of historical aircraft. He later decided to sell the company, which he had started as a hobby, feeling that it was becoming too commercial for him to handle. In a BBC interview, he stated:
[tpl]quote|Intrepid Aviation was a way for me to make my hobby pay for itself a little bit, but gradually over a few years Intrepid Aviation became a business because you have to be businesslike about it. Suddenly I found instead of it being a hobby and me enjoying myself, it was a business and so I sold it. I don't have Intrepid Aviation any more. I just have a nice old biplane that I pop up, wander around the skies in sometimes...[tpl]cite web|title=Intrepid Aviation|url=http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/miscellaneous-articles/david-gilmour-and-intrepid-aviation.html|accessdate=5 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071021205312/http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/miscellaneous-articles/david-gilmour-and-intrepid-aviation.html  |archivedate = 21 October 2007[/tpl][/tpl]
Gilmour has stated in interviews that he doesn't believe in an afterlife and that he is an atheist.Newsday, published 30 March 2006: "I'm an atheist, and I don't have any belief in an afterlife...""The theme of the new album – those Pink Floyd habits die hard – is mortality. One song, 'This Heaven', reflects Gilmour's atheism".The Sunday Telegraph (London), 28 May 2006, Section Seven, Pg. 8. On 22 May 2008, he won the 2008 Ivor Novello Lifetime Contribution Award.2008 Ivor Novello Award Winners In autumn 2008, he was awarded for outstanding contribution for music by the Q Awards.

When it comes to Gilmour's political views he has stated that he is left wing, and that his beliefs spring from that of his parents; David stated that his parents were "Proper Manchester Guardian readers", and went onto say "Some of their friends went on the Aldermaston marches. Mine never did to my knowledge, but they were both committed to voting for the Labour Party"; Gilmour inherited his parents liberalism, stating "I still consider myself to be more a socialist than anything else, even if I can't quite stick with party politics".http://www.neptunepinkfloyd.co.uk/index.php/npf-mag/426-david-gilmour-mojo-interview
