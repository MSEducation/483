North Carolina Highway 147 is a North Carolina state highway.  The route connects the Research Triangle Park to both Western Wake County and the city of Durham.

==Route Description==

The route's entire length is a limited access freeway; linking NC 540 in Morrisville with the Research Triangle Park (RTP), Downtown Durham and Interstates 40 and 85.  It is a fairly urbanized commuter-route and suffers from peak-traffic during conventional rush hours. Speed limits on the freeway range from [tpl]convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].  
From NC 540 to Interstate 40, the highway is a toll road, part of the Triangle Expressway.  Tolling on this stretch of NC 147 began on January 3, 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncturnpike.org/projects/Triangle_Expressway/|title=North Carolina Turnpike Authority: Triangle Expressway|accessdate=2011-12-08[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/12/08/1697098/states-first-modern-toll-road.html | title=State's first modern toll road opens today | publisher=NewsObserver.com | date=December 8, 2011 | accessdate=2011-12-08[/tpl]
Its northern terminus with Interstate 85 is a partial interchange, where northbound NC 147 merges onto southbound I-85 and vice-versa. Travelers wanting to go north on I-85 and vice-versa must utilize the nearby U.S. 15-501 freeway.

===Alternate names===

Though the highway is commonly known as "NC 147" or "147" throughout the state, the highway does have other known names it uses locally in areas.

==Tolls==

The Triangle Expressway is an all electronic toll collection (ETC) and camera enforced toll road.  There are three gantry locations along NC 147, all located on entrance/exit ramps.  Those that do not participate in the ETC program will receive a bill in the mail and will have 30 days from date on bill before additional fees and civil penalties are applied.[tpl]cite web |publisher= North Carolina Turnpike Authority |title=NC Quick Pass FAQ's |url= https://www.myncquickpass.com/en/faq/all.shtml |accessdate= April 13, 2014[/tpl]

==History==

The Durham Freeway began with a 1962 bond referendum. The first section of the road, completed in 1970 around downtown Durham, was designated Interstate 40.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] The original section extended from Chapel Hill Street to Alston Avenue and resulted in the destruction of a portion of the Hayti neighborhood as part of urban renewal, though a DOT engineer said the neighborhood likely would have been torn down anyway. The road was later extended west to Erwin Road and southward to where it now meets the current I-40, but the decision was made for I-40 to bypass Durham.  The section inside the city was renamed. The road's other names have included East-West Expressway and the I.L. "Buck" Dean Freeway.[tpl]cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Bloom |title= 30-year, 12-mile project completed |work= The Herald-Sun |location= Durham, NC |date= July 26, 1998 |page=A1 |issn=[/tpl]  
In 1979, planners said many of the city's roads needed widening, and the decision was made to extend the freeway to I-85. The first section in 1982 disrupted the Crest Street neighborhood, but the N.C. DOT moved 181 houses instead of tearing them down, an action that resulted in a 1987 third-place Federal Highway Administration award for "historic preservation and cultural enhancement".  Eventually, the problems that caused the original I-40 extension to I-85 to be delayed were overcome, and NC 147 was extended through the city.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Work began in 1993, and the eastbound lanes opened May 21, 1997.[tpl]cite news |title= Durham Freeway's new lanes to ease eastbound travel  |work= The Herald-Sun |location= Durham, NC |date= May 21, 1997 |page=C1 |issn=[/tpl] The section connecting the road to I-85 opened July 31, 1998.[tpl]cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Bloom |title= Durham Freeway's last leg opens |work= The Herald-Sun |location= Durham, NC |date= August 1, 1998 |page=A8 |issn=[/tpl] 
On September 6, 2011, the south termini at T.W. Alexander Drive (exit 4) was permanently closed to make way for NC 147's extension to NC 540 in Morrisville; this made I-40 the temporary southern termini for three months.  On December 8, 2011, the southern extension was opened.  Dubbed the Triangle Parkway, the [tpl]convert|3.4|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] stretch of road is also part of the Triangle Expressway.[tpl]cite web|url=https://apps.dot.state.nc.us/pio/releases/details.aspx?r=5333|title=SECTION OF N.C. 147 IN DURHAM TO CLOSE SEPT. 6|accessdate=2011-08-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/crosstown/rtp-commuters-the-nc-147-southern-spur-is-closed-today-for-good|title=Crosstown Traffic - RTP commuters: The NC 147 southern spur is closed today, for good | publisher=NewsObserver.com | date=September 6, 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-06[/tpl]

==Future==

There are two future projects involving NC 147.  The first is the East End Connector (Currently in planning and environmental study).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/eastendconnector/|title=East End Connector|accessdate=2011-08-19[/tpl] That project was set to start construction in 2010, but was delayed until after 2012.[tpl]cite news |first= Bruce |last= Siceloff |title= Road plan imperils Triangle projects |work= The News & Observer |location= Raleigh, NC |date= March 27, 2005 |page= A1 |issn=[/tpl]  The second is the NC 147 extension to McCrimmon Parkway, in Morrisville, which is scheduled for Reprioritization.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/search/details.html#id=2616 |title= Project #U-4763 |work= Project Details |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation |accessdate= December 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/search/details.html#sfr=640 |title= Project #U-4763A |work= Project Details |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation |accessdate= December 13, 2012[/tpl]
