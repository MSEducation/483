==History==

Abbotsford's colonial development began when the Royal Engineers surveyed the area in response to the Gold Rush along the Fraser River in 1858. This led to the building of Yale Road (today Old Yale Road), the first transportation route to link the Fraser Valley. Settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown Grant to obtain the [tpl]convert|160|acre|km2[/tpl] that would become Abbotsford.
There is some controversy over the origin of the Abbotsford name.[tpl]cite book|last= Thorburn |first= Mark |title= British Columbia Place Names |year= 2009 |publisher= Dragon Hill Publishing Ltd |ISBN= 978-1-896124-46-9 |pages= 336 [/tpl] The most commonly cited origin is that Maclure named the land Abbotsford after family friend Henry Braithwaite Abbott, the Western Superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway.WS Crocket 1905 Abbotsford Adam and Black London History of Abbotsford. M.S.A. Museum Until 1922 the name was spelled Abottsford. Maclure's sons later stated that the property had actually been named for Sir Walter Scott's home, Abbotsford,WS Crockett 1905 Abbotsford Adam and Black London while in his later years Maclure himself claimed that the naming had been "a combination of two ideas".
The title passed hands to Robert Ward, who filed a townsite subdivision on July 9, 1891. Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected Mission with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway at Sumas, Washington. This route was the only rail connection between Vancouver and Seattle until 1904. The Village of Abbotsford was incorporated in 1892. At that time Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, but also sold off a significant portion to the Great Northern Railway’s subsidiary company the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway. The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with Vancouver and Chilliwack was called, was discontinued in 1950, but BCER's successor BC Hydro retains the right to re-introduce passenger rail service. Service to Vancouver runs from neighbouring Mission by way of the West Coast Express.
The most notable natural disaster to hit Abbotsford was a major flood of the Fraser River in 1948.
In September of 1984 Pope John Paul II held an open-air mass for over 200,000 people at the Abbotsford International Airport.http://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/Page3457.aspx
The amalgamation of the Village of Abbotsford and the District of Sumas into the District of Abbotsford occurred in 1972. The District of Abbotsford amalgamated with the District of Matsqui in 1995 to become the City of Abbotsford, raising the population significantly.

===Quick facts===

==Climate==

Like many locations of a similar latitude, Abbotsford has four distinct seasons. However, the proximity to the Pacific Ocean provides milder winters, along with much greater rainfall than inland areas of the country. The influence of the Pacific also makes the transition between seasons more gradual compared to locations further inland.
Spring
Spring starts out cool and generally showery before gradually turning warmer and drier. Below freezing temperatures may occur overnight into May, and snow may fall until the end of April, but it normally melts quickly. Normal daytime highs range from near 10 °C in March to the low 20's in June. During periods of warmth, temperatures can reach into the mid 20's C during March and April, and can exceed 30 °C from May onwards.
Summer
Summer on the west coast is known for its relative dryness. It is not uncommon to receive little or no rainfall for weeks at a time. August averages only 20% of November's rainfall, and only about 16% of annual precipation falls between June 1 and October 1. Un-watered grass often turns brown in July, and may not need to be cut until September, when significant rains become more likely.
Rain that falls during summer is normally quite light, but can occasionally come in the form of thunderstorms.
Summers in Abbotsford are relatively warm, and can become quite hot on occasion. The average daily high in August is 23.8 °C, but highs over 30 °C are not uncommon. The highest temperature ever recorded was 38.0°C on July 29, 2009 at Abbotsford Airport.
Nights are usually fairly comfortable, even when the days are hot. It is rare for the temperature to stay above 20 °C at night, often falling as low as 10 °C. During warm spells, the temperature may range by as much as 20 °C in 12 hours (for example; a morning low of 11°C and an afternoon high of 31 °C).
Autumn
Autumn is characterized by increasingly unsettled and cooler conditions. Temperatures may still reach the mid or even upper 20's C at first, but rainfall becomes more frequent and temperatures drop in October. Frost may occur in late September, and at any time during October.
October 1 heralds the unofficial start of the rainy season, but the heaviest rains occur in November, which averages 234.3 mm of rain and 6.3 cm of snow (240.9 mm combined). According to Environment Canada, Abbotsford is the fourth wettest of 100 major cities in Canada, with 1573.2 mm of combined rain and snow annually. A weather pattern known as the Pineapple Express often brings significant rainstorms in autumn and winter.
The earliest snowfall has been known to occur at the end of October, but more frequently occurs in November. In milder years, there may be no snow until December. Occasionally, there will be a spell of sub-freezing weather in late November or early December. This may be accompanied by snow and high winds, but is usually short-lived.
Winter
With a mean temperature of about 2.5 °C in January, Abbotsford's winters are cool, but relatively mild compared to most of Canada. However, the overcast and damp conditions may be subjectively less pleasant than colder sunny weather.
The coldest month on record at Abbotsford International Airport is January 1950, with a mean temperature of −8.6 °C (an average high of −4.7 °C and an average low of −12.4 °C). It was during this time that Abbotsford also set its all-time record low temperature of −21.1 °C, on the 18th of that month.
Snow occurs frequently in the surrounding mountains, but less often closer to sea level. There is a general misconception by visitors and residents in other parts of the country that the area does not receive any snow at all, but the truth is that Abbotsford averages 63.5 cm of snow per year, and there has never been a winter when traceable snow has not been observed at both Abbotsford International Airport and Vancouver International Airport. As a matter of fact, Environment Canada currently ranks Abbotsford 44th and Vancouver 59th under the category "Most huge snowfall days (25 cm or more)" out of 100 major Canadian cities, placing them above cities such as Calgary (74th place) and Toronto (99th place).
Snow in Abbotsford tends to be quite wet, which when combined with typical winter temperatures rising above and falling below freezing throughout the course of the day, can make for unusually slippery road conditions. Years or even months with snowfall surpassing the 100 cm mark are also not completely exceptional; the former occurred twice in the 1990s, while January 1954 saw more than 140 cm of snow. Snow can fall at any time between October and May.
Snowfall accumulations tend to vary greatly by year and season. During the winter of 1990–1991, 152.3 cm fell; the next winter, only a trace of snow was recorded. In the year 1996, 199.2 cm (over six feet) was recorded; the next year, only 6.2 cm fell. Serious snow storms occurred most recently in December 2008, when as much as 60 cm fell in the days leading up to Christmas. Abbotsford can expect a White Christmas once every five years on average.
