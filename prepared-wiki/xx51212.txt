The Colorado Mammoth are a member of the National Lacrosse League. They have played at Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado, United States, since the 2003 season. 
In 2004 they became the league's attendance leader, closely beating the Toronto Rock. In 2006, they again came away with the league attendance record, again beating out the Toronto Rock. 2006 was the first year in the 20-year history of the NLL that the league had an attendance of more than one million fans in one season. The Colorado Mammoth had the honor of hosting fan number one million, an honor that commissioner Jim Jennings believed to be rightfully theirs, given the impact they had on the league's attendance that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/article.php?id=449|title=NLL Welcomes Millionth Fan|work=NLL.com|date=April 28, 2006|accessdate=2007-02-13[/tpl] In 2008, the Mammoth average attendance per game was highest among Pepsi Center's residents, including the Colorado Avalanche (NHL), and the Denver Nuggets (NBA).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/mar/21/mammoth-sales/ |title=Mammoth Sales |accessdate=2008-03-21 |author=Paton, James |date=March 21, 2008 |work=RockyMountainNews.com |publisher=[/tpl]
