==History==

The first version, by Steve Wainstead, was in December 1999 and was the first Wiki written in PHP to be publicly released.
The first version ran under PHP 3.x and ran on DBM files only. 
It was a feature-for-feature reimplementation of the original WikiWikiWeb at c2.com.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In early 2000 Arno Hollosi contributed a second database library to run PhpWiki on MySQL.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
From then on the features and contributions started to grow, including a templating system, color diffs, rewrites of the rendering engine and much more.
Arno was interested in running a wiki for the game Go.http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoWiki
Jeff Dairiki was the next major contributor, and soon headed the project for the next few years.
Since then Reini Urban and Marc-Etienne Vargenau maintain it.
Version 1.4.0rc1 implements Wikicreole 1.0, including additions.
