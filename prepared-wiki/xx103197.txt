Fin Fin responds to the player's tone of voice and volume of the voice - one reviewer describing Fin Fin as a 'virtual mood ring'.  30,000 copies were sold in the first year in Japan.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Next Generation|date=October 1997|title=Finding companionship in a digital age|pages=56-63[/tpl]
Fin Fin was much like the popular Tamagotchi for your PC. If he was not fed or paid enough attention to he would sing a sad whistling song or sometimes would fly away.
