[[Little Italy]]

CATEGORIES: Little Italys, Italian diaspora, Ethnic enclaves

Little Italy is a general name for an ethnic area populated primarily by Italians or people of Italian ancestry, usually in an urban neighborhood.  "Little Italy" holds many different aspects of the Italian culture.  There are shops to pick up just about any Italian goods as well as Italian restaurants lining the streets.  The idea of "Little Italy" is basically to have the country of Italy stuck in the middle of a big city.  This can be due to immigration in the older days.  People of the same culture settled together in certain areas and as our world modernized, these little towns such as "Little Italy" blossomed, making it what it is today.
