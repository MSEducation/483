Anchor Brewing Company is an American alcoholic beverage producer, operating a brewery and distillery on Potrero Hill in San Francisco, California. The brewery was founded in 1896 and was purchased by Frederick Louis Maytag III, in 1965, saving it from closure. It moved to its current location in 1979. It is one of the last remaining breweries to produce California common beer, also known as Steam Beer, a trademark owned by the company.

==History==

Anchor began during the Gold Rush when Gottlieb Brekle arrived from Germany and began brewing in San Francisco.  In 1896, Ernst F. Baruth and his son-in-law, Otto Schinkel, Jr., bought the old brewery on Pacific Avenue and named it Anchor.  The brewery burned down in the fires that followed the 1906 earthquake, but was rebuilt at a different location in 1907.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Anchor Brewing: Our History I | url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory.htm | publisher=Anchor Brewing Company | date=27 January 2010 | accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100915121246/http://anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory.htm| archivedate= 15 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  There is no record of what Anchor did during Prohibition, but it resumed serving Steam Beer after Repeal, possibly as the only steam brewing company still in operation.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Anchor Brewing: Our History II | url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory2.htm | publisher=Anchor Brewing Company | date=27 January 2010 | accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005123756/http://anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory2.htm| archivedate= 5 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] However the brewery burned down yet again within the year, and it relocated once more, this time to a building a few blocks away.
The brewery continued operations into the late 1950s, but suffered heavily from the country's increasingly strong preference for the light lagers produced by the megabreweries.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Anchor Brewing: Our History III | url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory3.htm | publisher=Anchor Brewing Company | date=27 January 2010 | accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005122347/http://anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory3.htm| archivedate= 5 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Whereas there had been more than 4,000 breweries at the turn of the twentieth century, only 70 remained by the 1960s.[tpl]cite news |author=Tom Abate | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/04/27/MNOD1D55P1.DTL |  title=Anchor Brewing Co. sold to Greggor, Foglio |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=27 April 2010[/tpl]
Anchor shut its doors briefly in 1959, but was bought and reopened the following year.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Anchor Brewing: Our History IV | url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory4.htm | publisher=Anchor Brewing Company | date=27 January 2010 | accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005122756/http://anchorbrewing.com/brewery/ourhistory4.htm| archivedate= 5 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  By 1965, however, it was doing so poorly that it nearly closed again.  Anchor's situation continued to deteriorate largely because the current owners lacked the expertise, equipment, and attention to cleanliness that are required to produce consistent batches of beer for commercial consumption. The brewery gained a deserved reputation for producing sour, bad beer.[tpl]cite book | last=Ogle | first=Maureen | coauthors= | title=Ambitious Brew: The Story of American Beer | location=Orlando | publisher=Harcourt  | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-15-101012-7 [/tpl]

Turning the failing brewery around required more than the money in Maytag's fortune. He also had to change the character of the beer that was produced there.  Between purchasing Anchor and producing the first batches of bottled Anchor Steam in 1971, Maytag had to learn the brewing process from scratch, invest in improvements to the equipment, and focus heavily on cleanliness in the brewing process.  The new beer was a definitive representative of  California common beer, a derivative of historic steam beer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jB8qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AykEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5332%2C5774950 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |last=Lefler |first=Jack |title=Steam beer is hot item among young in Frisco  |date=June 9, 1975 |page=green sheet [/tpl]
Before offering in bottles, sales were only as draft beer to thirty local establishments that had long carried the brand. Total production was only 800 barrels in 1969, 1,200 in 1970, and 2,100 in 1971.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2ZlMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y_oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6976%2C8503545 |newspaper=Lakeland (FL) Ledger |last=Hillinger |first=Charles |agency=(Los Angeles Times) |title=The last steam beer brewery [/tpl] The bottles were initially sold in four-packs, to keep the price close to mainstream six-packs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pMhGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QfgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5637%2C839822 |newspaper=The Day |location=New London, CT |agency=(Chicago Tribune) |last=Gorman |first=John |title=Anchor Steam: the coddled beer |date=July 6, 1986 |page=C4 [/tpl]
thumb|Stirring hops into the wort in the brewhouse.During the 1980s Anchor Steam Beer began to achieve national notice and demand increased from only a few thousand cases per year that had been produced in the old location.  It was the first of the modern microbreweries, being among the first American breweries to produce a porter, barley wine, or India pale ale with regularity. Its success inspired many others to enter the brewing business, notably New Albion.[tpl]cite book |last=Acitelli |first=Tom |title=The Audacity of Hops: The History of America's Craft Beer Revolution |year=2013 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9781613743881 |oclc=828193572 |page=335[/tpl]
In 1989 the company produced a limited edition of beer (known in Sumerian as sikaru) which they named Ninkasi after the Sumerian goddess of beer. It was based on a scholarly reconstruction of an ancient Sumerian recipe known as the "hymn to Ninkasi".[tpl]cite web|last=Helfferich|first=Carla|title=Beer before Bread|url=http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF10/1039.html|publisher=Alaska Science Forum|accessdate=25 February 2011|date=17 July 1991[/tpl]  The recipe started with a twice-baked bread known as bappir as well as malt, and was sweetened with honey and dates. It did not include hops or other bittering ingredients, so it was considerably sweeter than modern beers.[tpl]cite web| title=Sumerian Beer Project| url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/ninkasi.htm|work=Anchor Brewing |accessdate=23 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100915162753/http://anchorbrewing.com/beers/ninkasi.htm| archivedate= 15 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The recipe is described by Charlie Papazian.[tpl]cite book | last=Papazian  | first=Charlie | title=Home Brewer's Companion | location=New York | publisher=Avon Books | year=1994 | isbn=0-380-77287-6[/tpl]
In 1993, the company opened Anchor Distillery, a microdistillery in the same location as the brewery, and began making a single malt rye whiskey, named Old Potrero after the hill. In 1997, the microdistillery began producing gin, called Junípero—Spanish for juniper, and a reference to Fr. Junípero Serra, an important figure in San Francisco's and California's history. Recently they have also begun producing a Jenever style gin called Genevieve, using wheat, barley, rye, and the same herbal ingredients as their Junípero gin.
In 2010, Maytag sold the company to the former Skyy vodka executives Keith Greggor and Tony Foglio, who plan to expand Anchor's business while keeping its commitment to artisan brewing. In 2013, the brewery launched Anchor California Lager, a re-creation of an historic Boca Brewing lager from the 1870s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/connect/news/95 |title=Anchor Brewing Company Launches Anchor California Lager® And Forms Partnership with California State Parks Foundation |date=February 7, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2013[/tpl]  The brewery also announced a major expansion plan at Pier 48 in the Mission Rock neighborhood near AT&T Park.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/connect/news/98 |title=Anchor Brewing to Quadruple its Production with New Facilities Planned for Pier 48 |date=February 19, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2013[/tpl]  Construction is expected to begin in late 2014, and will expand Anchor's annual production capacity from 180,000 barrels to 680,000 barrels.
