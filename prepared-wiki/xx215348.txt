==Controversy==

Iran's Mohammad Alirezaei was due to race against Israel's Tom Be'eri in the fourth heat of the 100 metre breaststroke, but pulled out, apparently under the orders from officials of the Iranian delegation. Efraim Zinger, Olympic Committee of Israel General Secretary, criticized the withdrawal saying "Politics takes precedence over sport with the Iranians and the Olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west". Giselle Davies, director of communications for the IOC, said that Alirezaei withdrew because of sickness and submitted his case in writing to his Federation.[tpl]cite news|title=Iranian swimmer quits Olympic race against Israeli|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/11/iranisrael.olympics/|publisher=CNN|date=9 August 2008|accessdate=16 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Magney|first=Jacqueline|title=Iranian who quit swim heat may be expelled|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/latest-news/iranian-who-quit-swim-heat-may-be-expelled/2008/08/10/1218306666479.html|publisher=The Age|date=11 August 2008|accessdate=16 May 2013[/tpl] At the 2004 Games in Athens, Iran's Arash Miresmaeili, a two-time world judo champion, refused to compete against Israel's Ehud Vaks in the opening round of the 66 kg competition, later admitting that he made his decision to show solidarity for the Palestinian cause.
