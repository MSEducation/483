Andrew Golota (pol. Andrzej Gołota, born January 5, 1968 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish boxer. He won a bronze medal at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul and is a four-time world heavyweight title challenger.

==Amateur career==

Golota had 111 wins in an amateur career that culminated in his winning a bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Golota won other international amateur tournaments as well.
In 1990, he got into a fight with Piotr Bialostocki in a bar in Wloclawek.  Facing charges of assault and battery, he fled Poland rather than risk five years in prison. Down and Dirty, Sports Illustrated article, 1996-08-19, Retrieved on 2013-05-27  Later that year, he married a U.S. citizen of Polish descent and settled permanently in Chicago. His wife had lived in Chicago since the age of eleven.
Gołota's Olympic results were as follows:

==Professional career==

In 1992, he turned professional, knocking out Roosevelt Shuler in three rounds. He had three more knockouts and then went the distance for the first time, defeating Robert Smith in six rounds. He won his next 16 fights by knockout. His wins included Bobby Crabtree and Jeff Lampkin. Following his KO of Crabtree he was featured in Ring Magazine's new faces section. Soon after, he faced a respected contender, Maron Wilson. Golota won a ten round decision. Gołota won his next five bouts by knockout. His opponents included Samson Po'hua and Darnell Nicholson, both of whom were considered fringe contenders at the time. The win over Po'hua was memorable for the moment in which Gołota bit Po'hua on the shoulder, two years before the infamous bite-filled rematch between Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.BraggingRightsCorner.com

===Golota vs. Bowe I & II===

Golota's first high-profile fight came against former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. Bowe had not fought in nearly a year since his third and final fight with Evander Holyfield, which he won by technical knockout in the eighth round, and had said regarding his opponent, "how do you train for a bum?", paying no attention to his opponent's win-loss record. The fight was held at Madison Square Garden on July 11, 1996, and was televised by HBO as part of its World Championship Boxing series.
Early in the fight it appeared that Bowe had underestimated his opponent's skills. However, Golota's penchant for not following the rules was also showcased in this fight as he had trouble keeping his punches above Bowe's belt line. After being repeatedly warned, referee Wayne Kelly began deducting points from Golota and had done so twice prior to the seventh round. Early in that round Kelly took a third point from Golota and warned him that if he did it again, he was going to lose the fight. Golota continued to fight and with less than a minute left in the round landed several hard shots that appeared to have Bowe staggered. However, with 37 seconds remaining in the round Golota dropped Bowe with another blatant low punch, directly to the genitals, and Kelly disqualified him.
What ensued was a dramatic riot that left a large number of civilians and policemen injured, including Gołota himself, who was hit by a member of Bowe's entourage with a two-way radio and required eleven stitches to close a cut on his head. The riot, which has been named "Riot at the Garden", was called Event of the Year by the Ring Magazine.
The controversy of Golota vs. Bowe I created interest in a rematch. Golota vs. Bowe II was on Pay Per View and Gołota once again led Bowe on the scorecards only to be disqualified in the ninth round by referee Eddie Cotton, again for multiple low blows. This fight also proved to be controversial, and a protest was filed by Gołota's camp to try to overturn the fight's result. Michael Katz, a sportswriter, coined the term Foul Pole for Gołota.
Both fights are featured on HBO's documentary Legendary Nights The Tale of Bowe Golota.

===Championship fight with Lewis===

Despite two losses in a row, Gołota became the WBC number one contender. On October 4, 1997, he received a shot at the world's Heavyweight championship against Lennox Lewis in Atlantic City, NJ. Gołota was knocked out in the first round.
Gołota subsequently claimed that an injection of lidocaine for tendonitis in his right knee given to him by his physician shortly before the fight made him woozy and impaired his vision. The adverse effects of lidocaine include dizziness, blurred vision, seizures. As a result, he filed a medical malpractice suit against his physician, claiming that the injection had cost him the fight and a deal with HBO for $21 million to broadcast his next four to five fights.Ackert, Kristie, Golata Sues Own Doctor Over Shot, New York Daily News, February 12, 1999, http://www.nydailynews.com; Plus: Boxing-- Heavyweights, Golota Says Injection Made Him Feel Woosy, The New York Times, March 20, 1998, http://query.nytimes.com Plus - Boxing Heavy Weights; Golota Says Injection Made Him Woozy

===Later career===

Gołota's boxing career continued with him beating former 2-time world champion Tim Witherspoon by decision. In his next match, he lost to Michael Grant by a knockout in the tenth round in one of The Ring's 1999 fights of the year. Gołota scored two knockdowns of Grant in the first round. He was ahead on all three judges' scorecards in the tenth round when he himself was knocked down. When asked by referee Randy Neuman whether he wanted to continue, he shook his head twice and then haltingly answered "No."
In 2000, Gołota fought in China beating Marcus Rhodes with a third round knockout.
Later in 2000, he faced former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.  Tyson knocked Golota down in the first round, and in between rounds Andrew told his corner to stop the fight but his corner talked him into continuing. In the third round, as he had done in the Grant match, Gołota told the referee he did not want to continue. The result of the fight was later changed to no contest when Tyson failed a post fight drug test, testing positive for marijuana.
Following the Tyson fight, Gołota was inactive for nearly three years before returning to the ring on August 14, 2003. He scored a technical knockout of journeyman Brian Nix in the seventh round. On November 15, Golota knocked out Terrence Lewis in the sixth round at Verona, New York.
Gołota then received a second world title shot, fighting IBF heavyweight champion Chris Byrd at New York City's Madison Square Garden on April 17, 2004. The fight resulted in a draw.
On November 13 of that year, he received his second world title shot in a row. Despite knocking down WBA champion John Ruiz twice within the bout, he lost by unanimous decision.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-11-14-heavyweight-fights-part2_x.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | title=Ruiz, Byrd, Rahman victorious in ring | first1=Dan | last1=Rafael | date=November 14, 2004 | accessdate=April 25, 2010[/tpl]
Golota received his third world title try in a row on May 21, 2005 against WBO champion Lamon Brewster. Though heavily favored to win, Gołota lost when Brewster knocked him down three times inside the first round, prompting the referee to stop the bout.
June 9, 2007, he beat Jeremy Bates in the 2nd round by technical knockout.
Gołota fought Kevin McBride on October 6, 2007 in Madison Square Garden and won by TKO in the 6th round, winning the IBF North American Heavyweight championship.
On January 19, 2008, Gołota defeated Mike Mollo by unanimous decision in 12 rounds to win the World Boxing Association Fedelatin heavyweight championship belt.
In January, 2009, Gołota lost by first round TKO to Ray Austin.
On October 24, 2009 in Łódź, Gołota fought Tomasz Adamek and lost by TKO in the 5th round. The event was hosted on Polsat TV, it was also broadcast live online on ipla.tv platform. It was the largest live internet transmission in Poland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
