Bath and North East Somerset (commonly referred to as BANES or B&NES) is the district of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset Council that was created on 1 April 1996 following the abolition of the County of Avon. It is part of the Ceremonial county of Somerset. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath.
Bath and North East Somerset covers an area of [tpl]convert|220|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl], of which two thirds is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but BANES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Westfield and the Chew Valley.
The area has varied geography including river valleys and rolling hills. The history of human habitation is long but expanded massively during Roman times, and played significant roles in the Saxon era and English civil war. Industry developed from a largely agricultural basis to include coal mining with the coming of canals and railways. Bath developed as a spa resort in Georgian times and remains a major cultural tourism centre having gained World Heritage City status.

==History==

Although BANES was only created in 1996 the area it covers has been occupied for thousands of years. The age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but is believed to be from the Neolithic period,[tpl]cite web | title=Stanton Drew Stone Circles | work=English Heritage Archeometry | url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/archaeometry/StantonDrew/ | accessdate=8 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060630054023/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/archaeometry/StantonDrew/| archivedate= 30 June 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] as is the chambered tomb known as Stoney Littleton Long Barrow.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stonepages.com/england/stoneylittleton.html |title=Stoney Littleton |accessdate=15 March 2008 |work=Stones of England | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080308235808/http://www.stonepages.com/england/stoneylittleton.html| archivedate= 8 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Solsbury Hill has an Iron Age hill fort.

The archaeological evidence shows that the site of the Roman Baths' main spring was treated as a shrine by the Celts,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.somersettouristguide.com/Bath/The_Roman_Baths_722.asp |title=The Roman Baths |accessdate=1 November 2007 |work=Somerset Tourist Guide [/tpl] and was dedicated to the goddess Sulis, whom the Romans identified with Minerva; however, the name Sulis continued to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to Bath's Roman name of Aquae Sulis (literally, "the waters of Sulis").
Excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century until the third century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park,[tpl]cite web | title=Mendip Hills An Archaeological Survey of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | work=Somerset County Council Archaeological Projects | url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/HES_MendipAONB.pdf | accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl] where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found.

The Saxon advance from the east seems to have been halted by battles between the British and Saxons, for example; at the siege of Badon Mons Badonicus (which may mave been in the Bath region e.g. at Solsbury Hill),[tpl]cite web | title=Roman Times | work=Britannia | url=http://www.britannia.com/history/somerset/somhist3.html|accessdate=29 October 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061112073000/http://www.britannia.com/history/somerset/somhist3.html| archivedate= 12 November 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] or Bathampton Down.[tpl]cite book |title=The hidden places of Somerset |last=Scott |first=Shane |year=1995 |publisher=Travel Publishing Ltd |location=Aldermaston |isbn=1-902007-01-8 |pages=16 [/tpl] This area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD.[ref]The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 501–97 AD.
[/ref] The Western Wandsdyke was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. The ditch is on the north side, so presumably it was used by the Celts as a defence against Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames valley. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the British Celtic tribes, with victories at Bradford-on-Avon (in the Avon Gap in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 645–56 AD In 675, Osric, King of the Hwicce, set up a monastic house at Bath, probably using the walled area as its precinct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/towns/bathtime.shtml |title=Timeline Bath |accessdate=10 December 2007 |work=Time Travel Britain [/tpl] King Offa of Mercia gained control of this monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.[tpl]cite web|title=Bath Abbey|url=http://www.uquebec.ca/musique/orgues/angleterre/batha.html#English | work=Robert Poliquin's Music and Musicians| publisher=Quebec University | accessdate=18 September 2007[/tpl] In the ninth century the old Roman street pattern had been lost and it had become a royal possession, with King Alfred laying out the town afresh, leaving its south-eastern quadrant as the abbey precinct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/saxon/alfredsborough.htm |title=Alfreds Borough |accessdate=8 December 2007 |work=Bath Past | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071208195046/http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/saxon/alfredsborough.htm| archivedate= 8 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Edgar of England was crowned king of England in Bath Abbey in 973.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/saxon_12.htm |title=Edgar the Peaceful |accessdate=8 December 2007 |work=English Monarchs – Kings and Queens of England [/tpl]

New baths were built around the three springs. Later bishops, however, returned the episcopal seat to Wells, while retaining the name of Bath in their title as the Bishop of Bath and Wells. The priory at Hinton Charterhouse was founded in 1232 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury who also founded Lacock Abbey.[tpl]cite book |title=The hidden places of Somerset |last=Scott |first=Shane |year=1995 |publisher=Travel Publishing Ltd |location=Aldermaston |isbn=1-902007-01-8 |pages=18–19 [/tpl]

The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. Bath was granted city status by Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thecityofbath.co.uk/civic_insignia.htm |title=Civic Insignia |accessdate=10 December 2007 |work=City of Bath [/tpl] Keynsham, said to be named after Saint Keyne, developed into a medieval market town, its growth prompted by the foundation of an influential and prosperous abbey, founded by the Victorine order of Augustinian monks founded around 1170. It survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 and a house was built on the site. The remains have been designated as grade I listed building by English Heritage.[tpl]cite web | title=Keynsham Abbey  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=485012 | accessdate=18 July 2007[/tpl] The town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth.

In 1668 Thomas Guidott, who had been a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College Oxford, moved to Bath and set up practice. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and in 1676 he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the country and soon the aristocracy started to arrive to partake in them.[tpl]cite journal |last=Burns |first=D.

In north Somerset, around Radstock mining in the Somerset coalfield was an important industry, and in an effort to reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway.[tpl]cite web | title=Rivers and Canals | work=Somerset County Council: History of Somerset | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Rivers.htm|accessdate=29 October 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060925010138/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Rivers.htm| archivedate= 25 September 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It connected to the Kennet and Avon Canal which linked the River Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol, joining the River Avon at Bath via Bath Locks. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway connected Bath and Bournemouth. It was jointly operated by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR).  After the 1 January 1923 Grouping joint ownership of the S&D passed to the LMS and the Southern Railway.Awdry, Christopher (1990). Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies. Partick Stephens Ltd.

The area was also served by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset coalfield. The line was opened in 1873 between Bristol and Radstock, where it joined with an earlier freight only line from Frome. The biggest civil engineering project on the line was the Pensford Viaduct over the River Chew. The viaduct is 995 feet long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet to rail level and consists of 16 arches. It is now a Grade II listed building. Freight services on the branch line ceased in 1951. The line achieved some fame after closure by its use in the film The Titfield Thunderbolt, but the track was taken up in 1958.
During World War II, between the evening of 25 April and the early morning of 27 April 1942, Bath suffered three air raids in reprisal for RAF raids on the German cities of Lübeck and Rostock. The three raids formed part of the Luftwaffe campaign popularly known as the Baedeker Blitz; over 400 people were killed, and more than 19,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.royalcrescentbath.com/HistoryBathatWar.htm |title=History – Bath at War |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=Royal Crescent Society, Bath [/tpl] Houses in the Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms, while the south side of Queen Square was destroyed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.royalcrescentbath.com/HistoryRoyalCrescent%202.htm#The_Day_Bombs_fell_on_Bath |title=Royal Crescent History: The Day Bombs fell on Bath  |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=Royal Crescent Society, Bath [/tpl] All have since been reconstructed.

==Geography==

Bath and North East Somerset covers an area of [tpl]convert|220|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=Area Information|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/leisureandculture/tourismandtravel/areainformation/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council|accessdate=18 June 2011[/tpl]  of which two thirds is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/bathnes/leisureandculture/tourismandtravel/areainformation/default.htm |title=About the area |accessdate=30 December 2007 |work=Bath and North East Somerset Council |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071104232206/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/bathnes/leisureandculture/tourismandtravel/areainformation/default.htm  |archivedate = 4 November 2007[/tpl] Surrounding local government areas include Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire.
The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but BANES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and the Chew Valley. Bath lies on the River Avon and its tributaries such as the River Chew and Midford Brook cross the area.
In the west of the area the Chew Valley consists of the valley of the River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.
To the north of Bath are Lansdown, Langridge and Solsbury hills.  These are outliers of the Cotswolds.

==Governance==

Historically part of the county of Somerset, Bath was made a county borough in 1889 so being independent of the newly created administrative Somerset county council, which covered the rest of B&NES.[tpl]cite journal |last=Keane |first=Patrick |title=An English County and Education: Somerset, 1889–1902 |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=88 |issue=347 |pages=286–311 |id= |url=  |quote= |doi=10.1093/ehr/LXXXVIII.CCCXLVII.286[/tpl] The area that would become B&NES became part of Avon when that non-metropolitan county was created in 1974. Since the abolition of Avon in 1996, Bath has been the main centre of the district of Bath and North East Somerset (B&NES), one of the four authorities that replaced Avon County Council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/493/contents/made |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |work=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=19 March 2011[/tpl]
Before the Reform Act of 1832 Bath elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html |title=Parliamentary Constituencies in the unreformed House |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=United Kingdom Election Results | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071105102205/http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html| archivedate= 5 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Bath now has a single parliamentary constituency, with Liberal Democrat Don Foster as Member of Parliament. The rest of the area falls within the North East Somerset constituency.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/cgi-bin/calcwork.pl?seat=Somerset%20North%20East |title= Somerset North East: New Boundaries Calculation|accessdate=19 September 2007 |work=Electoral Calculus: General Election Prediction [/tpl] Previously most of the area was in the Wansdyke constituency, which covers the part of B&NES that is not in the Bath constituency. It also contained four wards or parts of wards from South Gloucestershire Council. It was named after the former Wansdyke district.
Since B&NES was created, no political party has been in overall control of the council. The Liberal Democrats quickly became the dominant party, but in the local elections on 3 May 2007 the Conservative Party won 31 seats became the largest party, though they did not have a majority. After the 2011 local elections, the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives won 29 seats each with the Labour Party winning only five seats, none of which are in Bath; the Liberal Democrats went on to form a minority administration.
The current council composes of 65 councillors, 32 from Bath, 6 each from the Norton Radstock and Keynsham areas, and 21 others.  The current political division as of January 2013 is:[tpl]cite web |url=http://democracy.bathnes.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=PARTY&VW=LIST&PIC=0 |title=Your Councillors – Bath & North East Somerset Council |publisher=Bath & North East Somerset Council |accessdate=23 June 2012[/tpl]

Bath and North East Somerset Council runs one of the most successful youth democracy groups in the UK, Democratic Action for B&NES Youth (DAFBY), which is now a model of good practice for similar organisations across the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qcda.gov.uk/libraryAssets/media/cs_banes.pdf |title=Challenging injustice through democratic action |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority[/tpl] The group are consulted by the council and its partners on a wide variety of issues that affect young people. The Quality Improvement Agency have awarded the group Post-16 Citizenship Champion status, and in May 2008, DAFBY was awarded Outstanding status by OFSTED. DAFBY now delivers training for other youth participation organisations, as well as supporting the local Member of Youth Parliament, Fred Cotterill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/profiles/south_west/cotterill_fred.html |title=Fred Cotterill, Member of Youth Parliament profile |accessdate=22 March 2009 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament[/tpl]

===Parishes===

The area of the city of Bath which was part of Bath County Borough is unparished. The electoral wards within Bath are the central Abbey, Kingsmead and Walcot wards, and the more outlying Bathwick, Combe Down, Lambridge, Lansdown, Lyncombe, Newbridge, Odd Down, Oldfield, Southdown, Twerton, Westmoreland, Weston and Widcombe wards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilanddemocracy/councillorsdemocracyandelections/elections/wardmaps.htm|title=Elections — Ward Maps |date=31 August 2005 |publisher=Bath & North East Somerset Council |accessdate=15 November 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080621225523/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilanddemocracy/councillorsdemocracyandelections/elections/wardmaps.htm| archivedate=21 June 2008[/tpl]

==Demography==

170,238 people live in the area and approximately half live in the City of Bath making it 12 times more densely populated than the rest of the area.
According to the UK Government's 2001 census, Bath, together with North East Somerset, which includes areas around Bath as far as the Chew Valley, has a population of 169,040, with an average age of 39.9 (the national average being 38.6). According to the same statistics, the district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a white ethnic background at 97.2% — significantly higher than the national average of 90.9%. Other non-white ethnic groups in the district, in order of population size, are multiracial at 1%, Asian at 0.5% and black at 0.5% (the national averages are 1.3%, 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00ha.asp |title=Bath and North East Somerset UA 2001 Census |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=National Statistics| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071102233146/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00ha.asp| archivedate= 2 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The district is largely Christian at 71%, with no other religion reaching more than 0.5%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the non-religious, at 19.5%, are significantly more prevalent than the national 14.8%. Since Bath is known for the restorative powers of its waters, it is interesting to note that only 7.4% of the population describe themselves as "not healthy" in the last 12 months, compared to a national average of 9.2%; only 15.8% of the inhabitants say they have had a long-term illness, as against 18.2% nationally.

==Transport==

Bath is approximately [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-east of the larger city and port of Bristol, to which it is linked by the A4 road, and is a similar distance south of the M4 motorway. Bath and North East Somerset is also served by the A37 and A368 trunk roads, and a network of smaller roads.
Bath is connected to Bristol and the sea by the River Avon, navigable via locks by small boats. The river was connected to the River Thames and London by the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810 via Bath Locks; this waterway – closed for many years, but restored in the last years of the 20th century – is now popular with narrow boat users.[tpl]cite book |last=Allsop |first=Niall |title=The Kennet & Avon Canal |year=1987 |publisher=Millstream Book |location=Bath |isbn=0-948975-15-6 [/tpl] Bath is on National Cycle Route 4, with one of Britain's first cycleways, the Bristol & Bath Railway Path, to the west, and an eastern route toward London on the canal towpath. Although Bath does not have an airport, the city is about [tpl]convert|18|mi|km|0[/tpl] from Bristol Airport, which may be reached by road or by rail via Bristol Temple Meads railway station.
Bath is served by the Bath Spa railway station (designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel), which has regular connections to London Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads, Cardiff Central, Swansea, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance (see Great Western Main Line), and also Westbury, Warminster, Salisbury, Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton (see Wessex Main Line).
