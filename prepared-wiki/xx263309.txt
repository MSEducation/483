The Wildseeloder is a [tpl]Convert|2119|m|ft[/tpl] high mountain in the eastern Kitzbühel Alps in Tyrol, Austria. The valley base for the Wildseeloder is Fieberbrunn in the Pillersee valley. On its northern slopes is a ski area. The summit, which has no lifts up to it, is a popular ski touring destination in winter. West of the Wildseeloder is a lake, the Wildsee, in a cirque hollow. The Wildseeloderhaus stands on its shore. The easiest ascent to the Wildseeloder runs from Fieberbrunn to the north, over the Lärchfilzkogel past the Wildseeloderhaus.
