ZynAddSubFX is a free open source software synthesizer for Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.
For sound generation it has three hybrid synth engines that combine additive, subtractive, Fourier and other synthesis methods. No external samples are used to produce the sound; everything is done by synthesis.
The synthesizer has effects like reverberation, echo, chorus, distortion, equalization and others, and supports microtonal tunings.http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/[ref]

The author of ZynAddSubFX is Romanian programmer Nasca Octavian Paul.http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/credits.htmlhttp://www.paulnasca.com/open-source-projects The project was started in March 2002 and the first public version (1.0.0) was released on September 25, 2002.http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/news.html
A limited Mac OS X version was released by Ben Powers. It has been reported however that this port is PowerPC only (G4-G5 chips).http://web.archive.org/web/20060128141330/http://70.24.158.31:8080/zyn_mac/index.htmlhttp://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=370041
A VST port implementation is now available, being maintained by jackoo (Vlad Ionescu) on the KVR Audio Forums.http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=268277 The VST version is still in beta development, but has been tested with hosts such as VSTHost, EnergyXT 1.41, Cubase and REAPER. The latest version features a 'MidiLearn' mechanism (which enables users to assign CC messages to various controls), native VST parameter automation and multiple outputs.

==Sound generation==

ZynAddSubFX combines several different methods of audio synthesis in order to create sounds: additive synthesis by the ADSynth engine, subtractive synthesis by the SUBSynth engine, and an original algorithm used to generate wavetables in the PADSynth engine.http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc/PADsynth/PADsynth.htm

==Music made with ZynAddSubFX==

ZynAddSubFX was featured in the KVR One-Synth-Challenge contest.
In November 2013, unfa released an album that was entirely made with ZynAddSubFX.
