Leslie Jane Ferrar, CVO (born 20 July 1955) was Treasurer to Charles, Prince of Wales from January 2005 until July 2012.  Early on in her tenure her alleged (but unsubstantiated) behaviour in office led to her being dubbed 'the grasping treasurer' by a couple of members of the 'tabloid' press.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/features/2140849/royalty-check |title=Prince Charles' royalty check |accessdate=2006-08-03 |author=Karen Day  |date=2005-08-04[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite news | author =Sue Carroll |  url = http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/suecarroll/tm_column_date=16032005-name_index.html| title =ROYAL LEMON AIDES | work = mirror.co.uk| publisher = | pages = | page = | date = 2005-03-16| accessdate = 2006-08-03| language = [/tpl]
