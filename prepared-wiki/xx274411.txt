==Reception==

The Allmusic review by David R. Adler awarded the album 3 stars stating "Emergence showcases Miroslav Vitous in a solo bass setting, with no overdubs. It's austere and challenging, but Vitous is never ponderous; he sustains plenty of interest with his passion and staggering technique, dividing his time equally between pizzicato and arco statements... An excellent complement to other solo bass statements on ECM, most notably by Dave Holland and Gary Peacock".Adler, D. R. Allmusic Review accessed September 26, 2011
In 2011, Ricardo Villalobos and Max Loderbauer used samples of Emergence as the basis for the track "Reemergence" on the remix album Re:ECM.
