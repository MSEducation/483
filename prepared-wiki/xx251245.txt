As a doctor,[ref]Philippine Medical Association. (1963) Journal, Volume 39
[/ref] Gedeon became very popular in his hometown treating poor people in the rural areas for free and charged only the rich. As a result, he was appointed Governor by President Roxas with Congressman Villarin's recommendation when the position became vacant.Bishop Juan P. Quijano http://www.bishopjuan.org Inspired by the admiration of the people he then pursued to widen his political endeavors and ran for governor in his province Misamis Occidental  He won a landslide victory and became the youngest governor.  He served four terms as governor, appointed in 1946, elected in 1947, 1951, and 1959, during a time of progress and growth.Post, R. (1977, December 22).  "Former governor of Philippines".

When he tried to run for another term against a wealthy opponent Henry Regalado who was also supported by a millionaire shipping liner owner Congressman William Chiongbian,Sidel, John Thayer.

And lacking of funds he was forced to finance his political campaign by mortgaging his house. He was defeated and was offered a position under the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos. But he declined because he did not want to betray his faithful supporters by working under the opposite political party affiliation.  Although Gedeon had befriended Marcos, during Marcos’s term as Congressman and Senator, he spoke against him as President.  Fearing prosecution Gedeon and Eugenia left the Philippines.Post, R. (1977, December 22).  "Former governor of Philippines".  Salisbury Post, North Carolina, p.1. They first lived in Virginia for a year and worked in the State Hospital, but he decided to move to Salisbury, North Carolina and accepted a job offer as a physiatrist at the Veteran’s Administration Hospital.Post, R. (1977, December 22).  "Former governor of Philippines".  Salisbury Post, North Carolina, p.1.
Meanwhile in the Philippines, rumors widely spread that President Ferdinand Marcos would declare martial law. Out of fear, Gedeon advised his children to emigrate to the U.S. before martial law was declared in 1972. He pleaded to the U.S. President and U.S. State Department for his daughter and family to be approved for immigration.[ref]Central Foreign Policy Files

(1971) Ramon Magsaysay: a political biography.  He was the youngest governor of the province, one of the youngest serving governors in the Philippines, and one of longest serving governors.  Gedeon was also a member of the Freemasons.
