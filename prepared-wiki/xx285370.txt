Stella McNicol (1956 - 1996) was a musician from Toronto, (Canada).

==Career==

McNicol was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1956. At the age of four years she began her music studies, focusing especially on the piano, under the guidance of her mother. A few years later, developing her artistic talent, McNicol started singing in a choir and acting in theaters in Canada and America. At the same time, and as a complementary activity, Stella debuted as a model.
Stella's vocal abilities captured the attention of Rudy La Scala, a Venezuelan singer-songwriter and record producer. Together, they travelled to Rome, where they met with several record label producers.
Her debut album, "Que Nota!"http://www.rudylascala.com/productions.php?album_id=24/ was recorded between September and December 1980 at Phase One Studios (Toronto) and released in 1981 under label Love Records. The single Que Nota! became an instant success in Venezuela.
McNicol wrote lyrics while La Scala wrote the music. The drummer was Pentti "Whitey" Glan, who worked very closely with Alice Cooper for seven years and Bette Midler in "The Rose (film)"
McNicol also co-wrote several songs for Los Chamos and the Mexican singer Arturo Vazquez.
McNicol probably was killed by her boyfriend in 1996 at the age of 40; he was charged with second degree murder.http://www.owjn.org/archive/gender2.htm
