The rifle is available in several versions (American, Varmint, Lux, Scout, Silhouette, Style, and FS) and calibers (.22 Long Rifle, .22 WMR, .17 HMR, and .17 HM2) and is imported into the United States by CZ-USA.

==Versions==

===American===

The CZ 452 American features a more "American" appearance, with a straight-combed Turkish walnut stock.  The barrel is 22½" long, and the rifle is not equipped with open sights. The top of the receiver is machined with a 3/8"-wide dovetail groove for mounting a telescopic sight. A left-handed version is also manufactured.
A 16" barrel version is also available with a threaded muzzle (European standard 1/2" x 20 threads per inch (TPI)) for attaching sound suppressors.  Adapters to allow the attachment of 1/2" x 28 TPI suppressors made in the U.S. are available from several manufacturers.
The American has a blued finish on most metal surfaces.

===Varmint===

The Varmint is the heavy-barrel version of the American, featuring a 21" heavy barrel without open sights, and 11 mm (.22 Long Rifle versions) or 3/8" (.17 HMR versions) dovetail grooves for telescopic sight mounting.  The straight stock is Turkish walnut with a heavier forend to support the barrel.

===Lux and Trainer===

The Lux is equipped with a 24.8" (630 mm) barrel in the .22 caliber model, walnut European-style stock with curved comb which is often referred to as a "hogback" stock.  The lower comb design aids shooting with iron sights.  All Lux models come with a tangent sight marked in 25 meter increments and adjustable for windage and elevation.  The elevation can also be fine-tune adjusted on the front sight blade by loosening a setscrew and sliding the blade up or down.  A left hand version is also manufactured.
The "Trainer" is identical to the Lux except for a beechwood stock instead of the walnut used on the Lux. Note that earlier Lux and Trainer rifles had sights calibrated to 200 meters. Recent rifles are fitted with the 300 meter sight tang.

===Ultra Lux===

The "Ultra Lux" is similar to the Lux/Trainer models but has a 28.6" (727 mm) barrel, a beechwood stock with a raised cheek swell and a ten-round detachable magazine.CZ USA 2007 catalog  The tangent sight is calibrated from 25 to 300 meters.

===Scout===

The Scout is a compact rifle intended for young shooters, with reduced stock dimensions, reduced weight, and a single-round loading device. The reduced stock dimensions and weight also make it suitable for smaller adults.  The single-round loading device helps teach ammunition conservation and marksmanship.  It has a shortened beechwood stock with a straight, slightly dropped comb, and a blued metal finish.  It also uses buckhorn sights.

===Silhouette===

The "Silhouette" was designed for small-bore metallic silhouette shooting competitions, and to meet the requirements of the IMSSA. It is essentially a CZ American action and barrel in a synthetic stock with a raised comb.  Blued metal finish.
