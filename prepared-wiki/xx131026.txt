The route is [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] in length.
Highway 244 is also known as Wildwood Road, Mahtomedi Avenue, and Dellwood Avenue at various points throughout its route.  The route is located in Washington County.

==Route description==

Highway 244 serves as a northâ€“south route between the communities of Mahtomedi, Willernie, and Dellwood.  The route forms an arc around the east side of White Bear Lake.
The road runs primarily through a heavily wooded, residential area. That, combined with hilly terrain and numerous curves, results in a 30-35 MPH speed limit for most of its length. It becomes 45 MPH after the junction with Washington County Road 12, and lowers to 40 MPH when it reaches the commercial area at its southern terminus with Highway 120 and Ramsey County Road 15.
The route is legally defined as Route 244 in the Minnesota Statutes.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=161.115 |title=161.115, Additional Trunk Highways |work=Minnesota Statutes |publisher=Office of the Revisor of Statutes, State of Minnesota |year=2010 |accessdate=December 27, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Highway 244 was authorized on July 1, 1949. The route had been paved prior to it becoming a state highway.
At one time, Highway 244 had continued farther west from its present day junction with Highway 120 at the White Bear Lake / Mahtomedi boundary line.  Before 2002, the route had continued west of Highway 120 on present day Ramsey County Road 15 (the south edge of the city of White Bear Lake) until reaching Highway 61 at the Vadnais Heights / Gem Lake boundary line.  Highway 244 had previously formed an arc around both the south and east sides of White Bear Lake.
The state began turning the route over to Washington and Ramsey counties in 2001, which was expected to be finalized in 2009.[tpl]Riner|route=244|access date=May 7, 2010[/tpl]
The 2001 Minnesota Legislature approved removal of Route 244 from the state trunk highway system.  The portion within Ramsey County was, and still is, also known as County Road E.  In 2002, the Ramsey County portion was officially transferred to the county[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/stateaid/juris.html#Minnesota%20Highway%20244%20and%20120 |title=Jurisdictional Transfers |publisher=Minnesota Department of Transportation |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl] and the State Highway 244 signs were removed and it was re-signed as Ramsey County Road 15 (County E).
As of 2010, the section of 244 within Washington County is still labeled as State Highway 244, but is still expected to be re-signed to county highway numbers.  As of 2010, Highway 244 still appears on the official state highway map as a state highway within Washington County.
