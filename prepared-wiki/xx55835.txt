[[File:Seven-flue Stack 1834 .png|thumb|320px|alt=This illustration from the Mechanics' Magazine 582 of Saturday August 4, 1834 shows a theoretical cross section of a seven flue stack in a four storey house with cellars. It is designed to the show the contrast between mechanical sweeping and children sweeping chimneys. It is interesting as it shows how the flues from fireplaces at different floors and at different places in the rooms are bent and gathered together into a common stack with the seven pots neatly alongside each other:

* A- is a hearth served by vertical flue, a horizontal flue, and then a vertical rise having two right-angled bends that were difficult for brushes.

* B- is a long straight flue (14in by 9in) being climbed by a boy using back elbows and knees.

* C- is a short flue from a second floor hearth. The climbing boy has reached the chimney pot, which has a diameter too small for him to exit that way.

* E- shows a disaster. The climbing boy is stuck in the flue, his knees jammed against his chin.

* G- How a flue could be straightened to make it sweepable by mechanical means

* H- A dead climbing boy, suffocated in a fall of soot that accumulated at the cant of the flue.]]
The climbing boys, and sometimes girls,[tpl]Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=347[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=19[/tpl] were technically called chimney sweeps apprentices, and were apprenticed to a master sweep, who being an adult, was too large to fit into a chimney or flue. He would be paid by the parish to teach orphans or paupers the craft. They were totally reliant on him - they or their guardians had signed Papers of Indenture, in front of a magistrate, which bound them to him until they were adults. It was the duty of the Poor Law guardians to apprentice as many children of the workhouse in their care as possible, so as to reduce costs to the parish. The master sweep had duties: to teach the craft and its mysteries, to provide the apprentice with a second suit of clothes, to have him cleaned once a week, allow him to attend church, and not send him up chimneys that were on fire. An apprentice agreed to obey his master.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=12[/tpl] Once his seven-year-long apprenticeship was completed he would become a journeyman sweep, and would continue to work for a master sweep of his choice. Other apprentices were sold on to the sweep, or sold by their parents. Prices ranged from 7Â shillings [tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=21[/tpl] to 4 guineas.
It was generally agreed that six was a good age to train a boy.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=14[/tpl] Though Lord Shaftesbury once encountered one of the age of four, they were considered to be too weak. A master sweep would have many apprentices, they would start the morning by roaming the streets calling out  "Soot -Oh, Sweep" or another cry to let the house-owners know they were around - this would remind the owners of the dangers of un-swept chimneys. When engaged, the master sweep would fix a cloth over the fireplace, and the climbing boy would take off his boots and any excess clothes, then get behind it. The flue would be as tall as the house and twist several times, and its dimensions would be 14in by 9in. He would pull his cap down over his face and hold a large flat brush over his head, and wedge his body diagonally in the flue.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=18[/tpl] Using his back, elbows and knees, he would shimmy up the flue in the manner of a caterpillar and use the brush to dislodge loose soot, which would fall over him and down to the bottom, and a scraper to chip away the solid bits, as a smooth chimney was a safe chimney. Having reached the top he would slide back down at speed back to the floor and the soot pile. It was now his job to bag up the soot and carry it back to the master sweep's cart or yard.
Soot was valuable and could be sold for 9d a bushel in 1840.[tpl]Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=353[/tpl] An apprentice would do four or five chimneys a day. When they first started they scraped their knees and elbows, so the master would harden up their skin by  standing them close to a hot fire and rubbing in strong brine using a brush. This was done each evening until the skin hardened. The boys got no wages but lived with the master who fed them. They slept together on the floor or in the cellar under the sacks and the cloth used during the day to catch the soot. This was known as "sleeping black". The boy would be washed by the mistress in a tub in the yard, this may happen as often as once a week, but rarely did. One sweep used to wash down his boys in the Serpentine.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=71,72[/tpl] Another Nottingham sweep insisted they washed three times a year, for Christmas, Whitsun and the Goose Fair. Sometimes, a boy would need to be persuaded to climb faster or higher up the chimney, and the master sweep would either light a small fire of straw or a brimstone candle, to encourage him to try harder. Another method which also helped stop them from "going off" was to send another boy up behind him to prick pins into the soles of his feet or buttocks.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=13[/tpl]
Chimneys varied in size. The common flue was designed to be one and a half bricks long by one brick wide, though the often narrowed to one brick square, that is [tpl]convert|9|in|mm[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|9|in|mm[/tpl] or less.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=16[/tpl] Often the chimney would still be hot from the fire, occasionally it would actually be on fire.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=27[/tpl] Careless climbing boys could get stuck with their knees jammed against their chins. The harder they struggled the tighter they became wedged. They could remain in this position for many hours until they were pushed out from below or pulled out with a rope. If their struggling caused a fall of soot they would suffocate. Dead or alive the boy had to be removed and this would be done by removing bricks from the side of the chimney.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=26[/tpl] If the chimney was particularly narrow the boys would be told to "buff it", that is to do it naked,[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=71[/tpl] otherwise they just wore trousers, and a shirt made from thick rough cotton cloth.

===Health and Safety Concerns===

The conditions to which these children were subjected caused concern and societies were set up to promote mechanical means for sweeping chimneys and it is through their pamphlets that we have a better idea of what the job could entail. Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:
 
 After passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace  the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing  cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner's Jury returns a verdict of 'Accidental Death.' "[tpl]Harvnb|Waldron|1983|p=391[/tpl]

These however were not the only occupational hazards that chimney sweeps suffered. In the 1817 report to Parliament witnesses reported that climbing boys suffered from general neglect, In addition they exhibited stunted growth and deformity of the spine, legs and arms, that, in the 1810s, was put down to being required to remain in abnormal positions for long periods of time before their bones had hardened.. The knees and ankle joints were the most affected. Sores and inflammation of the eyelids that could lead to loss of sight, were slow in healing because the boy kept rubbing them. Bruises and burns were obvious hazards of having to work in an overheated environment. Cancer of the scrotum was only found in Chimneys sweeps so was referred to as Chimney Sweep Cancer in the teaching hospitals. Asthma and inflammation of the chest was attributed to the fact that the boys were out in all weathers,[tpl]Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=350[/tpl]
Chimney sweeps cancer which the sweeps called  soot wart didn't occur until the sweep was in his late teens or twenties. It has now been identified as a manifestation of scrotal squamous cell carcinoma. It was reported in 1775 by Sir Percival Pott in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It is the first industrially related cancer to be found.. Potts described it:
 
 It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges.....in no great length of time it pervades the skin, dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges(sic), hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.

He also comments on the life of the boys:
 
 The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard...they are treated with great brutality.. they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies,(sic) where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.
The carcinogen was thought to be coal tar possibly containing some arsenic.[tpl]cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Robert A.|title=Skin Cancer:  Recognition and Management|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|edition=3|page=55|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X6CMGuQmQi4C&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=mule+spinners%27+cancer+squamous+cell+carcinoma.#v=onepage&q=mule%20spinners%27%20cancer%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma.&f=false|accessdate=2011-05-02|isbn=978-0-470-69563-0[/tpl]
There were many deaths caused by accidents, frequently caused by the boy becoming jammed in the flue of a heated chimney, where they could suffocate or be burned to death. Sometimes a second boy would be sent to help, and on occasions would suffer the same fate.[tpl]Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=351[/tpl]

===Regulation===

In 1788, the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788: An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/work.htm|title= Key dates in Working Conditions, Factory Acts (Great Britain 1300 - 1899)|accessdate=19 March 2012[/tpl] It introduced the Apprenticeship Cap badge.  The Act had been partially inspired by the interest in climbing boys shown by Jonas Hanway, and his two publications The State of Chimney Sweepers'Young Apprentices (1773) and later  Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with the abolition of slavery in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to Edinburgh Scotland where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself pulling bundles of rags up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys which did not lead to future employment.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=37[/tpl] Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The Lords removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before civil registration, there was no way that anyone could check if a child was actually eight.
In the same year, David Porter, a humane master sweep, sent a petition to Parliament, and in 1792 published Considerations of the Present State of Chimney Sweepers with some Observations on the Act of Parliament intended for their Relief and Regulation. Though concerned for the boys' welfare he believed that boys were more efficient than any of the new mechanical cleaning machines. In 1796 a society was formed for Bettering the Conditions of the Poor, and they encouraged the reading of Hanway's and Porter's tracts. They had influential members and royal patronage from George III.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=43[/tpl] A Friendly Society for the Protection and Education of Chimney-Sweepers' Boys had been established in 1800.(The Times 16 April 1800, Page 1, Column b.)
In 1803, it was thought by some that a mechanical brush could replace a climbing boy (the Human brush), and members of the 1796 society formed  The London Society for the Superseding the Necessity for Employing Climbing Boys, They ascertained that children had now cleaned flues as small as 7in by 7in, and promoted a competition for a mechanical brush. The prize was claimed by George Smart, for what in effect, was a brush head on a long segmented cane, made rigid by an adjustable cord that passed though the canes.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=44[/tpl]
The Chimney Sweepers Act 1834 contained many of the needed regulations. It stated that an apprentice must express himself in front of a magistrate that he was willing and desirous. Masters must not take on boys under the age of fourteen. The master could only have six apprentices and an apprentice could not be lent to another master. Boys under fourteen who were already apprenticed, must wear brass cap badges on a leather cap. Apprentices were not allowed to climb flues to extinguish fires. Street cries were regulated.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=65[/tpl] The act was resisted by the master sweeps, and the general public believed that property would be at risk if the flues were not cleaned by a climbing boy.
Also that year building regulations relating to the construction of chimneys were changed.
The Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840 made it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to sweep chimneys. It was widely ignored. Attempts were made in 1852 and 1853 to reopen the issue, another enquiry was convened and more evidence was taken. There was no bill.  The Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864, c37. tightened controls significantly, by authorising fines and imprisonment for master sweeps who were ignoring the law, giving the police the power of arrest on suspicion and authorising Board of Trade inspections of new and remodelled chimneys. Lord Shaftesbury was a main proponent of the Bill.
In February 1875 a twelve-year-old boy, George Brewster, was sent up the Fulbourn Hospital chimneys by his master, William Wyer. He stuck and smothered. The entire wall had to be pulled down to get him out and although he was still alive, he died shortly afterwards. There was a Coronerâs Inquest which returned a verdict of manslaughter.  Wyer was sentenced to six monthsâ imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Shaftesbury seized on the incident to press his campaign again. He wrote a series of letters to The Times and in September 1875 pushed another Bill through Parliament which finally stopped the practice of sending boys up chimneys.The Story of a Mental Hospital:Fulbourn, 1858-1983, David H. Clark[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=31[/tpl]
A Chimney Sweepers Act was passed in 1875 that required chimney sweepers  to be authorised by the police to carry on their businesses in the district, thus providing the legal means to enforce all previous legislation.

==United States==

The history of sweeping in the United States varies little from that in the United Kingdom. Differences arise from the nature of housing and the political pressures. Early settler houses were built close together out of wood, so when one burnt it spread quickly to neighbouring properties. This caused the authorities to regulate the design of flues. From an early date, fire wardens and inspectors were appointed.
Sweeping of the wide flues of these low buildings was often done by the householder himself, using a ladder to pass a wide brush down the chimney. In a narrow flue, a bag of bricks and brushwood would be dropped down the chimney. But in longer flues climbing boys were used, complete with the UK tradition of coercion and persuasion using burning straw and pins in the feet and the buttocks.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=90[/tpl]  Sweeping was not a popular trade. During the eighteenth century the employment of Negro men and boys spread from the south to the north. Negro sweeps were not popular, and were thought to be inefficient and their shoddy work responsible for many fires. It was claimed that there were fewer fires in London where chimneys were swept by white boys than in New York. As in the UK, Smart's sweeping machine was available in the US shortly after 1803, but few were used. Unlike the UK, there were no societies formed to advocate the climbing boys' lot. The one novel produced in the states in 1854, championed the cause of 'Tit', a London climbing boy, contrasting his fate with the good conditions experienced by a Negro slave, 'Tat'. Descriptions gleaned of the boys' working conditions differ in one respect: the masters hired the sweep boys "from their owners".[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=93[/tpl]

==Sweeps Festivals==

The London boys had one day's holiday a year, the first of May, (Mayday) International Labour Day. They celebrated by parading through the streets, dancing and twisting with Jack in the Green, merging several folk traditions.[tpl]Harvnb|Mayhew|1861|p=370[/tpl] There is also a Sweeps Festival in Santa Maria Maggiore,Museo Spazzacamino in Italy and in Rochester in KentRochester Sweeps Festival where the tradition was revived in 1980.

==Good luck omen==

==Literature==

Chimney sweeps were often depicted in Victorian literature as heartless scoundrels who abused their child workers. They are typified in The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley. The English poet William Blake portrayed the chimney sweep as an abused child who hoped for a better life. In both "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience", Blake showcases the life of a common sweeper and exposes those who allowed barbaric actions against them to take place.  In Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist a particularly vicious chimney sweep called Gamfield wants to take Oliver as an apprentice, but at the last minute the magistrate refuses to sanction the move ("Mr Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already." )[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|pp=119â122[/tpl]
In "The Shepherdess and the Sweep" (1845), a fairy tale by the Danish poet and writer Hans Christian Andersen, a porcelain chimney sweep sits upon a table top near his love, a porcelain shepherdess. When the two are threatened, the chimney sweep gallantly conducts his love safely to the rooftop through the stove pipe.[tpl]Harvnb|Strange|1982|p=132[/tpl]
In Michael Crichton's novel The Great Train Robbery, Clean Willy Williams was an accessory to the gold heist. An apprentice chimney sweep who later became a "snakesman" (a burglar adept at climbing and wriggling through small spaces), he uses his skills to escape from Newgate Prison and to gain access to the railway office where important keys are stored.
With the development of the newer brush system and the end of child labour, the occupation changed its image to one of agile and good natured men, the chief example being in the book series Mary Poppins by P.L. Travers and the Walt Disney film adaptation which has an extended dance sequence in which the jovial workers celebrate the end of the workday with fearless acrobatics.  Their leader, "Bert", played by Dick van Dyke, sings "Chim Chim Cher-ee" which won the Oscar for "Best Song" in 1965. The chorus refers to the traditional association of chimney sweeps with good luck: "Good luck will rub off when I shake 'ands with you, or blow me a kiss ... and that's lucky too".
The novel Die schwarzen BrÃ¼der ("The Black Brothers"), written in 1941 in Switzerland by the Jewish author Kurt Held but published under the name of his wife Lisa Tetzner, depicts the life of climbing boys in northern Italy in the 19th century. It has been recreated in manga as Romeo's Blue Skies.
Barbara Vine's novel The Chimney Sweeper's Boy has as a central plot device a moth of that name, more formally identified as Epichnopterix plumella, which represents the main character's transformation and identity.

==Today==

Today, chimney sweeps are still operating, as venting systems for coal, heating oil, natural gas, wood and pellet burning appliances need to be maintained. There is a greater understanding of the dangers of flue deposits and carbon monoxide and gases from combustion. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuums, cameras and special chimney cleaning tools). Most sweeps are done from the bottom of the chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris.
Most modern chimney sweeps are professionals, and are usually trained to diagnose and repair hazards along with maintenance such as removal of flammable creosote, firebox and damper repair, and smoke chamber repair.  Some sweeps also offer more complicated repairs such as flue repair and relining, crown repair, and tuckpointing or rebuilding of masonry chimneys.
In the US, the two trade organisations that help to regulate the industry are the Chimney Safety Institute of America and The National Chimney Sweep Guild. Certification for chimney sweeps are issued by two organisations: Certified Chimney Professionals and The Chimney Safety Institute of America. Certification for chimney sweeps who reline chimneys are issued by Certified Chimney Professionals.
In the UK, four trade associations that help to regulate the industry are the National Association of Chimney Sweeps, the Guild of Master Chimney Sweeps The Institute Of Chimney Sweeps and the Association of Professional Independent Chimney Sweeps
