Daniel "Danny" Kass (born September 21, 1982) is an American professional snowboarder.
Kass was born in Pompton Plains section of Pequannock Township, New Jersey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20060209nbc01 |title=NBC OLYMPICS AND "APPRENTICE" ANNOUNCE FIRST-EVER ONLINE VOTING TO CAST FOR APPRENTICE SIX |publisher=NBC |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2008[/tpl] He grew up in New Jersey where he began snowboarding at the age of twelve.  His home slopes are what are now known as Hidden Valley and Mountain Creek ski resorts both located in the mountains of Vernon Township and Highland Lakes. After several years of shredding around the Mid-Atlantic States, Kass entered into the Okemo Mountain School to focus more of his time on riding some of the better pipe and park in the East. In 2001, Danny broke out into what has become one of the most successful contest streaks in snowboarding with four US Open Championships, seven Winter X Games medals and two Olympic silver medals.
During the winter of 2006, Kass fought his way back from a slow start in the US Grand Prix Circuit to qualify for the Olympics in Torino for the second time in a row. And just like in 2002, Kass took home another silver medal with back to back 1080s and his signature smooth style.
Kass and his brother Matt Kass were the founders of Grenade Gloves, which specializes in snowboarding gloves, accessories, and other extreme sporting gear.
Kass is one of the stars of The Adventures of Danny and The Dingo on Fuel TV.
