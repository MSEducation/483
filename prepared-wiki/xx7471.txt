Macau ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|aʊ|[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|t=澳門|s=澳门|p=Àomén|first=t[/tpl]), also spelled Macao, is one of the two Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, the other being Hong Kong. Macau lies on the western side of the Pearl River Delta across from Hong Kong to the east, bordered by Guangdong Province to the north and facing the South China Sea to the east and south.Macau Yearbook 2007, 475. The territory's economy is heavily dependent on gambling and tourism, but also includes manufacturing. The Cantonese people from Hong Kong and Guangdong, especially recent mainland tourism from Mandarin-speaking regions, have boosted the economy of Macau significantly.
A former Portuguese colony, Macau was administered by Portugal from the mid-16th century until late 1999, when it was the last remaining European colony in Asia.Fung, 5.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/566301.stm |title=Macau and the end of empire |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 1999[/tpl] Portuguese traders first settled in Macau in the 1550s. In 1557, Macau was rented to Portugal by the Chinese empire as a trading port. The Portuguese administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until 1887, when Macau became a colony of the Portuguese empire. Sovereignty over Macau was transferred back to China on 20 December 1999. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of Macau stipulate that Macau operate with a high degree of autonomy until at least 2049, fifty years after the transfer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.umac.mo/basiclaw/english/main.html |title=Content of Basic Law of Macau |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=University of Macau[/tpl] By 2002, it had become one of the world's richest cities.Macau has become known as the 'Las Vegas of the Far East'.

Under the policy of "one country, two systems", the PRC's Central People's Government is responsible for the territory's defense and foreign affairs, while Macau maintains its own legal system, police force, monetary system, customs policy, and immigration policy. Macau participates in many international organizations and events that do not require members to possess national sovereignty.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/88/23/dc/en/ |title=Joint declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and The Government of the Republic of Portugal on the question of Macau |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=GPB Govt of Macau[/tpl]
According to The World Factbook, Macau has the second highest life expectancy in the world. In addition, Macau is one of the very few regions in Asia with a "very high Human Development Index", ranking 23rd or 24th in the world in 2007 (with Japan being the highest in Asia; the other Asian countries/regions within the "very high HDI" category are South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Brunei).

==Etymology==

Before the Portuguese settlement in the mid-16th century, Macau was known as Haojing ([tpl]lang|zh-hant|濠鏡[/tpl], literally "Oyster Mirror") or Jinghai ([tpl]lang|zh-hant|鏡海[/tpl], literally "Mirror Sea").Macau Yearbook 2007, 517. The name Macau is thought to be derived from the A-Ma Temple ([tpl]zh|t=媽閣廟 |p=Māgé Miào |j=Maa1 Gok3 Miu6|links=no[/tpl]), a temple built in 1448 dedicated to Matsu – the goddess of seafarers and fishermen. It is said that when the Portuguese sailors landed at the coast just outside the temple and asked the name of the place, the natives replied "[tpl]lang|zh-hant|媽閣[/tpl]" ([tpl]zh|p=Māgé|j=Maa1 Gok3|links=no[/tpl]). The Portuguese then named the peninsula "Macau".Fung, 298. The present Chinese name ([tpl]zh|t=澳門 |p=Àomén |j=Ou3 Mun4 |links=no[/tpl]) means "Inlet Gates".

==History==

The history of Macau is traced back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), when the region now called Macau came under the jurisdiction of Panyu county, in Nanhai prefecture (present day Guangdong). The first recorded inhabitants of the area were people seeking refuge in Macau from invading Mongols during the Southern Song dynasty.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/44907.htm |title=The entry "Macau history" in Macau Encyclopedia |accessdate=2 January 2008 |publisher=Macau Foundation |language=Chinese |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013210914/http://macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/44907.htm  |archivedate=13 October 2007[/tpl] Under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), fishermen migrated to Macau from Guangdong and Fujian provinces.
Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century.Chan, 3–4. In 1513, Jorge Álvares became the first Portuguese to land in China. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though not the right to stay onshore.Fung, 5–6. Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water;Fung, 7. they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van. In 1557, the Portuguese established a permanent settlement in Macau, paying an annual rent of 500 taels (18.9 kilograms[tpl]\[/tpl]41.6 pounds) of silver. The Portuguese continued to pay an annual tribute up to 1863 in order to stay in Macau.
By 1564, Portugal commanded western trade with India, Japan, and China. But their pride was shocked by the indifference with which the Chinese treated them. The senate of Macau once complained to the viceroy of Goa of the contempt with which the Chinese authorities treated them, confessing however that "it was owing more to the Portuguese themselves than to the Chinese". In 1631 the Chinese restricted Portuguese commerce in China to the port of Macau.[ref]

During the 17th century, some 5,000 slaves lived in Macau, in addition to 2,000 Portuguese and 20,000 Chinese.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nPyg0evI8ykC&pg=PA32 |title=The Survival of Empire: Portuguese Trade and Society in China and the South China Sea 1630–1754|year=2004 |author=George Bryan Souza|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=reprint|isbn=0-521-53135-7 |page=32 |pages= |quote=soldiers 5000 slaves 20000 Chinese 1643 2000 moradores (Portuguese inhabitants) 1644 40000 total inhabitants 1648 Jesuits record[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oCx0D0iE2QoC&pg=PA323 |title=Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas |year=1996 |author=Stephen Adolphe Wurm|author2=Peter Mühlhäusler|author3=Darrell T.

As more Portuguese settled in Macau to engage in trade, they made demands for self-administration; but this was not achieved until the 1840s.Historical figures of Macau, by CCTV. In 1576, Pope Gregory XIII established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/11502.htm |title=The entry "Catholic" in Macau Encyclopedia |publisher=Macau Foundation |accessdate=6 January 2008 |language=Chinese |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224173753/http://www.macaudata.com/macauweb/Encyclopedia/html/11502.htm  |archivedate=24 December 2007[/tpl] In 1583, the Portuguese in Macau were permitted to form a Senate to handle various issues concerning their social and economic affairs under strict supervision of the Chinese authority, by CCTV. but there was no transfer of sovereignty.
Macau prospered as a port but it was the target of repeated failed attemptsHistory of the Qing (清史稿) by the Dutch to conquer it in the 17th century. On June 24, 1622, the Dutch attacked Macau in the Battle of Macau, in the hope of turning it into a Dutch possession. The Portuguese repulsed their attack and the Dutch never tried to conquer Macau again. The majority of the defenders were African slaves, with only a few Portuguese soldiers and priests. Captain Kornelis Reyerszoon was commander of the 800 Dutch strong invasion force.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nsh8NHDQHlcC&pg=PA238 |title=Slavery and South Asian history |volume= |year=2006 |editor1=Indrani Chatterjee|editor2=Richard Maxwell Eaton |publisher=Indiana University Press |edition=illustrated |location= |isbn=0-253-21873-X |page=238 |pages= |quote=Portuguese,"he concluded;"The Portuguese beat us off from Macau with their slaves."10 The same year as the Dutch ... an English witness recorded that the Portuguese defense was conducted primarily by their African slaves [/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vWLRxJEU49EC&pg=PA544 |title=Middle East and Africa |volume= |year=1996 |author= |editor= |publisher=Taylor & Francis |edition= |location= |isbn=1-884964-04-4 |page=544 |pages= |quote=A miscellaneous assemblage of Portuguese soldiers, citizens, African slaves, friars, and Jesuits managed to withstand the attack.

Following the Opium War (1839–42), Portugal occupied Taipa and Coloane in 1851 and 1864 respectively. On 1 December 1887, the Qing and Portuguese governments signed the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce, under which China ceded the right of "perpetual occupation and government of Macau by Portugal" in compliance with the statements of the Protocol of Lisbon. In return, Macau Government would cooperate with Hong Kong's smuggle of Indian opium and China would be able to increase profits through customs taxes. Portugal was also obliged "never to alienate Macau without previous agreement with China", therefore ensuring that negotiation between Portugal and France (regarding a possible exchange of Macau and Portuguese Guinea with the French Congo) or with other countries would not go forward – so that the British commercial interests would be secured; Macau officially became a territory under Portuguese administration.
In 1928, after the Qing dynasty had been overthrown following the Xinhai Revolution, the Kuomintang (KMT) government officially notified Portugal that it was abrogating the Treaty of Amity and Commerce;Macau Yearbook 2007, 518. the two powers signed a new Sino-Portuguese Friendship and Trade Treaty in place of the abrogated treaty. Making only a few provisions concerning tariff principles and matters relating to business affairs, the new treaty did not alter the sovereignty of Macau and Portuguese government of Macau remained unchanged.Fung, 409–410.
During the Second World War, unlike Portuguese Timor which was occupied by the Japanese in 1942 along with Dutch Timor, the Japanese respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau, but only up to a point. As such, Macau enjoyed a brief period of economic prosperity as the only neutral port in South China, after the Japanese had occupied Guangzhou (Canton) and Hong Kong. In August 1943, Japanese troops seized the British steamer Sian in Macau and killed about 20 guards. The next month they demanded the installation of Japanese "advisors" under the alternative of military occupation. The result was that a virtual Japanese protectorate was created over Macau.
When it was discovered that neutral Macau was planning to sell aviation fuel to Japan, aircraft from the [tpl]USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6[/tpl] bombed and strafed the hangar of the Naval Aviation Centre on 16 January 1945 to destroy the fuel. American air raids on targets in Macau were also made on 25 February and 11 June 1945.  Following Portuguese government protest, in 1950 the United States paid US$20,255,952 to the government of Portugal.p.116 Garrett, Richard J.

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Beijing government declared the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce invalid as an "unequal treaty" imposed by foreigners on China. However, Beijing was not ready to settle the treaty question, leaving the maintenance of "the status quo" until a more appropriate time.Fung, 410–411.
Influenced by the Cultural Revolution in mainland China and by general dissatisfaction with Portuguese government, riots broke out in Macau in 1966.

Shortly after the overthrow of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974 in Lisbon, the new Portuguese government determined it would relinquish all its overseas possessions. In 1976, Lisbon redefined Macau as a "Chinese territory under Portuguese administration" and granted it a large measure of administrative, financial, and economic autonomy. Three years later, Portugal and China agreed to regard Macau as "a Chinese territory under (temporary) Portuguese administration".Fung, 418. The Chinese and Portuguese governments commenced negotiations on the question of Macau in June 1986. The two signed a Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration the next year, making Macau a special administrative region (SAR) of China.Fung, 424. The Chinese government assumed formal sovereignty over Macau on 20 December 1999.Macau Yearbook 2007, 519–520. The economy since then has continued to prosper with the sustained growth of tourism from mainland China and the construction of new casinos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/macau/economy|title=Macau: Economy|accessdate=18 January 2014|publisher=Michigan State University[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20131023D23HH259.htm|title=Macau Casinos Thrive As Landscape Shifts|accessdate=18 January 2014|publisher=Nikkei Asian Review[/tpl]

==Government and politics==

The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, Macau's constitution promulgated by China's National People's Congress in 1993, specify that Macau's social and economic system, lifestyle, rights, and freedoms are to remain unchanged for at least 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1999. Under the principle of "one country, two systems", Macau enjoys a high degree of autonomy in all areas except in defence and foreign affairs. Macau officials, rather than PRC officials, run Macau through the exercise of separate executive, legislative, and judicial powers, as well as the right to final adjudication.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/1999/leibasica/index_uk.asp#c2 |title=Basic Law of Macau Chapter II: Relationship between the Central Authorities and the Macau Special Administrative Region |accessdate=3 January 2008 |publisher=Government Printing Bureau[/tpl] Macau maintains its own separate currency, customs territory, immigration and border controls, and police force.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/1999/leibasica/index_uk.asp#c5 |title=Basic Law of Macau Chapter V: The Economy |accessdate=3 January 2008 |publisher=Government Printing Bureau[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/1999/leibasica/index_uk.asp#c7 |title=Basic Law of Macau Chapter VII: External Affairs |accessdate=3 January 2008 |publisher=Government Printing Bureau[/tpl]

===Executive===

The government in Macau is headed by the chief executive, who is appointed by the central government upon the recommendation of an election committee, whose three hundred members are nominated by corporate and community bodies. The recommendation is made by an election within the committee.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/2004/14/lei03_en.asp#c4a32 |title=Election of the Chief Executive |accessdate=5 September 2006 |publisher=Government Printing Bureau[/tpl] The chief executive's cabinet is made up of five policy secretaries and is advised by the Executive Council that has between seven and eleven members.[tpl]cite book |year=2007 |title=Macau 2007 Yearbook |publisher=Government Information Bureau of Macau SAR |isbn=978-99937-56-09-5[/tpl] Edmund Ho Hau Wah, a community leader and former banker, was the first chief executive of the Macau SAR, replacing General Vasco Rocha Vieira at midnight on 20 December 1999.

===Judiciary===

The original framework of the legal system, based largely on Portuguese law or Portuguese civil law system, was preserved after 1999. The territory has its own independent judicial system with a high court. Judges are selected by a committee and appointed by the chief executive. Foreign judges may serve on the courts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.mo/eng/law/4judicialSystem.html |title=Brief Introduction of Judicial System of Macau SAR |accessdate=5 September 2006 |author=Sam Hou Fai |publisher=UNESCO |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060430035340/http://www.unesco.org.mo/eng/law/4judicialSystem.html |archivedate=30 April 2006[/tpl]

===Military===

Under Portuguese rule, Macau often served as an expeditionary base to Japan and other regions of East Asia from the 16th century onwards, while maintaining a strong garrison mainly to repel Dutch and mainland Chinese attacks. However since the allied British settled Hong Kong, the need for a strong military presence in Macau dimmed and it became limited before ceasing in 1974. However despite no Portuguese garrison was left on the territory, a small security force managed by the local PSP was kept, which proved useful with the escalading triad warfare tensions towards the last decades of Portuguese administration. Also the Capitania dos Portos kept operating a coast guard and the Portuguese airforce kept airfields active until the opening of Macau International Airport in the mid-1990s. In 1999, upon handover to the PRC, a substantial garrison of the People's Liberation Army was established in the city helping deliver the last blow to the violence perpetrated by the triads, who were weakened by police action and arrests prior to the handover. The garrison remains, with a large portion of the forces stationed in neighbouring Zhuhai as well.

==Geography==

Macau is situated [tpl]convert|60|km|mi|0[/tpl] southwest of Hong Kong and [tpl]convert|145|km|mi|0[/tpl] from Guangzhou. It also has [tpl]convert|41|km|mi|0[/tpl] of coastline, yet only [tpl]convert|310|m|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl] of land border with Guangdong.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-overview/macau-geography.html |title=Macau Geography |accessdate=6 January 2008 |publisher=AsiaRooms.com[/tpl] It consists of the Macau Peninsula itself and the islands of Taipa and Coloane, which are now connected by landfill forming the Cotai Strip. The peninsula is formed by the Zhu Jiang (Pearl River) estuary on the east and the Xi Jiang (West River) on the west. It borders the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone in mainland China. The main border crossing between Macau and China is known as the Portas do Cerco (Barrier Gate) on the Macau side, and the Gongbei Port of Entry on the Zhuhai side.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsgd.com/citiesandtowns/zhuhai/news/200603030050.htm |title=Zhuhai Gongbei Checkpoint Opens Earlier |accessdate=6 January 2008 |author=Yan |publisher=New Guangdong newsgd[/tpl]
Macau Peninsula was originally an island, but a connecting sandbar gradually turned into a narrow isthmus, thus changing Macau into a peninsula. Land reclamation in the 17th century transformed Macau into a peninsula with generally flat terrain, though numerous steep hills still mark the original land mass. Alto de Coloane is the highest point in Macau, with an altitude of [tpl]convert|170.6|m|ft|1[/tpl]. With a dense urban environment, Macau has no arable land, pastures, forest, or woodland.

Located on China's southern coast, Macau has ample rainfall, with average annual precipitation being [tpl]convert|2120|mm|in|0[/tpl]. However, winter is mostly dry due to the influence of the vast Siberian High affecting much of East Asia. Autumn in Macau, from October to November, is sunny and still pleasantly warm with low humidity. Winter (December to early March) is generally mild with temperature above [tpl]convert|13|°C|0[/tpl] most of the time, although it could also drop to below [tpl]convert|8|°C|0[/tpl] at times. Humidity starts to increase from late March. Summer is very warm to hot (often rising above [tpl]convert|30|°C|0[/tpl] at daytime). The hot weather is often followed by heavy rain, thunderstorms and occasional typhoons.

==Economy==

Macau's economy is based largely on tourism. Other chief economic activities in Macau are export-geared textile and garment manufacturing, banking and other financial services.Chan, 12–13. The clothing industry has provided about three quarters of export earnings, and the gaming, tourism and hospitality industry is estimated to contribute more than 50% of Macau's GDP, and 70% of Macau government revenue.
Macau is a founding member of the WTO and has maintained sound economic and trade relations with more than 120 countries and regions, with European Union and Portuguese-speaking countries in particular; Macau is also a member of the IMF.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mc.html |title=CIA the world factbook |accessdate=15 November 2007 |publisher=CIA the World Factbook – Macau[/tpl] The World Bank classifies Macau as a high income economy[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/servlets/ECR?contentMDK=20421402&sitePK=239419#High_income High Income Group |title=Income Group – High Income, World Bank |accessdate=15 November 2007 |publisher=World Bank[/tpl] and the GDP per capita of the region in 2006 was US$28,436. After the Handover in 1999, there has been a rapid rise in the number of mainland visitors due to China's easing of travel restrictions. Together with the liberalization of Macau's gaming industry in 2001 that induces significant investment inflows, the average growth rate of the economy between 2001 and 2006 was approximately 13.1% annually.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amcm.gov.mo/economic_statistics/economic.htm |title=Economic statistics from Monetary Authority of Macau |publisher=AMCM |accessdate=23 December 2007[/tpl]

Starting in 1962, the gambling industry had been operated under a government-issued monopoly license by Stanley Ho's Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau.

In 2002, the Macau government ended the monopoly system and six casino operating concessions and subconcessions are granted to Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands, Galaxy Entertainment Group, the partnership of MGM Mirage and Pansy Ho (daughter of Stanley Ho), and the partnership of Melco and Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). Today, there are 16 casinos operated by the STDM, and they are still crucial in the casino industry in Macau, but in 2004, the opening of the Sands Macau ushered in the new era.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200112/16/eng20011216_86803.shtml |title=Monopoly on Macau's Gambling Industry to End |accessdate=25 February 2008 |work=People's Daily[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/30/content_353166.htm |title=Gambling empire bets on rebranding |accessdate=25 February 2008 |work=China Daily [/tpl] Gambling revenue has made Macau the world's top casino market, surpassing Las Vegas.World Class Casino

As prescribed by the Macau Basic Law, the government follows the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strives to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross domestic product. All the financial revenues of the Macau Special Administrative Region shall be managed and controlled by the Region itself and shall not be handed over to the Central People's Government.

==Monetary system==

In Macau, the unit of currency is the pataca which is currently pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a rate of HK$1 = MOP1.03. The name pataca is a Portuguese word which was applied to the Mexican dollars that were the main circulating coin in the wider region in the second half of the 19th century. In 1894, the pataca was introduced in both Macau and Portuguese Timor as a unit of account for the Mexican dollar and the other silver dollar coins in circulation. In 1901, it was decided to grant the Banco Nacional Ultramarino the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas, and in the year 1906, these notes went into circulation at an official equivalent rate of 2 shillings and 4 pence sterling, and all foreign coins were outlawed. However, the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, and as such, the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. In 1935, when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, whereas the pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling. From 1945 to 1951, fractional coins of the pataca were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor; and, in 1952, similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual pataca coin for the first time.

==Demographics==

Macau is the most densely populated region in the world, with a population density of 20,497 persons per square kilometre in 2013[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2013_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2013 Country Ranks, By Rank, Source: Calculated from the Total Population and Total Area figures reported by the CIA World Factbook 2013 |accessdate=10 Jyly 2013 |publisher=Countries of the World [/tpl] (18,428 persons/km2 in a 2004 projection 47,728/sq mi).[tpl]cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpp |title=United Nations World Population Prospects (2004 revision) |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=UN Statistics Division |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071216015214/http://esa.un.org/unpp  |archivedate=16 December 2007[/tpl] 95% of Macau's population is Chinese; another 2% is of Portuguese and/or mixed Chinese/Portuguese descent, an ethnic group often referred to as Macanese. According to the 2006 by-census, 47% of the residents were born in mainland China, of whom 74.1% were born in Guangdong and 15.2% in Fujian. Meanwhile, 42.5% of the residents were born in Macau, and those born in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Portugal shared 3.7%, 2.0% and 0.3% respectively.
The growth of population in Macau mainly relies on immigrants from mainland China and the influx of overseas workers since its birth rate is one of the lowest in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2054rank.html |title=Rank Order – Birth rate |accessdate=10 May 2007 |publisher=CIA|work=The World Factbook[/tpl] According to The World Factbook, Macau has the second highest life expectancy in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=Life expectancy at birth |publisher=CIA |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] while its infant mortality rate ranks among the lowest in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=Rank Order – Infant mortality rate |accessdate=10 May 2007 |publisher=CIA|work=The World Factbook[/tpl]
Macau's official languages are Chinese (Cantonese) and Portuguese. Macau still retains its own dialect of Portuguese, called Macanese Portuguese. Other languages such as Mandarin, English, and Hokkien are spoken by local communities.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mc.html |title=Macau Overview |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=CIA – The World Factbook[/tpl] The Macanese language, a distinctive creole generally known as Patuá, is still spoken by several dozen Macanese.[tpl]cite book |title=Maquista Chapado: Vocabulary and Expressions in Macau's Portuguese Creole |last=Fernandes |first=Senna |year=2004 |publisher=Miguel de and Alan Baxter |location=Macau |isbn= [/tpl]
Most Chinese in Macau are profoundly influenced by their own tradition and culture, of which most take part in Chinese folk religion, of which the faiths of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism, form an integral part. Macau has a sizable Christian community; Roman Catholics and Protestants constitute 7% and 2% of the population respectively. In addition, 17% of the population follow original Mahayana Buddhism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/7066.htm |title=Background Note: Macau Profile |accessdate=7 January 2008 |publisher=U.S. State Department[/tpl]
Since Macau has an economy driven by tourism, 14.6% of the workforce is employed in restaurants and hotels, and 10.3% in the gambling industry. With the opening of several casino resorts and other major constructions underway, many sectors reportedly experience a shortage of labor, and the government seeks to import labor from neighboring regions.
The number of imported workers stood at a record high of 98,505 in the second quarter of 2008, representing more than 25% of the labor force in Macau.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dsec.gov.mo/index.asp?src=/english/indicator/e_piem_indicator.html |title=Principal statistical indicators |accessdate=27 December 2007 |publisher=Statistics and Census Service (DSEC) of the Macau Government[/tpl] Some local workers complain about the lack of jobs due to the influx of cheap imported labor. Some also claim that the problem of illegal labor is severe.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6611245.stm |title=Rare Macau protest turns violent |accessdate=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News – Business | date=1 May 2007[/tpl] Another concern is the widening of income inequality in the region. Macau's Gini coefficient, a popular measure of income inequality where a low value indicates a more equal income distribution, rose from 0.43 in 1998 to 0.48 in 2006. It is higher than those of neighboring regions, such as mainland China (0.447), South Korea (0.316) and Singapore (0.425).

==Education==

A fifteen-year free education is currently being offered to residents, that includes a three-year kindergarten, followed by a six-year primary education and a six-year secondary education. The literacy rate of the territory is 93.5%. The illiterates are mainly among the senior residents aged 65 or above; the younger generation, for example the population aged 15–29, has a literacy rate of above 99%. Currently, there is only one school in Macau where Portuguese is the medium of instruction.
Macau does not have its own universal education system; non-tertiary schools follow either the British, the Chinese, or the Portuguese education system. There are currently 10 tertiary educational institutions in the region, four of them being public. In 2006, the Programme for International Student Assessment, a worldwide test of 15-year-old schoolchildren's scholastic performance coordinated by OECD, ranked Macau as the fifth and sixth in science and problem solving respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/2/0,3343,en_32252351_32236191_39718850_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=PISA 2006 Science Competencies for Tomorrow's World |accessdate=10 January 2008[/tpl] Nevertheless, education levels in Macau are low among high income regions. According to the 2006 by-census, among the resident population aged 14 and above, only 51.8% has a secondary education and 12.6% has a tertiary education.
As prescribed by the Basic Law of Macau Chapter VI Article 121, the Government of Macau shall, on its own, formulate policies on education, including policies regarding the educational system and its administration, the language of instruction, the allocation of funds, the examination system, the recognition of educational qualifications and the system of academic awards so as to promote educational development. The government shall also in accordance with law, gradually institute a compulsory education system. Community organizations and individuals may, in accordance with law, run educational undertakings of various kinds.

==Health care==

Macau is served by one major public hospital, the Hospital Conde S. Januário, and one major private hospital, the Hospital Kiang Wu, both located in Macau Peninsula, as well as a university hospital called Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital in Cotai. In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in traditional Chinese medicine is also available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gcs.gov.mo/files/spage/CFA10_E.html |title=Macau Factsheet |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR[/tpl]
Currently none of the Macau hospitals are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain their education and qualification elsewhere. Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the Kiang Wu Nursing College.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ipm.edu.mo/ess/ |title=Macau Polytechnic Institute General Information |accessdate=3 December 2007 |publisher=Macau Polytechnic Institute[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kwnc.edu.mo/web/cmain.htm |title=Homepage of the College of Nursing and Midwifery |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=College of Nursing and Midwifery, Macau[/tpl] Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau.
The Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organizations in the area of public health, and assure the health of citizens through specialized and primary health care services, as well as disease prevention and health promotion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/introduction/e_introduce_fs.htm |title=The introduction of Health Bureau, Macau SAR |accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR [/tpl] The Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the blood transfusion centre in Macau. It also handles the organization of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private health care providers, and issues licences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/organization/e_legis_fs.htm |title=The policy and functions of the department of health, Macau SAR |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR[/tpl]

==Transport==

In Macau, traffic drives on the left, unlike in either mainland China or Portugal, but like neighbouring Hong Kong. Macau has a well-established public transport network connecting the Macau Peninsula, Cotai, Taipa Island and Coloane Island. Buses and taxis are the major modes of public transport in Macau. Currently three companies[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Transmac, Transportas Companhia de Macau and Reolian Public Transport Co.[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]operate franchised public bus services in Macau.Macau Yearbook 2007, 453–454. The trishaw, a hybrid of the tricycle and the rickshaw, is also available, though it is mainly for sightseeing purposes. The newest public bus operator, Reolian Public Transport Co., entered service on 1 August 2011. This new bus operator operates on the existing routes by Transmac and Transportas Companhia de Macau.
The Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal and the Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal provides cross-border transportation services for passengers travelling between Macau and Hong Kong, while the Yuet Tung Terminal in the Inner Harbour serves those travelling between Macau and cities in mainland China, including Shekou and Shenzhen.Macau Yearbook 2007,458.
Macau has one active international airport, known as Macau International Airport located at the eastern end of Taipa and neighbouring waters. The airport used to serve as one of the main transit hubs for passengers travelling between mainland China and Taiwan, but now with the introduction of direct flights between those two regions, passenger traffic in this regard has lessened.Chan, 58.Fung, 198. It is the primary hub for Air Macau. In 2006, the airport handled about 5 million passengers.Macau Yearbook 2007, 467–468.

==Culture==

The mixing of the Chinese and Portuguese cultures and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the Macau Grand Prix in November,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/app/home/mgpc/en |title=Grand Prix Macau |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=Macau Grand Prix Committee[/tpl] when the main streets in Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the Monaco Grand Prix. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.
The Lunar Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/macau/macau-festivals-&-events/index.html |title=Macau Festivals & Events |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=AsiaRooms.com[/tpl] The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February. The Procession of the Passion of Our Lord is a well-known Roman Catholic rite and journey, which travels from Saint Austin's Church to the Cathedral, also taking place in February.
A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess Matsu, is in full swing in April with many worshippers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In Coloane Village, the Taoist god Tam Kong is also honoured on the same day. Dragon Boat festival is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with Winter Solstice in December.
Macau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. The Historic Centre of Macau, which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a World Heritage Site UNESCO on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Durban, South Africa.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/135 |title=Mostar, Macau and Biblical vestiges in Israel are among the 17 cultural sites inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List |accessdate=5 September 2006 |publisher=UNESCO[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

Local cooking in Macau consists of a blend of Cantonese and Portuguese cuisines. Many unique dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used in an attempt to replicate European dishes. Its ingredients and seasonings include those from Europe, South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as local Chinese ingredients.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thisisthelife.com/en/macanese-cuisine.htm |title=Macanese Cuisine |accessdate=4 January 2008 |publisher=thisisthelife.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223080418/http://www.thisisthelife.com/en/macanese-cuisine.htm |archivedate = 23 December 2007[/tpl] Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices and flavours including turmeric, coconut milk, cinnamon and bacalhau, giving special aromas and tastes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arscives.com/bladesign/macau.discovered.htm |title=Discovering Macau – fabulous food spice route and early fusion cuisine |accessdate=7 June 2007 |publisher=Discovery.com [/tpl] Famous dishes include Minchi, Capella, Galinha à Portuguesa, Galinha à Africana (African chicken), Bacalhau, Macanese Chili Shrimps and stir-fry curry crab.
