Lochgoilhead ([tpl]lang-gd|'Ceann Loch Goibhle'[/tpl]) is a small village of some 300-400 people in the Scottish Highlands in Argyll, Scotland.
The main employment spheres include tourism, agriculture (mainly sheep farming), and forestry. There are two outdoor education centres in the village, The Lochgoilhead National Activity Centre and Ardroy Outdoor Education Centre. Tourism more than doubles the village population during the summer months. Two single-track roads both lead in and out of the village. It has a Post Office, village store, a medical and dental practice, two hotels, two pubs, and an inn. 
BBC News correspondent Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in The Gaza Strip by Palestinian militants, spent many years in Lochgoilhead in his youth. The highlands above the village were used for the scene in the 1963 James Bond film From Russia with Love in which Bond (played by Sean Connery) eliminated two villains in a helicopter by firing gunshots at them.From Russia with Love (1963) - Filming locations The 1985 Scottish movie Restless Natives also used Lochgoilhead to film a chase scene, as well as some roads just outside the village.
