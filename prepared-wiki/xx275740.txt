==Background==

Each year, local Cub and Boy Scouts leave plastic bags for their neighbors soliciting canned food items. One week later, the Scouts return to pick up and deliver the bags of food to a local food bank.
Or the Boy/Cub Scouts will stand outside major food retailers (with permission) soliciting donations from shoppers. The donations will usually be delivered directly to the local food bank that day.
