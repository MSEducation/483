==Mission and purpose==

Job Corps' mission is to "help young people ages 16 through 24 improve the quality of their lives through vocational and academic training."http://www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps.aspx

==History==

Job Corps was initiated as the central program of the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty, part of his domestic agenda known as the Great Society. Sargent Shriver, the first Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, modeled the program on the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Established in the 1930s as an emergency relief program, the CCC provided room, board, and employment to thousands of unemployed young people. Though the CCC was discontinued after World War II, Job Corps built on many of its methods and strategies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl][tpl]Or|date=November 2009[/tpl]

Applicants to the Job Corps program are identified and screened for eligibility by organizations contracted by the U.S. Department of Labor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps/program_admin.aspx |title=Program Administration |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010[/tpl] Each student in the Job Corps goes through four stages of the program:http://jobcorps.gov/cdss.aspx
Outreach and Admissions (OA): This is the stage at which students visit admissions counselors and gather information, as well as prepare for and leave for their Job Corps Centers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/cdss/OA.aspx |title=How Job Corps Works: Outreach and Admissions |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010[/tpl] Transportation is provided to and from the centers by Job Corps.
Career Preparation Period (CPP): This stage focuses on the assimilation of the student into the center, academic testing, health screening, and instruction on resume building and job search skills. Students are instructed on computer literacy, employability, and center life. This phase lasts for the first 30 days on center.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/cdss/CPP.aspx |title=How Job Corps Works: Career Preparation Period |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010[/tpl]
Career Development Period (CDP): This period is where the student receives all vocational training, drivers' education, academic instruction, and preparation for life outside of Job Corps, i.e. a repeat of CPP with an actual job search.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jobcorps.gov/cdss/CDP.aspx |title=How Job Corps Works: Career Development Period |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Job Corps |accessdate=January 6, 2010[/tpl]
