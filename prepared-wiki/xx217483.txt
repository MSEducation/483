When 9th District Congressman Bob Kasten vacated his seat to run for governor in 1978, Sensenbrenner ran in the election to succeed him, defeating his primary opponent, Susan Engeleiter, by 589 votes with a plurality of 43%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387741 |title=WI District 9 - R Primary Race - Sep 12, 1978 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl]Goldman, T.R., "The Man With The Iron Gavel", Legal Times May 2, 2005 He was elected in November 1978 with 61%,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=53770 |title=WI District 9 Race - Nov 07, 1978 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl] and has been reelected 16 more times with no substantive opposition, sometimes running unopposed.

In fact, his worst two re-elections were in 2004, when he defeated UW-Milwaukee professor Bryan Kennedy with 67% of the vote,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4415 |title=WI - District 05 Race - Nov 02, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl] and in 2006 defeated him in a rematch with 62%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207759 |title=WI - District 05 Race - Nov 07, 2006 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl]

===Tenure===

In 1998, Sensenbrenner had an important role in the impeachment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, acting as one of the House managers.
Sensenbrenner introduced the USA PATRIOT Act to the House on October 23, 2001. He did not write the act; the primary author was Assistant Attorney General of the United States Viet Dinh. Nevertheless, Sensenbrenner has been recognized as "one of the architects of the Patriot Act."Granick, Jennifer and Sprigman, Christopher (2013-06-27) The Criminal N.S.A., The New York Times  In November 2004, Sensenbrenner and California Congressman Duncan Hunter objected to provisions of a bill that, among other things, created a Director of National Intelligence, a key recommendation of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 Commission.
In 2005, Sensenbrenner authored the Real ID Act, which requires additional scrutiny of citizenship before issuing drivers' licenses and set forth certain requirements for state driver's licenses to make it more difficult for terrorists and criminals to alter their identity by counterfeiting documents. He attached the controversial act as a rider on military spending bill HR418. Subsequently, it was passed by the Senate without debate.Barrett, Ted. CNN"House, Senate agree on $82 billion war spending bill" In March 2005, Sensenbrenner sided firmly with the parents and siblings in the Terri Schiavo case, who fought unsuccessfully in federal court and the House to block her husband's decision to allow the withdrawal of her feeding tube.
On June 17, 2005, Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, abruptly ended a meeting where Republicans and Democrats were supposed to be debating the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act and walked out in response to Democratic members raising issues regarding human rights violations at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and the ongoing Iraq war. He ordered the court reporter to halt transcriptions of the proceedings, C-SPAN cameras covering the meeting be shut off, and that discussion on the issue be halted. Sensenbrenner defended his actions by claiming that the Democrats and witnesses had repeatedly violated House rules in discussing issues he believed to be unrelated to the subject of the meeting.United States House Committee on the Judiciary press release "Sensenbrenner Floor Statement Regarding Question of Personal Privilege", June 16, 2005 His abrupt walkout was contrary to House parliamentary procedure, which is to adjourn either on motion or without objection. Political journalist Matt Taibbi described the incident in a profile of the 109th Congress published around October 2006: "Last year, Sensenbrenner became apoplectic when Democrats who wanted to hold a hearing on the Patriot Act invoked a little-known rule that required him to let them have one. "Naturally, he scheduled it for something like 9 a.m. on a Friday when Congress wasn't in session, hoping that no one would show," recalls a Democratic staffer who attended the hearing. "But we got a pretty good turnout anyway." Sensenbrenner kept trying to gavel the hearing to a close, but Democrats again pointed to the rules, which said they had a certain amount of time to examine their witnesses. When they refused to stop the proceedings, the chairman did something unprecedented: He simply picked up his gavel and walked out. "He was like a kid at the playground," the staffer says. And just in case anyone missed the point, Sensenbrenner shut off the lights and cut the microphones on his way out of the room.  Commenting on Sensenbrenner's actions on The Daily Show, comedian Jon Stewart said, "Oh my God, he literally took his gavel and went home; we are officially being governed by children."
Sensenbrenner was the main sponsor of H.R. 4437, a bill passed by the House in 2005 that would provide additional criminal penalties for aiding and abetting illegal immigration to the United States."H.R. 4437: Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005", GovTrack.us
On September 8, 2005, Sensenbrenner voted against a bill to provide $50 billion in emergency aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina."H.R. 3673: Second Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to Meet Immediate Needs... (Vote On Passage)", GovTrack.us  The bill passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.
On December 16, 2005, Sensenbrenner introduced the Digital Transition Content Security Act. In 2006, it was reported that Sensenbrenner would help lead the effort to pass the Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2006, which is supported by large copyright holders and opposed by fair use activists.McCullagh, Declan. "Congress readies broad new digital copyright bill" CNET News.com, April 23, 2006
Sensenbrenner receives high marks from the National Taxpayers Union, a non-profit organization that supports low taxes."Representative Sensenbrenner — Interest Group Ratings", vote-smart.org
In 2006, Sensenbrenner joined with House Speaker Dennis Hastert in expressing outrage concerning the FBI raid of the congressional office of Democratic Representative William J. Jefferson, asserting constitutional concerns over separation of powers. He held Judiciary Committee hearings in May 2006 on this issue. Many Republican and conservative pundits, including Rush Limbaugh, took a dim view of this stance, and a June 1, 2006, ABC News poll found 86% of Americans supported the right of the FBI to search a congressional office when they obtain a warrant.
In fall 2006, The Animal Fighting Prohibition Act bill unanimously passed the Senate, but Sensenbrenner used his position to block final House consideration of the legislation, even though the bill had 324 co-sponsors. The act creates felony-level penalties for animal fighting activities. The Right to Life Act had hearings scheduled for December 12, 2006 at 10 am, but Sensenbrenner cancelled them right before the House adjourned on December 9 at 3:17am.judiciary.house.gov The purpose of H.R. 552 is to "implement equal protection ... for the right to life of each born and preborn human person." In the 109th Congress, the legislation collected 101 cosponsors.Right to Life Act 2005 list of cosponsors and text of bill, accessed October 30, 2006.
Sensenbrenner was the only Republican to join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Congressional delegation to meet the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India during the March 2008 protests against China by Tibetans.Pelosi meets with Dalai Lama, offers support for Tibet  While there he said, "In the US Congress, there is no division between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of protecting Tibetan culture and eliminating repression against Tibetans around the world".Pelosi urges world to condemn China
Sensenbrenner was named the 2006 "Man of the Year" by the conservative publication Human Events because of his opposition to open-borders immigration policies.Man of the Year: Jim Sensenbrenner - HUMAN EVENTS In contrast, in the same year he was rated the second-worst member of the House by  Rolling Stone, which dubbed him "the dictator".jsonline.com
In 2009, by a voice vote, the US Federal House approved H.R. 445, the Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2009,http://www.govtrack.us/­congress/­bill.xpd?bill=h111-445 [tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  authored by Sensenbrenner.

Sensenbrenner believes in criminal prosecution of broadcasters and cable operators who violate decency standards as opposed to the current FCC regulatory methods.Boliek, Brooks. "Sensenbrenner to cable execs: Indecency is criminal act" The Hollywood Reporter, April 5, 2005. In July 2012, Sensenbrenner advocated amending the Espionage Act of 1917 to enable the prosecution of journalists involved in publishing leaks of state secrets.[tpl]cite news | title = House may prosecute journalists for reporting leaked information | date = July 11, 2012 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0711/House-may-prosecute-journalists-for-reporting-leaked-information | work = The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate = July 14, 2012[/tpl]
In December 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Sensenbrenner referred to First Lady Michelle Obama’s “big butt” while talking to church members at a Christmas bazaar at St. Aidan's church in Hartford.[tpl]cite web|last=Bice|first=Daniel|title=Sensenbrenner apologizes to first lady over "big butt" remark|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/136060223.html|work=No Quarter Blog|publisher=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel Online|accessdate=December 23, 2011[/tpl] Church member Ann Marsh-Meigs told the newspaper that she heard Sensenbrenner’s remarks. She said the congressman was speaking about the first lady’s efforts to combat childhood obesity, and added, “And look at her big butt.” On December 22, Sensenbrenner’s press secretary said Sensenbrenner had sent Obama a personal note and released a statement saying he regretted his “inappropriate comment.” Sensenbrenner’s office would not release the text of the note.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1211/70788.html |title=Jim Sensenbrenner sorry for 'big butt' quip - Mackenzie Weinger |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl]
In June 2013, Sensenbrenner objected to the FBI and NSA's use of the PATRIOT Act to routinely collect phone records from millions of Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing. "The Bureau’s broad application for phone records was made under the so-called business records provision of the Act," he said. "I do not believe the broadly drafted FISA order is consistent with the requirements of the Patriot Act. Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.”[tpl]cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/303937-patriot-act-author-extremely-troubled-by-nsa-phone-tracking|title=Patriot Act author ‘extremely troubled’ by NSA phone tracking|publisher=The Hill|date=June 6, 2013|first=Justin|last=Sink[/tpl] He released a statement saying “While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have always worried about potential abuses.” He added: “Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.”[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/opinion/president-obamas-dragnet.html?src=me&ref=general&pagewanted=all|title=President Obama’s Dragnet|date=2013-06-06|accessdate=06-07-2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=337001|title=Author of Patriot Act: FBI’s FISA Order is Abuse of Patriot Act|date=2013-06-06|accessdate=06-07-2013[/tpl]
He had similar criticism of the PRISM program. Sensenbrenner said the Patriot Act, which he authored, while granting law enforcement increased surveillance powers to prevent terrorist incidents, did not authorize the PRISM program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/210884931.html|title=Sensenbrenner sees lawsuits stemming from surveillance|date=06-10-2013|accessdate=06-10-2013[/tpl] In an article he authored in the Guardian, he said, "This is well beyond what the Patriot Act allows."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/abuse-patriot-act-must-end|title=This abuse of the Patriot Act must end|date=06-09-2013|accessdate=06-11-2013[/tpl]
Sensenbrenner supported the Amash Amendment, a plan to defund the NSA's telephone surveillance program.  According to the New York Times, "Never, he said, did he intend to allow the wholesale vacuuming up of domestic phone records, nor did his legislation envision that data dragnets would go beyond specific targets of terrorism investigations".  The Amendment fell seven votes short of the number it needed to pass.[ref]

In October 2013, he introduced the USA Freedom Act in the House, a bill designed to curtail the powers of the NSA and end the NSA's dragnet phone data collection program. The bill is supported by various civil liberties advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-surveillance-review-intelligence-chiefs-testify |title=NSA faces sweeping surveillance review as intelligence chiefs face hostile house|publisher=TheGuardian.Com|date=2013-10-29|accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl]
Following the death of Nelson Mandela, on December 6, 2013, Sensenbrenner spoke to a group of supporters at a Brookfield restaurant and objected to the executive proclamation by President Barack Obama to lower the flags to half-staff to honor Mandela.  He stated it was his belief that the American flag should only be flown at half-staff for Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/235420511.html|publisher=Journal Sentinal, Inc|last=Bice|first=Daniel|title=Rep.
