The Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel is an automobile tunnel under the Suez Canal.  It has two lanes of traffic, one in each direction, and connects the Asian Sinai Peninsula to the town of Suez on the African mainland. 

==Construction==

It was originally constructed as a shield tunnel by the Tarmac Construction in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/download.cfm/docid/98AFA0DC-B9EC-48EF-B5328E5CBB270CDB|title=From the Suez Canal to the A9|publisher=Highway Engineer|date=November 1981|accessdate=4 June 2012[/tpl] In 1992, the Japanese government granted aid to a project aimed at rehabilitating the tunnel which had developed leaks. It is 1.63 km long and has an outside diameter of 11.6 m.

==Significant developments in the region==

The tunnel was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the Suez Canal, including other projects such as  the Suez Canal overhead line crossing (completed in 1998), the El Ferdan Railway Bridge, and the Suez Canal Bridge (completed in 2001).
