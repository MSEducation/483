==Penrith Panthers==

Wallace made his NRL debut at Canberra Stadium against the Canberra Raiders in Round 17 of the 2005 season.Player Profile: Peter Wallace, Herald Sun. In Round 3, 2007, against the Brisbane Broncos, Wallace kicked a 44-metre field goal in golden point, with Penrith winning 29â€“28.[tpl]cite news|last=Walter|first=Brad|url=http://www.leaguehq.com.au/news/lhqmatchreport/wallaces-44m-wobbler/2007/03/30/1174761757830.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=31 March 2007|title=Wallace's 44m wobbler|accessdate=25 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Wallace was the subject of controversy when he was dropped to NSWRL Premier League in Round 15 of the NRL competition in 2007. Penrith coach Matthew Elliott moved Wallace to the premier league on what he claimed to be poor form. However Wallace had earned a man of the match award only two weeks before, but had a poor game the week later. The controversy came when claims were made that Wallace was dropped due to the fact that he had signed with the Broncos, but team-mate Joel Clinton, who was also Broncos bound, wasn't dropped. There were rumours from the media, that Wallace wanted out of the Penrith Panthers to go to Brisbane mid-season. Wallace denied these claims, and wanted to fulfill his contract with the Panthers, even if it was in premier league.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
It remains unclear how the move to the Broncos came about.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23384293-23214,00.html|title=Wallace forced to leave Panthers|publisher=Fox Sports|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=17 March 2008[/tpl]

==Brisbane Broncos==

Wallace's career at the Broncos started in 2008. He guided his new club to a first round defeat of his old club, the Panthers, before picking up consecutive "Man of The Match" awards in his next two matches, also wins for Brisbane. Wallace performed very strongly while Darren Lockyer was injured and provided much needed stability in the Broncos halves and a good kicking game.
Wallace was selected for the City vs Country Origin match in 2008. In May, 2008, Wallace was selected as halfback for New South Wales for game I of State of Origin on 21 May at ANZ Stadium. With his first touch of the ball, he made a line break. He also had a hand in two tries and placed a pin point accurate kick for Anthony Quinn to score the second try of the night. He made only one error and took many hits from Queensland players, making 29 tackles.
Wallace was selected for the Blues again in Game II (playing on his normal home ground) before he ruptured a testicle and missed Game III. After State of Origin ended Wallace was reunited with halves partner Darren Lockyer at the Broncos. Wallace's great form from the start of the season had slightly been lost but he still remains to be a future star and a great prospect for the Brisbane Broncos. On 15 July 2008, Wallace extended his contract with the Brisbane Broncos until 2012.
On 20 October 2008, Wallace was arrested after a scuffle with security at a pub in Mooloolaba, Queensland, where it was believed he was celebrating his 23rd birthday.Broncos' Wallace charged over pub scuffle, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 20 October 2008.
Under the "grandfather rule", Wallace was eligible to play for Scotland in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, but was unable to make the team due to treatment for injuries.Hadfield, Dave: Brough best in Super League but injury to Wallace severs Scotland partnership plan, The Independent, 10 September 2008.

In May 2009, he was named in the 17 man squad to represent New South Wales in the opening State of Origin match on 3 June 2009, in Melbourne.[tpl]cite news|last=Fitzgibbon|first=Liam|publisher=Fox Sports News (Australia)|title=NSW selectors go with form and not reputation for Origin opener |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25537374-5018993,00.html  |accessdate=30 May 2009|date=25 May 2009[/tpl]
Wallace was injured at the time of the Broncos' 2009 post-Origin slump and upon his return the club enjoyed its best winning streak in 5 years, reaching the finals. However in Brisbane's second play-off win Wallace broke his ankle, meaning he would miss the grand final qualifier.
