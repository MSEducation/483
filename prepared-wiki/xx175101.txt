The Landaluce Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually during the first part of July at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California. Open to two-year-old filles, it is contested over a distance of six furlongs on Cushion Track synthetic dirt.
Inaugurated in 1945 as the Hollywood Lassie Stakes, it was renamed in 1983 to honor Landaluce, the 1982 race winner and that year's American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly who died from a virus on December 11, 1982.
In 2004, the Landaluce Stakes lost its Grade III status.
