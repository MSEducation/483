The Rugby League European Federation (RLEF) is the umbrella body for nations playing the sport of rugby league football across Europe and the Northern Hemisphere.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rlef.eu.com/eurofed.php|publisher= Rugby League European Federation |title= Overview|author=RLEF|date=|accessdate=2009-06-30|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rma1sylj|archivedate=2010-08-06[/tpl] It supports the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The RLEF "oversees and co-ordinates the development of the sport in all its member countries and those neighbouring organisations that choose to link to the RLEF". The RLEF operates several competitions, most notably the European Cup.

==History==

The federation was founded January 2003 following an initiative between Richard Lewis, Executive Chairman of Britain's Rugby Football League (RFL) and his French counterpart Jean Paul Ferre. The RLEF's first constitution was approved in January 2004 and the federation's first Board of Directors was elected. This first Board of Directors consisted of Jean Paul Ferre as President/Chairman and Richard Lewis as Deputy Chairman with Nigel Wood and Nicolas Larrat being the other Board members. Representatives for Morocco, Italy, Serbia, Russia, Lebanon, Ireland, Scotland and Wales attended. Russia became a full member of the RLEF, joining Britain and France, and the RLIF soon after.
At the time of its foundation, the RLEF placed a "particular emphasis on generating development funding within each country". Historically, much of the development work conducted in Europe had been funded by the RFL.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/4076783/RFL-chief-executive-Nigel-Wood-backs-Super-League-to-flourish.html|publisher= Telegraph.co.uk|title= RFL chief executive Nigel Wood backs Super League to flourish |author=Michael Fisher |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rmac9POm|archivedate=2010-08-06[/tpl] Following the profitable 2008 World Cup, the RFL and RLEF prepared to bid for funds to enhance their activities.
In December 2009, Kevin Rudd, a former  Scotland rugby league international, stepped down as Executive Officer of the RLEF after more than five years in the post.[tpl]cite web|title=Euro development boss to step down|url=http://www.rugbyleague.com/rugby-league-news/euro-development-boss-to-step.html|publisher=rugbyleague.com|accessdate=2010-08-06|author=rugbyleague.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rmeyB66Z|archivedate=2010-08-06|date=2009-12-18[/tpl] RLEF Chairman Richard Lewis stated that Rudd "has done an outstanding job and created a platform, structure and competitions framework that can take us into the future". Rudd was succeeded by  Danny Kazandjian.[tpl]cite web|title=RLEF appoint new development exec |url=http://www.rugbyleague.com/rugby-league-news/rlef-appoint-new-development-exec.html|publisher=rugbyleague.com|accessdate=2010-08-06|author=rugbyleague.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rmfIjiHi|archivedate=2010-08-06|date=2010-05-21[/tpl] Kazandjian had previously been a key figure in the establishment of rugby league in Lebanon and had led the  RLEF's development drive in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions as Director of Development for the Euro-Med region.
