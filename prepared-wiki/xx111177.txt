==Activities==

Al Musawi returned to Lebanon in 1978. Along with Subhi al Tufayli he spearheaded the formation of Hezbollah movement in the Beqaa Valley in 1982, one of the three major areas of Shia population in Lebanon.Ranstorp, Magnus, Hizb'allah in Lebanon : The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis, New York, St. Martins Press, (1997), p.46  From 1983 to 1985 he is reported to have served as operational head of the Hezbollah Special Security Apparatus. From late 1985 until April 1988 he was head of Hezbollah's military wing, the Islamic Resistance.Foreign Report, 30 July 1987Ha'aretz, 2 October 1987al-Hayat, 27 November 1989Independent, 7 March 1990
According to some reports, al Musawi was responsible for the abduction of Lt. Col William Higgins while commander of Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance, (military wing).Jerusalem Post, 21 February 1988 and Ha'aretz, 28 February 1989
In 1991, The Hezbollah had entered a new era with the end of the both the Iran–Iraq War and Lebanese Civil War, the Taif Agreement and the release of the Kuwait 17 bombers. A new leader was thought to be needed to facilitate the release of the Western hostages held by Hezbollah and more importantly to shift Hezbollah's focus to resistance activity against Israel.
In May 1991, Hezbollah chose al Musawi as its secretary-general. As a former head of both the Security Apparatus (considered the instigator of hostage taking) and the military wing of Hezbollah, al Musawi was well qualified for this post.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah, (1997), p.105  Al Musawi replaced the non-flexible Sheikh Subhi al-Tufayli and promised Hezbollah would "wipe out every trace of Israel in Palestine." He described Israel as "the cancer of the Middle East." Al Musawi also promised to "intensify Hezbollah military, political and popular action in order to undermine the peace-talks." Middle East International, 8 November 1991 He did not support entering mainstream politics.[tpl]cite web|last=Simon|first=Kevin|title=Hezbollah: Terror in Context|url=http://digitalcommons.olin.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=ahs_capstone_2012&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dlebanese%2Bcivil%2Bwar%2Band%2Bpolitical%2Bpersonas%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22lebanese%20civil%20war%20political%20personas%22|publisher=Olin College of Engineering|accessdate=2 July 2012|year=2012[/tpl] Unlike other Hezbollah figures, he advocated the acceptance of Taif Agreement, which was the rejection of theocratic state in Lebanon.[tpl]cite journal|last=Staten|first=Cliff|title=From Terrorism to Legitimacy: Political Opportunity Structures and the Case of Hezbollah|journal=OJPCR: The Online Journal of Peace and Conflict Resolution|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=32–49|url=http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/8_1staten.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl]

On 16 February 1992, Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at the motorcade of al Musawi in southern Lebanon, killing al Musawi, his wife, his five-year-old son, and four others.[tpl]cite journal|last=Luft|first=Gal|title=The Logic of Israel's Targeted Killing|journal=The Middle East Quarterly|year=2003|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–13|url=http://www.meforum.org/515/the-logic-of-israels-targeted-killing|accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] Israel said the attack had been planned as an assassination attempt in retaliation for the kidnapping and death of missing Israeli servicemen in 1986 and abduction of US Marine and UN peace-keeping officer William R. Higgins in 1988.[tpl]cite book|last=Ranstorp |first=Magnus|title=Hizb'allah in Lebanon: The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis|location=New York|publisher=St. Martins Press|year=1997|page=107|isbn=0-312-16288-X[/tpl]
