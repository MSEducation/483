==Lines==

Notes:
 * The headway figure for line 1 takes into account the services on line 4.
Since the timetable change on 13 December 2009, there has been only one pair of line 4 trains each day via Krankenhaus. At other times, travellers to/from Krankenhaus must change to line 1 in Sundhausen.
The old line 3 linked the Huttenstraße with Hauptfriedhof with one intermediate stop, and was shut down on 30 June 1985.  From 1 June 1985 to 1991, a SEV line 3 led from the old Busbahnhof to Hauptfriedhof. Today, this route is operated on Monday to Saturday by city bus line F and the evening line, on Monday to Friday by city bus line E, and on Sundays by city bus line B.
The branch line in Waltershausen formerly belonging to line 4 (between Waltershausen Bahnhof und Waltershausen-Gleisdreieck) has operated since August 2007 as line 6.
