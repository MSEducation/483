==History==

In 1895, following their conquest by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan, the Kom Kafir people in Afghanistan were forced to convert to Islam. Every former Kafiristan Kafiri were renamed Nuristani (The Enlightened Ones) respectively Nuristan (Land of Light). In present time there are now known Nuristani Kom or simply Kom.
At the end of the 19th century, they were living in the lower part of the Bashgul Valley, known as Kam,Kamboj (George Scott Robertson), Kamdesh in Khowar, and Kamoz in Pashto, and in the adjacent valleys.
Numerous scholars have connected the names Kom and Kata with ancient Kamboja and identified the Kafirs, especially the Siah-Posh Kafirs, as having descended from ancient Kambojas[tpl]Citation needed|reason=There had been some authors mentioned in the previous version, however without the year of publication or literal sources in the list of references|date=January 2014[/tpl].
Though not a numerous people, the Kom were greatly respected military prowess by neighboring tribes as well as by Chitralis and the Pashtun people. The Kom control the destiny of Bashgul valley and were said to be its virtual kings (George Scott Roberston). The Kom were tributary to the Mehtar of Chitral until 1895.  
The political headquarters of the Kom of the Siah-Posh Kafir clan were at Kombrom. The country of the Koms is also in present-day Nuristan called Komstan.
