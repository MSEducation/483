==Programs==

===Visual arts program===

The Visual Arts program is a mix of contemporary, historical, group, monographic, thematic, and media-specific shows.  Certain artists have had their first major museum exposure in Walker exhibitions, among them Joseph Cornell, Frank Gehry, Julie Mehretu, Mario Merz, and Kara Walker. Chuck Close credits the museum and its then-director Martin Friedman for launching his career with the purchase of Big Self-PortraitChuck Close, Big Self-Portrait (1967-68) Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. (1967-1968) in 1969.Mary Abbe (June 5, 2012), Former Walker director Martin Friedman toasted in New York Star Tribune. In 1995, the museum displayed the YBA showcase Brilliant!.
The Permanent Collection is thoroughly integrated with the institution’s history. After 1958, exhibitions, commissions, and acquisitions were pursued at a much faster pace.  As a result, the collections—though they encompass the whole of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries—are strongest after 1960. Many of the works in the collection were exhibited, commissioned, or discovered during studio visits. Some relationships with artists—for example, Matthew Barney, Robert Gober, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Sherrie Levine, and Claes Oldenburg—have extended over many years and encompassed multiple projects, and the collection often reflects that commitment through deep holdings that follow the shifts and turns of a whole career. In recent years the Walker has begun collecting from groups who have remained outside the traditional artistic canon. These “alternative modernisms” include Japanese Gutai, Viennese Actionism, Italian Arte Povera, and Fluxus, all of which developed during the 1950s and 1960s. It currently has an exhibit of paintings by Marsden Hartley ("Roses") ("Maine Coastal Stillife"), some of which are part of the Walker's permanent collection. In its permanent collection there are also works by Cindy Sherman, Jeanne Dunning, Lucas Samaras ("Reconstruction"), Alex Katz, Charles Sheeler, and Siah Armajani. Kiki Smith donated a work in honor of Walker curator Siri Engberg.[tpl]cite web|title=Annual Report|url=http://www.walkerart.org/static/pdf/annual_report_2008.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Walker Art Center|year=2008|accessdate=May 4, 2013|page=55[/tpl]

===Performing arts===

The Walker began presenting local dance, poetry, and chamber music concerts in 1940. In 1953, the volunteer-staffed Center Arts Council (CAC) was formed to organize a wider range of performances and film screenings. Out of CAC grew the Center Opera Company (later the Minnesota Opera) in 1963, led by John Ludwig and dedicated primarily to contemporary American opera and unique collaborations between opera and visual artists. By the time it disbanded in 1970, the CAC had already presented Merce Cunningham's first Minnesota performance (1963) and established its first artist commission, Alwin Nikolais' Vaudeville of the Elements (1965). Performing Arts was officially designated as a department in 1970.
Throughout the 1970s, the department sponsored events in a range of venues around the Twin Cities, increasing the visibility of contemporary dance, new music, jazz, and experimental theater and hosting an array of pop, rock, and folk concerts. The Walker launched significant program initiatives and established key relationships with a range of artists now considered masters—Cunningham, Mabou Mines, Philip Glass, Twyla Tharp, Meredith Monk, and many others—that continue today. In 2011, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which has had "one of the longest and most fruitful associations with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company of any American museum", struck an agreement with the Cunningham Foundation to acquire as many as 150 of the art objects that have been central to the company’s dances, including sculptures, sets, costumes and other works by artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.Randy Kennedy (March 16, 2011), From the Backdrop to Their Own Stage New York Times.

===Film/video===

Widely recognized for presenting a full range of moving-image art forms,[tpl]According to whom|date=June 2011[/tpl] the Walker Art Center's film and video programs feature both contemporary and historical works. In the 1940s, the Walker identified moving images (mostly movies, but also experimental films) as integral to contemporary life. Artists of that time were experimenting with film’s formal properties, such as light, motion, and sound, while also separating film art from conventional narrative cinema.
In 1973, the Film/Video Department was officially formed and the Edmond R. Ruben Film and Video Study Collection was established, along with an endowment to fund the development of the archive. Ruben, a leading figure in film exhibition in the Upper Midwest, and his wife Evelyn believed in collecting films as a way of preserving the art form. Today, with more than eight hundred fifty titles, the Ruben Collection brings together classic and contemporary cinema as well as documentaries, avant-garde films, and video works by artists. It is distinctive[tpl]According to whom|date=June 2011[/tpl] for its holdings by visual artists that range from classics by Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, and Fernand Léger to extensive contemporary work by William Klein, Derek Jarman, Bruce Conner, Marcel Broodthaers, Matthew Barney, Nam June Paik, and leading experimental artists who challenged the form and content of film, such as Paul Sharits and Stan Brakhage.

===Design===

The Walker Art Center maintains a professional, in-house design and editorial department headed by Andrew Blauvelt to fulfill its various communication needs. The department is responsible for the design and editing of all printed materials, including the creation and planning of publications such as exhibition catalogues, bi-monthly magazines, and books, as well as exhibition and event graphics, signage programs, and promotional campaigns.
Additionally, the department organizes design-related projects and programs, such as lectures, exhibitions, and special commissions. Over the course of its 60-plus year history, the department has organized many important exhibitions on architecture and design, and has served as a vital forum for contemporary design issues, bringing hundreds of world-renowned architects, designers, and critics to the Twin Cities through programs such as the Insights design lecture series, which celebrated its 25th year in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/insights-2011-design-lecture-series-2 |title=Insights 2011 Design Lecture Series — Calendar — Walker Art Center |publisher=Walkerart.org |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl]

===New media===

The Walker’s New Media Initiatives group oversees mnartists.org, an online database of Minnesota artists and organizations that provides a digital gathering place for the local arts community. Through a partnership with the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Walker manages ArtsConnectEd,artsconnected.org an online resource for arts educators that draws from both institutions’ permanent collection resources.
In the early 1990s, the Walker developed äda'web, an early website dedicated to net art. It was curated by Benjamin Weil and designed by Vivian Selbo. äda'web's first official project went up in May 1995, although it had been informally active since February of the same year.[tpl]cite web |last=Weil |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.walkerart.org/gallery9/dasc/adaweb/weil.html |title=A Brief History of Äda'web |publisher=Walkerart.org[/tpl]

===Education and community programs===

Learning is emphasized as a core experience at the Walker through a mix of education programs, community building efforts, and interpretive projects. The department conducts community, family, interpretive, public, school, teen, and tour programs, as well as mnartists.org. Each division offers programs and activities in visual art, performing arts, film/video, new media, design, and architecture. To inform these undertakings, the staff work with Walker curators and partners from local organizations, artists, schools, and community groups. Advisory groups such as the Walker Art Center Teen Arts Council, Tour Guide Council, and the Parent Advisory Group are also implemented in the department for the Walker to further build relationships with its audience.

==Campus==

The Walker Art Center is on a 17 acre (69,000 m²) urban campus that includes both buildings and parks.Walker Art Center "Saatchi Gallery".  The north wing of the building opened in 1971 and was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. In 2005, an expansion designed by Herzog & de Meuron opened that doubled the size of the museum and added new galleries, a restaurant, and a 385-seat theater.
The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, a collaboration between the Walker and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, is a sculpture park on the north side of the Walker Campus.

==History==

Formally established in 1927, the Walker Art Center began as the first public art gallery in the Upper Midwest. The museum's focus on modern art began in the 1940s, when a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made possible the acquisition of works by important artists of the day, including sculptures by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, and others.
During the 1960s, the Walker organized increasingly ambitious exhibitions that circulated to museums in the United States and abroad.  The permanent collection expanded to reflect crucial examples of contemporary artistic developments.  Concurrently, Performing Arts, Film, and Education programs grew proportionately and gained their own national prominence throughout the next three decades.
Opened in April 2005, the new expansion nearly doubled the size of the Walker Art Center.  The expansion, designed by Herzog & de Meuron includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities, allowing for a better usage of resources from objects in the permanent collection to books in the library to an inside view of the artist's own creative process.
A key aspect of the design is a "town square," a sequence of spaces that draw people for informal conversation, interactive learning, and community programs.[ref]

==Management==

===Funding===

The Walker Art Center is supported in part by a grant provided by the Minnesota State Arts Board through an appropriation by the Minnesota Legislature from the State’s general fund and its arts and cultural heritage fund.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/support |title=Support - Walker Art Center |publisher=Walkerart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl] To ensure the Walker’s creative independence, then-director Kathy Halbreich forswore millions of dollars in potential state aid for the museum's $73.8 million expansion in 2005, a decision that resulted in a one-year salary freeze, some staff cuts, and the elimination of the Walker’s new-media art program.Carol Vogel (March 20, 2007), Influential Director Resigns at Minneapolis Art Center New York Times.
In 2011, the Walker Art Center reported net assets of $243 million. Its annual expenses were $22 million, and its endowment was at $152 million. The museum director's compensation is at around $375,000.Shane Ferro (July 25, 2012), As MOCA's Money Woes Simmer, A Look at How Major Museums' Finances Work ARTINFO.
