[[SMS language]]

CATEGORIES: Internet slang, Mobile phone culture, Online chat, Text messaging

SMS language or textese (also known as txt-speak, txtese, chatspeak, txt, txtspk, txtk, txto,  texting language, txt lingo, SMSish, txtslang,or txt talk) is a term for the abbreviations and slang commonly used with mobile phone text messaging, but sometimes used with other Internet-based communication such as email and instant messaging.
Three features of early mobile phone messaging encouraged users to use abbreviations: (a) Text entry was difficult, requiring multiple key presses on a small keypad to generate each letter; (b) Messages were limited to 160 characters, and (c) it made texting faster.
Once it became popular it took on a life of its own and was often used outside of its original context. At its peak, it was the cause of vigorous debate about its potentially detrimental effect on literacy, but with the advent of alphabetic keyboards on smartphones its use, and the controversies surrounding it, have receded.

==History==

SMS language is similar to that used by those sending telegraphs that charged by the word. It seeks to use the fewest number of letters to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments [tpl]cite web|author=Lily Huang |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/150449 |title=Newsweek.com |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl] 
in dealing with space, time and cost constraints of text messaging. This follows from how early SMS permitted only 160 characters and some carriers charge messages by the number of characters sent.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Short Message Service (SMS)|url=http://www.besttextmarketing.com/sms-marketing/history-of-short-message-service-sms/|work=Reviews and Ratings of SMS Marketing Services|publisher=Best Text Marketing|accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl]
It also shares some of these characteristics with Internet slang and Telex speak following from how its evolution is rather symbiotic to the evolution of use of shorthand in Internet chat rooms. Likewise, such a change sought to accommodate the small number of characters allowed per message, and to increase convenience for the time-consuming and often small keyboards on mobile phones. In addition, similarly elliptical styles of writing can be traced to the days of telegraphese 120 years back, where telegraph operators were reported to use abbreviations similar to those used in modern text when chatting amongst themselves in between sending of official messages.[tpl]cite web|last=Radnedge |first=Aidan |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/872560-stripped-down-text-speak-is-over-120-years-old-research-reveals |title=www.metro.co.uk |publisher=www.metro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl]
Nevertheless, the invention of mobile phone messaging is considered to be the source for the invention of SMS language. In general, SMS language thus permits the sender to type less and communicate more quickly than one could without such shortcuts. One example is the use of "tomoz" instead of "tomorrow". Nevertheless, there are no standard rules for the creation and use of SMS languages. Any word may be shortened (for example, "text" to "txt"). Words can also be combined with numbers to make them shorter (for example, "later" to "l8r"), using the numeral "8" for its homophonic quality.[tpl]cite journal|author=Beverly, Plester; Wood, Clare; Joshi, Puja|title=Exploring the relationship between children's knowledge of text message abbreviations and school literacy outcomes|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=23 March 2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=145–161|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/026151008X320507/abstract;jsessionid=7B8CBF22A3EB28F19B4982BC19505DD0.d03t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=|doi=10.1348/026151008X320507[/tpl]

===SMS language as a multilingual entity===

Some may view SMS language to be a nascent dialect of the English language, that is a dialect strongly if not completely derivative of the English language. This may not be so. Such generalization may have risen from the fact that mobile phones had only been able to support a limited number of default languages in the early stages of its conception and distribution.[tpl]cite journal|first=Mohammad Shirali-Shahreza|title=Multilingual SMS|journal=Idea Group Inc.|year=2007|series=Category: Mobile Phone|pages=666–668|url=http://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=17153[/tpl]
A mobile operating system (OS) such as Symbian and language packs enable the linguistic localization of products that are equipped with such interfaces, where the current Symbian release (Symbian Belle) supports the scripts  and orthographies of over 48 languages and dialects, though such provisions are by no means fully comprehensive as to the languages used by users all over the world. Researcher Mohammad Shirali-Shahreza (2007) further observes that mobile phone producers offer support "of local language of the country" within which their phone sets are to be distributed.
Nevertheless, various factors contribute as additional constraints to the use of non-English languages and scripts in SMS. This motivates the anglicization of such languages, especially those using non-Latin orthographies (i.e. not using Latin alphabets) following for instance, the even more limited message lengths involved when using for example, Cyrillic or Greek letters.[tpl]cite book | title=Txtng the gr8 db8| last=Crystal| first=David| year=2009| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York[/tpl] On the flip side, researcher Gillian Perrett observes the de-anglicization[tpl]cite web|last=Perrett|first=Gillian|title=Globalization and the de-Anglicization of English|url=http://journal.teflin.org/index.php/teflin/article/viewFile/240/170|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalum|accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl]  of the English language following its use and incorporation into non-English linguistic contexts.
As such, on top of the measures taken to minimize space, time and cost constraints in SMS language, further constraints upon the varied nature and characteristics of languages worldwide add to the distinct properties and style of SMS language(s).

==Linguistic properties and style==

The primary motivation for the creation and use of SMS language was to convey a comprehensible message using the fewest number of characters possible. This was due (i) to the way in which telecommunication companies limited the number of characters per SMS, and also charged the user per SMS sent. To keep costs down, users had to find a way of being concise while still getting their message across. Further (ii) typing on a phone is normally slower than with a keyboard, and capitalization is even slower. 
As a result, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization are largely ignored. In many countries, people now have access to unlimited text options in their monthly plan, although this varies widely from country to country, and operator to operator. However, screens are still small, which continues to motivate short messages and the input problem persists: SMS language is still widely used for brevity.
Observations and classifications as to the linguistic and stylistic properties of SMS language have been made and proposed by Crispin Thurlow,[tpl]cite web|last=Thurlow|first=Crispin|title=Generation Txt? The sociolinguistics of young people's text messaging.|url=http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/v1/n1/a3/thurlow2002003.html|publisher=Discourse Analysis Online (DAOL)[/tpl] López Rúa[tpl]cite journal|last=López-Rúa|first=Paula|title=Teaching L2 vocabulary through SMS language: some didactic guidelines|journal=ELIA|year=2007|issue=7|pages=165–188[/tpl] and David Crystal among many others. Although they are by no means exhaustive, some of these marked properties involve the use of:

===Initialisations (acronyms and abbreviations composed of initials)===

There are many examples of words or phrases that share the same abbreviations (e.g., lol could mean laugh out loud, lots of love, or little old lady, and cryn could mean crayon or cryin(g)).

===Reductions and shortenings, and omission of parts of speech[tpl]cite web|last=Freudenberg|first=Kristy|title=Investigating the impact of SMS speak on the written work of English first language and English second language high school learners|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/2052/Freudenberg,%20K.pdf?sequence=1|work=MA Thesis: Philosophy Stellenbosch University|accessdate=19 March 2012[/tpl]===

For words that have no common abbreviation, users most commonly remove the vowels from a word, and the reader is required to interpret a string of consonants by re-adding the vowels (e.g. dictionary becomes dctnry and keyboard becomes kybrd). Omission of words, especially function words (e.g.: determiners like "a" and "the") are also employed as part of the effort to overcome time and space constraints.
The advent of predictive text input and smartphones featuring full QWERTY keyboards may contribute to a reduction in the use of shortenings in SMS language, although this has not yet been noted.

====Pragmatics and context in interpretation of ambiguous shortenings====

Recipients may have to interpret the abbreviated words depending on the context in which they are being used. For instance, should someone use ttyl, lol they may probably mean talk to you later, lots of love as opposed to talk to you later, laugh out loud. In another instance, if someone were to use omg, lol they may perhaps mean oh my god, laugh out loud as opposed to oh my god, lots of love.
Therefore, co-textual references and context are crucial when interpreting textese, and it is precisely this shortfall that critics cite as a reason not to use it (although the English language in general, like many other languages, has many words that have different meanings in different contexts).
SMS language does not always obey or follow standard grammar, and additionally the words used are not usually found in standard dictionaries or recognized by language academies.

===Reactive tokens===

The feature of 'reactive tokens' that is ubiquitous in Internet Relay Chat (IRC), is also commonly found in SMS language. Reactive tokens include phrases or words like ‘yeah I know’, which signifies a reaction to a previous message. In SMS language, however, the difference is that many words are shortened unlike in spoken speech.[ref]{{Cite web|url=http://www.tesol-france.org/Documents/Colloque07/SMS%20Text%20Analysis%20Language%20Gender%20and%20Current%20Practice%20_1_.

===Pictograms and logograms (rebus abbreviation)===

Some tokens of the SMS language can be likened to a rebus, using pictures and single letters or numbers to represent whole words (e.g. "i The dialect has a few hieroglyphs (codes comprehensible to initiates) and a range of face symbols.[tpl]cite web|last=Walters |first=Guy |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/07/gr8-db8-crystal-texting-txtng |title=New Statesman |publisher=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl]

===Paralinguistic and prosodic features===

Prosodic features in SMS language aim to provide added semantic and syntactic information and context from which recipients can use to deduce a more contextually relevant and accurate interpretation. These may aim to convey the textual equivalent of verbal prosodic features such as facial expression and tone of voice[tpl]cite journal|last=Watt|first=Helen J.|title=How Does the Use of Modern Communication Technology Influence Language and Literacy Development? - A Review|journal=Contemporary Issues Communicatio Science and Disorders|year=2010|volume=37|pages=141–148|url=http://www.nsslha.org/uploadedFiles/NSSLHA/publications/cicsd/2010F-Use-of-Modern-Communication-Technology.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Nancy Anashia Ong'onda, Peter Maina Matu, Pamela Anyango Oloo| title=Syntactic Aspects in Text Messaging| journal=World Journal of English Language| year=2011| volume=1| issue=1[/tpl] Indeed, even though SMS language exists in the format of written text, it closely resembles normal speech in that it does not have a complicated structure and that its meaning is greatly contextualised.

====Capitalization====

In the case of capitalization in SMS language, there are three scenarios:Ling, Richard. 2005. "The socio-linguistics of SMS: An analysis of SMS use by a random sample of Norwegians" in Mobile communications: Renegotiation of the social sphere, edited by R. Ling and P. Pedersen. London: Springer.
SMS messages with:
Most SMS messages have done away with capitalization. Use of capitalizations on the first word of a message may in fact, not be intentional, and may likely be due to the default capitalization setting of devices.
Capitalization too may encode prosodic elements, where copious use may signify the textual equivalent of raised voice to indicate heightened emotion.

====Asterisk emoting and emoticons====

Just as body language and facial expressions can alter how speech is perceived, emoticons can alter the meaning of a text message, the difference being that the real tone of the SMS sender is less easily discerned merely by the emoticon. Using a smiling face can be perceived as being sarcastic rather than happy, thus the reader has to decide which it is by looking at the whole message.[tpl]cite journal | author=Ahmed, Sabreena; Nurullah, Abu Sadat; Sakar, Subarna| title=The Use of SMS and Language Transformation in Bangladesh| year=2010[/tpl]
Use of punctuation and capitalization to form emoticons distracts from the more traditional function of such features and symbols. Nevertheless, uses do differ across individuals and cultures. For example, overpunctuation may simply be used to communicate paralinguistic aspects of communication without the need to create an emotion from it like so: "Hello!!!!".

===Punctuation, or lack thereof===

While vowels and punctuation of words in SMS language are generally omitted, David Crystal observes that apostrophes occur unusually frequently. He cites an American study of 544 messages, where occurrence of apostrophes in SMS language is approximately 35 percent.  This is unexpected, seeing that it is a hassle to input an apostrophe in a text message with the multiple steps involved. Interestingly, the use of apostrophes cannot be totally attributed to users attempting to disambiguate words that might otherwise be misunderstood without it.
There are not that many cases in English where leaving out the apostrophe causes misunderstanding of the message. For example, "we’re" without the apostrophe could be misread as "were". Even so, these are mostly understood correctly despite being ambiguous, as readers can rely on other cues such as part of sentence and context where the word appears to decide what the word should be. For many other words like "Im" and "Shes", there is no ambiguity. Since it is not imperative that users use apostrophes to ensure that their message is understood accurately, this phenomenon may in part be attributed to texters wanting to maintain clarity so that the message can be more easily understood in a shorter amount of time.

===Variations in spelling===

Users may also use spellings that reflect their illocutionary force and intention rather than using the standard spelling. For example, the use of "haha" to signify "standard" laughter, and "muahaha" to encode perhaps more raucous or evil sound of laughter.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tesol-france.org/Documents/Colloque07/SMS%20Text%20Analysis%20Language%20Gender%20and%20Current%20Practice%20_1_.pdf|title=SMS text analysis: Language, gender and current practices|accessdate=2012-02-27|author=Muhammad, Shaban Rafi[/tpl]
In this, regional variations in spelling can also be observed. As such, SMS language, with its intergroup variations, serves also as an identity marker.

==Conventionalised examples and vocabulary==

===SMS dictionaries===

SMS language has yet to be accepted as a conventional and stable form, dialect and language. As a result (as much as it is also a consequence), notable lexicographical efforts and publications (e.g. dictionaries) dealing specifically with SMS language have yet to emerge.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mashamaite, Kwena and Mphahlele, Lorna Mampa|title=The Impact of Short Message Service (SMS) Language on Language Proficiency of Leaners and the SMS Dictionaries: A Challenge for Educators and Lexicographers|journal=IADIS International Conference Mobile Learning 2005|year=2005|pages=161–168|url=http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200506L022.pdf[/tpl] This is perhaps with the exception of the SMS dictionary that the service provider Vodacom, provides its clients with as a supplement to their cellphone purchase. However, as a result text message slang has aided many children's language. By constantly using this ungrammatical form of texting so frequently, it has become apart of their "normal language".
