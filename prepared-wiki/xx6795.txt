A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor light source that resembles a basic pn-junction diode, except that an LED also emits light.[ref]

 led and LED.[/ref] When an LED's anode lead has a voltage that is more positive than its cathode lead by at least the LED's forward voltage drop, current flows. Electrons are able to recombine with holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.
An LED is often small in area (less than 1 mm2), and integrated optical components may be used to shape its radiation pattern.[tpl]Cite pmid|18542260[/tpl]
Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light.
Infrared LEDs are still frequently used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits, such as those in remote controls for a wide variety of consumer electronics.
The first visible-light LEDs were also of low intensity, and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with very high brightness.
Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps for electronic devices, replacing small incandescent bulbs. They were soon packaged into numeric readouts in the form of seven-segment displays, and were commonly seen in digital clocks.
Recent developments in LEDs permit them to be used in environmental and task lighting. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, and camera flashes.
However, LEDs powerful enough for room lighting are still relatively expensive, and require more precise current and heat management than compact fluorescent lamp sources of comparable output.
LEDs have allowed new text, video displays, and sensors to be developed, while their high switching rates are also useful in advanced communications technology.

===Discoveries and early devices===

Electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered in 1907 by the British experimenter H. J. Round of Marconi Labs, using a crystal of silicon carbide and a cat's-whisker detector.
Russian Oleg Losev reported creation of the first LED in 1927.[tpl]cite journal | author=Losev, O. V. | journal=Telegrafiya i Telefoniya bez Provodov | year=1927 | volume=44 | pages=485–494[/tpl] His research was distributed in Russian, German and British scientific journals, but no practical use was made of the discovery for several decades.[tpl]cite book|author=Lee, Thomas H. |title=The design of CMOS radio-frequency integrated circuits|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-521-83539-9|page=20[/tpl] Rubin BraunsteinRubin Braunstein. physics.ucla.edu of the Radio Corporation of America reported on infrared emission from gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other semiconductor alloys in 1955. Braunstein observed infrared emission generated by simple diode structures using gallium antimonide (GaSb), GaAs, indium phosphide (InP), and silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloys at room temperature and at 77 Kelvin.
In late 1961, while working at Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas, TX, James R. Biard and Gary Pittman found gallium arsenide (GaAs) emitted infrared light when electric current was applied.
On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled "Semiconductor Radiant Diode" based on their findings, which described a zinc diffused p–n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias.
After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two inventors the first patent for the infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent US3293513), the first modern LED.
Immediately following issuance of the patent, Texas Instruments began a project to manufacture infrared diodes and announced the first LED commercial product in October 1962, the SNX-100.
The SNX-100 used the zinc diffusion and gold-zinc P-type contact from the varactor diode and the tin alloy from the tunnel diode for the N-type Ohmic contact, which was achieved by plating molybdenum wires with tin and alloying them into the N-type surface of the die using a strip heater.
The first visible-spectrum (red) LED was developed in 1962 by Nick Holonyak, Jr., while working at General Electric Company. Holonyak first reported this breakthrough in the journal Applied Physics Letters on the December 1, 1962.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v1/i4 | title=Coherent (Visible) Light Emission from Ga(As1−x Px) Junctions | author=Holonyak Nick | journal=Applied Physics Letters |date=December 1962 | issue=4 | doi=10.1063/1.1753706 | last2=Bevacqua | first2=S. F. | volume=1 | pages=82|bibcode = 1962ApPhL...1...82H [/tpl] Holonyak is considered by some people as the "father of the light-emitting diode".
M. George Craford, a former graduate student of Holonyak, invented the first yellow LED and improved the brightness of red and red-orange LEDs by a factor of ten in 1972. In 1976, T. P. Pearsall created the first high-brightness, high-efficiency LEDs for optical fiber telecommunications by inventing new semiconductor materials specifically adapted to optical fiber transmission wavelengths.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Efficient, Lattice-matched, Double Heterostructure LEDs at 1.1 mm from GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y by Liquid-phase Epitaxy|journal=Appl.

===Commercial development===

The first commercial LEDs were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps, and in seven-segment displays,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.datamath.org/Display/Monsanto.htm | title=LEDs cast Monsanto in Unfamiliar Role | author=Rostky, George | journal=Electronic Engineering Times (EETimes) |date=March 1997 | issue=944[/tpl] first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as TVs, radios, telephones, calculators, as well as watches (see list of signal uses).
Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of US$200 per unit, and so had little practical use.
The Monsanto Company was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators.[tpl]Cite book|author=Schubert, E. Fred |title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|chapter=1|isbn=0-8194-3956-8[/tpl]  Hewlett Packard (HP) introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment. In the 1970s commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics. These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by Dr. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor.[tpl]cite patent | title=Method of Manufacturing Semiconductor Devices |country=US |number=3025589 | author=Hoerni, J.A. |fdate=May 1, 1959 |gdate=Mar 20, 1962[/tpl]Patent number: 3025589 Retrieved May 17, 2013 The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions.[tpl]Cite news| author=Bausch, Jeffrey |title =The Long History of Light Emitting Diodes |url=http://www.electronicproducts.com/Optoelectronics/LEDs/The_long_history_of_light-emitting_diodes.aspx|publisher =Hearst Business Communications |year=2011 |date= December 2011 [/tpl]  These methods continue to be used by LED producers.[tpl]Cite pmid|19696346[/tpl]

The development of LED technology has caused their efficiency and light output to rise exponentially, with a doubling occurring approximately every 36 months since the 1960s, in a way similar to Moore's law. This trend is generally attributed to the parallel development of other semiconductor technologies and advances in optics and material science, and has been called Haitz's law after Dr. Roland Haitz.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2006.78|title=Haitz's law|year=2007|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=1|page=23|issue=1|bibcode = 2007NaPho...1...23.

===Physics===

The LED consists of a chip of semiconducting material doped with impurities to create a p-n junction. As in other diodes, current flows easily from the p-side, or anode, to the n-side, or cathode, but not in the reverse direction. Charge-carriers—electrons and holes—flow into the junction from electrodes with different voltages. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower energy level and releases energy in the form of a photon.
The wavelength of the light emitted, and thus its color, depends on the band gap energy of the materials forming the p-n junction. In silicon or germanium diodes, the electrons and holes recombine by a non-radiative transition, which produces no optical emission, because these are indirect band gap materials. The materials used for the LED have a direct band gap with energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet light.
LED development began with infrared and red devices made with gallium arsenide. Advances in materials science have enabled making devices with ever-shorter wavelengths, emitting light in a variety of colors.
LEDs are usually built on an n-type substrate, with an electrode attached to the p-type layer deposited on its surface. P-type substrates, while less common, occur as well. Many commercial LEDs, especially GaN/InGaN, also use sapphire substrate.
Most materials used for LED production have very high refractive indices. This means that much light will be reflected back into the material at the material/air surface interface. Thus, light extraction in LEDs is an important aspect of LED production, subject to much research and development.
