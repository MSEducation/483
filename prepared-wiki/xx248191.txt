The VSTOL Support Ship (VSS) was a proposed light aircraft carrier design for the United States Navy in the late 1970s that would be smaller and less expensive than the Navy's existing aircraft carriers such as the [tpl]sclass|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0[/tpl].  The design would cost one-quarter as much, although the V/STOL aircraft it would carry would have reduced performance.  The United States Senate and others supported the design, but it was ultimately rejected by the Navy.
