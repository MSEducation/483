==Professional career==

===1970s===

After dropping out of college, Limbaugh moved to McKeesport, Pennsylvania. In 1972, he became a Top 40 music disc jockey on WIXZ, a small AM radio station that reached much of the Pittsburgh area. He started with an afternoon show and later did mornings, broadcasting under the name Jeff Christie. Limbaugh moved to Pittsburgh station KQV in 1973 as the evening disc jockey, succeeding Jim Quinn. He was fired in late-1974, when the station was sold to Taft Broadcasting. Limbaugh was reportedly told by management that he would never make it as on air talent, and should consider going into sales. Unable to find another job in local radio, Limbaugh moved back home to Cape Girardeau. He became a lifelong fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers from his time in the region.http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_052209/content/01125104.guest.html[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/01/transcript-rush-limbaughs-address-cpac |title=Transcript of Rush Limbaugh's Address at CPAC |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/fanatics-brave-cold-for-titanic-super-bowl-contest-between-steelers-and-packers/story-e6frg7mf-1226000987695 | work=The Australian | title=Fanatics brave cold for titanic Super Bowl contest between Steelers and Packers | date=February 6, 2011[/tpl]
For the rest of the decade Limbaugh took jobs at several radio stations, working in music radio, before settling in Kansas City. In 1979, he left radio and accepted a position as director of promotions with the Kansas City Royals baseball team. There he developed a close friendship with then-Royals star third baseman and future Hall of Famer George Brett; the two remain close friends.[tpl]cite book | last = Toma | first = George | coauthors = Goforth, Alan & Brett, George | title = Nitty gritty dirt man | publisher = SportsPublishingLLC.com | year = 2004 | page = 164 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=l1xauXzmbvkC&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=rush+limbaugh+george+brett | isbn = 978-1-58261-646-9[/tpl]

===1980s===

In 1984, Limbaugh returned to radio as a talk show host at KFBK in Sacramento, California, where he replaced Morton Downey, Jr. The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine—which had required that stations provide free air time for responses to any controversial opinions that were broadcast—by the FCC in 1987 meant stations could broadcast editorial commentary without having to present opposing views. Daniel Henninger wrote, in a Wall Street Journal editorial, "Ronald Reagan tore down this wall (the Fairness Doctrine) in 1987 ... and Rush Limbaugh was the first man to proclaim himself liberated from the East Germany of liberal media domination."Henninger, Daniel (April 29, 2005) "Rush to Victory". The Wall Street Journal.
On August 1, 1988, after achieving success in Sacramento and drawing the attention of former ABC Radio President Edward McLaughlin, Limbaugh moved to New York City and began his national radio show. He debuted just weeks after the Democratic National Convention, and just weeks before the Republican National Convention. Limbaugh's radio home in New York City was the talk-formatted WABC, and this remains his flagship station (although Limbaugh now hosts his program from West Palm Beach).

===1990s===

In December 1990, journalist Lewis Grossberger wrote in The New York Times that Limbaugh had "more listeners than any other talk show host" and described Limbaugh's style as "bouncing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian".[tpl]cite news | first=Lewis | last=Grossberger | pages=SM58 | title= The Rush Hours |date=December 16, 1990 |work=The New York Times [/tpl] Limbaugh's rising popularity coincided with the Persian Gulf War, and his support for the war effort and his relentless ridicule of peace activists. The program gained more popularity and was moved to stations with larger audiences, eventually being broadcast on over 650 radio stations nationwide.
In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected president of the United States. Limbaugh satirized the policies of Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as those of the Democratic Party. When the Republican Party won control of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections, the freshman Republican class awarded Limbaugh an honorary membership in their caucus. This event confirmed him as an influential figure on the national political scene.[tpl]cite news | last = Seelye | first = Katherine Q. | title = Republicans Get a Pep Talk From Rush Limbaugh | pages = A16 |work=The New York Times | date = December 12, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DC1E39F931A25751C1A962958260 [/tpl]

===2000s===

Limbaugh had publicized personal difficulties in the 2000s. In late 2001, he acknowledged that he had gone almost completely deaf, although he continued his show. He was able to regain much of his hearing with the help of a cochlear implant in 2001.
In 2003, Limbaugh had a brief stint as a pro football commentator with ESPN. He resigned a few weeks into the 2003 NFL season after making comments about the press coverage for quarterback Donovan McNabb that caused controversy and accusations of racism on the part of Limbaugh. His comment about McNabb was: "I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there's a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn't deserve. The defense carried this team."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,493270,00.html |title=Was Limbaugh Right to Resign from ESPN? |publisher=Time.com |date=October 6, 2003 |accessdate=September 22, 2013[/tpl] For example, a sportswriter construed the comment as racist against himself and other sportswriters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/writers/peter_king/09/30/mcnabb_limbaugh/ | title=Open mouth, insert foot, Limbaugh's comments on McNabb aren't racist, but they are boneheaded|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|author=King, Peter | date=September 30, 2003[/tpl] Another sports analyst wrote Limbaugh's viewpoint was shared by "many football fans and analysts" and "it is ... absurd to say that the sports media haven't overrated Donovan McNabb because he's black."[tpl]cite web|last=Palmer |first=Brian |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2089193/ |title=Rush was Right|publisher=Slate|date=December 5, 2011[/tpl]
In 2003, Limbaugh stated that he was addicted to pain medication, and sought treatment.[tpl]cite news |title=Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/10/10/rush.limbaugh/ |newspaper=CNN |date=10 October 2003 |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] In April 2006, Limbaugh turned himself in to authorities, on a warrant issued by the state attorney's office, and was arrested "on a single charge of prescription fraud".[tpl]cite news |title=Rush Limbaugh Turns Himself In On Fraud Charge In Rx Drug Probe |author=Peter Whoriskey |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042801692.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=29 April 2006 |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] His record was later expunged.[tpl]cite news |title=Rush Limbaugh, conservative radio host, rushed to Hawaiian hospital with chest pains: report |author=Dave Goldiner |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/rush-limbaugh-conservative-radio-host-rushed-hawaiian-hospital-chest-pains-report-article-1.437568 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl]

===The Rush Limbaugh Show===

Limbaugh's radio show airs for three hours each weekday beginning at noon Eastern Standard Time on both AM and FM radio. The program is also broadcast worldwide on the Armed Forces Radio Network.
Radio broadcasting shifted from AM to FM in the late 1970s because of the opportunity to broadcast music in stereo with better fidelity. Limbaugh's show was first nationally syndicated in August 1988, in a later stage of AM's decline. Limbaugh's popularity paved the way for other conservative talk radio programming to become commonplace on the AM radio. In March 2006, WBAL in Baltimore became the first major market radio station in the country to drop Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio program.[tpl]cite news | last = Hiaasen | first = Rob | title = WBAL Radio Cancels Rush Limbaugh: Station is First to Drop Show, Wants to Focus on Local News | publisher = The Baltimore Sun | date = March 14, 2006 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/427188/wbal_radio_cancels_rush_limbaugh_station_is_first_to_drop/index.html [/tpl] In 2007, Talkers magazine again named him No. 1 in its "Heavy Hundred" most important talk show hosts.
Limbaugh frequently mentions the EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) network, but this is a mythic construction, as he told The New York Times in 1990.Lewis Grossberger, "The Rush Hours", The New York Times, December 16, 1990, section 6, p. 58 In reality, his show was co-owned and first syndicated by Edward F. McLaughlin, former president of ABC who founded EFM Media in 1988, with Limbaugh's show as his first product. In 1997, McLaughlin sold EFM to Jacor Communications, which was ultimately bought up by Clear Channel Communications. Today, Limbaugh owns a majority of the show, which is syndicated by the Premiere Radio Networks.
According to a 2001 article in U.S. News & World Report, Limbaugh had an eight-year contract, at the rate of $31.25 million a year."Vital Statistics", U.S. News & World Report, July 30, 2001, p. 7 In 2007, Limbaugh earned $33 million.The Celebrity 100: #36 Rush Limbaugh. Forbes. June 14, 2007. On July 2, 2008, Matt Drudge reported that Limbaugh signed a contract extension through 2016 that is worth over $400 million, breaking records for any broadcast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://drudgereport.com/flashrl.htm |title=LIMBAUGH SIGNS THROUGH 2016; $400 MILLION DEAL SHATTERS BROADCAST RECORDS |publisher=Drudgereport.com |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731002506/http://www.drudgereport.com/flashrl.htm  |archivedate = July 31, 2008[/tpl] A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that Rush Limbaugh was the most trusted news personality in the nation, garnering 12.5 percent of poll responses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imao.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/media_project_poll_info.pdf |title=Zogby poll |format=PDF |accessdate=September 22, 2013[/tpl]

===Television show===

Limbaugh had a syndicated half-hour television show from 1992 through 1996, produced by Roger Ailes. The show discussed many of the topics on his radio show, and was taped in front of an audience. Rush Limbaugh says he loves doing his radio show,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_060909/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush Receives 'Freedom of Speech Award' from Talkers Magazine |publisher=Rushlimbaugh.com |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl] but not a TV show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_111309/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush and Roger Ailes Speak at Boy Scouts Awards Dinner |publisher=Rushlimbaugh.com |date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl]

===Other media appearances===

Limbaugh's first television hosting experience came March 30, 1990, as a guest host on Pat Sajak's CBS late-night talk show, The Pat Sajak Show.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNK4byQkn7w Rush Limbaugh guest-hosts the Pat Sajak show in 1990 ACT UP activists in the audience[tpl]cite news|first=Richard|last=Gehr|title=Mouth At Work|work=Newsday| publisher=|page=4|date=October 8, 1990|accessdate=[/tpl] heckled Limbaugh repeatedly; ultimately the entire studio audience was cleared.

On December 17, 1993, Limbaugh appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman.[tpl]cite news|first=Tom |last=Maurstad|title=Stern, Limbaugh meet their match; Hosts Leno, Letterman hold their own in war|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=|page=1C|date=December 20, 1993|accessdate=[/tpl] Limbaugh also guest-starred (as himself) on a 1994 episode of Hearts Afire. He appeared in the 1995 Billy Crystal film Forget Paris, and in 1998 on an episode of The Drew Carey Show.
In 2007, Limbaugh made cameo appearances on Fox News Channel's short-lived The 1/2 Hour News Hour in a series of parodies portraying him as the future President of the United States. In the parodies, his vice president was fellow conservative pundit Ann Coulter. He also made a cameo in the Family Guy episode "Blue Harvest" that year. More recent Family Guy appearances have been: the 2010 episode "Excellence in Broadcasting", and the 2011 episode "It's a Trap!", a parody of Return of the Jedi, in which Limbaugh can be heard on the radio claiming that, among other things, the "intergalactic liberal space media" was lying about climate change on the planet Hoth, and that Lando Calrissian's administrative position on Cloud City was a result of affirmative action.
His persona has often been utilized as a template for a stereotypical conservative talk show host on TV shows and in movies, including an episode of The Simpsons (as a conservative talk radio host named Birch Barlow), as Gus Baker on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head, as Lash Rambo (host of "Perfection in Broadcasting") on an episode of The New WKRP in Cincinnati, and as Fielding Chase in the Columbo spinoff film Butterfly in Shades of Grey.
As a result of his television program, Limbaugh became known for wearing distinctive neckties. In response to viewer interest, Limbaugh launched a series of ties[tpl]cite news|first=Penny|last=Parker|page=C–1|title=Ties loud, just like Limbaugh.|date=March 20, 1996|work=Denver Post[/tpl] designed primarily by his then-wife Marta.[tpl]cite news| first=Thomas|last=Vinciguera|page=43|title=No Talk Show, But a Loud Tie|date=August 4, 1996|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Sales of the ties reached over US$5 million in their initial sales year, but were later discontinued.
In January 2010, Chicago's Second City announced a new production, Rush Limbaugh: The Musical, a musical parody of Limbaugh which incorporates a pastiche of several Broadway musicals. It follows in the footsteps of 2009's successful run of Rod Blagojevich Superstar, which was written and developed by the same creative team.
On January 30, 2010, Limbaugh was a judge for the 2010 Miss America pageant in Las Vegas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/29/entertainment/main6154147.shtml|title=Rush Limbaugh Named Miss America Judge: Conservative Radio Host Joins Vivica Fox, Shawn Johnson on 2010 Panel|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=January 30, 2010 | date=January 29, 2010[/tpl] In early 2011, Limbaugh was the subject of the third season of Golf Channel's The Haney Project, in which instructor Hank Haney coached him in eight episodes.[tpl]cite news |title=Hank Haney will dissect Rush Limbaugh's golf game |author=Steve DiMeglio |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2011-01-10-haney-project-rush-limbaugh_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2011[/tpl]

Zev Chafets, whose book Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One was published May 25, 2010, wrote after the first primaries of the 2010 U.S. election season that Limbaugh was "the brains and the spirit behind" the Republican Party's "resurgence" in the wake of the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. In his May 20, 2010, New York Times op-ed column, Chafets pointed among others to Sen. Arlen Specter's defeat, after being labeled by Limbaugh "Republican in Name Only," and to Sarah Palin, whose "biggest current applause line—Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no—came courtesy of Mr. Limbaugh." More generally, Chafets wrote, Limbaugh has argued the party-of-no Ronald Reagan conservative course for the Republicans vigorously, notably since six weeks after the Obama inauguration, and has been fundamental to, and encouraging to, the more prominently noted Tea Party movement."The Limbaugh Victory" OpEd by Zev Chavets, The New York Times, May 19, 2010 (May 20, 2010, on p.

==Views==

In his first New York Times best seller, Limbaugh describes himself as conservative, and is critical of broadcasters in many media outlets for claiming to be objective. He has criticized political centrists, independents, and moderate conservatives, claiming they are responsible for Democrat Barack Obama's victory over Republican John McCain in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election and inviting them to leave the Republican party. He calls for the adoption of core conservative philosophies in order to ensure the survival of the Republican party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_110508/content/01125100.guest.html |title=Wednesday Quotes: Your Conservative Rock |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |work= |date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_110608/content/01125108.guest.html |title=Get Off the Ledge, Conservatives!

===African-Americans===

Limbaugh has been noted for making controversial race-related statements with regard to African-Americans. He once opined that all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resembled Jesse Jackson, and another time that "the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons."[tpl]cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200910120009 |title=January 19, 2007 transcript |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |accessdate=April 3, 2012[/tpl]  While employed as what he describes as an "insult-radio" DJ, he used a derogatory racial stereotype to characterize a black caller he could not understand, telling the caller to "take that bone out of your nose and call me back."[tpl]cite news|first=Richard|last=Gehr|title=Mouth At Work|work=Newsday| publisher=|page=4|date=October 8, 1990|quote="For all his bravado, however, Limbaugh is immensely sensitive to charges of insensitivity.

Gee, don't get me in this one. I am the least racist host you'll ever find.` Recalling a stint as an `insult-radio` DJ in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he admits feeling guilty about, for example, telling a black listener he could not understand to `take that bone out of your nose and call me back.`"[/tpl] In March 2010, Limbaugh used the similarity of recently resigned Rep. Eric Massa's surname to the slavery-era African-American pronunciation of "master" to make a pun on the possibility that Gov. David Paterson, New York's first African-American governor, would pick Massa's replacement: "Let's assume you're right caller. So, David Paterson will become the massa who gets to appoint whoever gets to take Massa's place. So, for the first time in his life, Paterson's gonna be a massa.

==Use of entertainment props==

Limbaugh utilizes props to introduce his monologues on various topics. On his radio show, news about the homeless has often been preceded with the Clarence "Frogman" Henry song "Ain't Got No Home."[tpl]cite news |first=Lewis |last=Grossberger |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=The Rush Hours |url= |work=The New York Times| publisher= |page=58 | date=December 16, 1990 | accessdate= | language= [/tpl] For a time, Dionne Warwick's song "I Know I'll Never Love This Way Again" preceded reports about people with AIDS.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Remnick |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Day of the Dittohead |url= |work=The Washington Post| publisher= |page=C1 | date=December 16, 1990 | accessdate= | language= [/tpl] These later became "condom updates" preceded by Fifth Dimension's song, Up, Up and Away.

He would then deny that he had "hung up" on the caller, which he had promised not to do.

==Claims of inaccuracy==

Some groups and individuals have criticized Limbaugh's accuracy. The July–August 1994 issue of Extra!, a publication of the progressive group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), alleges 50 different inaccuracies and distortions in Limbaugh's commentary.The Way Things Aren't Extra!, July–August 1994The Way Things Aren't: Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error : Over 100 Outrageously False and Foolish Statements from America's Most Powerful Radio and TV commentator, Rendall, Steve; Naureckas, Jim; and Cohen, Jeff; W.W. Norton and Company, 1995 Others have since joined FAIR in questioning Limbaugh's facts. Comedian Al Franken, who later became a Senator, wrote a satirical book (Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations) in which he accused Limbaugh of distorting facts to serve his own political biases.Franken, Al, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations, Delacorte Press, 1996
Professor Ray Perkins has written a book titled "Logic and Mr. Limbaugh: A Dittohead's Guide To Fallacious Reading" which takes "50 examples of logical reasoning from Rush's statements, identifies the logical arguments, and points out fallacies."http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Mr-Limbaugh-Dittoheads-Fallacious/dp/0812692942
Limbaugh has been criticized for inaccuracies by the Environmental Defense Fund. A defense fund report authored by Princeton University endowed geoscience professor Michael Oppenheimer and professor of biology David Wilcove lists 14 significant scientific facts that, the authors allege, Limbaugh misrepresented in his book The Way Things Ought to Be.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apps.edf.org/documents/2432_WayThingsReallyAre.pdf|title=The way things really are|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund|year=1994|format=PDF[/tpl] The authors conclude that "Rush Limbaugh ... allows his political bias to distort the truth about a whole range of important scientific issues."
On October 14, 2011, Limbaugh questioned the U.S. military initiative against Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), based on the assumption that they were Christians. "They are fighting the Muslims in Sudan. And Obama has sent troops, United States troops to remove them from the battlefield, which means kill them." Upon learning about the accusations leveled against Kony, which included kidnapping whole schools of young children for use as child soldiers, Limbaugh stated that he would research the group.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/magazine/08UGANDA.html |title=Charlotte, Grace, Janet and Caroline Come Home |work=The New York Times |date=May 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 11, 2012 |first=Melanie |last=Thernstrom[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2011/10/14/obama_invades_uganda_targets_christians |title=Obama Invades Uganda, Targets Christians |publisher=The Rush Limbaugh Show |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011[/tpl]  The show's written transcript on his website was not changed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/rush-limbaugh-attacked-president-obama-for-targeting-joseph-konys-christian-lra/ |title=Rush Limbaugh Attacked President Obama For 'Targeting' Joseph Kony's 'Christian' LRA |publisher=Mediaite |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=August 2, 2012[/tpl]

===Prescription drug addiction===

On October 3, 2003, the National Enquirer reported that Limbaugh was being investigated for illegally obtaining the prescription drugs oxycodone and hydrocodone. Other news outlets quickly confirmed the investigation.[tpl]cite news|last=Candiotti|first=Susan|title=Limbaugh mostly mum on reports of drug probe|publisher=CNN|date=October 3, 2003|url= http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/News/10/03/rush.drugs/[/tpl] He admitted to listeners on his radio show on October 10, 2003, that he was addicted to prescription painkillers and stated that he would enter inpatient treatment for 30 days, immediately after the broadcast.[tpl]cite news|author= George Bennett & John Pacenti|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/news/limbaugh/101103_limbaugh.html|title= Talk host Limbaugh to enter drug rehab|publisher=Palm Beach Post|page=1A|date=October 11, 2003[/tpl] Limbaugh stated his addiction to painkillers resulted from several years of severe back pain heightened by a botched surgery intended to correct those problems.
A subsequent investigation into whether Limbaugh had violated Florida's doctor shopping laws was launched by the Palm Beach State Attorney, which raised privacy issues when investigators seized Limbaugh's private medical records looking for evidence of crimes. Roy Black, one of Limbaugh's attorneys, stated that "Rush Limbaugh was singled out for prosecution because of who he is. We believe the state attorney's office is applying a double standard."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/01/04/State/Limbaugh_may_face_a_r.shtml | date=January 4, 2004 | agency= Associated Press | title= Limbaugh may face a rarely used charge[/tpl]  On November 9, 2005, following two years of investigations, Assistant State Attorney James L.

The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement in agreement and filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Limbaugh.[tpl]cite news | date= January 13, 2004 | title= Improbable ally joins Limbaugh privacy fight | publisher= The St. Petersburg Times | pages=1B[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=41 |title=Palm Beach Appeals Court to Hear Argument in Limbaugh Medical Records Case |publisher=Aclufl.org |date=April 7, 2004 |location=West Palm Beach |accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl] On December 12, 2005, Judge David F.

On April 28, 2006, a warrant was issued for his arrest on the charge of doctor shopping. According to Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the sheriff, during his arrest, Limbaugh was booked, photographed, and fingerprinted, but not handcuffed. He was then released after about an hour on $3,000 bail.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/28/national/main1561324.shtml |title=Rush Limbaugh Arrested On Drug Charges, Conservative Radio Commentator Turns Himself In But Claims Innocence |publisher=CBS News |date= April 28, 2006|accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/28/ldt.01.html |title=Lou Dobbs Tonight|work=Lou Dobbs Tonight |format=Transcript |publisher=CNN |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/28/limbaugh.booked/index.html |title=Rehab, $30,000 to keep Limbaugh out of court|publisher=CNN |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl] After his surrender, he filed a "not guilty" plea to the charge. Prosecutors explained that the charges were brought after they discovered he received about 2,000 painkillers, prescribed by four doctors in six months, at a pharmacy near his Palm Beach mansion. In 2009, after 3 years of prolonged discussion regarding a settlement, prosecutors agreed to drop the charge if Limbaugh paid $30,000 to defray the cost of the investigation, completed an 18-month therapy regimen with his physician, submitted to random drug testing, and gave up his right to own a firearm for eighteen months.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/menu/rushwire/settlement_agreement_ends_state_investigation_of_rush_limbaugh.guest.html | date= April 28, 2006 | title= Settlement Agreement Ends State Investigation of Rush Limbaugh | publisher= RushLimbaugh.com[/tpl] Limbaugh agreed to the settlement, though he continued to maintain his innocence of doctor shopping and asserted that the state's offer resulted from a lack of evidence supporting the charge.[tpl]cite news|first=Brian|last=Skoloff| url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/article_fb5e2724-da62-539e-835a-610da671248c.html|date=May 1, 2006 | agency= Associated Press | title= Limbaugh Facing Drug Tests Under Deal[/tpl]
Before his addiction became known, Limbaugh had condemned illegal drug use on his television program, stating that "Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country... And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up."Murphy, Jarrett. Rush Limbaugh Arrested On Drug Charges.

In June 2006, Limbaugh was detained by drug enforcement agents at Palm Beach International Airport. Customs officials confiscated Viagra from Limbaugh's luggage as he was returning from the Dominican Republic. The prescription was not in Limbaugh's name.  After he was released with no charges filed, Limbaugh joked about the incident on his radio show, claiming that he got the Viagra at the Clinton Library and was told they were blue M&M's. He also stated that "I had a great time in the Dominican Republic. Wish I could tell you about it."[tpl]cite news|title=Rush Limbaugh Detained With Viagra|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/27/national/main1753947.shtml|date=June 27, 2006|accessdate=September 30, 2008|publisher=CBS News[/tpl]

===Cigar aficionado===

In the early 1990s, when the cigar boom was gaining momentum, Limbaugh was seen frequently with a cigar in hand and by the end of the 1990s, cigars had become Limbaugh's staple in many public appearances. Often starting segments of his show with the phrase, "Amid billowing clouds of fragrant and aromatic first-, second-, and sometimes third-hand premium cigar smoke" as well as mentioning a story print-out in his "formerly nicotine-stained fingers", cigars became a common topic of discussion. In the spring of 1994, Limbaugh appeared on the cover of the magazine Cigar Aficionado and shared the story of his conversion to cigars. He has since been a frequent participant in many events such as "The Big Smoke", hosted throughout the year by the magazine. Limbaugh has participated in many charity cigar auctions hosted by the magazine, and is known to talk frequently with his listeners about his and their cigar interests, preferences and recommendations. "I think cigars are just a tremendous addition to the enjoyment of life."[tpl]cite news|first=Mervyn| last=Rothstein|title=Rush's Judgment|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,18,00.html| publisher=Cigar Aficionado|accessdate=November 4, 2006[/tpl] He is also frequently seen in his studio smoking a cigar during his show.

===Deafness===

Rush Limbaugh has described himself as being "100 percent, totally deaf".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_101207/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush to Excellence Speech for WPHT-AM Philadelphia |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |date=October 11, 2007 |work=Transcript |accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl] In 2001, Limbaugh announced that he had lost most of his ability to hear: "I cannot hear television. I cannot hear music. I am, for all practical purposes, deaf – and it's happened in three months." He said that the condition was not genetic.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/10/08/politics/main314011.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Limbaugh Losing His Hearing | date=October 8, 2001[/tpl] On December 19, 2001, doctors at the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles were able to successfully restore a measure of his hearing through cochlear implant surgery.

When questioned whether Limbaugh's sudden hearing loss was caused by his addiction to opiates, his cochlear implant doctor, otolaryngologist Jennifer Derebery, said that it was possible but that there is no way to know for sure without performing tests that would destroy Limbaugh's hearing completely. "We don't know why some people, but apparently not most, who take large doses may lose their hearing".[tpl]cite web|title=Did Drugs Cause Limbaugh's Hearing Loss?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=128270&page=1|publisher=ABCNews|accessdate=August 15, 2012[/tpl]
In 2005, Limbaugh was forced to undergo "tuning" due to an "eye twitch", an apparent side-effect of cochlear implants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4hearingloss.com/archives/2005/04/rush_to_get_bio.html |title=Rush to get bionic tune up |publisher=4 Hearing Loss |date=April 28, 2005 |work=Transcript |accessdate=November 9, 2008[/tpl]
On April 8, 2014, on his radio program, Limbaugh announced his decision to 'go bilateral'.

==Controversies and criticisms==

===Michael J. Fox===

In October 2006 Limbaugh said Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, had exaggerated the effects of his affliction in political TV ad advocating for funding of stem cell research. Limbaugh said that Fox in the ad had been "shameless" in "moving all around and shaking", and Fox had not taken "his medication or he's acting, one of the two".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/24/AR2006102400691.html | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Montgomery | title=Rush Limbaugh On the Offensive Against Ad With Michael J. Fox | date=October 25, 2006[/tpl] Fox said "the irony of it is I was too medicated", adding that there was no way to predict how his symptoms would manifest. Limbaugh said he would apologize to Fox "bigley and hugely...if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/24/politics/main2121910.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Fox Responds To Limbaugh Accusation[/tpl] In 2012, Fox said Limbaugh in 2006 had acted on "bullying instincts" when "he said I faked it. I didn't fake it", and said Limbaugh's goal was to have him marginalized and shut down for his stem cell stance.[tpl]cite news| url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/15/clips-from-last-night-michael-j-fox-on-rush-limbaugh-meredith-vieira-and-richard-cohen-on-living-with-ms/?iref=allsearch | work=CNN | title=Clips From Last Night: Michael J.

===Phony soldiers===

Media Matters' reported radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in 2007 saying that Iraq War veterans opposed to the war as "the phony soldiers". Limbaugh later said that he was speaking of Jesse MacBeth, a soldier who falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but, in fact, had never seen combat. Limbaugh said Media Matters was trying to smear him with out of context and selectively edited comments. After Limbaugh published what he said was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters said that over a minute and 30 seconds of the transcript was omitted without "notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript."[tpl]cite web| title =Limbaugh falsely recasts "phony soldiers" smear| publisher =Media Matters| date=September 28, 2007| url =http://mediamatters.org/research/200709280010| accessdate = August 12, 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web| title =Limbaugh selectively edited "phony soldiers" clip, claimed it was "the entire transcript"| publisher =Media Matters| date=September 28, 2007| url =http://mediamatters.org/research/200709280009|accessdate = August 12, 2010 [/tpl] Limbaugh said during the minute and a half gap Media Matters had pointed out, he was waiting for relevant ABC news copy on the topic, and the transcript and audio edits were "for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything."[tpl]cite web| title =Limbaugh Makes His Case| publisher =The National Review Online|date=October 3, 2007| url =http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222373/limbaugh-makes-his-case/byron-york| accessdate = August 16, 2010[/tpl] Senator Harry Reid and 41 Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, signed a letter asking the CEO of Clear Channel to denounce Limbaugh.

===Sandra Fluke===

On February 29, 2012, Rush Limbaugh commented about contraceptive mandates and included mention of law student Sandra Fluke as a "slut" and "prostitute".
