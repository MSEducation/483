Hermosa Soberana (Spanish for Beautiful and Sovereign) was the national anthem of Nicaragua from 1893 until 1910. 
The anthem was dedicated to General José Santos Zelaya, and it was adopted as the national anthem in September 1893. The music was composed by Alejandro Cousin (a son-in-law of General Santos), who also composed the 1889-1893 national anthem. The author is not exactly known, but probably it was written by one of the following three poets: Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado. Although replaced in 1910, "Hermosa Soberana" is still popular as a patriotic song.[tpl]cite news | title = Nicaragua National Anthem (1893-1910) | url =http://www.nationalanthems.us/forum/YaBB.pl?num=1094147444 | accessdate = 2008-10-05[/tpl]
