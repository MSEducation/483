==Publication history==

The Marauders make their first appearance in Uncanny X-Men #210 during the 1986 crossover, the "Mutant Massacre", slaughtering a large percentage of the mutant community living beneath Manhattan known as the Morlocks. During their battles with the X-Men, X-Factor including the Norse God Thor, several Marauders are apparently killed; Riptide in Uncanny X-Men #211; Prism in X-Factor #10; and Blockbuster in The Mighty Thor #374. After the Mutant Massacre, Sabretooth attacked some kids in the tunnels in Daredevil #238.
In Uncanny X-Men #213, Sabretooth attacks Xavier's mansion while Malice succeeds in possessing Dazzler but is driven out in issue #214. Later in issue #219, the Marauders attack Polaris, whom Malice takes possession of and becomes leader over the Marauders. The Marauders then try to assassinate Madelyne Pryor in issues #221-222. It also shows flashbacks of them in X-Factor #39, and Uncanny X-Men #215.
During the 1989 crossover "Inferno", the dead Marauders mysteriously reappear alive in Uncanny X-Men #240 and battle the X-Men during the demonic invasion of Manhattan. Most of them perish here. Blockbuster, Malice, and Sabretooth later attack the X-Men at Xavier's mansion in issue #243.
X-Men #34 (vol. 2, July 1994) reveals that Sinister is able to clone the Marauders back to life; Gambit #8 (vol. 3, Sept. 1999) further reveals that all the clones have gene imprints that would shut them down if they turn against Sinister. In Gambit #9, the clone samples for Sabretooth were seemingly destroyed. However, in later issues of X-Force,X-Force vol. 3, #9 a clone of Sabretooth was shown.
The Marauders also chase after the mutant Threnody in X-Man issues #13-18-19 (March-Sept. 1996).
The 1996 miniseries, The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, features a band of criminals known as the Marauders during the 19th century, hired by Mister Sinister to kidnap homeless and deformed people on which to experiment.
Uncanny X-Men #350 (December 1997) reveals that it was Gambit who had organized the modern day Marauders, although he was never actually a member. It also says that it was he who brought them down to the Morlock tunnels. He had no idea of their intentions, and when they started killing all of them, all he could do is save a little girl named Sarah (later Marrow). This contradicts with previous versions of the story since in Uncanny X-Men #210, it was shown that the Marauders followed a young Morlock girl, Tommy. This is one of several contradictions between the two versions of the story.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=232 |title=UXN Presents...
