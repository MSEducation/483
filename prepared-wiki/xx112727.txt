Knoxville Raceway is a semi-banked 1/2 mile dirt oval raceway located at the Marion County Fairgrounds in Knoxville, Iowa, USA. Races at the "Sprint Car Capital of the World" are held on Saturday nights from April through September each year. Some special events may start as early as Wednesday and build up to Saturday. Regular events include 305 cubic inch, 360 cubic inch and 410 cubic inch sprint car racing. Each August, the Raceway holds the paramount sprint car event in the United States, the Knoxville Nationals. The track is governed by the 24-member fair board elected by Marion County residents.

==History==

The first weekly races were held at the Knoxville Raceway in 1954. After internal issues with the sanctioning body—the Southern Iowa Stock Car Racing Association—in 1956, Marion Robinson of Des Moines, Iowa was appointed as race promoter. During Robinson's tenure, the cars progressed from stock cars to modifieds to supermodifieds to  sprint cars. Robinson created what would become the Knoxville Nationals in 1961. The event took place over two days and featured a $5,000 purse. P. Ray Grimes took over in 1974, but when he was unable to perform his duties following a snowmobile accident in 1977, Ralph Capitani took over as race director and promoter. Under the leadership of Capitani, the racetrack rose to new heights. "Cappy" retired at the end of the 2011 season. 
In 2012 the duties of Race Director and Promoter were split into two positions.  Toby Kruse was hired as the track General Manager and Promoter and John McCoy was named Race Director. Kruse resigned in September of 2012.  In November of 2012 Brian Stickel was promoted as the General Manager and Promoter. Stickel had worked at the Knoxville Raceway as Director of Marketing and Sales for seven years prior.
