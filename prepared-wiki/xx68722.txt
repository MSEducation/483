==Biography==

===Formation and early career (1984–1990)===

After the breakup of his first band Nemesis, bassist Leif Edling started his own band under the name Candlemass with vocalist Johan Längqvist, drummer Matz Ekström, guitarist Mats "Mappe" Bjorkman and Klas Bergwall. Their first release, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus (1986), immediately secured their standing, positioning the band within metal circles, setting a milestone in the doom metal scene.allmusic ((( Candlemass > Biography ))) Following the band's debut album Längqvist was replaced by Messiah Marcolin. By the time the band entered the studio to record their second effort, Nightfall, in 1987, Bergwall and Ekström had left the band. Jan Lindh joined the band on drums, and Lars Johansson joined the band on guitars following the completion of the album.
Candlemass's next two albums were Ancient Dreams (1988) and Tales of Creation (1989). In 1990, the band released a live album Live. Shortly afterward, a dispute between the band members resulted in Messiah Marcolin's departure.

===New singer-era, hiatus and first reunion (1991–2003)===

After Marcolin left, Candlemass recruited vocalist Thomas Vikström and recorded Chapter VI (1992). The band then toured in support of that album. By 1994, Candlemass had called it quits, partly because Chapter VI was unsuccessful [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] and partially because Edling had formed another project under the name of Abstrakt Algebra. With Abstrakt Algebra not doing well, Leif suddenly recruited a new line-up under the name of Candlemass and recorded the album Dactylis Glomerata,[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Sept. 2008|date=September 2008[/tpl] which was a combination of songs for a new Abstrakt Algebra CD and some new material.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Sept. 2008|date=September 2008[/tpl] A year later the album From the 13th Sun was released.
In 2002, the members of a past Candlemass line-up reunited. They performed some well-received live shows[tpl]citation needed|date = January 2010[/tpl] and released another live album. Other albums released by the reformed band were remastered versions of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Nightfall, Ancient Dreams, and Tales of Creation. A DVD called Documents of Doom was released as well. The band was working on a new album and recorded some new songs while searching for a record label when differences arose again, resulting in Candlemass disbanding a second time. In the meantime, Leif Edling started a new project, Krux, with former Abstrakt Algebra singer Mats Levén and two members of Entombed.

===Second reunion (2004–2006)===

In November 2004, the band announced that they had re-united for the second time. They had recorded a new album, named simply Candlemass, with the same line-up. It was released in May 2005. They won a Swedish Grammy for it in 2005.
In 2006 the band announced that a new album was in preparation, to be released sometime in 2007. In October 2006, after much uncertainty regarding Messiah Marcolin's participation, it was settled that Messiah was out for good.

===Mats Levén as new singer and future (2012–present)===

On June 2, 2012, Candlemass announced via their website that Robert Lowe had left the band as vocalist, mainly due to the quality of the live performances and explained to be "a very difficult decision for the band", and would be replaced for the band's upcoming shows by long time friend and collaborator of Candlemass, Mats Levén (of Yngwie Malmsteen, Therion, Treat and At Vance fame, among others). Levén had earlier worked with Leif Edling in Abstrakt Algebra and Krux and sang on demos from the Candlemass and King of the Grey Islands sessions, found on the box set Doomology. In addition, keyboardist Per Wiberg (ex-Opeth, Spiritual Beggars) would also join the band on stage for these live shows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.candlemass.se/candlemass/2012/06/02/candlemass-singer-change/|title=CANDLEMASS SINGER CHANGE!|publisher=Candlemass.se|date=2012-06-02|accessdate=2012-06-02[/tpl]

They were featured in a list of the 100 greatest Swedish hard rock/metal bands of all time in a special jubilee edition, to celebrate the magazine's 100th issue. In connection with this, it was also revealed that Candlemass, along with death metal band Entombed (#2 on the list), were to perform jointly at a special jubilee concert in Stockholm arranged by the magazine.http://www.swedenrock.com/index.cfm?pg=85http://www.swedenrock.com/index.cfm?pg=55&cobView=99
