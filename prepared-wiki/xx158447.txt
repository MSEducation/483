Lindisfarne Anglican Grammar School is a co-educational private day school on the southern end of the Gold Coast, Australia, offering an integrated NSW curriculum from pre-school through to Year 12. The school has two campuses, pre-school through to Year 4 at Tweed Heads South, and Year 5 through to Year 12 in Terranora, New South Wales. It is located in the Anglican Diocese of Grafton.

==History==

Lindisfarne Anglican Grammar School was established in 1981 as a result of initiatives taken by the Rector and parishioners of St. Cuthbert's Church, Tweed Heads. The campus at Sunshine Avenue has progressively expanded its facilities and 1995 saw the growth into secondary years. In 1996 the Senior School relocated to its permanent site at Mahers Lane, Terranora, with the middle school joining it in 1997. The Pre-school opened at the Junior School Campus in 1998.
Development is ongoing at both campuses to house Lindisfarne’s expanding enrollment.

==Location==

Located in Terranora in the Tweed Valley hinterland, the school overlooks the Terranora Broadwater and out to the Pacific Ocean. Brisbane is one and a quarter hours north, and Byron Bay thirty minutes south. The Gold Coast Airport at Coolangatta is twenty minutes from the school.

==Education==

It is the leading[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Anglican co-educational school serving the Tweed Coast and southern Gold Coast and is the only grammar school based on or near the Gold Coast.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
While close to the Queensland border, Lindisfarne is distinctly a NSW school; it is registered and accredited by the NSW Board of Studies. The school offers the six key learning areas in the primary school and the eight key learning areas in secondary school leading to the award of the NSW Higher School Certificate in Year 12.
The school excels in the performing arts and sport. In addition it emphasizes academic achievement and structured programs in literacy. These extend from early literacy in the pre-school to tertiary literacy in Years 11 and 12.
Lindisfarne is the highest ranked school in the area based on the ranking provided by the Federal Government's My School website.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The school runs using a bi-week system, with week A differing to week B on the time table, repeating every fortnight.
The Accelerated Mathematics program offers students the opportunity to sacrifice an elective, so more lessons are invested in maths. In year 9 students will do both year 9 and 10 mathematics, with the possibility to 'drop-out' of the course at any time. The advantage of the course is during year 11 the students will complete their HSC maths, allowing more time and/or subjects in year 12. The HSC mark from year 11 will not count towards their ATAR if they pursue Maths Extension 2 (the highest maths available in NSW).
The Accelerated Physics program is identical, except it is run during year 10(Students will have better scientific foundations and mathematical abilities). The HSC course can be repeated if a student is unsatisfied with their score.

==Electives (9/10)==

Students are entitled to two electives, and may change them from year 9 to 10.

==Distance Education (Southern Cross Courses)==

HSC
Note: Students may be given class time, or can study Distance Ed. as a third elective.
Note that elective courses may not go ahead if subjects do not have enough participants.

==Pastoral Care==

From the Pre-School through to Year 6, Pastoral Care is provided by the students own teacher with the support of specialist teachers with which they have regular classes with throughout the week.
An explicit Pastoral Care Programme is delivered to students in years 7–10 in which topics are addressed such as resilience, bullying and harassment, how to cope with stress, loss, mental illness, self-esteem, confidence, self discipline, drug education and other issues of physical, emotional and social wellbeing. Students meet with their Pastoral Care teacher every day and are always available to discuss with them any issues, problems or triumphs they wish to share.
In addition to these dedicated Pastoral Care classes, further co-curricular and elective programmes which support Pastoral Care in the school include:

==Sport==

Students can choose to participate in a variety of sporting activities covering a broad range of capabilities. Junior School students have two sport lessons each week with a specialist sports teacher, senior school students can participate in sports such as rock climbing, surfing, fishing, hockey, beach yoga and AFL. The School is a member of the North Coast Sports Association and has won many Regional and Statewide competitions.
All students of Lindisfarne are placed into sport houses named after Christian saints. They are:
NB; In 2009 St Cuthbert house was added to the triad, giving students the option to swap houses. A negative stigma was associated with students who 'abandoned' their previous house to be in Cuthbert.

==Sport 'houses'==

Students are encouraged to participate and compete in house events, with the house gaining the most points via academic achievements, charitable events and sporting merit winning the house cups. For example, despite Barnabas' winning two of the three sporting events (Swimming Carnival, Cross-Country, Athletics Carnival), enough points were awarded in academic awards to displace them from their 'podium'.
In 2012, the House Tutor Group (HTG) system was implemented, a form of vertical integration of the grades 7–12. Originally shrouded with controversy, the five HTG classes (per house) consisted of a group of (seemingly) random individuals from each grade. In 2013, to accommodate new students and utilize staff without a HTG class, each house comprised six HTG classes.
Often referred to as BA1, BA2, BA3 and so forth (for Barnabas), or CU1, CU2, CU3 ect.(for Cuthbert). Staff house captains are heavily involved, to the extent of being a counselor if students have family difficulties or troubled peer relationships.
Each house in years 9–10 elects a Student Representative Counsel (SRC) member. Every fortnight, SRC members participate in meetings to air concerns or notions their peers have proposed. During meetings school maintenance, charities and 'Mufti Days' (free uniform) are voted on and approved by a staff member. Students are delegated tasks within their house, usually to fund-raise for charities or to build enthusiasm for various policies (such as giving leaving Year 12s 'good-bye' boxes with memoirs, sweets and jokes).
