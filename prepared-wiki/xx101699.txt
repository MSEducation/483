[[Oliguria]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs: Urinary system

Oliguria or hypouresis (both names from roots meaning "not enough urine") is the low output of urine.[tpl]DorlandsDict|/six/000074712|oliguria[/tpl] In humans, it is clinically classified as an output more than 100 ml/day but less than 400ml/day.Boon et al, Davidson's Principles & Practice of Medicine (20th Ed), p475 The decreased output of urine may be a sign of dehydration, renal failure, hypovolemic shock, HHNS hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, urinary obstruction/urinary retention, DKA, pre-eclampsia, and urinary tract infections, among other conditions.
The most extreme type of Oliguria is called anuria, which represents an absence of urine, clinically classified as below 50ml/day.

==Definition==

Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants,[tpl]cite journal | author = Klahr S, Miller S | title = Acute oliguria | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 338 | issue = 10 | pages = 671–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9486997 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199803053381007[/tpl] Free Full Text. less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL or 500 mLMerck manuals > Oliguria Last full review/revision March 2009 by Soumitra R. Eachempati per 24h in adults - this equals 17 or 21 mL/hour. For example, in an adult weighing 70 kg it equals 0.24 or 0.3 mL/hour/kg. Alternatively, however, the value of 0.5 mL/kg/h is commonly used to define oliguria in adults as well.
Olig- (or oligo-) is a Greek prefix meaning small or few.http://biology.about.com/od/prefixesandsuffixeso/g/blo3.htm
Anuria is defined as less than 50mL urine output per day.

==Testing==

Perform ultrasound examination of the kidney to rule out obstructive processes.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing oliguria can be categorized globally in three different categories:

===Postoperative oliguria===

Patients usually have decrease in urine output after a major operation that may be a normal physiological response to:

==Oliguria in infants==

Oliguria, when defined as less than 1 mL/kg/h, in infants is not considered to be a reliable sign of renal failure.[tpl]cite journal | author = Arant B | title = Postnatal development of renal function during the first year of life | journal = Pediatr Nephrol | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–13 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3153294 | doi = 10.1007/BF00849229[/tpl]
