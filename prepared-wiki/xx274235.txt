[[Brallier Formation]]

CATEGORIES: Geology of Pennsylvania, Devonian, Shale, Geologic formations of the United States

The Devonian Brallier Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia.

==Description==

The Brallier Formation was described by Charles Butts in 1918 as a fine-grained, siliceous shale with few fine-grained sandstone layers, from outcrops in central Pennsylvania.  Others expanded usage of the term to rocks in other states.

===Stratigraphy===

The Brallier is roughly equivalent to the Scherr Formation.
The contact with the underlying Harrell Formation is generally gradational.

===Fossils===

Hasson and Dennison reported the following fossils from outcrops of the lower Brallier at Keyser, West Virginia, Ridgeville, West Virginia, and McCoole, Maryland:Hasson, Kenneth O., and Dennison, John M., 1978, STRATIGRAPHY OF THE DEVONIAN HARRELL AND MILLBORO SHALES IN PARTS OF PENNSYLVANIA, MARYLAND, WEST VIRGINIA, AND VIRGINIA, Project Final Report for Energy Research and Development Administration Contract #EY-77-C-21-8153, May 1978 http://www.netl.doe.gov/KMD/cds/disk41/C-%20Basin%20Analysis/Stratigraphy%20of%20the%20Devonian%20Harrell%20and%20Millboro%20Shales%20in%20.pdf

===Notable Exposures===

Type locality is at a railway station 6 miles northeast of Everett, Bedford County, Pennsylvania.

==Age==

Relative age dating places the Brallier in the late Devonian.
