[[First Earth Battalion]]

CATEGORIES: New Age, 20th-century military history of the United States

The First Earth Battalion was the name proposed by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon, a U.S. soldier who had served in Vietnam, for his idea of a new military of supersoldiers to be organized along New Age lines.

==The Men Who Stare at Goats==

According to the book The Men Who Stare at Goats by journalist Jon Ronson, Channon spent time in the 1970s with many of the people in California credited with starting the human potential movement, and subsequently wrote an operations manual for a First Earth Battalion. The manual was a 125-page mixture of drawings, graphs, maps, polemical essays and point-by-point redesigns of every aspect of military life. Channon imagined new battlefield uniform would include pouches for ginseng regulators, divining tools, food stuffs to enhance night vision, and a loud speaker that would automatically emit "indigenous music and words of peace."Thomas, B.

A movie based on the book—released in Autumn 2009—starring George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, fictionalized the First Earth Battalion as the New Earth Army.

==Beliefs==

Channon believed the Army can be the principal moral and ethical basis on which politics can harmonize in the name of the Earth. Channon declared the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance was to the planet earth.Grant De Pauw, L. (2000). Battle Cries and Lullabies: Women in War from Prehistory to the Present. Oklahoma City, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. Channon envisioned the First Earth Battalion would organize itself informally: uniforms without uniformity, structure without status, and unity powered by diversity, and members would be multicultural, with each race contributing to "rainbow power".McRae, R.F. (1984). Mind Wars: The True Story of Government Research into the Military Potential of Psychic Weapons. New York: St. Martin's Press. Channon proposed as a guiding principle that members of the First Earth Battalion seek nondestructive methods of conflict resolution because their first loyalty is to the planet.Ferguson, M. (1980).

===Warrior Monk===

Channon coined the term "warrior monk" for potential members of the First Earth Battalion.Druckman, D., & Swets, J.A. (eds.). (1988). Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.

===Credo===

According to the book Mind Wars by Ronald McRae, each member of the First Earth Battalion would be sworn to uphold a credo of "high commandos and guerrilla gurus":
