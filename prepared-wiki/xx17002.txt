Mont Blanc ([tpl]IPA-fr|mɔ̃.blɑ̃[/tpl]) or Monte Bianco ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈmonte ˈbjaŋko[/tpl]), both meaning "White Mountain", is the highest mountain in the Alps and the European Union.The Caucasus mountains, which include higher peaks than Mont Blanc, are included on many political maps of Europe, although the case can be made that they are geographically and culturally more Asian than European. Excluding the Caucasus, Mont Blanc is the highest summit in Europe. It rises [tpl]convert|4810|m|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl]Mont Blanc shrinks by 45cm in two years above sea level and is ranked 11th in the world in topographic prominence. It is also sometimes known as La Dame blanche (French for "the White Lady") or Il Bianco (Italian for "the White One").
The mountain lies in a range called the Graian Alps, between the regions of Aosta Valley, Italy, and Haute-Savoie, France. The location of the summit is on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy and the valleys of Montjoie Valley and Arve Valley in France.  The Mont Blanc massif is popular for mountaineering, hiking, skiing, and snowboarding.
The three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy, and both Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France — the latter being the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix, through the Col du Géant.  Begun in 1957 and completed in 1965, the 11.6 km (7¼ mi) Mont Blanc Tunnel runs beneath the mountain between these two countries and is one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes.

==History==

The first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc was on 8 August 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who gave a reward for the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering.[tpl]cite web|url=http://climbing.about.com/od/mountainclimbing/a/MontBlanc.htm|title=Facts About Mont Blanc — Highest Mountain in Western Europe|last=Green|first=Stewart|publisher=About.com|accessdate=7 August 2011[/tpl] The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808.
Now the summit is ascended by an average 20,000 mountaineer-tourists each year and could be considered an easy, yet long, ascent for someone who is well trained and used to the altitude. This impression is reinforced by the fact that from l'Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being merely [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] higher. While seeming deceptively close, La Voie des 3 Monts route (known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes) requires much ascent and descent before the final section of the climb is reached and the last 1000 m push to the summit is undertaken.
There are deaths on Mont Blanc every year, and on the busiest weekends, normally around August, the local rescue service performs an average of 12 missions, mostly directed towards people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. There are routes that require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering, a guide (or at least a veteran mountaineer), and proper equipment. It is a long course that includes delicate passages and the hazard of rock slides. Also, at least one night at the refuge is required to acclimatize to the altitude; less could lead to altitude sickness and possible death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Muza, SR; Fulco, CS; Cymerman, A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide. |journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM-TN-04-05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Cymerman, A; Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments.

===Ownership of the summit===

Since the French Revolution the issue of the ownership of the summit has spurred many debates. Previously, the entire mountain had formed part of the Duchy of Savoy and since 1723 of the Kingdom of Sardinia, one of the pre-unitarian Italian states.Historical map  After Napoleon's victories in Italy, Piedmont was forced to cede Savoy and Nice to France. In article 4 of this treaty it says: "The border between the Sardinian kingdom and the departments of the French Republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the Piedmont side, of the summits, peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned, as well as the intermediary peaks, knowing: starting from the point where the borders of Faucigny, the Duchy of Aoust and the Valais, to the extremity of the glaciers or Monts-Maudits: first the peaks or plateaus of the Alps, to the rising edge of the Col-Mayor". This act is even more confusing, because it states that the border should be visible from the town of Chamonix and Courmayeur. The summit is not visible from Courmayeur, because part of the mountain lower down obscures it.
After Napoleonic Wars and French occupation, with the Congress of Vienna the King of Sardinia was restored in Savoy, Nice and Piedmont, his traditional territories. Already inaccurate at the time, the Treaty of Paris was no longer valid. Forty-five years later, after the Second Italian War of Independence, it was replaced by a new legal act. This act was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860  by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoy (following the French neutrality for the plebiscites held in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, against the Pope's will). For the first time, with the consent of the king of Sardinia, Mont Blanc is located on the border with France. A demarcation agreement, signed on 7 March 1861, defines the "new border".
Currently this act and the maps attached is still legally valid both for the French Government and the Italian one.Assemblée Nationale: traité franco-italien signé à Turin le 26 mars 1860 One of the prints from the Sarde Atlas,:Image:1823 Mont Blanc 1.jpg made in 1823 and positions the border exactly on the summit edge of the mountain (and measures it to be [tpl]convert|4804|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high). The convention of 7 March 1861 recognises this through an attached map, taking into consideration the limits of the massif, and drawing the border on the icecap of Mont Blanc, and therefore makes it both French and Italian. Watershed analysis of modern topographic mapping not only places the main summit on the border, but also suggests that the border should follow a line northwards from the main summit towards Mont Maudit, leaving the south east ridge to Mont Blanc de Courmayeur wholly within Italy. Despite the fact that the Franco-Italian border was redefined in both 1947 and 1963, the commission made up of both Italians and French ignored the Mont Blanc issue. The current situation sees administration of the mountain being shared between the Italian town of Courmayeur and the French town of St Gervais les Bains, although the larger part of the mountain lies within the commune of the latter.

===Vallot cabin===

The first real scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist-meteorologist Joseph Vallot at the end of the 19th century. He wanted to stay near the top of the summit, so he had to build his own permanent cabin.

===Janssen observatory===

In 1891, Pierre Janssen, an astronomer and the director of the Meudon astrophysical observatory, envisaged the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could find strong foundations. The Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug down [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] but found nothing solid, so Eiffel gave up.
Despite this, the observatory was built in 1893.
During the cold wave of January 1893 a temperature of [tpl]convert|-43|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] was recorded on Mont Blanc, being the lowest ever recorded there.
Levers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Janssen’s death) a crevasse started opening under the observatory and it was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved in extremis.

===Air crashes===

The mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes; Air India Flight 245 in 1950 The glacier des Bossons : plane crashes: and Air India Flight 101 in 1966. Both planes were approaching Geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people, respectively, died.BBC on this day 24 January 1966: 117 die in Air India tragedy The latter passengers included top nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha, known as the "father" of India's nuclear programme.Diplomatic bag contents revealed

===Tunnel===

In 1946 a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain. The Mont Blanc tunnel would connect Chamonix, France and Courmayeur, Italy and become one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes between the two countries. In 1965 the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of 11,611 metres (7.215 mi).Timeline of the Mont Blanc Tunnel

====1999 Disaster====

In 1999 a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain. In total 39 people were killed when the fire raged out of control. The tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety, reopening after 3 years.Mont Blanc Tunnel at age 46

==Elevation==

The summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice and snow dome whose thickness varies. No exact and permanent summit elevation can therefore be determined, though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates.
For a long time its official elevation was [tpl]convert|4807|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Then in 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be [tpl]convert|4810.40|m|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl].
After the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists re-measured the height on 6 and 7 September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the elevation was [tpl]convert|4808.45|m|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl], and the peak was [tpl]convert|75|cm|in[/tpl] away from where it had been in 2002.
After these results were published, more than 500 points were measured, to assess the effects of climate change and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points. From then on the elevation of the mountain has been measured every two years.
The interpretation that the heatwave had caused this fluctuation is disputed because the heatwave is known not to have significantly affected the glaciers above [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The height and position of the summit could have been moved by general glacial forces. At this elevation, the temperatures rarely rise above [tpl]convert|0|C|F|lk=on[/tpl]. During the summer of 2003, the temperature rose to [tpl]convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl], and even [tpl]convert|3|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl], but this would not have been enough for the ice, which stayed at [tpl]convert|-15|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl], to melt.
The summit was measured again in 2005, and the results were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be [tpl]convert|4808.75|m|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] more than the previous recorded height. The actual rock summit was found to be at [tpl]convert|4792|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], some [tpl]convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] away from the ice-covered summit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.cnrs.fr/en/309.htm?debut=256|title=The rock summit of the Mont Blanc, 40 m west of the ice summit|last=Vincent|first=Christian|date=2004-08-02|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|accessdate=2008-08-08[/tpl]
In 2007 the summit was measured at [tpl]convert|4810.9|m|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] and in 2009 at [tpl]convert|4810.45|m|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl].

==Climbing routes==

Blanc Massif averages nearly 100 fatalities a year with published estimate of 6,000-8,000 alpinist fatalities in total. (The High Mountains of the Alps, Dumler, 1994). There are several classic climbing routes to the summit of Mont Blanc:Routes description, from camptocamp.org
From the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.

==Protection==

The Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and its cultural importance, considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1431/|title=Massif du Mont Blanc|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=2011-01-10[/tpl] It would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to make a request to UNESCO for it to be listed.
Mont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, and for this reason, some view it as threatened[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]. Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book Le versant noir du mont Blanc (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.pro-mont-blanc.org
In 2007, Europe's two highest toilets (at a height of 4,260 metres, 13,976 feet) were helicoptered to the top of Mont Blanc. They are also serviced by helicopter. They will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, helping to alleviate the discharge of urine and faeces that spreads down the mountain face with the spring thaw, and turns it into 'Mont Noir'.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2429287.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081208143034/http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2429287.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |publisher=Ananova |title=Europe's highest toilet |accessdate=2011-08-20[/tpl]
