Tomáš "Vosa" Sršeň (born August 25, 1966 in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia) is a retired Czech professional ice hockey left wing who played most of his career in Europe.
Sršeň started his career with HC Zetor Brno in 1985, and played for his home country in the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.  He was selected in the seventh round of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers, but stayed in Czechoslovakia for three more seasons, playing for Zetor and for HC Dukla Jihlava.
Sršeň made his National Hockey League debut for the Oilers in the 1990–91 season, but only appeared in two games for the club, registering no scoring points.  He spent most of the season, and all of the next, with the minor league affiliate Cape Breton Oilers.
Sršeň returned to Europe for the 1992–93 season, playing with Leksands IF and then Rögle BK in the Swedish Elitserien.  For Rögle, he won the Håkan Loob Trophy as the league's top scorer with 28 goals in the 1993–94 season. He was a member of the Czech Republic national team at the 1994 Winter Olympics and at the 1994 and 1995 World Championships.  He returned to his home country during the 1994–95 season and played for HC Vsetín until 1999.  During these years, his team won five consecutive championships of the Czech Extraliga.  He played for several more teams in the Czech Republic, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, and the Italian Serie A before retiring in 2003.
