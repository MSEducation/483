[[Fifty øre (Danish coin)]]

CATEGORIES: Coins of Denmark, Numismatics

The fifty øre coin is the smallest-denomination coin of the Danish krone. Since the removal of the 25 øre coin in 2008, it has been the only Danish coin with a face value of under one krone.

==Design==

The design is almost identical to the 25 øre coin issued in 1991, the only differences being the face value of the coin and the size.[tpl]cite web | author=Nationalbanken | url=http://nationalbanken.dk/DNUK/NotesAndCoins.nsf/side/50-oere_coin_!OpenDocument | title=50-øre coin | accessdate=2008-05-21 | authorlink=Danmarks Nationalbank[/tpl]

==History==

The first coin of the denomination of half of a krone was a ½ krone coin issued in 1924, measuring 20mm in diameter and 2mm in thickness. It featured on its obverse the monogram of King Christian X of Denmark, and the crown on the reverse. It was made of aluminium bronze and shared its design with the krone coin of the time. Its last minting was in 1940http://worldcoingallery.com/countries/display.php?image=img4/54-831&desc=Denmark km831.1 1/2 Krone (1924-1940)&query=Denmark  and it was demonetised on 31 December 1942.http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces14514.html
The present fifty øre coin was introduced into circulation on 3 July 1989 after the demonetisation of the five and ten øre coins. Its obverse features the crown of King Christian V of Denmark. The coin is composed of a bronze of 97% copper, 2.5% zinc and 0.5% tin.
