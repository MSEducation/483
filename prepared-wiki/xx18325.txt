[[Substantia nigra]]

CATEGORIES: Midbrain, Basal ganglia

The substantia nigra is a brain structure located in the mesencephalon (midbrain) that plays an important role in reward, addiction, and movement. Substantia nigra is Latin for "black substance", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02251241 |title=Neuromelanin synthesis in rat and human substantia nigra |year=1990 |last1=Rabey |first1=J.

Although the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta and pars reticulata. The pars compacta serves mainly as an input to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the striatum with dopamine. The pars reticulata, on the other hand, serves mainly as an output, conveying signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures.

==Anatomy==

The substantia nigra, along with four other nuclei, is part of the basal ganglia. It is the largest nucleus in the midbrain, lying dorsal to the cerebral peduncles. Humans have two substantiae nigrae, one on each side of the midline.
The substantia nigra is divided into two parts: the pars reticulata and pars compacta, which lies medial to the pars reticulata. Sometimes a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though its is usually classified as part of the pars reticulata. The pars reticulata and the internal globus pallidus are separated by the internal capsule.[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Pars reticulata===

The pars reticulata bears a strong structural and functional resemblance to the internal part of the globus pallidus. The two are sometimes considered parts of the same structure, separated by the white matter of the internal capsule. Like those of the globus pallidus, the neurons in pars reticulata are mainly GABAergic.[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl]

====Afferent connections====

The main input to the pars reticulata derives from the striatum. It comes by two routes, known as the direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly to pars reticulata. The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the globus pallidus; a GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, and a glutamatergic projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the pars reticulata.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/cne.901800102 |title=Efferent projections of the subthalamic nucleus: An autoradiographic study in monkey and cat |year=1978 |last1=Nauta |first1=Haring J. W. |last2=Cole |first2=Monroe |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=180 |pages=1–16 |pmid=418083 |issue=1[/tpl][tpl]better source|date=November 2012[/tpl] Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the pars reticulata but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: They are tightly intermingled but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.

====Efferent connections====

There are significant projections to the thalamus (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), superior colliculus, and other caudal nuclei from the pars reticulata (the nigrothalamic pathway),[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/cne.901650402 |title=Nigrothalamic projections in the monkey demonstrated by autoradiographic technics |year=1976 |last1=Carpenter |first1=Malcolm B. |last2=Nakano |first2=Katsuma |last3=Kim |first3=Ronald |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=165 |issue=4 |pages=401–15 |pmid=57125[/tpl] which use GABA as their neurotransmitter. In addition, these neurons form up to five collaterals that branch within both the pars compacta and pars reticulata, likely modulating dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00235891 |title=Neuronal interactions in the substantia nigra pars reticulata through axon collaterals of the projection neurons |year=1982 |last1=Deniau |first1=J.M. |last2=Kitai |first2=S.T. |last3=Donoghue |first3=J.P. |last4=Grofova |first4=I. |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=47[/tpl]

==Function==

The substantia nigra is an important player in brain function, in particular, in eye movement, motor planning, reward-seeking, learning, and addiction. Many of the substantia nigra's effects are mediated through the striatum. The nigral dopaminergic input to the striatum via the nigrostriatal pathway is intimately linked with the striatum's function.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.185 |title=Dopaminergic Modulation of Neuronal Excitability in the Striatum and Nucleus Accumbens |year=2000 |last1=Nicola |first1=Saleem M. |last2=Surmeier |first2=D. James |last3=Malenka |first3=Robert C. |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=23 |pages=185–215 |pmid=10845063[/tpl] The co-dependence between the striatum and substantia nigra can be seen in this way: when the substantia nigra is electrically stimulated, no movement occurs; however, the symptoms of nigral degeneration due to Parkinson's is a poignant example of the substantia nigra's influence on movement. In addition to striatum-mediated functions, the substantia nigra also serves as a major source of GABAergic inhibition to various brain targets.

===Pars reticulata===

The pars reticulata of the substantia nigra is an important processing center in the basal ganglia. The GABAergic neurons in the pars reticulata convey the final processed signals of the basal ganglia to the thalamus and superior colliculus. In addition, the pars reticulata also inhibits dopaminergic activity in the pars compacta via axon collaterals, although the functional organization of these connections remains unclear.
The GABAergic neurons of the pars reticulata spontaneously fire action potentials. In rats, the frequency of action potentials is roughly 25 Hz.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03699.x |title=Subregional changes in discharge rate, pattern, and drug sensitivity of putative GABAergic nigral neurons in the kindling model of epilepsy |year=2004 |last1=Gernert |first1=Manuela |last2=Fedrowitz |first2=Maren |last3=Wlaz |first3=Piotr |last4=Löscher |first4=Wolfgang |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=2377–86 |pmid=15525279[/tpl] The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=11896175 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11896175 |year=2002 |last1=Sato |first1=M |last2=Hikosaka |first2=O |title=Role of primate substantia nigra pars reticulata in reward-oriented saccadic eye movement |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=2363–73 |journal=The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience[/tpl] The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials. However, lesion of the subthalamic nucleus leads to only a 20% decrease in pars reticulata firing rate, suggesting that the generation of action potentials in the pars reticulata is largely autonomous,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/syn.20064 |title=Subthalamic nucleus lesions alter basal and dopamine agonist stimulated electrophysiological output from the rat basal ganglia |year=2004 |last1=Zahr |first1=Natalie May |last2=Martin |first2=Lynn Pauline |last3=Waszczak |first3=Barbara Lee |journal=Synapse |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=119–28 |pmid=15352137[/tpl] as exemplified by the pars reticulata's  role in saccadic eye movement. A group of GABAergic neurons from the pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus, exhibiting a high level of sustained inhibitory activity.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=6864250 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6864250 |year=1983 |last1=Hikosaka |first1=O |last2=Wurtz |first2=RH |title=Visual and oculomotor functions of monkey substantia nigra pars reticulata. III. Memory-contingent visual and saccade responses |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=1268–84 |journal=Journal of neurophysiology[/tpl] Projections from the caudate nucleus to the superior colliculus also modulate saccadic eye movement.
Altered patterns of pars reticulata firing such as single-spike or burst firing are found in Parkinson's disease[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00910.x |title=Substantia nigra pars reticulata units in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats: Responses to striatal D2 dopamine receptor stimulation and subthalamic lesions |year=2000 |last1=Tseng |first1=Kuei Y. |last2=Riquelme |first2=Luis A. |last3=Belforte |first3=Juan E. |last4=Pazo |first4=Jorge H. |last5=Murer |first5=M.

===Pars compacta===

The most prominent function of the pars compacta is motor control,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00505805 |title=Pars compacta of the substantia nigra modulates motor activity but is not involved importantly in regulating food and water intake |year=1980 |last1=Hodge |first1=Gordon K. |last2=Butcher |first2=Larry L. |journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology |volume=313 |pages=51–67 |pmid=7207636 |issue=1[/tpl] though the substantia nigra's role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. However, lack of pars compacta neurons has a large influence on movement, as evidenced by the symptoms of Parkinson's. The motor role of the pars compacta may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.01.084 |title=Differential behavioral effects of partial bilateral lesions of ventral tegmental area or substantia nigra pars compacta in rats |year=2008 |last1=Pioli |first1=E.Y. |last2=Meissner |first2=W. |last3=Sohr |first3=R. |last4=Gross |first4=C.E. |last5=Bezard |first5=E. |last6=Bioulac |first6=B.H. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=153 |issue=4 |pages=1213–24 |pmid=18455318[/tpl]
The pars compacta is heavily involved in learned responses to stimuli. In primates, dopaminergic neuron activity increases in the nigrostriatal pathway when a new stimulus is presented.[tpl]cite journal |title=Responses of monkey dopamine neurons during learning of behavioral reactions |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/1/145 |author=Ljungberg, T; Apicella, P; Schultz, W |volume=67 |issue=1 |journal=J Neurophysio |pages=145–63 |date= January 1, 1992 |pmid=1552316 [/tpl] Dopaminergic activity decreases with repeated stimulus presentation. However, behaviorally significant stimulus presentation (such as classical conditioning, where a reward is presented) continues to activate the dopaminergic neurons, which has been used to explain the addictiveness of drugs. The pars compacta is also important in spatial learning, the observations about one's environment and location in space. Lesions in the pars compacta lead to learning deficits in repeating identical movements,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.120.6.1279 |title=Place learning strategy of substantia nigra pars compacta-lesioned rats |year=2006 |last1=Da Cunha |first1=Claudio |last2=Silva |first2=Marcio H. C. |last3=Wietzikoski |first3=Samantha |last4=Wietzikoski |first4=Evellyn C. |last5=Ferro |first5=Marcelo M. |last6=Kouzmine |first6=Ivana |last7=Canteras |first7=Newton S. |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=1279–84 |pmid=17201473[/tpl] and some studies point to its involvement in a dorsal striatal-dependent, response-based memory system that functions relatively independent of the hippocampus, which is traditionally believed to subserve spatial or episodic-like memory functions.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1074-7427(03)00008-X |title=Evidence for the substantia nigra pars compacta as an essential component of a memory system independent of the hippocampal memory system |year=2003 |last1=Da Cunha |first1=Claudio |last2=Wietzikoski |first2=Samantha |last3=Wietzikoski |first3=Evellyn C |last4=Miyoshi |first4=Edmar |last5=Ferro |first5=Marcelo M |last6=Anselmo-Franci |first6=Janete A |last7=Canteras |first7=Newton S |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=236–42 |pmid=12676522[/tpl]
The pars compacta also plays a role in temporal processing and is activated during time reproduction. Lesions in the pars compacta leads to temporal deficits.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200001)22:13.0.CO;2-E |title=Neuropsychological mechanisms of interval timing behavior |year=2000 |last1=Matell |first1=Matthew S. |last2=Meck |first2=Warren H. |journal=BioEssays |volume=22 |pages=94–103 |pmid=10649295 |issue=1[/tpl] As of late, the pars compacta has been suspected of regulating the sleep-wake cycle,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000513 |title=The Role of the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta in Regulating Sleep Patterns in Rats |year=2007 |editor1-last=Brosnan |editor1-first=Sarah |last1=Lima |first1=Marcelo M.S. |last2=Andersen |first2=Monica L. |last3=Reksidler |first3=Angela B. |last4=Vital |first4=Maria A.B.F. |last5=Tufik |first5=Sergio |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=e513 |pmid=17551593 |pmc=1876809[/tpl] which is consistent with symptoms such as insomnia and REM sleep disturbances that are reported by patients with Parkinson's disease. Even so, partial dopamine deficits that do not affect motor control can lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, especially REM-like patterns of neural activity while awake, especially in the hippocampus.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1767-06.2006 |title=Dopaminergic Control of Sleep-Wake States |year=2006 |last1=Dzirasa |first1=K. |last2=Ribeiro |first2=S. |last3=Costa |first3=R. |last4=Santos |first4=L.

==Pathophysiology==

The substantia nigra is critical in the development of many disases, including Parkinson's disease.

===Parkinson's disease===

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized, in part, by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, akinesia, bradykinesia, and stiffness.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.131045 |title=Parkinson's disease: Clinical features and diagnosis |year=2008 |last1=Jankovic |first1=J |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=368–76 |pmid=18344392[/tpl] Other symptoms include disturbances to posture, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and depressed mood.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/mds.20460 |title=Nonmotor complications in Parkinson's disease |year=2005 |last1=Adler |first1=Charles H. |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=20 |pages=S23–9 |pmid=15822106[/tpl]
The cause of death of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta is unknown. However, some contributions to the unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta have been identified. For one, dopaminergic neurons show abnormalities in mitochondrial complex 1, causing aggregation of alpha-synuclein; this can result in abnormal protein handling and neuron death.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1087753 |title=Molecular Pathways of Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease |year=2003 |last1=Dawson |first1=T. M. |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5646 |pages=819–22 |pmid=14593166 |last2=Dawson |first2=VL[/tpl] Secondly, dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta contain less calbindin than other dopaminergic neurons.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1006/neur.1996.0042 |title=Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons in the Mouse that Contain Calbindin-D28kExhibit Reduced Vulnerability to MPTP-induced Neurodegeneration |year=1996 |last1=Liang |first1=Chang-Lin |last2=Sinton |first2=Christopher M. |last3=Sonsalla |first3=Patricia K. |last4=German |first4=Dwight C. |journal=Neurodegeneration |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=313–8 |pmid=9117542[/tpl] Calbindin is a protein involved in calcium ion transport within cells, and excess calcium in cells is toxic. The calbindin theory would explain the high cytotoxicity of Parkinson's in the substantia nigra compared to the ventral tegmental area. Regardless of the cause of neuronal death, the plasticity of the pars compacta is very robust; Parkinsonian symptoms do not appear until up to 50-80% of pars compacta dopaminergic neurons have died.Interview. Yoland Smith, PhD[tpl]vs|date=January 2014[/tpl] Most of this plasticity occurs at the neurochemical level; dopamine transport systems are slowed, allowing dopamine to linger for longer periods of time in the chemical synapses in the striatum.

===Schizophrenia===

Increased levels of dopamine have long been implicated in the development of schizophrenia.[tpl]cite book |last1=van Rossum |first1=J |chapter=The significance of dopamine-receptor blockade for the action of neuroleptic drugs |year=1967 |editor1-last=Brill |editor1-first=H |editor2-last=Cole |editor2-first=J |editor3-last=Deniker |editor3-first=P |editor4-last=Hippius |editor4-first=H |editor5-last=Bradley |editor5-first=P B |pages=321–9 |title=Neuropsychopharmacology, Proceedings Fifth Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum |oclc=458719[/tpl] However, much debate continues to this day surrounding this dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Despite the controversy, dopamine antagonists remain a standard and successful treatment for schizophrenia. These antagonists include first generation (typical) antipsychotics such as butyrophenones, phenothiazines, and thioxanthenes. These drugs have largely been replaced by second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as clozapine and paliperidone. It should be noted that, in general, these drugs do not act on dopamine-producing neurons themselves, but on the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron.
Other, non-pharmacological evidence in support of the dopamine hypothesis relating to the substantia nigra include structural changes in the pars compacta, such as reduction in synaptic terminal size.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02465329 |title=Synaptic contacts in schizophrenia: Studies using immunocytochemical identification of dopaminergic neurons |year=1999 |last1=Kolomeets |first1=N. S. |last2=Uranova |first2=N. A. |journal=Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=217–21 |pmid=10432512[/tpl] Other changes in the substantia nigra include increased expression of NMDA receptors in the substantia nigra, and reduced dysbindin expression. Increased NMDA receptors may point to the involvement of glutamate-dopamine interactions in schizophrenia. Dysbindin, which has been (controversially) linked to schizophrenia, may regulate dopamine release, and low expression of dysbindin in the substantia nigra may be important in schizophrenia etiology.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.04.163 |title=Hyperactivation of midbrain dopaminergic system in schizophrenia could be attributed to the down-regulation of dysbindin |year=2006 |last1=Kumamoto |first1=Natsuko |last2=Matsuzaki |first2=Shinsuke |last3=Inoue |first3=Kiyoshi |last4=Hattori |first4=Tsuyoshi |last5=Shimizu |first5=Shoko |last6=Hashimoto |first6=Ryota |last7=Yamatodani |first7=Atsushi |last8=Katayama |first8=Taiichi |last9=Tohyama |first9=Masaya |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=345 |issue=2 |pages=904–9 |pmid=16701550|display-authors=9 [/tpl] Due to the changes to the substantia nigra in the schizophrenic brain, it may eventually be possible to use specific imaging techniques (such as melanin-specific imaging) to detect physiological signs of schizophrenia in the substantia nigra.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.03.021 |title=Use of Neuromelanin-Sensitive MRI to Distinguish Schizophrenic and Depressive Patients and Healthy Individuals Based on Signal Alterations in the Substantia Nigra and Locus Ceruleus |year=2008 |last1=Shibata |first1=Eri |last2=Sasaki |first2=Makoto |last3=Tohyama |first3=Koujiro |last4=Otsuka |first4=Kotaro |last5=Endoh |first5=Jin |last6=Terayama |first6=Yasuo |last7=Sakai |first7=Akio |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=401–6 |pmid=18452894[/tpl]

==Chemical modification of the substantia nigra==

Chemical manipulation and modification of the substantia nigra is important in the fields of neuropharmacology and toxicology. Various compounds such as levodopa and MPTP are used in the treatment and study of Parkinson's disease, and many other drugs have effects on the substantia nigra.

===Amphetamine and trace amines===

Studies have shown that, in certain brain regions, amphetamine and trace amines increase the concentrations of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron. The various mechanisms by which amphetamine and trace amines affect dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively, and are known to involve both DAT and VMAT2.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.07109.x |title=The emerging role of trace amine-associated receptor 1 in the functional regulation of monoamine transporters and dopaminergic activity |year=2011 |last1=Miller |first1=Gregory M. |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=164–76 |pmid=21073468 |pmc=3005101[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Amphetamine | url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00182#targets | work=DrugBank | publisher= University of Alberta | accessdate=13 October 2013 | date=8 February 2013 | section=Targets [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05906.x |title=VMAT2: A dynamic regulator of brain monoaminergic neuronal function interacting with drugs of abuse |year=2011 |last1=Eiden |first1=Lee E. |last2=Weihe |first2=Eberhard |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1216 |pages=86–98 |pmid=21272013[/tpl]  Amphetamine is similar in structure to dopamine and trace amines; as a consequence, it can enter the presynaptic neuron via [tpl]abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter[/tpl] as well as by diffusing through the neural membrane directly. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine and trace amines activate TAAR1, which, through protein kinase signaling, induces dopamine efflux, phosphorylation-dependent [tpl]abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter[/tpl] internalization, and non-competitive reuptake inhibition.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1124/pr.109.001107 |title=International Union of Pharmacology. LXXII. Recommendations for Trace Amine Receptor Nomenclature |year=2009 |last1=Maguire |first1=J. J. |last2=Parker |first2=W. A. E. |last3=Foord |first3=S. M. |last4=Bonner |first4=T. I. |last5=Neubig |first5=R. R. |last6=Davenport |first6=A. P. |journal=Pharmacological Reviews |volume=61 |pages=1–8 |pmid=19325074 |issue=1 |pmc=2830119[/tpl] Because of the similarity between amphetamine and trace amines, it is also a substrate for monoamine transporters; as a consequence, it (competitively) inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamines by competing with them for uptake, as well.
In addition, amphetamine and trace amines are substrates for the neuronal vesicular monoamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). When amphetamine is taken up by [tpl]abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2[/tpl], the vesicle releases (effluxes) dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange.

===Cocaine===

Cocaine's mechanism of action in the human brain includes the inhibition of dopamine reuptake,[tpl]cite journal |author=Heikkila, R E; Cabbat, F S; Duvoisin, R C |title=Motor activity and rotational behavior after analogs of cocaine: correlation with dopamine uptake blockade |pmid=575770 |journal=Commun Psychopharmacol   |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=285–90 |year=1979[/tpl] which accounts for cocaine's addictive properties, as dopamine is the critical neurotransmitter for reward. However, cocaine is more active in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area than the substantia nigra. Cocaine administration increases metabolism in the substantia nigra, which can explain the altered motor function seen in cocaine-using subjects.[tpl]cite book |title=Cocaine |author=Joan M. Lakoski, Matthew P. Galloway, Francis J. White |publisher=Telford Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-8493-8813-9[/tpl] The inhibition of dopamine reuptake by cocaine also inhibits the firing of spontaneous action potentials by the pars compacta.[tpl]cite journal |title=Actions of cocaine on rat dopaminergic neurones in vitro |author=M.

However, recent studies show that cocaine can also cause a decrease in DAT mRNA levels,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb08365.x |title=Quantitation of Rat Dopamine Transporter mRNA: Effects of Cocaine Treatment and Withdrawal |year=1992 |last1=Xia |first1=Yue |last2=Goebel |first2=Dennis J. |last3=Kapatos |first3=Gregory |last4=Bannon |first4=Michael J. |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=1179–82 |pmid=1494906[/tpl] most likely due to cocaine blocking dopamine receptors rather than direct interference with transcriptional or translational pathways.
Inactivation of the substantia nigra could prove to be a possible treatment for cocaine addiction. In a study of cocaine-dependent rats, inactivation of the substantia nigra via implanted cannulae greatly reduced cocaine addiction relapse.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00213-007-0850-8 |title=The role of dorsal vs ventral striatal pathways in cocaine-seeking behavior after prolonged abstinence in rats |year=2007 |last1=See |first1=R.

===Levodopa===

The substantia nigra is the target of chemical therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Levodopa (commonly referred to as L-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, is the most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson's disease. Despite controversy concerning the neurotoxicity of dopamine and L-DOPA,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(96)01056-6 |title=Differential neurotoxicity induced by l-DOPA and dopamine in cultured striatal neurons |year=1996 |last1=Cheng |first1=Neng-Neng |last2=Maeda |first2=Takehiko |last3=Kume |first3=Toshiaki |last4=Kaneko |first4=Satoshi |last5=Kochiyama |first5=Hanae |last6=Akaike |first6=Akinori |last7=Goshima |first7=Yoshio |last8=Misu |first8=Yoshimi |journal=Brain Research |volume=743 |pages=278–83 |pmid=9017256 |issue=1–2[/tpl] it remains the most common treatment for Parkinson's disease. The drug is especially effective in treating patients in the early stages of Parkinson's, although the drug does lose its efficacy over time.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/ana.10513 |title=Limitations of current Parkinson's disease therapy |year=2003 |last1=Rascol |first1=Olivier |last2=Payoux |first2=Pierre |last3=Ory |first3=Fabienne |last4=Ferreira |first4=Joaquim J. |last5=Brefel-Courbon |first5=Christine |last6=Montastruc |first6=Jean-Louis |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=53 |pages=S3–12; discussion S12–5 |pmid=12666094[/tpl] Levodopa can cross the blood–brain barrier and increases dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, thus alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The drawback of levodopa treatment is that it treats the symptoms of Parkinson's (low dopamine levels), rather than the cause (the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra).

===MPTP===

MPTP, is a neurotoxin specific to dopaminergic cells in the brain, specifically in the substantia nigra. MPTP was brought to the spotlight in 1982 when heroin users in California displayed Parkinson's-like symptoms after using MPPP contaminated with MPTP. The patients, who were rigid and almost completely immobile, responded to levodopa treatment. No remission of the Parkinson's-like symptoms was reported, suggesting irreversible death of the dopaminergic neurons.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.6823561 |title=Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis |year=1983 |last1=Langston |first1=J. |last2=Ballard |first2=P |last3=Tetrud |first3=J. |last4=Irwin |first4=I |journal=Science |volume=219 |issue=4587 |pages=979–80 |pmid=6823561[/tpl] The proposed mechanism of MPTP involves disruption of mitochondrial function, including disruption of metabolism and creation of free radicals.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s007020100004 |title=Neurochemical findings in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease |year=2001 |last1=Schmidt |first1=N. |last2=Ferger |first2=B. |journal=Journal of Neural Transmission |volume=108 |issue=11 |pages=1263–82 |pmid=11768626[/tpl]
Soon after, MPTP was tested in animal models for its efficacy in inducing Parkinson's disease (with success). MPTP induced akinesia, rigidity, and tremor in primates, and its neurotoxicity was found to be very specific to the substantia nigra pars compacta.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(84)90777-7 |title=Selective nigral toxicity after systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrine (MPTP) in the squirrel monkey |year=1984 |last1=William Langston |first1=J. |last2=Forno |first2=Lysia S. |last3=Rebert |first3=Charles S. |last4=Irwin |first4=Ian |journal=Brain Research |volume=292 |issue=2 |pages=390–4 |pmid=6607092[/tpl] In other animals, such as rodents, the induction of Parkinson's by MPTP is incomplete or requires much higher and frequent doses than in primates. Today, MPTP remains the most favored model for studying Parkinson's.
