==Stories collected==

==Overview==

The collection features 22 works, which includes nineteen short stories, a novella ("The Mist"), and two poems ("Paranoid: A Chant" and "For Owen"). In addition to the introduction, in which King directly addresses his readers in his signature conversational style, Skeleton Crew features an epilogue of sorts entitled "Notes" wherein King discusses the origins of several stories in the collection. The stories are collected from science-fiction and horror anthologies (Dark Forces, Shadows, Terrors, and New Terrors) genre magazine publications (Twilight Zone, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Startling Mystery Stories, Weirdbook and Fantasy and Science Fiction) and popular magazines (Redbook, Gallery, Yankee and Playboy).
Although published in 1985, the stories collected in Skeleton Crew span seventeen years from "The Reaper's Image" (King's second professional sale when he was just eighteen years old) to "The Ballad of The Flexible Bullet" which was completed in 1983.King, Stephen, "Introduction" to Skeleton Crew, Putnam Press 1985 pp. 13
Skeleton Crew is critically held as showing King as a maturing writerBeahm, George, The Stephen King Companion, Andrews and McNeel, 1989, pp. 271 with greater breadth and depth than his previous short works.Collings, Michael R., The Annotated Guide to Stephen King, Starmount Press, 1986, pp. 25
The collection also features some more personal works, including "For Owen", the poem he wrote for his son, and "Gramma" a horrific tale from an eleven-year old boy's perspective that seems to recall King's own horrors living with his invalid grandmother.Spignesi, Stephen J.

Of one of the stories in the collection, King says: "As far as short stories are concerned, I like the grisly ones the best. However the story "Survivor Type" goes a little bit too far, even for me."Grant, Charles L. "Interview with Stephen King " Monsterland Magazine, May/June, 1985.
