==History==

The school was the first state grammar school for girls in Buckinghamshire when it opened in 1901 with eighteen students.
The Clock House in Frogmoor, High Wycombe was where the school was originally housed in 1901. The school was first opened in September 1901 when there were only 18 fee paying students and 3 staff. Miss Mary Christie M.A. was the first headmistress. 
The school moved to Benjamin Road in 1906 where it remained for 50 years, except for a time during the First World War when it was evacuated to the old grammar school so that Benjamin Road buildings could be used as a military hospital. By 1922 the school had 300 pupils and was rapidly expanding. The school acquired its status as a Voluntary Controlled Girl's Grammar School in 1944. By 1956 the number of girls wishing to attend the school was so great that the school moved again to new premises that were built at the present site on Marlow Hill. 
It won Top of the Form in 1959.[tpl]cite web | last = House | first = Marilyn | title = Nightmares about gym | work = That'll Teach 'Em : What it was like | publisher = Channel 4 | url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/teachem/whatlike_4_t.html | accessdate =2008-06-16 [/tpl]
Over the years new buildings were added to the school as it grew larger, with Technology, Sport and Drama blocks being some of the latest additions. These were built to allow for the extra 300 pupils and staff that arrived when Lady Verney High School joined with Wycombe High in 1993.The most recent addition is the Wainwright Learning Centre, which was opened in 2006. This houses our well resourced library, conference facilities, the school archive and an Internet caf√©.http://www.whs.bucks.sch.uk/explore/about-the-school
In September 2011, the current headteacher, Sharon Cromie, implemented a 'Vertical Tutoring' system. Which introduced 6 houses to the school: Austen, Bronte, Curie, Nightingale, Parks and Pankhurst. Each house is named after a famous and inspirational woman in history. Each house has its own colour: Austen-Orange, Bronte-Red, Curie-Blue, Nightingale-Green, Parks-Purple and Pankhurst-Yellow.

==Uniform and PE kit==

Wycombe High School have a fairly strict uniform code, consisting of a blue, revere collared blouse, a coloured jumper (cobalt blue for years 7-9, burgundy for years 10 & 11) and either hipster trousers or a box-pleated skirt.
The PE is a black and blue nylon shirt, with a matching skirt/skort. The regulation hoodie is also required. Students are required to have black dance leggings, black tracksuit bottoms, black athletic shorts, hockey socks, shin pads, football boots, two pairs of trainers.
The uniform changed from a very traditional pinstripe white and navy shirt and pleated navy skirt, to the current uniform in 2002, with a mixed response from pupils.
