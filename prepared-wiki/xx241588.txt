Founded in 1961 the Ypsilanti Historical Society operates the Ypsilanti Historical Museum and Fletcher-White Archives in Ypsilanti, MI. The museum and archives are located at 220 N Huron St. in an Italianate mansion built in 1860 by Asa Dow. The house came into possession of the Ypsilanti Historical Society in 1970 after being owned by the city since 1966. In 2007 the Fletcher-White Archives moved from the property's carriage house into the basement of the main house.
The Fletcher-White Archives includes collections on Eastern Michigan University, Willow Run, and Ypsilanti Public Schools.http://www.ypsilantihistoricalsociety.org/archive.html Through collaboration with the University of Michigan's Digital Library Production Service, the Ypsilanti Historical Society Photo Archives has made hundreds of images available online.
