In 1876 the settlement at Tooleybuc was described in the following terms: 
 Tooley Buc is on the New South Wales side of the river, and is on the mail road between Swan-hill and Balranald, being nearly equidistant between the two places.  There is no township there, unless a large public-house and a small and comical-looking wooden chapel, which, by the bye, appeared to be unused, can be held to constitute one, but there is a good deal of settlement in the neighbourhood.  A store and post-office are attached to the public-house.  Tooley Buc is a crossing-place for sheep and cattle.'The Riverine Trade (No. III): Down the Murray', The Argus (newspaper), 29 January 1876, p. 5. 
Tooleybuc is home to a historic bridge over the Murray River.  Constructed in 1907, the bridge is designed to rise to let paddle steamers through. In 1974, the paddle steamer "Pevensey" collided with the bridge after passing through the open bridge heading upstream. The steamer attempted to move to the south bank after clearing the bridge, but was caught in the strong current and swept sideways into the east side of the bridge. The bridge sustained no noticeable damage, but the "Pevensey" suffered some damage to her upper works. After being pulled off by a team of locals who were gathered to see her come through the bridge, the "Pevensey" refueled and made minor repairs, before heading upstream to Echuca.
The town in conjunction with nearby township Manangatang has an Australian rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League.[tpl]Citation  | last = Full Points Footy  | title = Tooleybuc Manangatang | url = http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Tooleybuc-M'tang.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-25 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The town first established a football team in 1903, in the Lines Football Association. This became the Nyah-Piangil Football Association soon after, and Tooleybuc won its first Premiership in 1923, defeating Woorinen by 1 point. As a member of the Mid Valley Football Association, Tooleybuc won the Premiership in 1935. The Association became the Mid-Murray Football League, and Tooleybuc made the Grand Final on six occasions, but only managed one Premiership, when they defeated Lalbert by 32 points in 1965. In 1997, a re-organization of football leagues in the area resulted in the creation of the Central Murray Football League. In 2004 the Tooleybuc and Manangatang football clubs merged to form the Saints.Club History Timeline url = http://footypedia.isgreat.org/00001237.htm The senior team lost the Grand Final to Kerang Football Club in 2004, and won the Premiership in 2007, defeating Balranald Football Club by 45 points.
