CATEGORIES: Solute carrier family

Thiamine transporter 1, also known as thiamine carrier 1 (TC1) or solute carrier family 19 member 2 (SLC19A2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC19A2 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: solute carrier family 19 (thiamine transporter)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10560| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Neufeld EJ, Mandel H, Raz T, Szargel R, Yandava CN, Stagg A, Fauré S, Barrett T, Buist N, Cohen N | title = Localization of the gene for thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome, on the long arm of chromosome 1, by homozygosity mapping | journal = Am.

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in this gene cause thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus, megaloblastic anemia and sensorineural deafness.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bay A, Keskin M, Hizli S, Uygun H, Dai A, Gumruk F | title = Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome | journal = Int.
