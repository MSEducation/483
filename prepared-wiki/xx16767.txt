In 1996, she landed a leading role in the adventure film, Alaska (1996). After guest-starring appearances in The Outer Limits, Promised Land, and Touched by an Angel, Birch took a break from acting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.superiorpics.com/thora_birch/ |title=The Thora Birch Picture Pages |publisher=Superiorpics.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] In 1999, she returned in the made-for-TV film Night Ride Home and also took a small uncredited role in the Natalie Portman film Anywhere but Here.
Later in 1999, Birch won critical praise playing the role of Jane Burnham in American Beauty and was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award. The movie itself went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film, and thus classified as a minor in the United States, her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie. They and child labor representatives were on the set for the shooting of the scene.[tpl]cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Movie Answer Man|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/movie-answer-man-10101999|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=3 February 2012|quote=It is not illegal. to have people under 18 nude or partially nude on film.

After supporting roles in The Smokers (2000; where Birch was called "a scene-stealer" by The Hollywood Reporter)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0185908/|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|title=Film review: 'Smokers'|date=20 March 2000[/tpl] and Dungeons & Dragons (2000), she landed the lead role alongside Keira Knightley in the horror movie The Hole (2001). The film was released in the cinema in the UK, and went direct-to-video in the US almost two years later and gained divided reviews. BBC.co.uk wrote: "Given that she has a much leaner role than the one she enjoyed in "American Beauty", the qualities which made her flourish in that multi-Oscar-winner are still abundantly clear".[tpl]cite web|first=Michael |last=Thomson |date=12 April 2001 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/04/12/the_hole_2001_review.shtml |title=Films – review – "The Hole" |publisher=BBC |date=2001-04-12 |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl]
Birch landed the leading role in Ghost World (2001), alongside Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi, and Brad Renfro. Her performances gained positive response from film critics. In his review for The New York Times, A. O.

Birch was cast and scheduled to make her American stage debut in the off Broadway revival of Dracula, but was fired for the behavior of her father, her manager at the time, who physically threatened one of the show's cast members.

In regard to her reduced exposure in the film industry, she insists that she has continually worked and maintained a career but "it's just that no one was paying attention."

In addition to her ongoing acting aspirations, Birch is seeking production support for a screenplay and stated that she wants to "move forward" as part of a life in which she considers herself "really lucky!"
