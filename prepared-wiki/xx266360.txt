Trained in art at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia during World War II, Woolman had her first solo show in 1947 in New York City, where she taught and exhibited for the next several years.  In the early 1960s she studied printmaking at George Washington University in Washington D.C. It was at that time that she began focusing on etching and then collage and collograph.  Over the next decade Woolman showed at the Washington World Gallery, the Market-Five Gallery on Capital Hill in Washington DC and Gallery 85 in New York City.
Later in life Woolman traveled the world with her husband, Myron Woolman, creating her art.  She lived and exhibited in Europe, West Africa, Thailand, and the Philippines.  She returned to the US in the mid 1990s. She lived and worked in Indiana until her death.  Her paintings, collages and collagraphs are in private collections in New York, Washington, London, Paris, Tokyo and Dubai.  Her work is part of the archive collection at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC.
