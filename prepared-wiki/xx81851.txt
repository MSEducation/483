Passion is the fourth album by American singer Jennifer Rush.Official website | Biography
Following on from the success of her previous album, Rush continued working with much of the same team of writers and producers. This album however failed to find the same high level of success and didn't chart at all in the UK. However sales were satisfying in her most successful market, Germany, where the album reached No.3 and was certified platinum.Arcor.de | Discography The lead single "You're My One and Only" became a hit, but further releases "Keep All the Fires Burning Bright" and "Love Get Ready" did little to generate interest.Official website | Single releases
Single success did come a few months later in the UK, when a duet with Pl√°cido Domingo, "Till I Loved You" became a hit in the summer of 1989.Chartstats.com | "Till I Loved You" Chart details The record company however failed to capitalise on this by not repromoting the album.
Notable tracks on this album include "Same Heart" - a duet with Michael Bolton, although this came a year before his international breakthrough (another opportunity for repromotion), and "Remind My Heart" which was a collaboration with producer Jellybean Benitez who was currently at the peak of his fame.
