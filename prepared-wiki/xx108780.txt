The forces Tyrwhitt commanded were called the Harwich Force during World War I. His leadership was highly regarded, and he led his ships at the Battle of Heligoland Bight and in the Cuxhaven Raid in 1914, and in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915. During the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the Admiralty held back Tyrwhitt's forces in case of a German attack on the coast. 
After the War he commanded the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet and then became Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Scotland in 1923. From 1926 to 1928, Tyrwhitt was Commander-in-Chief on the China Station during a period of disturbances and tension with the Nationalist Government, and became the senior British officer in the region. In the aftermath of the Invergordon Mutiny, Tyrwhitt was instrumental in preventing Vice-Admiral Frederic C. Dreyer, the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, from taking command of the Atlantic Fleet and ending any hopes Dreyer had of becoming First Sea Lord.[tpl]cite book |title=Tyrwhitt of the Harwich Force |last=Temple Patterson |page=280 [/tpl] From 1930 to 1933, he served as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore.
