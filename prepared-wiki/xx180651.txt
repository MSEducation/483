Born in Stratford, East London, Williams was signed by First Division Charlton Athletic from non-league Woodford Town in 1987. Where he was top goal scorer for two successive seasons. This prompted Ron Atkinson to spend nearly a million pounds to bring the Londoner to Sheffield Wednesday in 1990 where he enjoyed a productive partnership with David Hirst. That season he won a League Cup medal at Wembley Stadium by beating Manchester United 1-0. In the same season Wednesday achieved promotion back to the Premier Division.  Williams moved back to London with Crystal Palace in 1992 in a swap deal involving Mark Bright. In season 1993/94 he won a Championship Winners medal with Palace and was second top goal scorer behind Chris Armstrong.
After loans with Sunderland and Birmingham City he returned to Charlton, followed by a few months at Torquay United before ending his league career with Southend United in 1998 due to injuries.
