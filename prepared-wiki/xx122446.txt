==Biography==

A native of Woodstock, New York, Weider was born in 1951 and began playing guitar at age 11. Some of his early influences included Chuck Berry, James Burton and Scotty Moore. While still a teenager in Woodstock, he became acquainted with Levon Helm and was exposed to The Band's music. Weider went on to become an accomplished studio session player in cities such as Atlanta and Nashville, but eventually returned to Woodstock and was invited to become The Band's sole guitarist in 1985, remaining until the group's dissolution in 2000 following the death of Rick Danko in late 1999."Jim Weider takes the TCAN stage Friday" - The Dedham Transcript
Weider's main instrument is the Fender Telecaster, but he also plays a vintage 1960s Silvertone electric guitar (primarily for slide) and a vintage 1960s Guild Starfire III. For amplification, Weider uses a combination of Fender amplifiers and his own signature series JW40 amp, designed in conjunction with Fargen Amplification, Inc. He is also the co-designer of the AnalogMan King Of Tone pedal which you will find on his pedalboard.
In addition to his work with The Band and his own musical group The Jim Weider Band, Weider has performed and recorded with numerous other musicians, including Robbie Dupree, Dr. John, Graham Parker, Keith Richards and Bob Weir. He is also featured in several instructional videos produced by Homespun Video. Following Jimmy Vivino's departure in early 2009, Jim Weider had been appearing with the Levon Helm Band until Helm's death in 2012.
