[tpl]nihongo|Mario Kart 64|マリオカート64|Mario Kāto Rokujūyon[/tpl] is a Mario racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It is the successor to Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and is the second Mario Kart game. It was released first in Japan on December 14, 1996 and in North America and Europe in 1997. In January 2007, Mario Kart 64 was released as a downloadable Virtual Console title on the Wii.
Changes from the original include the move to polygon-based true 3D computer graphics for track design, and the inclusion of four-player support. Players take control of characters from the Mario universe, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user. The move to three-dimensional graphics allowed for track features not possible with the original game's Mode 7 graphics, such as changes in elevation, bridges, walls, and pits. However, the characters and items remained 2D pre-rendered sprites.
The game was critically well received and was a bestseller.

==Gameplay==

Mario Kart 64 is a kart racing game in which the player controls one of eight selectable Mario characters who race in karts in different race tracks that vary in shape and theme. During a race, the players can obtain random items from special boxes placed in different areas of the track that are used to impede the opposition and gain the advantage. For example, shells and bananas allow the player to attack opponents and slow them down, and Mushrooms grant the player a temporary boost in speed.

===Game modes===

There are four different game modes available in Mario Kart 64: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, and Battle. Some modes support both single-player and competitive multiplayer gameplay, while other modes only support one or the other.

===Playable characters===

Mario Kart 64 features eight playable characters. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Bowser appeared in Super Mario Kart while the remaining two characters, Wario, and Donkey Kong are new to the series replacing Koopa Troopa and Donkey Kong Jr. The characters are divided into three weight classes: lightweights, whose karts have high acceleration and lower top speed; heavyweight, whose karts have low acceleration but high top speed; and middleweights, who have balanced acceleration and top speed.

==Development==

Production of the game began in 1995 under its original title Super Mario Kart R,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/04/super-mario-kart-r-64-beta|title=|publisher=Unseen64|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2010-08-13[/tpl] and was intended to be a launch game for the Nintendo 64, but more resources were given to Super Mario 64[tpl]'[/tpl]s development. An early prototype of the game was showcased at the Shoshinkai Software Exhibition in Japan on November 24, 1995.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2008-03-27|url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?n64/n64.htm|title=The N64's Long Way to completion  |publisher=Nintendo Land|date=1998-01-01|author=Liedholm, Marcus|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080503135511/http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?n64/n64.htm|archivedate=2008-08-28[/tpl] The prototype featured the Feather item from Super Mario Kart and a Magikoopa as one of the eight playable characters, who was replaced with Donkey Kong in the final game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/08/the-10-greatest-wizards-in-video-games/magikoopa |work=The 10 Greatest Wizards In Video Games |title=7.

The player's driving controls were designed to be similar to operating a radio-controlled car.Nintendo Power 92. 1997. While Mario Kart 64 features tracks that are fully rendered in 3D, the game uses billboarding to display the characters and items. Game director Hideki Konno stated that, while rendering the characters as 3D models was not impossible, the limited processing power of the console would not have allowed all eight characters to appear on the screen at once. Instead, the characters are composed of pre-rendered sprites that show the characters from various angles to simulate a 3D appearance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/mariokart/0/0 |title=It Started With A Guy In Overalls |work=Iwata Asks: Mario Kart Wii |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |publisher=Nintendo of America[/tpl] Rare Ltd., developer of the Donkey Kong Country games, provided Donkey Kong's character model.[tpl]cite web |url=http://themushroomkingdom.net/credits/mk64/USA |title=Mario Kart 64 Game Credits (USA) |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom[/tpl]
While rubberband AI was used to prevent all the racers from easily separating, the Blue Spiny Shell item, which targets and attacks the player in first place, was added in order to keep each race competitive and balanced. The item was included in all subsequent Mario Kart games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5780082/the-maker-of-mario-kart-justifies-the-blue-shell |title=The Maker Of Mario Kart Justifies The Blue Shell |publisher=Kotaku |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |author=Totilo, Stephen[/tpl]

==Reception==

Mario Kart 64 received generally positive reviews. The game has an average review ratio of 87% on Game Rankings, including reviews from IGN and GamePro, and magazines such as Electronic Gaming Monthly. IGN stated, "Though the single-player mode is a bit of a step back from the SNES original, Mario Kart 64 still offers one of the best multiplayer experiences to be had on Nintendo 64." GameSpot insisted that though the graphics and sound of the game are impressive, the gameplay is too easy and lacks depth. In their Virtual Console re-release review, the reviewer criticized its lack of ghost-saving, sound and graphics saying the latter had "aged rather poorly."Mario Kart 64 for Wii Review - Wii Mario Kart 64 Review The game placed 17th in Official Nintendo Magazine's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=7258|title=20-11 Official Nintendo Magazine|publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine|accessdate=2009-02-25[/tpl] Mario Kart 64 sold approximately 5.5 million copies in the United States and 2.24 million in Japan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|title=The Magic Box - US Platinum Chart Games|publisher=The Magic Box|date=2007-12-27|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-JPPlatinum.shtml|title=The Magic Box - Japan Platinum Chart Games|publisher=The Magic Box|date=2007-12-27|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] Joystiq reported in February 2009 that the game had sold over nine million copies worldwide.[tpl]cite web|title=Guinness pours out its Top 50 Games of All Time|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/26/guinness-pours-out-its-top-50-games-of-all-time/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=February 22, 2010|last=Ransom-Wiley|first=James|date=February 26, 2009[/tpl]
