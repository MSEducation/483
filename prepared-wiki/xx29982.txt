In 1986, Ford Agriculture was looking for a way out of the tractor business. The following year they bought Versatile, who made articulated four-wheel drive tractors. All this buying was to rival manufacturers like Deere & Company and Case IH but because of the 1980s American tractor slump, Ford was forced to think again. In 1988 they sold 80% of it to Fiat and in 1991 they bought the remaining 20%. So it was the end for Ford tractors. Fiat rebranded their European tractors under the newly acquired name of Ford-New Holland. In 2001, the Ford name was dropped.
