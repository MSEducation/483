USS ''Intrepid'' (CV/CVA/CVS-11), also known as The Fighting "I", is one of 24 [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s built during World War II for the United States Navy. She is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name.  Commissioned in August 1943, Intrepid participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, most notably the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, but also participated in the Vietnam War. Her notable achievements include being the recovery ship for a Mercury and a Gemini space mission. Because of her prominent role in battle, she was nicknamed "the Fighting I", while her often ill-luck and the time spent in dry dock for repairs earned her the nickname "the Dry I".
Decommissioned in 1974, in 1982 Intrepid became the foundation of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City.

==Construction & commissioning==

Intrepid was commissioned on 26 April 1943 by Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, the fifth [tpl]sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl] to be launched. She was sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral John H. Hoover. On 16 August 1943, she was commissioned with Captain Thomas L. Sprague in command before heading to the Caribbean for shakedown and training. Intrepid[tpl]'[/tpl]s motto upon setting sail was "In Mare In Caelo", which means "On the sea, in the sky", or "In the sea in Heaven".

==Service history==

===World War II===

Intrepid has one of the most distinguished service records of any Navy ship, seeing active service in the Pacific Theater including the Marshall Islands, Truk, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. At war's end, she was in Enewetak and soon supported occupation forces providing air support and supply services before heading back to California.

===Post-war===

====1955–1961====

====1962–1965====

====1965–1974====

This was the final Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization job performed by the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, which was scheduled to close. In September 1965, Intrepid, with her work approximately 75% completed, eased down the East River to moor at the Naval Supply Depot at Bayonne, New Jersey, for the completion of her multi-million dollar overhaul. After builder's sea trials and fitting out at Norfolk she sailed to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba on a shakedown cruise.
From April 1966 to February 1969, Intrepid made three Vietnam deployments, with Carrier Air Wing 10 embarked.http://www.gonavy.jp/CVW-AK1f.html Mid-1966 found Intrepid with the Pacific Fleet off Vietnam. Nine A-4 Skyhawks and six A-1 Skyraiders, loaded with bombs and rockets, were catapulted in seven minutes, with only a 28-second interval between launches. A few days later planes were launched at 26-second intervals. After seven months of service with the United States Seventh Fleet off Vietnam, Intrepid returned to Norfolk having earned her Commanding Officer, Captain John W. Fair, the Legion of Merit for combat operations in Southeast Asia.
On 9 October 1966 Lieutenant, junior grade William T. Patton of VA-176 from Intrepid, flying a propeller driven A-1H Skyraider, shot down one MiG-17. For the action, Lieutenant (jg) Patton was awarded the Silver Star.
In June 1967, Intrepid returned to the Western Pacific by way of the Suez Canal just prior to its closing during the Israeli-Arab crisis. There she began another tour with the Seventh Fleet.
In 1968, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. For Carrier Air Wing 10's final cruise aboard Intrepid from 4 June 1968 to 8 February 1969 off Southeast Asia, the wing consisted of VF-111 Detachment 11 (F-8C), VA-106 with the A-4E, VA-66 Waldos (A-4C), VFP-63 Detachment 11 (RF-8G), VA-36 'Roadrunners' (A-4C), VAQ-33 Detachment 11 (EA-1F), VAW-121 Detachment 11 (E-1B), and HC-2 Detachment 11.
In 1969, Intrepid was home ported at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, relieving [tpl]USS|Yorktown|CV-10|2[/tpl] as the flagship for Commander Carrier Division 16. In the fall, the ship was run aground by Captain Horus E. Moore, but was freed within two hours. From April–October 1971, Intrepid took part in NATO exercises, and made calls in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean ports of Lisbon, Plymouth, Kiel, Naples, Cannes, Barcelona, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Greenock, Rosyth, Portsmouth, and Bergen. During this cruise, submarine detection operations were conducted in the Baltic and at the edge of the Barents Sea above the Arctic Circle, under close scrutiny of Soviet air and naval forces. She subsequently returned to her homeport to be refitted.
Then, beginning in July 1972, Intrepid participated once again in NATO exercises, visiting Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Bergen, Brussels, Portsmouth and Gourock. Once again she found herself in the Barents and made round the clock flight operations as Intrepid was once again above the Arctic Circle. She cut her North Atlantic cruise short, returned to Quonset point for a mini-overhaul and was designated as CV-11 and made her final cruise in the Mediterranean, stopping twice in Barcelona and Malaga Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Nice, France;  Naples, Italy; Palma, Majorca; and Piraeus, Greece once. Due to fuel limitations Intrepid spent as much time in port as she did underway.
On 15 March 1974 Intrepid was decommissioned for the final time.

==Preservation as museum ship==

In 1976, Intrepid was moored at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia and hosted exhibits as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations.
Plans originally called for Intrepid to be scrapped after decommissioning, but a campaign led by real estate developer Zachary Fisher and the Intrepid Museum Foundation saved the carrier, and established it as a museum ship. In August 1982, the ship opened in New York City as the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum. Four years later, Intrepid was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark.[tpl]Cite journal |url= http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/86000082.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: USS Intrepid (CV-11) |date=May 1985 |format=PDF |author=Harry A.

===2006–2008 renovation===

Throughout the last several years, the Intrepid museum has operated a fund for the restoration, raising over $60 million to refit Intrepid, to improve its exhibits for visitors, and improve Pier 86.
In early July 2006, it was announced that Intrepid would undergo renovations and repairs, along with Pier 86 itself. It closed on 1 October 2006, in preparation for its towing to Bayonne, New Jersey for repairs, and later Staten Island, New York for renovation and temporary docking.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/intrepidmuseum/press/item.php?id=43 | title = The Intrepid Will Be Temporarily Moved and Pier 86 Will be Reconstructed Under an Historic $55 Million-Plus Capital Expansion Plan | publisher = Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum | accessdate = 2007-03-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061005111635/http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/intrepidmuseum/press/item.php?id=43  |archivedate = 5 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.marinelink.com/Story/ShowStory.aspx?StoryID=203707 | title = Intrepid to Close for Repairs, Renovation | publisher = Marinelink.com | accessdate = 2007-03-21 [/tpl]
On 6 November 2006, an attempt to remove the aircraft carrier from the pier for restoration was temporarily put on hold by the Coast Guard. Despite the use of several tugs with a combined [tpl]convert|30000|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], officials said the ship was stuck in 24 years worth of accumulated silt and would not move.
On 11 November 2006, the United States Navy announced that it would spend $3 million to dredge the mud and silt from under Intrepid. The effort was led by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving with assistance from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Coast Guard, and contractors.  The teams operated for three weeks to clear the site of mud and silt.
On 5 December 2006, after the removal of [tpl]convert|39000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on[/tpl] of muck from under the ship and around its four giant screws, Intrepid was successfully removed from its pier and was towed to Bayonne."Briefly, Slowly, Intrepid Moves Again" – New York Times
Intrepid made a D-Day "landing" on Staten Island, 6 June 2007, after being towed from a slip at Bayonne Dry Dock & Repair Corp.
While in Staten Island, Intrepid underwent the next phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8 million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Total cost of the renovation was $120 million — $55 million for the ship and $65 million for Pier 86.Pyle, Richard, "Aircraft carrier survived wars, years of decay", Associated Press (printed in the Washington Times, p. 10), 30 September 2008.
The carrier was towed back into place on the Hudson River on 2 October 2008 and reopened to the public on 8 November.
On 12 December 2011, ownership of the Space Shuttle Enterprise was officially transferred to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-121211a.html |title=Intrepid Museum Celebrates Ownership of Space Shuttle Enterprise |first=Robert Z |last=Pearlman |date=12 December 2011 |work=CollectSpace |accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/transition/placement/enterprise_transfer.html |title=NASA Transfers Enterprise Title to Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City |work=NASA.gov |date=11 December 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/11/prweb8987493.htm |title=NASA Transfers Title to Space Shuttle Orbiter Enterprise to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City |publisher=PRWeb |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] In preparation for the anticipated relocation, engineers evaluated the vehicle in early 2010 and determined that it was safe to fly on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft once again.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/03/enterprise-good-condition-potential-sca-ferry-smithsonian/ |title=Enterprise in good condition for potential SCA ferry from Smithsonian NASM |work=NASAspaceflight.com |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2010[/tpl] At approximately 9:40 am Eastern Daylight Time on 27 April 2012 Enterprise took off from Dulles International Airport en route to a fly-by over the Hudson River, New York's JFK International Airport, the Statue of Liberty, the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, and several other landmarks in the city; in an approximately 45-minute "final tour".
