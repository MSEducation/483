[[Intelligence]]

CATEGORIES: Intelligence, Educational psychology, Developmental psychology, Psychological testing

Intelligence has been defined in many different ways such as in terms of one's capacity for logic, abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional knowledge, memory, planning, and problem solving.
Intelligence is most widely studied in humans, but has also been observed in animals and in plants.  Artificial intelligence is the simulation of intelligence in machines.
Within the discipline of psychology, various approaches to human intelligence have been adopted. The psychometric approach is especially familiar to the general public, as well as being the most researched and by far the most widely used in practical settings.[tpl]cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77[/tpl] Article in Wikipedia: Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns

==History of the term==

Intelligence derives from the Latin verb intelligere, to comprehend or perceive. A form of this verb, intellectus, became the medieval technical term for understanding, and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous. This term was however strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism, including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the Active Intellect (also known as the Active Intelligence). This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume, all of whom preferred the word "understanding" in their English philosophical works.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Martinich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Hobbes for example, in his Latin De Corpore, used "intellectus intelligit" (translated in the English version as "the understanding understandeth") as a typical example of a logical absurdity.English, and Latin version. The term "intelligence" has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories which it now implies) in more contemporary psychology.

==Definitions==

The definition of intelligence is controversial. Some groups of psychologists have suggested the following definitions:

Besides those definitions, psychology and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as:
What is considered intelligent varies with culture. For example, when asked to sort, the Kpelle people take a functional approach. A Kpelle participant stated "the knife goes with the orange because it cuts it." When asked how a fool would sort, they sorted linguistically, putting the knife with other implements and the orange with other foods, which is the style considered intelligent in other cultures.Glick (1975) reported in Resnick, L. (1976). The Nature of Intelligence. Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

==Human intelligence==

Human intelligence is the intellectual capacity of humans, which is characterized by perception, consciousness, self-awareness, and volition. Through their intelligence humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, plan, problem solve, and use language to communicate. Intelligence enables humans to experience and think.

==Animal and plant intelligence==

Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers, scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence, or more broadly, animal cognition. These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species, and comparing abilities between species. They study various measures of problem solving, as well as mathematical and language abilities. Some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it means the same thing across species (e.g. comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals), and then operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts.
Wolfgang Köhler's pioneering research on the intelligence of apes is a classic example of research in this area. Stanley Coren's book, The Intelligence of Dogs[tpl]Verify credibility|date=June 2008[/tpl] is a notable popular book on the topic.[tpl]Cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |title=The Intelligence of Dogs |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-37452-4 |year=1995 |oclc=30700778[/tpl] (See also: Dog intelligence.) Nonhuman animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees, bonobos (notably the language-using Kanzi) and other great apes, dolphins, elephants and to some extent parrots, rats and ravens.
Cephalopod intelligence also provides important comparative study. Cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence, yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals. Vertebrates such as mammals, birds, reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species. The same is true with arthropods.
It has been argued that plants should also be classified as being in some sense intelligent based on their ability to sense the environment and adjust their morphology, physiology and phenotype accordingly.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Trewavas |first=Anthony |date = September 2005|title=Green plants as intelligent organisms |journal=Trends in Plant Science |pmid=16054860 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=413–419 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1038/415841a[/tpl]

==Artificial intelligence==

Artificial intelligence (or AI) is both the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science which aims to create it, through "the study and design of intelligent agents"[tpl]Cite book |author=Goebel, Randy; Poole, David L.; Mackworth, Alan K. |title=Computational intelligence: A logical approach |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=1997 |pages=1 |isbn=0-19-510270-3 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/poole/ci/ch1.pdf |format=pdf[/tpl] or "rational agents", where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.[tpl]Cite book |author=Canny, John; Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter |title=Artificial intelligence: A modern approach |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |year=2003 |isbn=0-13-790395-2 |oclc=51325314 60211434 61259102[/tpl] Achievements in artificial intelligence include constrained and well-defined problems such as games, crossword-solving and optical character recognition and a few more general problems such as autonomous cars.http://www.technologyreview.com/news/520746/data-shows-googles-robot-cars-are-smoother-safer-drivers-than-you-or-i/ General intelligence or strong AI has not yet been achieved and is a long-term goal of AI research.
Among the traits that researchers hope machines will exhibit are reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. In the field of artificial intelligence there is no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated.
