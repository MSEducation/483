==History==

Public Laws of North Carolina, 1907, Chapter 820 titled An Act to Stimulate High School Instruction in the Public Schools of the State and Teacher Training is the official law chartering East Carolina Teachers Training School (ECTTS) on March 8, 1907 by the North Carolina General Assembly.[tpl]cite web| title = An Act to Stimulate High School Instruction in the Public Schools of the State and Teacher Training| work = North Carolina Public Laws 1907, Chapter 820| publisher = North Carolina General Assembly| date = 1907-03-08| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=49| accessdate = 2007-06-10[/tpl] The chairman of its original Board of Trustees, Thomas Jordan Jarvis, a former Governor of North Carolina now known as the "Father of ECU", participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on July 2, 1908 in Greenville, North Carolina and ECTTS opened its doors on October 5, 1909.[tpl]cite web| last = Representatives McLawhorn, E.

A master's degree program was authorized in 1929; the first such degree granted by ECTC was in 1933. Progress toward full college status was made in 1948 with the designation of the bachelor of arts as a liberal arts degree, and the bachelor of science as a teaching degree.[tpl]cite web| title = East Carolina University Timeline| work = University Archives| publisher = East Carolina University - Joyner Library| year = 2007| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/timeline.cfm| accessdate = 2007-06-10[/tpl] A change of name to East Carolina College in 1951 reflected this expanded mission. Over the objections of Governor Dan K. Moore, who opposed the creation of a university system separate from the Consolidated University of North Carolina, ECC was made a regional university effective July 1, 1967, and assumed its present name, East Carolina University. The university did not remain independent for long; on July 1, 1972, it was incorporated into the University of North Carolina System, the successor to the Consolidated University. Today, ECU is the third–largest university in North Carolina with 21,589 undergraduate and 5,797 graduate students, including the 308 medicine and 52 dental students.

==Campus==

East Carolina is separated into three distinct campuses: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, and West Research Campus. It owns two sports complexes: Blount Recreational Sports Complex and North Recreational Complex. It owns a field station in New Holland, North Carolina.

===Main===

The main campus, also known as the east campus, is about [tpl]convert|530|acre|km2|0[/tpl] in an urban residential area of downtown Greenville.  The 158 buildings on main campus comprise more than 4.6 million square feet (325,000 m²) of academic, research, and residential space. Many of the Main Campus buildings feature the Spanish–Mission style architecture; inspiration drawn from Thomas Jarvis' time as an ambassador to Brazil.[tpl]cite web| title = Thomas Jordan Jarvis - Father of East Carolina University| publisher = Joyner Library, East Carolina University| year = 2007| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/ncc/exhibit.cfm/| accessdate = 2007-06-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last = National Governors Association| title = North Carolina Governor Thomas Jordan Jarvis| work = Governor's Information| publisher = National Governors Association| year = 2004| url = http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=eea575cbecff1110VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD| accessdate = 2007-06-11[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] He wanted to bring the unique architecture to eastern North Carolina.  On the main campus, there are five districts: Campus Core, Downtown District, Warehouse District, Athletic fields and the South Academic District.  On the Campus Core, there are 15 residence halls which are divided into three separate neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web| authorlink = http://www.ecu.edu/studentlife/campusliving/halls.cfm| title = Residence Halls| work = Residence Halls| publisher = East Carolina University - Campus Living| year = 2009| url = http://www.ecu.edu/studentlife/campusliving/halls.cfm| accessdate = 2010-02-20[/tpl] The distinct feature of the main campus is the mall, which is a large tree–laden grassy area where many students go to relax. In the middle of the mall is the replica of the cupola on the original Austin building.
