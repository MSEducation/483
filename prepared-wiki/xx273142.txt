==The Silver Lead==

In the early 1870s silver was discovered on the south side of Monashee Creek.  The value of the ore was assayed to be $1,500.00 a ton.  The vein narrowed and finally petered out.  Several years later the lead was discovered again.  The lead petered out and more attempts were made to find the lead again.  Miners like Donald McIntyre and L.W. Riske presevered for almost 20 years to discover the vein.  All attempts failed.  It has been stated that this vein may contain a mother lode of gold farther to the east and upstream.  The lost silver lead of Monashee creek still waits to be discovered
