CATEGORIES: Kyushu region, Islands of Japan

[tpl]nihongo|Kyushu|九州|Kyūshū|lit. "Nine Provinces"[/tpl] is the third largest island of Japan and most southwesterly of its four main islands.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Kyūshū" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 588|page=588[/tpl] Its alternate ancient names include [tpl]nihongo3|"Nine States"|九国|Kyūkoku[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo3|"West of the Pacified Area"|鎮西|Chinzei[/tpl], and [tpl]nihongo3|"Island of Tsukushi"|筑紫島|Tsukushi-no-shima[/tpl]. The historical regional name [tpl]nihongo|Saikaidō|西海道||lit. West Sea Circuit[/tpl] referred to Kyushu and its surrounding islands.  
In the 8th century Taihō Code reforms, Dazaifu was established as a special administrative term for the region.Nussbaum, "Dazaifu" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 150|page=150[/tpl]; Dazaifu  
As of 2006, Kyushu has a population of 13,231,995 and covers [tpl]convert|35640|km2|sqmi[/tpl].

==Geography==

The island is mountainous, and Japan's most active volcano, Mt Aso at [tpl]convert|1591|m[/tpl], is on Kyushu. There are many other signs of tectonic activity, including numerous areas of hot springs. The most famous of these are in Beppu, on the east shore, and around Mt. Aso, in central Kyushu.
The name Kyūshū comes from the nine ancient provinces of Saikaidō situated on the island: Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, Bungo, Hyūga, Osumi, and Satsuma.
Today's [tpl]nihongo|Kyushu Region|九州地方|Kyūshū-chihō[/tpl] is a politically defined region that consists of the seven prefectures on the island of Kyushu (which also includes the former Tsushima and Iki as part of Nagasaki), and also Okinawa Prefecture to the south:
The world's 37th largest island by area, Kyushu is smaller than Spitsbergen but larger than New Britain and nearby Taiwan. By population, it ranks 13th, having fewer inhabitants than Borneo or Sulawesi, but more than Salsette (Mumbai) or Cuba.

==Economy and environment==

Parts of Kyushu have a subtropical climate, particularly Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures. Major agricultural products are rice, tea, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and soy; silk is also widely produced. The island is noted for various types of porcelain, including Arita, Imari, Satsuma, and Karatsu. Heavy industry is concentrated in the north around Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, Nagasaki, and Oita and includes chemicals, automobiles, semiconductors, and metal processing.
Most of Kyushu's population is concentrated along the northwest, in the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, with population corridors stretching southwest into Sasebo and Nagasaki and south into Kumamoto and Kagoshima. Excepting Oita and Miyazaki cities, the eastern seaboard shows a general decline in population.
In 2010, the graduate employment rate in the region was the lowest nationwide, at 88.9%.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/05/22/news/grads-landing-jobs-near-all-time-low/#.UnYliHCVPeM |title=Grads landing jobs near all-time low |publisher=The Japan Times |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl]
Besides the volcanic area of the south, there are significant mud hot springs in the northern part of the island, around Beppu. These springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Extremophile. eds.
