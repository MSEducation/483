==History==

Fascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by Dillie Keane, along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been Adele Anderson—who joined the group in 1984—and Keane. The trio started performing in a West End wine bar, but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] Over the years, they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three Laurence Olivier Awards nominations for Best Entertainment in 1995 and 2000.
