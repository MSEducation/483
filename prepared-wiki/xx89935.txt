[[Ayacucho Region]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Peru, Ayacucho Region

Ayacucho is a region of Peru, located in the south-central Andes of the country. Its capital is the city of Ayacucho. The region was one of the hardest hit by terrorism during the 1980s during the guerrilla war waged by Shining Path known as the internal conflict in Peru.
A referendum was held on October 30, 2005 to decide whether the region would merge with the regions of Ica and Huancavelica to form the new Ica-Ayacucho-Huancavelica Region, as part of the decentralization process in Peru. The bill failed and Ayacucho remained an independent region.
