Vol 2, Pg 992.
Schofield's style of playing was initially heavily influenced by that of Border musician Billy Pigg (1902-1968).  Schofield produced a biography of Pigg, The Border Minstrel (ISBN 0-902510-16-9) researched by Adrian D Schofield and edited by Julia Say, which included all of Pigg's known compositions, and some other tunes from his repertoire, and was published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1997. Later in his piping career, Schofield turned to favor the more close-fingered detached/staccato style of traditional pipers such as Tom Clough.
