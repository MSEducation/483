[[The Sons of Hercules]]

CATEGORIES: Film series, Peplum films, Motion picture television series

The Sons of Hercules was a syndicated Embassy Pictures television show that aired in the United States of America in the 1960s.  The series repackaged 14 Italian sword-and-sandal films by giving them a standardized theme song for the opening and closing titles, as well as a standard introductory narration attempting to relate the lead character in each film to the Greek demigod Hercules. These films however were not all originally made as "Hercules" films in Italy.  Although two of them did originally feature Hercules (and not his sons), four of the films were originally Maciste movies in Italy, two of them were originally Ursus movies, and the other six were just isolated gladiator or mythological hero movies not released theatrically in the US.
