In addition to its legislative powers, certain appointments by the governor are subject to the Senate's advice and consent. Appointees may serve without being confirmed by the Senate, unless the Senate rejects the appointment.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/issinfo/gvst_eba.aspx?src=14 | title=Creation and Organization of Executive Branch Agencies | publisher=Minnesota House of Representatives Research Department | accessdate=February 27, 2014[/tpl]
