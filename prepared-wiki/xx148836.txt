Charles joined his father's business: he was soon employed to manage construction of the Norwich and Brandon Railway for Sir Samuel Morton Peto.Charles Thomas Lucas at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
In 1842 Charles set up his own contracting business in Norwich and progressed to rebuilding Peto's house, Somerleyton Hall. Charles and Thomas established a facility in Lowestoft from where they undertook various works, including the railway, the station, the Esplanade, St John’s church and several hotels.
