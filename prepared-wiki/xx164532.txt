==Background==

Bishop Raymond A. Kearney High School was founded in 1961 as part of the Diocesan system of schools. It was dedicated by Most Rev. Brian Joseph McEntegart on November 2, 1961 and named in honor of the youngest auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn who had served the diocese from 1935 until his death on October 1, 1956.
The Sisters of Saint Joseph were asked to administer and staff the school. In 1973, the Henry Hald Association, which governed diocesan schools was dissolved and the school was purchased by the Sisters of Saint Joseph. It was incorporated and reopened as Bishop Kearney High School which was to be governed by a Board of Trustees. In 1994, the Board was expanded to include not only the General Government of the Congregation, but also parents, alumnae and other lay persons with expertise in education, finance and plant management.

Sister Letitia Maria Flanagan, CSJ (1961-67)
