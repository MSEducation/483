[[Rhene]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Rhene is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). The genus was originally named Rhanis. Tamerlan Thorell renamed it Rhene in 1869 so that it would not be confused with a beetle genus that was also named Rhanis.[tpl]cite book|title=On European Spiders, Part 1: Review of the European Genera of Spiders, Preceded by Some Observations on Zoological Nomenclature|first=Tamerlan|last=Thorell|year=1869|page=37[/tpl] The name Rhene is derived from the Greek proper name Rhene (Ρήνη).
