</ref>  This recommendation is based on ''post hoc'' analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates.  For heart rate control ([[atrial fibrillation]]), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 1.0 and 2.0&nbsp;ng/ml. In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects below).
Quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increases plasma levels of digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully.
Researchers at Yale University looked at data from an earlier study to see if digoxin affected men and women differently. That study determined digoxin, which has been used for centuries and makes the heart contract more forcefully, did not reduce deaths overall, but did result in less hospitalization. Researcher Dr. Harlan Krumholz said they were surprised to find women in the study who took digoxin died "more frequently" (33%) than women who took a placebo pill (29%). They calculated digoxin increased the risk of death in women by 23%. There was no difference in the death rate for men in the study.
Digoxin is also used as a standard control substance to test for p-glycoprotein inhibition.

==Mechanism of actions==

The main pharmacological effects of digoxin are on the heart. Extracardiac effects are responsible for some of the therapeutic and many of the adverse effects (see above). It has mechanical effects as it increases myocardial contractility; however, the duration of the contractile response is just slightly increased. Overall, the heart rate is decreased, while blood pressure increases as the stroke volume is increased, leading to increased tissue perfusion. Myocardial efficiency is due to improved hemodynamics, and the ventricular function curve is improved.
Other, electrical effects are an initial brief increase in action potential, followed by a decrease as the K+ conductance increases due to an increased intracellular amounts of Ca2+ ions. The refractory period of the atria and ventricles is decreased, while it increases in the sinoatrial and AV nodes. A less negative resting membrane potential is made, leading to increased irritability. Other, more indirect effects are cholinomimetic because of vagal stimulation, giving rise to AV nodal delay.
The conduction velocity increases in the atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. Automaticity is also increased, in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers and ventricles.
ECG changes are increased PR interval, due to decreased AV conduction, and a decreased QT interval because of the altered duration of decreased action potential. Also, the T wave is inverted, accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
Slight vasodilation is seen in heart failure. This effect is contrary to effects that should be seen as a result of increased intracellular calcium levels, but this occurs since digoxin improves hemodynamics, which leads to restored angiotensin levels and decreased sympathetic discharge, causing indirect vasodilation.
Digoxin also affects the kidney by increased renal blood flow and increased glomerular filtration rate. A mild diuretic effect is seen only in heart failure.

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of action is not completely understood; however, the current hypothesis is outlined below.
Digoxin is a Cardiac Glycoside that acts as an inotropic agent, it decreases the action of the Na+/K+ ATPase channel by binding to an allosteric site. Normally 3 X Na+ moves out of the cardiac cell and 2 X K+ moves into the cardiac cell. As a result,Na+ concentration in myocyte increases and inactivates the NCX antiporter protein, which Na+ will no longer be pumped into the myocyte. On the other hand, inactivation of NCX causes Ca2+ concentration to increase inside the cell as Ca2+ cannot be pumped out. Increase in Ca2+ concentration thus aid contraction in the heart.
The benefits of Digoxin is an increased stroke volume, increased ejection fraction and decreased heart rate.

Charles Cullen admitted in 2003 to killing as many as 40 hospital patients with overdoses of heart medication—usually digoxin—at hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over his 16-year career as a nurse. On March 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences and is not eligible for parole.[tpl]cite news | publisher = USA Today | title = Victims' families set to confront killer | url = http://usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-01-patient-deaths_x.htm | date = 2006-01-01[/tpl]

On March 31, 2009, the FDA announced another generic digoxin pill recall by posting this company press release on the agency's web site: "Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. Announces a Nationwide Voluntary Recall of All Lots of Digoxin Tablets Due to Size Variability".
This March 31 press release from Caraco, a generic pharmaceutical company, states:

In the Turkish movie Once Upon a Time in Anatolia the prosecutor tells the doctor a story of a 'gorgeous woman' who died on the date she predicted she would die, well after delivering the baby. The doctor speculates she may have taken high doses of Dogoxin to die of heart attack. There are hints that she may have been the prosecutor's wife who committed suicide because she couldn't take his one time affair.
