Blairhall is a village in West Fife, Scotland. It is situated approximately [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] west of Comrie, and [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] west of Dunfermline. The village was originally a small hamlet but was expanded in 1911 to house the miners from a nearby colliery. Today Blairhall has a primary school and a community leisure centre.
Nearly [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] to the south, beyond Shiresmill, and to the west of the Bluther Burn, stands the 17th-century laird's house of Blairhall, which was the birthplace (c.1630) of Sir William Bruce, later baronet of Balcaskie and then Kinross, and Surveyor-General to King Charles II.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst14.html  |title=Blairhall |work=Gazetteer for Scotland |accessdate=2008-07-22[/tpl] 
In 2008, a further expansion of the village took place to the northwest, on an are called the Coo Park which was formerly the grounds of Comrie Castle. The park was landscaped with several parkland trees and a rigg-and-furrow system of cultivation from earlier times was evident. The house was owned by a James Anderson of Blairgowrie in the 1850s, but was demolished in the early 1960s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/92094/details/comrie+castle/ |title=Comrie Castle |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl] In the grounds there remain parkland trees, an overgrown ha-ha and the site of a curling pond.[tpl]cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/92094/details/comrie+castle/ |title=Comrie Castle |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl]
