[[MGP Nordic 2002]]

CATEGORIES: MGP Nordic, 2002 in Denmark

The MGP Nordic is a singing competition for children for the three Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. 
The winner was Razz with the song "Kickflipper".

==Creation of the MGP Nordic==

The contest originated in 2000 when Denmarks Radio held a song contest for Danish children that year and in 2001. The idea was extended to a Scandinavian song festival in 2002, MGP Nordic, with Denmark, Norway and Sweden as participants.
The MGP competition was combined with Junior Eurovision Song Contest after its creation in 2003. MGP Nordic was cancelled from 2003 to 2005 when the countries sent their finalists to JESC. But Denmark and Norway pulled out in 2006 and began holding MGP Nordic competitions again, preferring the original Scandinavian competition. Sweden participated in both contests in 2006 and 2007, with different contestants, but pulled out of JESC in 2008.
