Sparta (Doric Greek: [tpl]lang|grc-dor|Σπάρτα, Spártā[/tpl]; Attic Greek: [tpl]lang|grc-att|Σπάρτη, Spártē[/tpl]), or Lacedaemon,[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαίμων, Lakedaímōn[/tpl]) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece, situated on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese.[tpl]Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=91[/tpl] It emerged as a political entity around the 10th century BC,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014|reason=This statement (see also the stated date of establishment at the infobox) is inconsistent with and contradictory to the Myceanean Linear B attestation of 'Lakedaimonios' etc, found below at the 'Names' section. Mentioning Therapne does not negate or resolve this. Among others things, there are now the Hagios Basileios (Xerocampion) findings to consider; Mycenaean Greece seems to be surrounding Sparta. At minimum, there should be a rewording, somehow resolving the mutually opposed datings.[/tpl] when the invading Dorians subjugated the local, non-Dorian population. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.
Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars.[tpl]Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=174[/tpl] Between 431 and 404 BC, Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War,[tpl]Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=192[/tpl] from which it emerged victorious, though at great cost. Sparta's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta's prominent role in Greece. However, it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC. It then underwent a long period of decline, especially in the Middle Ages, when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras. Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives.
Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which completely focused on military training and excellence. Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates (Spartan citizens, who enjoyed full rights), Mothakes (non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans), Perioikoi (freedmen), and Helots (state-owned serfs, enslaved non-Spartan local population). Spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen, and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle. Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world.
Sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in the West following the revival of classical learning.[tpl]refn|group=n|For the nature of this development, see the article on Laconophilia.[/tpl] This love or admiration of Sparta is known as Laconism or Laconophilia. 
At its peak around 500 BC the size of the city would have been some 20,000-35,000 free residents, plus numerous helots and perioikoi (“dwellers around”). At 40,000+ it was one of the largest Greek cities;[tpl]citation|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|series=Princeton/Stanford Working Papers in Classics|title=The growth of Greek cities in the first millennium BC. v.1|date=December 2005|first=Ian|last=Morris[/tpl] however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000-610,000, making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 500 BC.[tpl]refn|group=n|According to Thucydides, the Athenian citizens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (5th century BC) numbered 40,000, making with their families a total of 140,000 people in all. The metics, i.e. those who did not have citizen rights and paid for the right to reside in Athens, numbered a further 70,000, whilst slaves were estimated at between 150,000 to 400,000.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece| editor-first=Nigel Guy|editor-last=Wilson|publisher=Routledge (UK)|year=2006|isbn=0-415-97334-1|pages=214–215[/tpl][/tpl]

==Names==

The earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the Mycenaean Greek [tpl]lang|gmy|𐀨𐀐𐀅𐀖𐀛𐀍[/tpl], ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo, "Lacedaimonian", written in Linear B syllabic script,[tpl]cite web|website=Palaeolexicon. Word study tool of Ancient languages|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16881|title=The Linear B word ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo[/tpl]
 being the equivalent of the written in the Greek alphabet, latter Greek, [tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαιμόνιος[/tpl], Lakedaimonios (Latin: Lacedaemonius).[tpl]harvnb|LIddell|Scott|1940|loc=[tpl]LSJ|*lakedai/mwn|Λακεδαιμόνιος, s.v. Λακεδαίμων[/tpl][/tpl].[tpl]L&S|Lacedaemon|Lacedaemonius, s.v. Lacedaemon|ref[/tpl]
The ancient Greeks used one of three words to refer to the home location of the Spartans. The first refers primarily to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the Eurotas River: Sparta.[tpl]harvnb|LIddell|Scott|1940|loc=[tpl]LSJ|*spa/rth|Σπάρτη[/tpl][/tpl]. The second word was Lacedaemon ([tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαίμων[/tpl]);[tpl]harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[tpl]LSJ|*lakedai/mwn|Λακεδαίμων[/tpl][/tpl]. this was also used sometimes as an adjective and is the name commonly used in the works of Homer and the Athenian historians Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus  seems to denote by it the Mycenaean Greek citadel at Therapne, in contrast to the lower town of Sparta. It could be used synonymously with Sparta, but typically it was not. It denoted the terrain on which Sparta was situated.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Lacedaemon | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Ancient Geography etc. | first=Alexander | last=MacBean | first2=Samuel | last2=Johnson | location=London | publisher=G. Robinson etc. | year=1773 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EqwBAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+dictionary+of+ancient+geography&hl=en&ei=RpRDTpD_MI6SgQf2vYi_CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Lacedaemon&f=false[/tpl]. In Homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside: wide, lovely, shining and most often hollow and broken (full of ravines).[tpl]harvnb|Autenrieth|1891|loc=Λακεδαίμων[/tpl]. The hollow suggests the Eurotas Valley. Sparta on the other hand is the country of lovely women, a people epithet.
The name of the population was often used for the state of Lacedaemon: the Lacedaemonians. This epithet utilized the plural of the adjective Lacedaemonius (Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαιμὀνιοι[/tpl]; Latin: Lacedaemonii, but also Lacedaemones). If the ancients wished to refer to the country more directly, instead of Lacedaemon, they could use a back-formation from the adjective: Lacedaemonian country. As most words for "country" were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine: Lacedaemonia ([tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαιμονία[/tpl], Lakedaimonia). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.
Lacedaemonia was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in ethnographers and lexica glossing place names. For example, Hesychius of Alexandria's Lexicon (5th century AD) defines Agiadae as a "place in Lacedaemonia" named after Agis.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=s.v. Ἀγιάδαι | encyclopedia=Hesychii Alexandrini Lexicon | editor-first=Maurice | editor-last=Schmidt | location=Jena | publisher=Frederick Mauk | year=1863|url= https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n24/mode/1up|language=Greek[/tpl]. At the Internet Archive The actual transition may be captured by Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae (7th century AD), an etymological dictionary. He relied heavily on Orosius' Historiarum Adversum Paganos (5th century AD) and Eusebius of Caesarea's Chronicon (early 5th century AD) as did Orosius. The latter defines Sparta to be Lacedaemonia Civitas but Isidore defines Lacedaemonia as founded by Lacedaemon, son of Semele, relying on Eusebius.[tpl]cite book | first=Leo | last=Wiener | title=Contributions toward a History of Arabico-Gothic Culture | volume=V. III: Tacitus' Germania & Other Forgeries | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Innes & Sones | year=1920 | page=20[/tpl] There is a rare use, perhaps the earliest of Lacedaemonia, in Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus Sicilus, Library, 19.70.2. but probably with [tpl]lang|grc|Χὠρα[/tpl] ("country") suppressed.
The immediate area around the town of Sparta, the plateau east of the Taygetos mountains, was generally referred as Laconice ([tpl]lang|grc|Λακωνική[/tpl]).[tpl]Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=4[/tpl]  This term was sometimes used to refer to all the regions under direct Spartan control, including Messenia.
Lacedaemon is now the name of a province in the modern Greek prefecture of Laconia.

==Geography==

Sparta is located in the region of Laconia, in the south-eastern Peloponnese.  Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the Evrotas River, the main river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water.  The valley of the Evrotas is a natural fortress, bounded to the west by Mt. Taygetus (2407 m) and to the east by Mt. Parnon (1935 m).  To the north, Laconia is separated from Arcadia by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude.  These natural defenses worked to Sparta's advantage and contributed to Sparta never having been sacked.  Though landlocked, Sparta had a harbor, Gytheio, on the Laconian Gulf.

==Mythology==

Lacedaemon (Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Λακεδαίμων[/tpl]) was a mythical king of Laconia.[tpl]harvnb|Pausanias|1918|loc= Description of Greece, ΙΙΙ.1.2[/tpl]. The son of Zeus by the nymph Taygete,  he married Sparta, the daughter of Eurotas, by whom he became the father of Amyclas, Eurydice, and Asine.  He named the country after himself and the city after his wife. He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the Charites, which stood between Sparta and Amyclae, and to have given to those divinities the names of Cleta and Phaenna. A shrine was erected to him in the neighborhood of Therapne.

==Archaeology of the classical period==

Thucydides wrote: Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame.  Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.Thucydides, i. 10 
Until the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the theatre, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the retaining walls; the so-called Tomb of Leonidas, a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the Eurotas; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman fortifications; several brick buildings and mosaic pavements.
The remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the American School at Athens. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.
In 1904, the British School at Athens began a thorough exploration of Laconia, and in the following year excavations were made at Thalamae, Geronthrae, and Angelona near Monemvasia. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta.
A small circus described by Leake proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after AD 200 around the altar and in front of the temple of Artemis Orthia. Here musical and gymnastic contests took place as well as the famous flogging ordeal (diamastigosis). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The votive offerings in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead found in great profusion within the precinct range, dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, supply invaluable evidence for early Spartan art.
In 1907, the sanctuary of Athena "of the Brazen House" (Chalkioikos) was located on the acropolis immediately above the theatre, and though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription of Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings. The Greek city-wall, built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century, was traced for a great part of its circuit, which measured 48 stades or nearly [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] (Polyb. 1X. 21). The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of AD 262, was also investigated. Besides the actual buildings discovered, a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of Spartan topography, based upon the description of Pausanias. Excavations showed that the town of the Mycenaean Period was situated on the left bank of the Eurotas, a little to the south-east of Sparta. The settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north. Its area was approximately equal to that of the "newer" Sparta, but denudation has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left save ruined foundations and broken potsherds.

==History==

===Archaic period===

The prehistory of Sparta is difficult to reconstruct because the literary evidence is far removed in time from the events it describes and is also distorted by oral tradition.Herodot, Book I, 56.3   However, the earliest certain evidence of human settlement in the region of Sparta consists of pottery dating from the Middle Neolithic period, found in the vicinity of Kouphovouno some two kilometres ([tpl]convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) south-southwest of Sparta.[tpl]Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=28[/tpl]  These are the earliest traces of the original Mycenaean Spartan civilisation, as represented in Homer's Iliad. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
This civilization seems to have fallen into decline by the late Bronze Age, when, according to Herodotus, Macedonian tribes from the north marched into Peloponnese, where they were called Dorians and subjugating the local tribes, settled there.  The Dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of Spartan territory almost before they had established their own state.[tpl]Harvnb|Ehrenberg|2004|p=31[/tpl]  They fought against the Argive Dorians to the east and southeast, and also the Arcadian Achaeans to the northwest.  The evidence suggests that Sparta, relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the Taygetan plain, was secure from early on: it was never fortified.
Nothing distinctive in the archaeology of the Eurotas River Valley identifies the Dorians or the Dorian Spartan state. The prehistory of the Neolithic, the Bronze Age and the Dark Age (the Early Iron Age) at this moment must be treated apart from the stream of Dorian Spartan history.
The legendary period of Spartan history is believed to fall into the Dark Age. It treats the mythic heroes such as the Heraclids and the Perseids, offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.
Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Spartans experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife, later attested by both Herodotus and Thucydides.[tpl]Harvnb|Ehrenberg|2004|p=36[/tpl] As a result they carried out a series of political and social reforms of their own society which they later attributed to a semi-mythical lawgiver, Lycurgus.[tpl]Harvnb|Ehrenberg|2004|p=33[/tpl]  These reforms mark the beginning of the history of Classical Sparta.

===Classical Sparta===

In the Second Messenian War, Sparta established itself as a local power in Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece. During the following centuries, Sparta's reputation as a land-fighting force was unequaled."A Historical Commentary on Thucydides"—David Cartwright, p. 176 In 480 BC a small force of Spartans, Thespians, and Thebans led by King Leonidas (approximately 300 were full Spartiates, 700 were Thespians, and 400 were Thebans although these numbers do not reflect casualties incurred prior to the final battle), made a legendary last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae against the massive Persian army, inflicting very high casualties on the Persian forces before finally being encircled.[tpl]Harvnb|Green|1998|p=10[/tpl] The superior weaponry, strategy, and bronze armour of the Greek hoplites and their phalanx again proved their worth one year later when Sparta assembled at full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians at the battle of Plataea.
The decisive Greek victory at Plataea put an end to the Greco-Persian War along with Persian ambition of expanding into Europe. Even though this war was won by a pan-Greek army, credit was given to Sparta, who besides being the protagonist at Thermopylae and Plataea, had been the de facto leader of the entire Greek expedition.Britannica ed. 2006, "Sparta"
In later Classical times, Sparta along with Athens, Thebes, and Persia had been the main powers fighting for supremacy against each other. As a result of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, a traditionally continental culture, became a naval power. At the peak of its power Sparta subdued many of the key Greek states and even managed to overpower the elite Athenian navy. By the end of the 5th century BC it stood out as a state which had defeated the Athenian Empire and had invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia, a period which marks the Spartan Hegemony.
During the Corinthian War Sparta faced a coalition of the leading Greek states: Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and Argos. The alliance was initially backed by Persia, whose lands in Anatolia had been invaded by Sparta and which feared further Spartan expansion into Asia."Dictionary of Ancient&Medieval Warfare"—Matthew Bennett, p. 86 Sparta achieved a series of land victories, but many of her ships were destroyed at the battle of Cnidus by a Greek-Phoenician mercenary fleet that Persia had provided to Athens. The event severely damaged Sparta's naval power but did not end its aspirations of invading further into Persia, until Conon the Athenian ravaged the Spartan coastline and provoked the old Spartan fear of a helot revolt."The Oxford Illustrated History of Greece and the Hellenistic World" p. 141, John Boardman, Jasper Griffin, Oswyn Murray
After a few more years of fighting, in 387 BC the Peace of Antalcidas was established, according to which all Greek cities of Ionia would return to Persian control, and Persia's Asian border would be free of the Spartan threat. The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system.Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 556-9 Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra. This was the first time that a Spartan army lost a land battle at full strength.
As Spartan citizenship was inherited by blood, Sparta now increasingly faced a helot population that vastly outnumbered its citizens. The alarming decline of Spartan citizens was commented on by Aristotle.

===Hellenistic and Roman Sparta===

Sparta never fully recovered from the losses that the Spartans suffered at Leuctra in 371 BC and the subsequent helot revolts. Nonetheless, it was able to continue as a regional power for over two centuries. Neither Philip II nor his son Alexander the Great attempted to conquer Sparta itself.
During Alexander's campaigns in the east, the Spartan king, Agis III sent a force to Crete in 333 BC with the aim of securing the island for Sparta.Agis III Agis next took command of allied Greek forces against Macedon, gaining early successes, before laying siege to Megalopolis in 331 BC. A large Macedonian army under general Antipater marched to its relief and defeated the Spartan-led force in a pitched battle.Agis III, by E. Badian  © 1967 - Jstor More than 5,300 of the Spartans and their allies were killed in battle, and 3,500 of Antipater's troops.Diodorus, World History Agis, now wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy them time to retreat. On his knees, the Spartan king slew several enemy soldiers before being finally killed by a javelin.Diodorus, World History, 17.62.1-63.4;tr. C.B. Welles Alexander was merciful, and he only forced the Spartans to join the League of Corinth, which they had previously refused to join.Alexander the Great and his time By Agnes Savill Page 44 ISBN 0-88029-591-0
Even during its decline, Sparta never forgot its claim to be the "defender of Hellenism" and its Laconic wit. An anecdote has it that when Philip II sent a message to Sparta saying "If I enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta", the Spartans responded with the single, terse reply: [tpl]lang|grc|αἴκα[/tpl], "if".[tpl]harvnb|Davies |1998|pp=133[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Plutarch|1874|loc=De garrulitate, 17[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Plutarch|1891|loc=De garrulitate, 17[/tpl]; in Greek.
When Philip created the league of the Greeks on the pretext of unifying Greece against Persia, the Spartans chose not to join, since they had no interest in joining a pan-Greek expedition unless it were under Spartan leadership. Thus, upon the conquest of Persia, Alexander the Great sent to Athens 300 suits of Persian armour with the following inscription: Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks 'except the Spartans', give these offerings taken from the foreigners who live in Asia added.
During the Punic Wars Sparta was an ally of the Roman Republic. Spartan political independence was put to an end when it was eventually forced into the Achaean League.  In 146 BC Greece was conquered by the Roman general Lucius Mummius.  Following the Roman conquest, the Spartans continued their way of life, and the city became a tourist attraction for the Roman elite who came to observe exotic Spartan customs.

===Medieval and modern Sparta===

According to Byzantine sources, some parts of the Laconian region remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD. Doric-speaking populations survive today in Tsakonia.  In the Middle Ages, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of Mystras.  Modern Sparti was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King Otto of Greece.

==Structure of Classical Spartan society==

===Constitution===

Sparta is an Oligarchy. The state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the Agiad and Eurypontid families,[tpl]harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=89[/tpl] both supposedly descendants of Heracles and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.
The duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. They were the chief priests of the state and also maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, which always exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus, about 450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads. Aristotle describes the kingship at Sparta as "a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship" (Pol. iii. I285a),The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and ... - Page 611. primary and secondary source while Isocrates refers to the Spartans as "subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign" (iii. 24).The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and ... - Page 611. primary secondary source
Civil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the ephors, as well as a council of elders known as the Gerousia.  The Gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings.[ref]The Greeks at War
