The Kakapo (Māori: kākāpō, night parrot), Strigops habroptilus (Gray, 1845), also called owl parrot, is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family Strigopoidea endemic to New Zealand.[tpl]cite journal|author=H.A.

A certain combination of traits makes it unique among its kind; it is the world's only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low basal metabolic rate, no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006| author=Ralph G. Powlesland, Don V. Merton, and John F.

Like many other New Zealand bird species, the Kakapo was historically important to the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore. It was hunted and used as a resource by Māori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. It was also sometimes kept as a pet.
The Kakapo is critically endangered; as of March 2014, with an additional sixhttp://www.upi.com/Science_News/2014/03/18/Rare-kakapo-chicks-born-in-New-Zealand/3381395178861/ from the first hatchings since 2011, the total known population is only [tpl]Number_of_Living_Kakapo[/tpl] living individuals, as reported by the Kakapo Recovery program, most of which have been given names.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.anotherchancetosee.com/2006/08/kakapo-parrots-86-names.html| title= KAKAPO PARROTS – The 86 Names| publisher=anotherchancetosee.com| date=4 August 2006| accessdate=2007-02-06[/tpl] Because of Polynesian and European colonisation and the introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats, the Kakapo was almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of April 2012, surviving Kakapo are kept on three predator-free islands, Codfish (Whenua Hou), Anchor and Little Barrier islands, where they are closely monitored.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/kakapo-habitat/|title=Kakapo Habitat|publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2014-03-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Kakapo relocated to raise chicks|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/6746273/Kakapo-relocated-to-raise-chicks|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=16 April 2012[/tpl] Two large Fiordland islands, Resolution and Secretary, have been the subject of large-scale ecological restoration activities to prepare self-sustaining ecosystems with suitable habitat for the Kakapo. The New Zealand government is willingly providing the use of these islands to Kakapo conservation.

==Taxonomy, systematics and naming==

The Kakapo was originally described by English ornithologist George Robert Gray in 1845. Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek strix, genitive strigos "owl", and ops "face", while its specific epithet comes from habros "soft", and ptilon "feather".[tpl]Cite book| author = Liddell, Henry George and Robert Scott | year = 1980 | title = A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition) | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4[/tpl] It has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own tribe, Strigopini. Recent phylogenetic studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the Kākā and the Kea, both belonging to the New Zealand parrot genus Nestor. Together, they are now considered a separate family within the parrots, Strigopidae.[tpl]Cite book|title=Systematics and Taxonomy of Australian Birds|author=Christidis L, Boles WE |year=2008 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-643-06511-6 |page=200[/tpl] Within the Strigopidae, the Kakapo is placed in its own tribe, Strigopini. The common ancestor of the Kakapo and the genus Nestor became isolated from the remaining parrot species when New Zealand broke off from Gondwana, around 82 million years ago. Around 70 million years ago, the Kakapo diverged from the genus Nestor.[tpl]cite journal|title=A Multilocus Molecular Phylogeny of the Parrots (Psittaciformes): Support for a Gondwanan Origin during the Cretaceous|journal=Mol Biol Evol|year=2008|first=T.F. |last=Wright|author2=Schirtzinger E.

Earlier ornithologists felt that the Kakapo might be related to the ground parrots and Night Parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies;Schodde, R. & Mason, I.J. (1981). Nocturnal Birds of Australia. Illustrated by Jeremy Boot. Melbourne: Lansdowne Edns 136 pp. 22 pls 35–36 rather, the cryptic colour seems to be adaptation to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.Leeton, P.R.J., Christidis, L., Westerman, M. & Boles, W.E. (1994). Molecular phylogenetic relationships of the Night Parrot (Geopsittacus occidentalis) and the Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus). Auk 111: 833–843
The name "Kakapo" is the English transliteration of "kākāpō" which is derived from the Māori terms kākā ("parrot") + pō ("night"). The Polynesian term kākā and its variant ʻāʻā were the generic South Pacific terms for Psittacidae. For example, the native names of the Kākā, the extinct Black-fronted Parakeet (Cyanoramphus zealandicus) of Tahiti, and the New Zealand members of the genus Cyanoramphus are also derived from them.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Description==

The Kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; the male measures up to [tpl]convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and weighs from [tpl]convert|2|to|4|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at maturity.[tpl]Cite book|author=Higgins, P.J.| year=1999| title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds. Volume 4: Parrots to Dollarbird| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Melbourne| isbn=0-19-553071-3[/tpl] The Kakapo cannot fly, having short wings for its size and lacking the pronounced keel bone (sternum) that anchors the flight muscles of other birds. It uses its wings for balance, support, and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike other land birds, the Kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat to store energy, making it the heaviest parrot.
The upper parts of the Kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation.
Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck and face are predominantly yellowish, streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the specific epithet habroptilus. The Kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers, resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the "owl parrot". The beak is surrounded by delicate vibrissae or "whiskers", which the bird uses to sense the ground for navigation as it walks with its head lowered. The mandible is mostly ivory-coloured, with part of the upper mandible being bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, zygodactyl (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.
The female is easily distinguished from the male: she has a more narrow and less domed head, her beak is narrower and proportionally longer, her cere and nostrils smaller, her legs and feet more slender and pinkish grey, and her tail proportionally longer. While her plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. She tends to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. A nesting female also has a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.
Like many parrots, the Kakapo has a variety of calls. As well as the booms (see below for a recording) and chings of their mating calls, it will often skraark to announce its location to other birds.
The Kakapo has a well-developed sense of smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can discriminate among odours while foraging; a behaviour reported for only one other parrot species. One of the most striking characteristics of the Kakapo is its pleasant and powerful odour, which has been described as musty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/up-close-and-personal/|title=Up Close & Personal|publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl] Given the Kakapo's well-developed sense of smell, this scent may be a social chemosignal. The smell often alerts predators to the largely defenceless Kakapo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Kakapo.asp?page=/facts/Kakapo.asp|title=Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus)|publisher=Wild Magazine[/tpl]

===Anatomy===

The skeleton of the Kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small, and has a low, vestigial, keel, and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some other flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused, but consists of a pair of clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The Kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.
The pectoral musculature of the Kakapo is also modified by flightlessness. The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that is associated with the large crop.
