[[Atlanta Pops Symphony Orchestra]]

CATEGORIES: American orchestras, Pops orchestras, Musical groups established in 1945

The Atlanta Pops Orchestra was established in 1945 and was run by Albert Coleman. Albert Coleman, a French immigrant, began working at WSB Radio in Atlanta, Georgia in 1944. At the time- he saw a need to gather what he considered to be the best musicians to form the Atlanta Pops Orchestra. The orchestra was to play for radio dates, public concerts,and free performances to benefit the arts, the area youth, and aspiring musicians. The Atlanta Pops became known throughout the southeast as a result of concerts free to local audiences in Atlanta. Albert was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to both the orchestra and the multitude of young artists whose careers were assisted by him an for the diversity and longevity of his involvement in the arts in Georgia.
They have received two dozen Grammy Awards.http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/atlanta_symphony_orchestra.html
Albert Coleman retired in 1998 and between 1998 and 2002 the orchestra performed under guest conductors for mainly private events. In 2002 the management was assumed by Altieri & Associates Entertainment, Inc. an Atlanta management, booking and musical contracting company. John Head was the principal conductor from 2002 to 2010 at which time Mr. Head retired and Dr. Jason D. Altieri was officially hired as the Conductor and Music Director. Jason Altieri is also the Associated Conductor of the Reno Philharmonic in Nevada as well as guest conducting nationally and internationally.
Under Dr. Altieri, the Pops has broadened its original musical goals to include corporate events as well as school clinics and concerts and entire community concert series. The orchestra is also planning to perform an even wider variety of programs that will include church concerts. It hires its own members to perform in Broadway shows visiting Atlanta and in other tours and celebrity shows appearing in this area such as Mannheim Steamroller, Celtic Woman, Johnny Mathis and many others over the recent past.
Albert Coleman died in December 2007, but the Atlanta Pops symphony continues to feature a broad range of guest soloists and emerging talent.
