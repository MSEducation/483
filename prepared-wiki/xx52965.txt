The UEFA European Championship is the primary association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), determining the continental champion of Europe. Held every four years since 1960, in the even-numbered year between World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the UEFA European Nations Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form "UEFA Euro year"; this format has since been retroactively applied to earlier tournaments.
Prior to entering the tournament all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. The championship winners earn the opportunity to compete in the following FIFA Confederations Cup, but are not obliged to do so.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=95756/index.html |title=2005/2006 season: final worldwide matchday to be 14 May 2006 |work=FIFA.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |date=19 December 2004 |accessdate=13 January 2012[/tpl]
The 14 European Championship tournaments have been won by nine different national teams: Germany and Spain each have won three titles, France has two titles, and Soviet Union, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Denmark and Greece have won one title each. To date, Spain are the only side in history to have won consecutive titles, doing so in the 2008 and 2012 editions.
The most recent championship, co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine in 2012, was won by Spain, who beat Italy 4–0 at the final in Kiev. The next European Championship will be hosted in France.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/footballfirst/newsid=1837508.html |title=Focus turns to France in 2016 |work=UEFA.com |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |publisher=Union of European Football Associations[/tpl]

==History==

===Beginnings===

The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started—three years after Delaunay's death.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/finals/history/background/index.html |title=UEFA European Football Championship origins |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1960/overview/index.html |title=Delaunay's dream realised in France |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/history/background/the-trophy/index.html |title=The Henri Delaunay Cup |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1960/teams/index.html |title=1960 UEFA European Championship - Teams |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1960/matches/round=164/match=4025/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Ponedelnik heads Soviet Union to glory |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 October 2003 |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the USSR due to political protests.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17680769 |title=Euro 1960: Lev Yashin leads Soviets to glory in France |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 June 2012 |first=Tom |last=Rostance |date=21 May 2012[/tpl] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, The Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/history/3078333.stm |title=France 1960 |date=17 May 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl]

The 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout.

===Expansion to 8 teams===

The competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/history/3083203.stm |title=Italy 1980 |date=17 May 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1980/matches/round=198/match=3585/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Hrubesch turns West Germany's unlikely hero |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=4 October 2003 |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half.

UEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4021041.stm |title=Greece defy the odds at Euro 2004 |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=20 December 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl] On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3830575.stm |title=France 0-1 Greece |date=25 June 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3844467.stm |title=Greece 1-0 Czech Rep |date=1 July 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1583/match=1059193/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Dellas delight stuns Czech Republic |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=2 July 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=149550.html |title=Limit on international substitutions |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=28 February 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl]

The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, "GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity,"[tpl]cite web |title=Sepp Blatter confident of positive goal-line technology vote |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18520916 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 [/tpl] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.

==Trophy==

The Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years prior to the first tournament in 1960. His son, Pierre, was in charge of creating the trophy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=389177.html |title=You won't find a superior trophy |first=Michael |last=Harrold |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |location=London |date=27 January 2006 |accessdate=13 January 2012[/tpl] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament.
For the 2008 tournament, the trophy was slightly remodelled to make it larger. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs [tpl]convert|8|kg[/tpl] and is [tpl]convert|60|cm[/tpl] tall, being seven inches longer and one pound heavier than the old one. A small figure juggling a ball on the back of the original was removed, as was the marble plinth. The silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=387580.html |title=New trophy for UEFA EURO 2008 |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=13 January 2012[/tpl] This version of the trophy has only ever been won by one team, Spain up to date.

===The competition===

Before 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.
For 2016, the competition will increase to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the breakups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl]
The competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.
Since the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.

===Qualifying===

In order to qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.
The groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:
The qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2012, the group qualifying phase consists of nine groups; six of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.
Each group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. Teams then either qualify for the final tournament or to further playoffs depending on their position in the group. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:

===Final tournament===

Sixteen teams progress to the final tournament; for the 2012 tournament, they were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams are divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups are drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists will be assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.
The four groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the quarter-finals, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.
