==History==

In the early 20th century, the railroad and tourism started to decline. Coal mining and timber production continued at a much slower pace. Today, tourism has made a dramatic rebound in the county with logging and farming making up the greatest part of the economic base. Due to a cold climate and lack of any large city, Garrett County has remained a sparsely populated rural area.

==Law and government==

===Government===

The County is governed by an elected Board of County Commissioners (the "Board"), whose three members serve four-year terms and must live in the District they represent. The Board is the traditional form of county government in Maryland and may exercise only such powers as are conferred by the General Assembly of Maryland.

==Geography==

Garrett County is Maryland's westernmost county, bordered to the north by the Mason-Dixon Line with Pennsylvania, to the south by the Potomac River and West Virginia, to the west by a land border with West Virginia, and to the east by a land border with Allegany County, Maryland.  The county's northwesternmost point is approximately [tpl]convert|60|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its southeasternmost point is approximately [tpl]convert|160|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of Baltimore, Maryland.
Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the Appalachian Mountains known variously as the Allegheny Mountains, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Appalachian Plateau.  The county's highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of [tpl]convert|3360|ft|m[/tpl] at Hoye-Crest along Backbone Mountain, the highest point in the state of Maryland.  As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately [tpl]convert|500|ft|m[/tpl].  River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to [tpl]convert|1800|ft|m[/tpl] below surrounding peaks.
The county contains over [tpl]convert|76000|acre|km2[/tpl] of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.  It is drained by two river systems, the Potomac and the Youghiogheny. The Savage River, a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county.  The Casselman River, a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county’s central section into Pennsylvania. The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, just south of Pittsburgh.

===Geologic points of interest===

====The Glades: Maryland's largest and most open mountain peatland====

The Glades' [tpl]convert|601|acre|km2[/tpl] is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to [tpl]convert|9|ft|m[/tpl] thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the Appalachians.
On the western edge of the Savage River State Forest along Maryland Route 495 lies Bittinger, Maryland. Named after Henry Bittinger who first settled in the area, other German settlers moved in and took up the fertile farm land. On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest glades area of Garrett County. Geographically, this is an area which seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America. Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of peat moss.

====Loess Dunes====

In the Casselman River valley, [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] south of Grantsville, Maryland and beside Maryland Route 495, one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America. A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of Maryland Route 495 that are "loess" (wind-blown) material. Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.
The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted. Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.
