==Education==

Stucky received his PhD  in physical chemistry from Iowa State University (Advisor: R. E. Rundle) in 1962. In 1962–63, he was a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Physics at MIT (Prof. Clifford G. Shull). His independent academic career started in 1964, when he was a professor of inorganic chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1972, he was promoted to full professor at UIUC but left in 1980 to work at Sandia National Laboratory and the DuPont Central Research and Development. He joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1986, where he is now the E. Khashoggi Industries, LLC Professor in Letters and Science, professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry (College of Letters and Science), professor in the Materials Department (College of Engineering), and a member of the Interdepartmental Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chem.ucsb.edu/~stuckygroup/stuckygroup/ |title=The Stucky Group: Home at UCSB |publisher=Chem.ucsb.edu |accessdate=December 17, 2011[/tpl]
