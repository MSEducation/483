Bombo is a suburb of the Municipality of Kiama, in the Illawarra Region of New South Wales, Australia.  It is located just 2 kilometres from Kiama. Bombo is the gateway between Kiama and its northern suburbs, Kiama Downs and Minnamurra.  A newly built section of the Princes Highway runs through Bombo, past Bombo Beach and Bombo railway station. Its main waterway is Spring Creek.
Bombo Railway Station was opened in 1887 and was the original Kiama station and the last station on the South Coast Line until 1893 when the tunnel was built to Kiama. It is the closest railway station to the ocean in New South Wales.
Bombo is derived from "Thumbon", the name of a renowned headman and warrior born in this district.[tpl]NSW GNR|id=KWIOWyqb|title=Bombo|accessdate=20 June 2009[/tpl]
