Cool Ground is a former National Hunt racehorse.  He won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1992, as well as the Kim Muir in 1989, the Anthony Mildmay, Peter Cazalet Memorial Chase in 1990 and 1991, the Welsh National in 1990 and the Greenalls Gold Cup (now called the Grand National Trial) in 1991.  Adrian Maguire rode him in his Gold Cup win where he won by a thrilling short-head over The Fellow with Docklands Express back in a close third.  His victory was a shock at 25/1 (he'd been 40/1 earlier in the day). Toby Balding trained him during that part of his career, and he was looked after by Kim Tierney.  The race took its toll on the horse and his only subsequent win was just over three years later.
