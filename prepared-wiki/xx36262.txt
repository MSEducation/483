 Longships Lighthouse is a navigation aid about [tpl]convert|1.25|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] off the coast of Lands End in Cornwall, UK. It stands on Carn Bras, the highest of the Longships islets which rises [tpl]convert|12|m|disp=flip[/tpl] above high water level. The lighthouse has been unmanned since 1988.

==History==

The original tower was built in 1795 to the design of Trinity House architect Samuel Wyatt. The lantern was [tpl]convert|24|m|disp=flip[/tpl] above sea level but very high seas obscured its light.Trinity House website; Longships lighthouse; retrieved April 2010

The tower was first lit in December 1873 having cost £43,870 to build. Even after these improvements, the S.S. Bluejacket was wrecked on rocks near the lighthouse on a clear night in 1898, nearly demolishing the lighthouse in the process.

==Operation==

The current lantern, which has a range of [tpl]convert|11|nmi[/tpl], emits one long five-second flash every ten seconds. Seaward flashes are white but they become red - due to tinted sectors - for any vessel straying too close to either Cape Cornwall to the north or Gwennap Head to the south-southeast. 
Fog horn signals sound every ten seconds.
