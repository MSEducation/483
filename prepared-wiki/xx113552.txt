Hendrik "Hendrie" Krüzen (born 24 November 1964 in Almelo, Overijssel) is a retired Dutch footballer who played as a left midfielder.

==Club career==

Krüzen made his senior debuts at only 16, with hometown's Heracles Almelo. After two solid years with FC Den Bosch, scoring in double figures, he signed with Eredivisie giants PSV Eindhoven, appearing rarely as the club won the double in the 1988–89 season, and also being loaned to his previous team.
Krüzen spent the following five years in neighbouring Belgium, representing K.V. Kortrijk, R.F.C. de Liège and K.S.V. Waregem. After the latter's relegation from the top flight, he returned to his country, joining first professional club Heracles, and moving to AZ Alkmaar in January 1996.
In 2002, after a spell in the Dutch second level with Go Ahead Eagles and two years in amateur football, Krüzen retired from football after 20 professional seasons, with totals of 556 games and 148 goals. Immediately afterwards, he returned to his first team, acting as assistant coach for several years.

==International career==

Krüzen made his debut for the Netherlands on 16 December 1987, in a UEFA Euro 1988 qualifier against Greece (3–0 away win). 
He would be selected by manager Rinus Michels for the final stages in West Germany, being an unused member as the national team won the tournament.
