The M2 Machine Gun or Browning .50 Caliber Machine Gun is a heavy machine gun designed towards the end of World War I by John Browning. It is very similar in design to Browning's earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06 cartridge. The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). The M2 has been referred to as "Ma Deuce",[tpl]cite book |last = Rottman |first = Gordon |title = The Us Army in the Vietnam War 1965–73 |publisher = Osprey Publishing |location = Reading |year = 2008 |isbn = 1-84603-239-3 |page=56[/tpl] as a GI phonetic slang or "the fifty" in reference to its caliber. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications and low-flying aircraft. The M2 machine gun has been in production longer than any other machine gun.
The Browning .50 caliber machine gun has been used extensively as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft armament by the United States from the 1930s to the present. It was heavily used during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Falklands War, and during the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan in the 2000s and 2010s. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries, and has been used by many other countries. The M2 has been in use longer than any other small arm in U.S. inventory except the .45 ACP M1911 pistol, also designed by John Browning.
The current M2HB is manufactured in the United States by General Dynamics[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4360 |title=Contracts for Friday, September 03, 2010 |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19[/tpl] and U.S. Ordnance[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4072 |title=Contracts for Wednesday, July 15, 2009 |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19[/tpl] for use by the United States government, and for U.S. Foreign Allies via FMS sales.

==History==

The United States did not have many machine guns when it entered World War I, and most were of old technology. The machine gun was heavily used in World War I, and weapons of larger than rifle caliber were appearing. Both the British and French had large caliber machine guns. The larger rounds were needed to defeat the armor that was being introduced to the battlefield. Armor was also appearing in the skies. During World War I, the Germans introduced a heavily armored airplane, the Junkers J.I. The armor made aircraft machine guns using conventional rifle ammunition (such as the .30-06) ineffective.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|p=333[/tpl], stating "The Germans put a heavily armored plane into service during the closing days of World War I. This act made obsolete for all time the rifle-caliber machine gun for aerial use. Some countries were slower to accept the fact than others but nevertheless it cannot be disputed. The United States was among the first to come to this realization."  
Consequently, the American Expeditionary Force's commander General John J. Pershing asked for a larger caliber machine gun.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|pp=181–182[/tpl] Pershing asked the Army Ordnance Department to develop a machine gun with a caliber of at least [tpl]Convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3[/tpl] and a muzzle velocity of at least [tpl]Convert|2700|ft/s|m/s[/tpl]. U.S. Col. John Henry Parker, commanding a machine gun school in France, observed the effectiveness of a French [tpl]convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] incendiary armor-piercing round. The Army Ordnance Department ordered eight experimental Colt machine guns rechambered for the French 11-mm cartridge.[tpl]harvnb|Chinn|1951|182[/tpl] The French had developed a prototype machine gun for an even larger caliber.
The French 11-mm round was found to be unsuitable because its velocity was too low. Pershing wanted a bullet of at least [tpl]convert|670|gr|g|abbr=on[/tpl] and a muzzle velocity of [tpl]convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl]. Development with the French round was dropped.
Around July 1917, John M. Browning started redesigning his .30 caliber machine for a larger caliber. Winchester worked on the cartridge, which was a scaled up version of the .30-06. Winchester initially added a rim to the cartridge because the company  wanted to use the cartridge in an anti-tank rifle, but Pershing insisted the cartridge be rimless.  The first .50 machine gun underwent trials on 15 October 1918. It fired at less than 500 rounds per minute, and the muzzle velocity was only [tpl]convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl]. Cartridge improvements were promised.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|p=183[/tpl] The gun was heavy, difficult to control, fired too slowly for anti-personnel, and was not powerful enough against armor.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|p=184[/tpl]
While the .50 was being developed, some German anti-tank rifles and ammunition were seized.  The German rounds had a muzzle velocity of [tpl]convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl], an [tpl]convert|800|gr|g|abbr=on[/tpl] bullet, and could pierce [tpl]convert|1|inch|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|250|yard|m|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|p=184[/tpl].  Chinn states the German round was 12.7-mm anti-tank, but it may have been the 13.2mm TuF round.  The Germans were working on their MG 18 TuF heavy machine gun. Winchester made the .50 caliber round have similar performance. Ultimately, the muzzle velocity was [tpl]convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Chinn|1951|p=186[/tpl]
Efforts by John M. Browning and Fred T. Moore resulted in the water-cooled Browning machine gun, caliber .50, M1921. An aircraft version was termed the Browning aircraft machine gun, caliber .50, M1921. These guns were used experimentally from 1921 until 1937. They had light-weight barrels and the ammunition only fed from the left side. Service trials raised doubts whether the guns would be suitable for aircraft or for anti-aircraft use. A heavy barrel M1921 was considered for ground vehicles.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|pp=333–335[/tpl]
John M. Browning died in 1926. Between 1927 and 1932, Dr. S.H. Green studied the design problems of the M1921 and the needs of the armed services. The result was a single receiver design that could be turned into seven types of .50 caliber machine guns by using different jackets, barrels, and other components. The new receiver allowed right or left hand feed. In 1933, Colt manufactured several prototype Browning machine guns (including what would be known as the M1921A1 and M1921E2). With support from the Navy, Colt started manufacturing the M2 in 1933.[tpl]Harvnb|Chinn|1951|pp=336–337[/tpl]
A variant without a water jacket, but with a thicker-walled, air-cooled barrel was designated the M2 HB (HB for Heavy Barrel). The added mass and surface area of the heavy barrel compensated somewhat for the loss of water-cooling, while reducing bulk and weight: the M2 weighs [tpl]convert|121|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] with a water jacket, but the M2 HB weighs [tpl]convert|84|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Due to the long procedure for changing the barrel, an improved system was developed called QCB (quick change barrel). The lightweight "Army/Navy" prefixed AN/M2 "light-barrel" version of the Browning M2 weighing [tpl]convert|60|lb|kg[/tpl] was also developed, and became the standard aviation machine gun of the World War II-era for American military aircraft of nearly every type.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skylighters.org/history/mgs/ |title=Skylighters, The Web Site of the 225th AAA Searchlight Battalion: AAA Weapons in Focus - The M2 .50-Caliber Machine Gun |publisher=Skylighters.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl]

==Design details==

The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun. The M2 fires from a closed bolt, operated on the short recoil principle. The M2 fires the .50 BMG cartridge, which offers long range, accuracy and immense stopping power. The closed bolt firing cycle made the M2 usable as a synchronized machine gun on aircraft before and during World War II, as on the early versions of the Curtiss P-40 fighter.
The M2 is a scaled-up version of John Browning's M1917 .30 caliber machine gun, even using the same timing gauges.

===Features===

The M2 has varying cyclic rates of fire, depending on the model.  The M2HB (heavy barrel) air-cooled ground gun has a cyclical rate of 450-575 rounds per minute.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 310–311: the official rate during WWII was 450–575 rpm, but it was extremely rare to encounter a M2HB that exceeded 550 rpm.  The early M2 water-cooled AA guns had a cyclical rate of around 450–600 rpm.DiGiulian, Tony, USA 0.50"/90 (12.7 mm) M2 Browning Machine Gun (2007) Article  The AN/M2 aircraft gun has a cyclic rate of 750–850 rpm; this increases to 1,200 rpm or more for AN/M3 aircraft guns fitted with electric or mechanical feed boost mechanisms.  These maximum rates of fire are generally not achieved in use, as sustained fire at that rate will wear out the bore within a few thousand rounds, necessitating replacement.  In addition to full automatic, the M2HB can be selected to fire single-shots or at less than 40 rounds per minute, or rapid fire for more than 40 rounds per minute.  Slow and rapid firing modes use 5-7 round bursts with different lengths of pause between bursts.FM 23-65, "Browning Machine Gun Caliber .50 HB, M2" United States Department of the Army, December 2002.
The M2 has an effective range of [tpl]Convert|1830|m|yard[/tpl] and a maximum effective range of [tpl]Convert|2000|m|yard[/tpl] when fired from the M3 tripod. In its ground-portable, crew-served role as the M2HB, the gun itself weighs a hefty [tpl]Convert|84|lb|kg[/tpl], and the assembled M3 tripod another [tpl]Convert|44|lb|kg[/tpl]. In this configuration, the V-shaped "butterfly" trigger is located at the very rear of the weapon, with a "spade handle" hand-grip on either side of it and the bolt release the center. The spade handles are gripped and the butterfly trigger is depressed with one or both thumbs. Recently new rear buffer assemblies have used squeeze triggers mounted to the hand grips, doing away with the butterfly triggers.
When the bolt release is locked down by the bolt latch release lock on the buffer tube sleeve, the gun functions in fully automatic mode. Conversely, the bolt release can be unlocked into the up position resulting in single-shot firing (the gunner must press the bolt latch release to send the bolt forward). Unlike virtually all other modern machine guns, it has no safety (although a sliding safety switch has recently been fielded to USMC armorers for installation on their weapons and is standard-issue for the U.S. Army for all M2s). Troops in the field have been known to add an improvised safety measure against accidental firing by slipping an expended shell casing under the butterfly trigger.Crew Served Weapons lesson plan The upgraded M2A1 has a manual trigger block safety.
Because the M2 was intentionally designed to operate in many configurations, it can be adapted to feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover belt feed slide assembly from left to right hand feed as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well trained individual less than two minutes to perform.
The charging assembly may be changed from left to right hand charge.  A right hand charging handle spring, lock wire and a little know how are all that are required to accomplish this.  The M2 can be battle ready and easily interchanged if it is preemptively fitted with a retracting slide assembly on both sides of the weapon system. This eliminates the need to have the weapon removed from service to accomplish this task.

===Ammunition===

There are several different types of ammunition used in the M2HB and AN aircraft guns.  From World War II through the Vietnam War, the big Browning was used with standard ball, armor-piercing (AP), armor-piercing incendiary (API), and armor-piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) rounds.  All .50 ammunition designated "armor-piercing" was required to completely perforate [tpl]Convert|0.875|in|mm[/tpl] of hardened steel armor plate at a distance of [tpl]Convert|100|yd|m[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|0.75|in|mm[/tpl] at [tpl]Convert|547|yd|m[/tpl].Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, U.S. Army .50 BMG Cartridge Specifications, DBI Books (1989), ISBN 0-87349-033-9, p.432  The API and APIT rounds left a flash, report, and smoke on contact, useful in detecting strikes on enemy targets; they were primarily intended to incapacitate thin-skinned and lightly armored vehicles and aircraft, while igniting their fuel tanks.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 311–312.
Current ammunition types include M33 Ball (706.7 grain) for personnel and light material targets, M17 tracer, M8 API (622.5 grain), M20 API-T (619 grain), and M962 SLAP-T.  The latter ammunition along with the M903 SLAP (Saboted Light Armor Penetrator) round can perforate [tpl]Convert|1.34|in|mm[/tpl] of HHA (face-hardened steel plate) at [tpl]Convert|500|m|yd[/tpl], [tpl]Convert|0.91|in|mm[/tpl] at [tpl]Convert|1200|m|yd[/tpl], and [tpl]Convert|0.75|in|mm[/tpl] at [tpl]Convert|1500|m|yd[/tpl].  This is achieved by using a [tpl]convert|0.30|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter[/tpl] tungsten penetrator. The SLAP-T adds a tracer charge to the base of the ammunition. This ammunition was type classified in 1993.M903 Caliber .50 Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP), M962 Saboted Light Armor, GlobalSecurity.orgCaliber .50 Cartridges, GlobalSecurity.org
When firing blanks, a large blank-firing adapter (BFA) must be used to keep the gas pressure high enough to allow the action to cycle. The adapter is very distinctive, attaching to the muzzle with three rods extending back to the base. The BFA can often be seen on M2s during peacetime operations.

==Deployment==

The M2 .50 Browning machine gun has been used for various roles:

===United States===

At the outbreak of the Second World War the United States had versions of the M2 in service as fixed aircraft guns, anti-aircraft defensive guns (on aircraft, ships, or boats), infantry (tripod-mounted) guns, and as dual purpose anti-aircraft and anti-vehicular weapons on vehicles.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 225George, John B., Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 404: By World War II, the M2HB had been designated as a dual-purpose anti-aircraft and anti-vehicular weapon for motorized, armored, and infantry divisions; the designation "anti-vehicular" included thin-skinned and lightly armored vehicles, as it was already recognized by 1940 that the .50 M2 AP round would not be useful against modern medium or heavy tanks.
The .50 AN/M2 light-barrel aircraft Browning used in planes had a rate of fire of approximately 800 rounds per minute, and was used singly or in groups of up to eight guns for aircraft ranging from the P-47 Thunderbolt to the B-25 Mitchell bomber, which in the last J-version of the Mitchell could have upwards of fourteen M2s firing forward for ground attack missions - eight in a solid metal-structure nose, four more mounted in a pair of conformal twin-gunned gun pods on the lower cockpit sides, and two more if the forward dorsal turret's pair of M2 guns were also aimed straight forward.
In the dual-purpose vehicle mount, the M2HB (heavy barrel) proved extremely effective in U.S. service: the Browning's .50 caliber AP and API rounds could easily penetrate the engine block or fuel tanks of a German Bf 109 fighter attacking at low altitude,Bird, James, Recollections of James R. Bird, A Battery, 160th F.A., 45th Inf. Div.,  Article or perforate the hull plates and fuel tanks of a German half-track or light armored car.Green, Michael, and Green, Gladys, Weapons of Patton's Armies, Zenith Imprint Press (2000), ISBN 0-7603-0821-7, ISBN 978-0-7603-0821-9, p. 34Bishop, Chris, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. (2002), ISBN 1-58663-762-2, ISBN 978-1-58663-762-0, p. 86  While the dual-purpose mounting was undeniably useful, it did normally require the operator to stand when using the M2 in a ground role, exposing him to return fire.Green, Michael, and Green, Gladys, Weapons of Patton's Armies, Zenith Imprint Press (2000), ISBN 0-7603-0821-7, ISBN 978-0-7603-0821-9, pp. 32–34  Units in the field often modified the mountings on their vehicles, especially tanks and tank destroyers, to provide more operator protection in the anti-vehicular and anti-personnel role.Yeide, 2004. p. 185 The weapon was particularly hated by the Germans, whose attacks and ambushes against otherwise helpless stalled motor convoys were frequently broken up by .50 caliber machine gun fire.Burgett, Donald, Seven Roads To Hell, Dell Publishing (1999), ISBN 0-440-23627-4, p. 129Jarymowycz, Roman J., Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine, Lynne Rienner Publishers (2001), ISBN 1-55587-950-0, ISBN 978-1-55587-950-1, p. 212  Vehicles would frequently "recon by fire" with the M2 Browning i.e. firing continuously at suspected points of ambush while moving through areas still containing enemy forces.  One vehicle would fire exclusively to the right, the following vehicle to the left, the next one to the right, and so on in order to cover both flanks of the advancing convoy.
Besides vehicle-mounted weapons, the heavy weapons companies in a World War II U.S. Army infantry battalion or regiment were each issued one M2 Browning with tripod (ground) mount.Rush, Robert S., GI: The US Infantryman in World War II, Osprey Publishing Ltd. (2003), ISBN 1-84176-739-5, p. 33  Mounted on a heavily sandbagged tripod, the M2HB proved very useful in either a defensive role or to interdict or block road intersections from use by German infantry and motorized forces.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 225, 311-312  Hearing the sound of an M2 could often cause enemy infantry to take cover.Henry, Mark R., The US Army in World War II (2): The Mediterranean, Osprey Publishing (2000), ISBN 1-84176-085-4, ISBN 978-1-84176-085-8, p. 20  There are numerous instances of the M2 Browning being used against enemy personnel, particularly infantry assaultsAbramski, Anthony V. (Pfc.),  Eyewitness Account of Pfc. Anthony V. Abramski, Citation In Support Of Congressional Medal of Honor Award to 2nd Lt. Audie Murphy at Holtzwihr, France, 26 January 1945 or for interdiction or elimination of enemy artillery observers or snipers at distances too great for ordinary infantry weapons.Wolfe, Clarence B., I Kept My Word, AuthorHouse Press (2006), ISBN 1-4259-6951-8, ISBN 978-1-4259-6951-6, p. 68The United States Army in World War II, Ch. XXI: Artillery & Armored Units in the ETO, Washington, D.C.: Historical Division, U.S. Army (1993), p. 645Jarymowycz, Roman J., Tank Tactics: From Normandy to Lorraine, Lynne Rienner Publishers (2001), ISBN 1-55587-950-0, ISBN 978-1-55587-950-1, p. 212: The M2HB fitted to tanks and M3 half-tracks was frequently employed against German rearguard forces including snipers and anti-tank teams, often firing into locations merely suspected of hiding such forces (so-called speculative fire).
The M2HB was not widely used in the Pacific campaign for several reasons, including the weight of the gun, the nature of infantry jungle combat, and because road intersections were usually easily outflanked.George, John B., Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 404  However, it was used by fast-moving motorized forces in the Philippines to destroy Japanese blocking units on the advance to Manila.  The quad mount .50 was also used to destroy Japanese emplacements.
The M2HB was used in Korea and Vietnam, and later in both Operation Desert Storm, the Afghan theater of Operation Enduring Freedom and in Iraq. In 2003, U.S. Army SFC Paul Ray Smith used his M2HB mounted on an M113 armored personnel carrier to kill 20 to 50 enemies who were attacking a U.S. outpost, preventing an aid station from being overrun and allowing wounded soldiers to be evacuated,Schmitt, Eric, Medal of Honor to Be Awarded to Soldier Killed in Iraq, a First, New York Times, 30 March 2005 SFC Smith was killed during the firefight and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

====M45 Quadmount====

The M45 Quadmount was a quadruple mounting of four .50 M2HB guns with a single gunner situated behind an armored housing. This was used by U.S. AA battalions, fitted either on a towed trailer or mounted in a half-track carrier (M16 AA half-track). With 200 rounds per gun in a powered tracking mount, the guns proved very effective against low-flying aircraft. The use of four guns adequately compensated for the fact that the individual M2HB's rate of fire (450-550 rounds per minute) was low for an effective anti–aircraft weapon.Rottman, Gordon L., Browning .50-Caliber Machine Guns, Osprey Publishing (2010), ISBN 978-1-84908-331-7, p. 19–20
Towards the end of the war, as Luftwaffe attacks became less frequent, the quad .50 (nicknamed the Meat Chopper or Krautmower) was increasingly used in an anti-personnel role, similarly to the earlier-introduced (1940) and more powerful German 20mm Flakvierling.  Snipers firing from trees were engaged by the quad gunner at trunk level - the weapon would cut down and destroy the entire tree, and the sniper with it.AAA Weapons of the U.S. Army, Part I: The "Quad 50" Machine Gun Mount, 225th AAA Searchlight Battalion (Skylighters) Article
The M45 Quadmount was still in use during the Vietnam War.

===Commonwealth and other forces===

Commonwealth use of the M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun (known as the .5 Browning in British and Commonwealth service) was limited in the Second World War, though from 1942 it was standard armament on US-built AFVs provided under lend-lease such as the M4 Sherman, M7 Priest, M8 Greyhound, or M10 Wolverine variously used by British, Canadian, Australian, South African and New Zealand units. Nevertheless, the heavy Browning's effectiveness was praised by many British and Commonwealth soldiers in infantry, armored, and ordnance branches.Shore, C. (Capt.), With British Snipers to the Reich, Boulder: Lancer Militaria, p. 197–198Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 35, 145  Many commanders thought the .50 Browning the best weapon in its class, certainly the best of the American weapons, including the M1 Garand and carbine.Shore, C. (Capt.), With British Snipers to the Reich, Boulder: Lancer Militaria, p. 197–198: They especially liked the "hell's brew" of AP, API, and APIT ammunition.  In North Africa, after Commonwealth units began to obtain sufficient parts, manuals, gauges, and ammunition for the new weapon, the .50 Browning was increasingly used, eventually replacing the 15 mm Besa, but in Italy was often deleted from top turret mountings because the mount exposed the operator to low branches and enemy fire.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 153: The New Zealand and South African divisions in particular loved the big Browning, and were frequently encountered trading for spare parts and gauges.  All LRDGs, and some SAS units used the aircraft (AN/M2) version of the gun, while beam/waist-mounted and turret-mounted Brownings were used later in the war in such aircraft as the Short Sunderland and Lancaster bomber.
After the Second World War, the .50 Browning continued to see action in Korea and other theaters, in aircraft, tripod (ground), ground AA (hip-ring), and vehicle mounts.  One of its most notable actions in a ground role was in a fierce battle with a nine-man SAS team at the Battle of Mirbat in Oman in July 1972, where the heavy Browning and its API ammunition was used to help repulse an assault by 250 Yemeni Adoo guerrillas, though the more famous weapon from the battle is a 25 pounder gun.Kennedy, Michael Paul, Soldier I: SAS, London: Bloomsbury Publishing PLC (1990), ISBN 0-7475-0750-3
A .50 caliber Browning was installed along with a .30 caliber Browning machine gun in each compact one-man turret on M113 APCs used by the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in South Vietnam.
Nigerian troops have extensively deployed the 50 caliber Browning, mounted on Otokar Cobra APCs, Panhard VBL M11s and Landcruiser gun-trucks in counterinsurgency operations in the Niger Delta, N.E Nigeria, the Jos Plateau and in Mali

===M2 as a sniper rifle===

The M2 machine gun has also been used as a long-range sniper rifle, when equipped with a telescopic sight.  Soldiers during the Korean War used scoped M2s in the role of a sniper rifle, but the practice was most notably used by US Marine Corps sniper Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam War.  Using an Unertl telescopic sight and a mounting bracket of his own design, Hathcock could quickly convert the M2 into a sniper rifle, using the traversing-and-elevating (T&E) mechanism attached to the tripod and a bolt on pistol grip kit that converts the M2 to fire semi-automatically by activating the trigger on the side plate to assist in aiming at stationary targets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] When firing semi-automatically, Hathcock hit man-size targets beyond [tpl]convert|2000|yd|m|disp=flip[/tpl]—twice the range of a standard-caliber sniper rifle of the time (a .30-06 Winchester Model 70).  In fact, Hathcock set the record for the longest confirmed kill at [tpl]convert|2460|yd|m|disp=flip[/tpl], a record which stood until 2002, when it was broken in Afghanistan by Canadian Forces sniper Arron Perry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/sniper.htm |title=Sniper Rifles |publisher=GlobalSecurity |accessdate=2008-03-24 |quote=When a 24-year old Marine sharpshooter named Carlos Norman Hathcock II chalked up the farthest recorded kill in the history of sniping—2,500 yards (1.42 miles, a distance greater than 22 football fields) in February 1967, he fired a Browning M2 .50 Cal.

==Variants and derivatives==

===M2 variants===

The basic M2 was deployed in U.S. service in a number of subvariants, all with separate complete designations as per the US Army system. The basic designation as mentioned in the introduction is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, with others as described below.
The development of the M1921 water-cooled machine gun which led to the M2, meant that the initial M2s were, in fact, water-cooled. These weapons were designated Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, Water-Cooled, Flexible. There was no fixed water-cooled version.
Improved air-cooled heavy barrel versions came in three subtypes.  The basic infantry model, Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible, a fixed developed for use on the M6 Heavy Tank designated Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Fixed, and a "turret type" whereby "Flexible" M2s were modified slightly for use in tank turrets. The subvariant designation Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, TT was only used for manufacturing, supply, and administration identification and separation from flexible M2s.
A number of additional subvariants were developed after the end of the Second World War. The Caliber .50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, M48 Turret Type was developed for the commander's cupola on the M48 Patton tank. The cupola mount on the M48A2 and M48A3 was thoroughly disliked by most tankers, as it proved unreliable in service.Zumbro, Ralph, Tank Sergeant, Presidio Press (1986), p. 92  An externally mounted M2 was later adopted for the commander's position on the M1 Abrams tanks.  Three subvariants were also developed for use by the U.S. Navy on a variety of ships and watercraft. These included the Caliber .50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, Soft Mount (Navy) and the Caliber .50 Machine Gun, Browning, M2, Heavy Barrel, Fixed Type (Navy).  The fixed types fire from a solenoid trigger and come in left or right hand feed variants for use on the Mk 56 Mod 0 dual mount and other mounts.

===M2A1===

When the M2 was first being designed, John Browning faced two design challenges.  With the machine tools available at that time, the dimensions that established the location of the bolt face and the depth of the chamber could not be held tightly enough to control the fit of the cartridge in the chamber.  The round can be too tight in the chamber and the gun wouldn't shoot, or be too loose in the chamber resulting in a stoppage or ruptured cartridge.  The other dimension that couldn’t be held close enough was when the firing pin would fall.  The solution to these problems was adjustable timing and headspace; the operator had to screw the barrel into the barrel extension, moving the barrel toward the bolt face to reach the proper headspace with simple gages to allow the operator to adjust to the proper dimensions.  By the late 20th century, the M2 was the only adjustable headspace weapon in the U.S. inventory.  With rising reports of injuries from improperly headspaced weapons, the U.S. Military held a competition for a quick change barrel conversion kit with fixed timing and headspace in 1997.  Three companies offered kits and Saco Defense won the competition.  However, funding was lost before the design could be fully evaluated and the program ended.  In 2007, the military found money to start a new competition.  Saco Defense had since been acquired by General Dynamics, who won the competition.New .50 Cal Machine Guns, No Tanks - SAdefensejournal.com, 19 August 2011
On October 15, 2010, the M2A1 heavy machine gun was type classified by the U.S. Army.  The M2A1, formerly known as the M2E2, incorporates improvements to the design including a quick change barrel (QCB) with removable carrying handle, a new flash suppressor that reduces muzzle flash by 95 percent, fixed headspace and timing, a modified bolt, and a manual trigger block safety.  "Headspace" is the distance between the face of the bolt and the base of the cartridge case, fully seated in the chamber. "Timing" is the adjustment of the gun so that firing takes place when the recoiling parts are in the correct position for firing.  When a standard M2 had a barrel change, the headspace and timing had to be manually set.  Improper adjustment could damage the weapon and cause serious injury to the user.  Fixed headspace and timing reduces risk, and the carrying handle allows the barrel to be switched in seconds.MA DEUCE version M2A1-Proven Performer gets an Upgrade - PEOSoldier.mil, January 3, 2011Ma Deuce Still Going Strong - Defenseindustrydaily.com In June 2011, the Army began conversion of M2HB machine guns to M2A1s.Army to convert Browning M2 to M2A1 - Thefirearmblog.com, August 6, 2011  In February 2012, the Army announced that it will upgrade all 45,000 M2s to M2A1 standard.M2A1 conversion - Strategypage.com, Feb 2, 2012 The M2A1 was named one of the greatest Army inventions of 2011.M2A1 Among Greatest Army Inventions of 2011 - Thefirearmblog.com, September 21, 2012 As of November 30, 2012, 8,300 built or converted M2A1s have been fielded by the U.S. Army.M2A1 Machine Gun Features Greater Safety, Heightened Lethality - Army.mil, November 30, 2012

===AN/M2===

The M2 machine gun was widely used during World War II and in later postwar conflicts as a remote or flexible aircraft gun. For fixed (offensive) or flexible (defensive) guns used in aircraft, a dedicated M2 version was developed called the .50 Browning AN/M2. The "AN" stands for "Army/Navy", since the gun was developed jointly for use by both services (unusual for the time, when the delineations between the Army and Navy were much stricter, and relations between armed services were often cool, if not outright hostile.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]) The AN/M2 had a cyclic rate of 750–850 rounds per minute, with the ability to be fired from an electrically operated remote-mount solenoid trigger when installed as a fixed gun. Cooled by the aircraft's slip-stream, the air-cooled AN/M2 was fitted with a substantially lighter [tpl]convert|36|in|cm|adj=on[/tpl] length barrel, lightening the complete unit to [tpl]convert|61|lb|kg[/tpl],[tpl]cite web |url=http://browningmgs.com/AirGunnery/01_50cal.htm |title=Aircraft Gunnery .50 Cal. |author= |date= |work= |publisher=browningmgs.com |accessdate=March 9, 2013[/tpl] which also had the effect of increasing the rate of fire. The official designation for this weapon was Browning Machine Gun, Aircraft, Cal. .50, AN/M2 (Fixed) or (Flexible). The B-17G Flying Fortress heavy bomber was armed with up to 13 AN/M2 guns in both turreted and flexible positions, with only the later versions of the B-25J Mitchell medium bomber, field-fitted with solid metal noses carrying more AN/M2 guns.  These could carry up to 14 to 18 M2s in total, mostly aimed forward for attack duties.

===M296===

The XM296/M296 is a further development of the AN/M2 machine gun for the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter. The M296 differs from previous remote firing variants in that it has adjustable firing rate (500–850 rpm), while lacking a bolt latch (allowing single-shot operation).M296 .50 cal. (12.7 mm) Machine Gun Article  As an air-cooled gun used aboard a relatively slow rotary-wing aircraft, the M296 has a burst restriction rate of 50 rounds per minute sustained fire or 150 rounds per minute maximum while conducting peacetime training requirements; the combat firing rate is unrestricted but does a ten-minute cooling period after prolonged firing is mandated to avoid stoppages due to overheating.M296 .50 cal.

===XM213/M213, XM218, GAU-15/A, GAU-16/A, and GAU-18/A===

The XM213/M213 was a modernization and adaptation of existing .50 caliber AN/M2s in inventory for use as a pintle mounted door gun on helicopters using the M59 armament subsystem.
The GAU-15/A, formerly identified as the XM218, is a lightweight member of the M2/M3 family. The GAU-16/A was an improved GAU-15/A with modified grip and sight assemblies for similar applications. Both of these weapons were used as a part of the A/A49E-11 armament subsystem (also known as the Defensive Armament System).
The GAU-18/A, is a lightweight variant of the M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right hand feed depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A feed chute adapter is attached to the left or right hand feed pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a feed chute system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.

===AN/M3, GAU-21/A, and M3P===

During World War II, a faster-firing Browning was developed for aircraft use. The AN/M3 features a mechanical or electrically boosted feed mechanism to increase the rate of fire to around 1,200 rounds per minute.  The AN/M3 was used in Korea on the F-86 Sabre, F-84 Thunderjet and F-80 Shooting Star, and in Vietnam in the XM14/SUU-12/A gun pod. Today, it can be found on the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano.
The FN Herstal license-produced M3-series is used by the U.S. military in two versions; the M3M and M3P.
