[[V-Model (software development)]]

CATEGORIES: Software development process

The V-modelKevin Forsberg and Harold Mooz, “The Relationship of System Engineering to the Project Cycle,” in Proceedings of the First Annual Symposium of National Council on System Engineering, October 1991: 57–65. represents a software development process (also applicable to hardware development) which may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.

==Verification phases==

===Requirements analysis===

In the Requirements analysis phase, the first step in the verification process, the requirements of the system are collected by analyzing the needs of the user(s). This phase is concerned with establishing what the ideal system has to perform. However it does not determine how the software will be designed or built. Usually, the users are interviewed and a document called the user requirements document is generated.
The user requirements document will typically describe the system’s functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. The users carefully review this document as this document would serve as the guideline for the system designers in the system design phase. The user acceptance tests are designed in this phase. See also Functional requirements.
There are different methods for gathering requirements of both soft and hard methodologies including; interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, observation, throw-away prototypes, use cases and static and dynamic views with users.

===System design===

Systems design is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system by studying the user requirements document. They figure out possibilities and techniques by which the user requirements can be implemented. If any of the requirements are not feasible, the user is informed of the issue. A resolution is found and the user requirement document is edited accordingly.
The software specification document which serves as a blueprint for the development phase is generated. This document contains the general system organization, menu structures, data structures etc. It may also hold example business scenarios, sample windows, reports for the better understanding. Other technical documentation like entity diagrams, data dictionary will also be produced in this phase. The documents for system testing are prepared in this phase.

===Architecture design===

The phase of the design of computer architecture and software architecture can also be referred to as high-level design. The baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. The integration testing design is carried out  in the particular  phase.[ref]

===Module design===

The module design phase can also be referred to as low-level design. The designed system is broken up into smaller units or modules and each of them is explained so that the programmer can start coding directly.
The low level design document or program specifications will contain a detailed functional logic of the module, in pseudocode:
The unit test design is developed in this stage.

==Criticism==

The V-Model has been criticized by Agile advocates and others as an inadequate model of software development for numerous reasons."The Death of the V-Model", accessed January 6, 2013"The Dangerous & Seductive V Model", accessed January 6, 2013"New Models for Test Development", accessed January 6, 2013 Criticisms include:

==Current state==

Supporters of the V-Model argue that it has evolved over time and supports flexibility and agility throughout the development process."Toward Agile Systems Engineering Processes", accessed January 6, 2013 They argue that in addition to being a highly disciplined approach, it promotes meticulous design,  development, and documentation necessary to build stable software products. Lately, it is being adopted by the medical device industry."Barriers to Adopting Agile Practices When Developing Medical Device Software" "A Software Process Development, Assessment and Improvement Framework, for the Medical Device Industry "
