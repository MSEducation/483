[[Simply Smiffy]]

CATEGORIES: Beano strips, The Bash Street Kids

Simply Smiffy was a comic strip in the UK comic The Beano, first appearing in issue 2254, dated 28 September 1985, and continuing for a year or so after that. It was drawn by Jerry Swaffield.
A spin-off from The Bash Street Kids, it featured Smiffy (a character from that strip) plus his brother, Normal Norman. With Norman being the straight man of the two, the humour lay in the fact that Smiffy never managed to get anything right.
An earlier Smiffy spin-off appeared in The Beano in 1971 which featured Smiffy trying out inventions sent in by Beano readers. 
Simply Smiffy returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by Paul Palmer.
Another unrelated strip entitled Smiffy appeared in The Beezer in the 1960s which featured a boy who liked getting dirty. This strip was drawn by Bill Ritchie.
