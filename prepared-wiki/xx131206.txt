CATEGORIES: Ships of the line of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth-built ships, 1650s ships

HMS ''Bristol'' was a 44-gun fourth-rate frigate of the English Royal Navy, originally built for the navy of the Commonwealth of England at Portsmouth, and launched in 1653. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear this name. By 1677 her armament had been increased to 48 guns. Life aboard her when cruising in the Mediterranean in 1677-8 is described in the diary of Henry Teonge.
In 1693, Bristol was rebuilt at Deptford as a 50-gun fourth-rate ship of the line.
In April 1709 she was captured by the French, but was recaptured two weeks later, at which time she was sunk.
