</ref> Ongoing excavations at Tarkio Valley in southwestern [[Iowa]] may reveal something of the familial life of ''Megalonyx''. An adult was found in direct association with two juveniles of different ages, suggesting that adults cared for young of different generations.<ref>Semken and Brenzel, http://slothcentral.com/?page_id=2</ref><ref>[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Semken | first1 =  | last2 = Brenzel | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = One Sloth Becomes Three | url = | journal=Newsletter of the Iowa Archeological Society | volume = 57 | page = 1 [/tpl]</ref>
The earliest known North American megalonychid, Pliometanastes protistus, lived in the southern U.S. about 9 million years ago and is believed to have been the predecessor of Megalonyx.  Several species of Megalonyx have been named; in fact it has been stated that "nearly every good specimen has been described as a different species".Harrington (1993)  A broader perspective on the group, accounting for age, sex, individual and geographic differences, indicates that only three species are valid (M. leptostomus, M. wheatleyi, and M. jeffersonii) in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene of North America,Kurt√©n & Anderson, 1980, p. 136.  although work by McDonald lists five species.
Jefferson's ground sloth has a special place in modern paleontology, for Thomas Jefferson's letter on Megalonyx, read before the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia in August 1796, marked the beginning of vertebrate paleontology in North America. When Lewis and Clark set out, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to keep an eye out for ground sloths. He was hoping they would find some living in the Western range. Megalonyx jeffersonii was appropriately named after Thomas Jefferson.

===Megatheriidae===

The megatheriid ground sloths are relatives of the megalonychids; these two families, along with the family Nothrotheriidae, form the infraorder Megatheria. Megatheriids appeared later in the Oligocene, some 30 million years ago, also in South America.  The group includes the heavily built Megatherium (given its name 'great beast' by Georges CuvierG. Cuvier (1796)) and Eremotherium. The skeletal structure of these ground sloths indicates that the animals were massive.  Their thick bones and even thicker joints (especially those on the hind legs) gave their appendages tremendous power that, combined with their size and fearsome claws, provided a formidable defense against predators.
The earliest megatheriid in North America was Eremotherium eomigrans which arrived 2.2 million years ago, after crossing the recently formed  Panamanian land bridge. With more than five tons in weight, 6 meters in length, and able to reach as high as [tpl]convert|17|ft|m[/tpl], it was larger than an African bush elephant bull. Unlike relatives, this species retained a plesiomorphic extra claw. While other species of Eremotherium had four fingers with only two or three claws, E. eomigrans had five fingers, four of them with claws up to nearly a foot long.De Iuliis and Cartelle (1999)

===Nothrotheriidae===

Recently recognized, ground sloths of Nothrotheriidae are often associated with those of the Megatheriidae, and together the two form the superfamily Megatheroidea. The most prominent members of the group are the South American genus Thalassocnus, known for being aquatic, and Nothrotheriops from North America.
The last ground sloths in North America belonging to Nothrotheriops died so recently that their petrified dung (coprolites) has remained undisturbed in some caves. One of the skeletons, found in a lava tube (cave) at Aden Crater, adjacent to Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico, still had skin and hair preserved, and is now at the Yale Peabody Museum. The American Museum of Natural History in New York City has a sample of dung with a note attached to it that reads "deposited by Theodore Roosevelt".  The largest samples of Nothrotheriops dung can be found in the collections of the Smithsonian Museum.

===Mylodontidae===

The mylodontid ground sloths together with their relatives the scelidotheriids and the orophodontids form the Mylodonta, the second radiation of ground sloths. The discovery of their fossils in caverns associated with human occupation lead some early researchers to theorize that the early humans built corrals when they could procure a young ground sloth, to raise the animal to butchering size.A.S. Woodward (1900) However, radiocarbon dates do not support simultaneous occupation of the site by humans and sloths.[ref]
