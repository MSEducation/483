[[Religious perspectives on Jesus]]

CATEGORIES: Perspectives on Jesus, Religious views

The religious perspectives on Jesus vary among major world religions.The Blackwell Companion to Jesus edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 ISBN 1-4051-9362-X page 1 http://books.google.com/books?id=5tjiiXkI_CUC&pg=PA526&dq=jesus+cinematic+portrayal+western&hl=en&ei=NwV5TuCvK8KC4gTpspy2Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=influential%20human%20history&f=false Jesus' teachings and the retelling of his life story have significantly influenced the course of human history, and have directly or indirectly affected the lives of billions of people, even non-Christians.The Cambridge companion to Jesus edited by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 ISBN 0-521-79678-4 pages 156-157The historical Christ and the Jesus of faith by C. Stephen Evans 1996, Oxford Univ Press ISBN 0-19-826397-X page v
Christianity teaches that Jesus is the Messiah (Christ) and the Son of God Incarnate. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.
In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved prophets. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (shirk).
The Bahá'í Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream Jewish scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
Other world religions such as Buddhism have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see historical Jesus.

==Christianity==

Christian views of Jesus are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the Canonical gospels, New Testament letters, the Christian creeds, as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.[tpl]cite book|last=Schreiner|first=Thomas R.|title=New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ|year=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2680-5|pages=23–37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=elw8xkVeTTUC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts.[tpl]cite book|last=Jackson|first= Gregory L. |title= Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison|year= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-615-16635-3| pages= 11–17 |publisher=Christian News[/tpl] Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah or Christ. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 ISBN 3-11-018151-7 pages 240-241 
Christians consider Jesus to be the Messiah (Christ) and believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life.Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649 These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199-200The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79 The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam's disobedience.Systematic Theology, Volume 2 by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303 
The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his Baptism, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension.Essays in New Testament interpretation by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 ISBN 0-521-23783-1 page 63The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key by Vigen Guroian 2010 ISBN 0-8028-6496-1 page 28 These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his Nativity at the beginning and the sending of the Paraclete at the end.Scripture in tradition by John Breck 2001 ISBN 0-88141-226-0 page 12 The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his "works and words", e.g. his ministry, parables and miracles.The Bible Knowledge Commentary by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 ISBN 0-88207-812-7 page 100The words and works of Jesus Christ by J. Dwight Pentecost 2000 ISBN 978-0-310-30940-6 page 212  The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the gospel of John includes no parables).
Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the Holy Name of Jesus do back to the earliest days of Christianity.Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 ISBN 1-146-98633-5 page 443Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 ISBN 0-8264-8011-X page 426 These devotions and feasts exist both in Eastern and Western Christianity.

===Incarnation===

Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate, God the Son, and "true God and true man" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the Bible, God raised him from the dead.[tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:24|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Romans|10:9|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Cor|15:15|NIV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:31-32[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Cor|6:14[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|2Cor|4:14[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Gal|1:1[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Eph|1:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Col|2:12[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Thess|1:10[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Heb|13:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Pet|1:3[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21[/tpl] He ascended to heaven, to the "right hand of God,"[tpl]bibleref2|Mark|16:19[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Luke|22:69[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|2:33[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55-56[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Romans|8:34[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Eph|1:20[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Col|3:1[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|1Peter|3:22[/tpl] and he will return again for the Last Judgment and the establishment of the Kingdom of God.cf.

==Islam==

In Islam, Jesus (Isa) is considered to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|year=2003|first=John L. |last=Esposito |page= 158|publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E324pQEEQQcC&pg=PA159#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-19-975726-8[/tpl]

Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the Injil and corresponding to the Christian New Testament. However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N. A. |title=Quests for the historical Jesus |first=James C. |last=Paget |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|page=183[/tpl]
Despite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (Maryam in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever.Esposito, John. What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam. New York: University Press, 2002. P31. The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform miracles—though only by the will of God—including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers.[tpl]cite book|last=Morgan|first=Diane|title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36025-1|pages=45–46|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of adultery.[tpl]Cite quran|19|27|e=33|s=ns[/tpl] It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the Old Testament. 
Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of Ahmadi Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually Judas Iscariot who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the Antichrist, once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7[/tpl]

===Comparative===

Islam rejects the Trinitarian Christian view that Jesus was God incarnate or the son of God, that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever atoned for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.[tpl]Cite quran|5|116[/tpl]

==Judaism==

Judaism rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.Simmons, Shraga, "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus", Ohr Samayach — Ask the Rabbi, Retrieved April 15, 2007; "Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?", AskMoses.com, Retrieved April 15, 2007
According to Conservative Judaism, Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html|title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews|accessdate=January 15, 2008|last=Waxman|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism|quote=Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task. To continue to assert that Jesus was the Mashiach goes against the belief that the Mashiach will transform the world when he does come, not merely hint at a future transformation at some undefined time to come... Judaism rejects the claim that a new covenant was created with Jesus and asserts instead that the chain of Tradition reaching back to Moshe continues to make valid claims on our lives, and serve as more than mere window dressing. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080109024012/http://uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html  |archivedate = January 9, 2008[/tpl] Reform Judaism, the modern progressive movement, states "For us in the Jewish community anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew and is an apostate".Contemporary American Reform Responsa, #68, "Question 18.3.4: Reform's Position On...What is unacceptable practice?", faqs.org.

===Jesus in Jewish writings===

The Babylonian Talmud include stories of Yeshu [tpl]lang|he|יֵשׁוּ[/tpl]; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the historical Jesus.Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition) Contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.Daniel Boyarin, Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999Jeffrey Rubenstein Rabbinic Stories (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002
The Mishneh Torah, an authoritative work of Jewish law, states in Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".
[tpl]quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be Messiah and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by Daniel. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled."[tpl]Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14[/tpl] Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the prophets spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world — there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of (Muhammad) the Ishmaelite who stood after him — there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."[tpl]Bibleref2c|Zeph.|3:9[/tpl] Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the Torah, and the things of the commandments!

==Bahá'í Faith==

The Bahá'í Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.[tpl]cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation[/tpl] In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single progressive religion from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277[/tpl] The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God. In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, is the return of Jesus.

==Other==

Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and Buddhism and Christianity have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of Gautama Buddha and Jesus. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor Ashoka around 250 BCE in many of the Greek Seleucid kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began.Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times" by Jerry H.Bentley (Oxford University Press, 1993) ISBN 0-19-507639-7 Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of gnosis by various Gnostic sects, such as the extinct Manichaeism.
