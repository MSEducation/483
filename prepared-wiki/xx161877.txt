==Incident==

On Friday afternoon, around 1:50 PM, a female Palestinian suicide bomber, Ayat Akhras, approached the supermarket entrance. Smadar, who spoke Arabic, became suspicious after two Arab women who usually sold vegetables outside the shop entrance were told by Akhras to leave. Smadar prevented Akhras from going past the entrance of the market, saying to her, “You will not enter the market. You and I will blow up here.”  Akhras then detonated the bomb.  Smadar was killed together with an American born teenager, 17-year old Rachel Levy.  28 people were injured in the attack.
Jerusalem police estimated that by preventing the suicide bomber entry deeper into the market, Smadar saved scores of lives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/CasualtiesOfWar/2002_03_29_2market.html |title=Female suicide bomber kills 2 at capital supermarket |publisher=Info.jpost.com |date=2002-03-31 |accessdate=2012-05-29[/tpl] "It is so characteristic of him that he was the one to block the terrorist from entering the supermarket," said one of the parents of a child from the school at which he worked.  His widow remembered him saying: "Shoshana, if a suicide bomber ever comes close to my school, he will not get past me. With my own body I would stop him."
In a prerecorded video, Ayat Akhras said she was sacrificing herself for the al-Aqsa mosque. Her father declared that he was proud of her.Schoolgirl suicide bomber kills two in supermarket After her death, it was rumored that she had been pregnant out of wedlock and preferred to die for a political cause rather than be murdered by relatives in an honor killing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5XBVsosvzYC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=ayat+al+akhras+pregnant&source=bl&ots=ccIwQZr6I5&sig=zoeuYZAS3DSLTFjFKkVJ4vY2FPQ&hl=en&ei=1M5jTaysI9mX4gbN4fjUCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=ayat%20al%20akhras%20pregnant&f=false |title=Suicide terrorism, Ami Pedahzur |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2002-03-29 |accessdate=2012-05-29[/tpl]
