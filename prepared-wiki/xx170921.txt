==Access==

The park is bisected by the A4140 Fryent Way that links Kingsbury with Wembley. A car park is available halfway down this road. The nearest underground is at Kingsbury Station on the Jubilee Line. The 206 bus terminates a short distance from the park. The Capital Ring footpath crosses the site.
However, the road Fryent Way, linking Kingsbury Circle and Salmon Street lacks a much needed bus service to transport residents and students alike around the area. The Barn Hill Open Area, or at least the summit of it, is nearer Wembley Park Station.
