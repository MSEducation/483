Declaring a hiatus from acting at age 14 to "just be a kid," Themmen went on to receive a B.F.A. in theatre from New York University. Smitten with the urge to travel, he founded Access International, a travel service that arranged Europe-bound charter flights for backpackers, during which he traveled to 36 countries on six continents. Following brief stints in real estate, film production, business representation at Walt Disney Imagineering and a few other ventures, he now directs commercial casting sessions in Los Angeles, signs autographs at movie conventions, and makes sporadic appearances in commercials, plays and TV shows.The Official Paris Themmen Website
