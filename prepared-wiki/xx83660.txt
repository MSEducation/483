Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for £12.24 million (€15 million) in 2003. In 2004, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup.
Ronaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007. In 2008 and 2013, Ronaldo won the FIFA/Ballon d'Or award for the best footballer on the planet, being the first ever Portuguese to win the award twice.[tpl]cite web |title=Cristiano Ronaldo |url=http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2008/20081202_030150_cristiano-ronaldo-ballon-d-or-2008.html |publisher=France Football |language=French |date=2 December 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Cristiano Ronaldo: Now I want a third |url=http://www.fifa.com/ballondor/news/newsid=2260752/index.html?intcmp=newsreader_news_caption |publisher=FIFA |date=13 January 2014 [/tpl] He was awarded the European Golden Shoe in both 2008 and 2011.

==Early life==

Ronaldo was born in Santo António, a neighbourhood of Funchal, Madeira, the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener.[tpl]cite video |date=22 April 2008 |title=Fiebre Maldini: Los inicios de Cristiano Ronaldo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3bxhH16EJ4 |format=flv |medium=Television production |language=Spanish |publisher=Sogecable |location=Madrid [/tpl] His second given name "Ronaldo" was chosen after then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who was his father's favourite actor.

==Club career==

===Early career===

At the age of eight, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha, where his father was the kit man. In 1995, Ronaldo signed with local club Nacional, and, after a title-winning campaign, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who subsequently signed him for an undisclosed sum.[tpl]cite news |url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/p/players_ronaldo.htm |title=Profile of Ronaldo at about.com |publisher=about.com [/tpl]

===Sporting CP===

Ronaldo joined Sporting's other youth players who trained at the Academia Sporting, the club's football academy, in Alcochete. He became the only player ever to play for Sporting's under-16, under-17, under-18, B-team, and the first team, all within one season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1005/1005391_clash_of_the_titans.html |title=Clash of the titans |publisher=manchestereveningnews.com [/tpl] He scored two goals in his league debut on 7 October 2002, which Sporting CP won 3–0 against Moreirense, while featuring for Portugal in the 2002 European Under-17 Championship.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.uefau17.com/history/index.htm |title=Famous players featured in U17 c'ships |publisher=uefau17.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090602071706/http://www.uefau17.com/history/index.htm |archivedate=2 June 2009[/tpl]
At the age of 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that might have forced him to give up playing football. The Sporting staff were made aware of the condition and Ronaldo's mother gave her authorisation for him to go into hospital.[tpl]cite web|title=Critsiano Ronaldo|url=http://prezi.com/elkm3nmsyann/cristiano-ronaldo/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=26 November 2013[/tpl] While there, he had an operation in which a laser was used to cauterise the area of his heart that was causing the problem.

"After I joined, the manager asked me what number I'd like. I said 28. But Ferguson said 'No, you're going to have No. 7,' and the famous shirt was an extra source of motivation.

====2006–2009====

The 2006–2007 season proved to be the breakout year for Ronaldo, as he broke the 20 goal barrier for the first time and picked up his first league title with Manchester United. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first team coach René Meulensteen. Meulensteen coached him in moves to make himself more unpredictable. He also helped him to work better with his team-mates, calling for the ball and scoring more 'ugly' goals instead of waiting for the special occasion when he could score the 'beautiful' goals for which he was already famous.Henry Winter, The Daily Telegraph, Sport, 29 Aug 2013, The secrets behind the development of Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, revealed by Rene Meulensteen

In the 2007–08 Champions League final on 21 May against league rivals Chelsea, Ronaldo scored the opening goal after 26 minutes, which was negated by a Chelsea equaliser in the 45th minute as the match ended 1–1 after extra time. His misfire in the penalty shoot-out put Chelsea in position to win the trophy, but John Terry shot wide right after slipping on the pitch surface, and Manchester United emerged victorious 6–5 on penalties.

During a quarter-final match against England on 1 July 2006, Ronaldo's United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho.

After the opening 0–1 defeat against Germany, Ronaldo was criticised for under performing, showing frustration at his and his team-mates' errors and for walking off into the changing-rooms straight after the match, rather than thanking the crowd with the team. Ronaldo's team-mate, Nani, later defended him, stating that he had left the pitch as he needed to instantly be treated for a possible injury, also adding that he was under excessive pressure, as football is a team sport.[tpl]cite news|title=What's gone wrong with Ronaldo?
