==History==

In 1845, Joseph C. Avery settled a land claim at the mouth of Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. In 1849, Avery opened a store at the site, platted the land, and surveyed a town site on his land claim, naming the community Marysville.
It is possible that the city was named after early settler Mary Lloyd, but now the name is thought to be derived from French fur trappers' naming of Marys Peak after the Virgin Mary.Corvallis Gazette Times: Archived Articles
In 1853, the legislative assembly changed the city's name to Corvallis, from the Latin phrase cor vallis, meaning "heart of the valley." Corvallis was incorporated as a city on January 29, 1857.corvallis150.org The town served briefly as the capital of the Oregon Territory in 1855 before Salem was eventually selected as the permanent seat of state government.

==Geography==

Corvallis is located at an elevation of 235 feet.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl] Situated midway in the Willamette Valley, Corvallis is about [tpl]convert|46|mi|km[/tpl] east of Newport and the Oregon Coast, [tpl]convert|85|mi|km[/tpl] south of Portland, [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] south of the state capital, Salem, [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Albany, about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] west of Interstate 5 at its closest point, and [tpl]convert|48|mi|km[/tpl] north of Eugene/Springfield. Oregon Route 99W, a secondary north-south route, also runs through Corvallis. U.S. Route 20 (which leads to Newport) and Oregon Route 34 (which leads to Waldport about [tpl]convert|56|mi|km[/tpl] to the west) both secondary East-West routes run through Corvallis from the Oregon Coast. Corvallis is at river mile 131-132 of the Willamette River.Willamette River Recreation Guide. 2007. Extension Service, Oregon State University. Available online from the state government of Oregon.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|14.30|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|14.13|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.17|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl]

==Climate==

Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Corvallis falls within the Marine West Coast climate zone (Köppen Cfb), with some Mediterranean characteristics. Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistent overcast skies. Spring and fall are also moist seasons with persistent cloudiness, and light rain falling for extended periods. Winter snow is rare, but occasionally does fall. Usually in the form of heavy wet snow, ranging between a dusting and a few inches that does not persist on the ground for more than a day. The northwest hills will often experience more snow. During the mid-winter months after extended periods of rain, thick persistent fogs can form, sometimes lasting the entire day. This can severely reduce visibility to as low as [tpl]convert|20|ft|m[/tpl]. The fog will often persist until a new storm system enters the area. This fog could be seen as a type of tule fog.
Rainfall total within the town itself is surprisingly variable. This is due to Corvallis lying right on the eastern edge of the Oregon Coast Range, with a small portion of the town inside of the range. Rainfall amounts can range from an average of [tpl]convert|66.40|in|cm[/tpl] per year Oregon USA Weather History and Climate Data in the far northwest hills, compared to [tpl]convert|43.66|in|cm[/tpl] per year at Oregon State University which is located in the center of Corvallis. Occasionally, rain can be seen falling in the northwest of the town, whereas it's just overcast, or even slightly sunny on the southeast portion of the town. This is due to the orographic lift of the prevailing cloud systems through the pacific northwest losing moisture and dissolving back into the air as it exits the coastal range.
Because of its close proximity to the coastal range, Corvallis can experience slightly cooler temperatures, particularly in the hills, than the rest of the Willamette Valley. The average annual low temperature is 4 degrees less than that of Portland just [tpl]convert|85|mi|km[/tpl] to the north. Despite this, temperatures dropping below freezing is still a rare event.

===Religion===

A 2003 study, released once every 10 years, listed Benton County (of which Corvallis makes up the majority of the population) as the least religious county per capita in the United States.  Only 1 in 4 people indicated that they were affiliated with one of the 149 religious groups the study identified. The study indicated that some of the disparity, however, may be attributed to the popularity of less common religions (ones not included as an option in the study) in the Pacific Northwest.[tpl]cite web |last = Reeves |first=Carol |date= 2003-12-21 |url= http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2003/12/21/news/top_story/local01.txt |title= Where are the faithful? |publisher = Corvallis Gazette-Times|accessdate= 2009-01-27[/tpl]

====Bus====

Long-distance bus service is provided by Greyhound. It stops at the Greyhound station in downtown Corvallis (station ID: CVI.)
Local bus service is provided by Corvallis Transit System (CTS).  In 2011 voters approved an additional fee on monthly waterbills allowing all bus service to become Fareless. The system runs a total of eight daytime routes Monday through Saturday, covering most of the city and converging at a Downtown Transit Center.  Additional commuter routes also run in the early morning and late afternoon on weekdays, and mid-morning and mid-afternoon on Saturdays.  When Oregon State University is in session CTS also runs the "Beaver Bus," a set of late-night routes running Thursday through Saturday.
Two other short-distance inter-city buses — the Linn-Benton Loop (to Albany), and the Philomath Connection, also stop at the Downtown Transit Center.
From 2010 to 2011 CTS has seen a 37.87% increase in ridership, partially as a result of going fareless and "the rising cost of fuel for individual vehicles and the desire for residents to choose more sustainable options for commuting to work, school and other activities"pg. 3 According to Tim Bates the Corvallis Transit System and Philomath Connection, had 3,621,387 passenger miles traveled and 85,647 gallons of fuel consumed in Fiscal Year 2011, a period that covers July 1, 2010 - June 30, 2011.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] This means that riders in Fiscal Year 2011 got 42.28 passenger miles per gallon.

The three sources are surface streams which are all tributaries of the Marys River.  Rock Creek has a processing capacity of [tpl]convert|7|e6USgal|m3[/tpl] of water per day (gpd), though operational characteristics of the [tpl]convert|9|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|20|in|cm|adj=on[/tpl] pipeline to the city limits capacity to half that.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=431&Itemid=364| title = Water Treatment Facilities| publisher = City of Corvallis Public Works| accessdate = 2009-01-26[/tpl]  The Rock Creek Plant output remains steady year round at about 3 million gpd.
