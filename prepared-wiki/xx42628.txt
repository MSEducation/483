==Episodes==

==Production==

Clive Exton in partnership with producer Brian Eastman adapted the pilot. Together, they wrote and produced Series 1-8, respectively. Exton and Eastman left Poirot after 2001, when they began work on Rosemary & Thyme. Michele Buck and Damien Timmer, who both went on to form Mammoth Screen, were behind the revamping of the series.[tpl]cite web|last=Kanter |first=Jake |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/damien-timmer-and-michele-buck-mammoth-screen/5046522.article |title=Damien Timmer and Michele Buck, Mammoth Screen | In-depth | Broadcast |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-04-28[/tpl] The episodes aired from 2003 featured a noticeable downplaying of the humour of the earlier series. The previous opening titles were dropped and only sombre arrangements of the original theme music are infrequently heard, which has been described as a consequence of the novels adapted being darker and more psychologically driven. However, a more upbeat string arrangement of the theme music is used for the end credits of Hallowe'en Party, The Clocks and Dead Man's Folly. The visual style of later episodes was noticeably different from earlier episodes: particularly, austere modernist or Art Deco locations and decor, widely used earlier in the series, were largely dropped in favour of more lavish settings (epitomised by the re-imagining of Poirot's home as a larger, more lavish apartment).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24914782 | work=BBC News | title=Goodbye to the splendid 1930s world of Poirot | date=15 November 2013[/tpl]
Series 9-12 lack Hugh Fraser, Phillip Jackson, and Pauline Moran, who had appeared in the previous series (excepting series 4, where Moran is absent). Series 10 (2006) introduced Zoë Wanamaker as the eccentric crime novelist Ariadne Oliver and David Yelland as Poirot's dependable valet, George - a character that had been introduced in the early Poirot novels, but was left out of the early adaptations in order to develop the character of Miss Lemon. The introduction of Wanamaker and Yelland's characters and the absence of the other characters is generally consistent with the stories on which the scripts were based. Hugh Fraser returned for two episodes of the final series: (The Big Four and Curtain), with Phillip Jackson, Pauline Moran[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/hugh-fraser-philip-jackson-and-pauline-moran-are-reunited-david-suchet-agatha|title=Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran are reunited with David Suchet for Agatha Christie’s The Big Four.|publisher=ITV Press Centre|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=29 May 2013|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= no[/tpl] and David Yellandhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947379/ returning for the adaptation of The Big Four.

===Casting===

Suchet was recommended for the part by Christie's family, who had seen him appear as Blott in the TV adaptation of Tom Sharpe's Blott on the Landscape.[tpl]cite news|last=Walton|first=James|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3560217/David-Suchet-Poirot.html|title=David Suchet: Poirot|publisher=Telegraph|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=3 March 2009|location=London|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090312015243/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3560217/David-Suchet-Poirot.html|archivedate=12 March 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] Suchet said that he prepared for the part by reading all the Poirot novels and every short story, and copying out every piece of description about the character.Interview: Dillin, John.

"Inside the mind of a media monster", Yorkshire Post. 27 April 2007. Suchet told Strand Magazine: "What I did was, I had my file on one side of me and a pile of stories on the other side and day after day, week after week, I ploughed through most of Agatha Christie's novels about Hercule Poirot and wrote down characteristics until I had a file full of documentation of the character. And then it was my business not only to know what he was like, but to gradually become him. I had to become him before we started shooting."[tpl]cite web|author=J.D.

According to many critics and enthusiasts, Suchet's characterisation is considered to be the most accurate interpretation of all the actors who have played Poirot, and the closest to the character in the books.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/faces/david_suchet.shtml|title=Drama Faces – David Suchet|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 March 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090203175751/http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/faces/david_suchet.shtml|archivedate=3 February 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In 2013, Suchet revealed that Christie's daughter Rosalind Hicks had told him she was sure Christie would have approved of his performance.Curtain: Press Packet

==Reception==

Agatha Christie's grandson Mathew has commented: "Personally, I regret very much that she (Agatha Christie) never saw David Suchet. I think that visually he is much the most convincing and perhaps he manages to convey to the viewer just enough of the irritation that we always associate with the perfectionist, to be convincing!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot|title=Agatha Christie: Characters: Poirot|publisher=Agatha Christie Limited|accessdate=3 March 2009|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090227161003/http://www.agathachristie.com/story-explorer/characters/poirot|archivedate=27 February 2009|deadurl= no[/tpl]
More recently, the series has been described by some critics as going "off piste",[tpl]cite web|author=Staff|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2008/09/square-eyes-2628-september/index.html|title=Square Eyes 26–28 September|publisher=Blogs.thestage.co.uk|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=3 March 2009[/tpl] though not negatively, from its old format. It has been praised for its new writers, more lavish productions and a greater emphasis on the darker psychology of the novels. Significantly, it was noted for Five Little Pigs (adapted by Kevin Elyot) bringing out a homosexual subtext of the novel. Nominations for twenty BAFTAs were received between 1989 and 1991 for series 1-3.[tpl]cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=poirot|title=BAFTA Awards Database|publisher=Bafta.org|accessdate=28 May 2013[/tpl]

==Being Poirot==

Being Poirot is a 50-minute television programme in which David Suchet attempts to unravel the mysterious appeal of Hercule Poirot and how he  portrayed him. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the same evening as the final episode Curtain.
Suchet visited Greenway, Agatha Christie's summer home, recollecting how he met her daughter Rosylyn and her husband Anthony Hicks for their approval before he began filming. He now meets Christie's grandson Matthew Pritchard who recounts how his grandmother found the character amongst Belgian refugees in Torquay. A visit to the permanent Poirot exhibition at Torquay Museum to which he presented the cane he used in the television series.
Suchet acknowledged the first stage and film adaptations of the books with actors such as Charles Laughton on the London stage in Alibi, an adaptation of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, in 1928. Alibi was filmed in 1931 with Austin Trevor but is now lost. The oldest surviving film portrayal from 1934 was Lord Edgware Dies again with Austin Trevor portraying Poirot. Suchet notes a conscious decision was made by the film company to portray Poirot without a moustache. Films featuring Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov were also featured and Suchet reveals he read the books and wrote down 93 notes of the character that he would use in his portrayal and for him it was discovering the voice he would use and the rapid mincing gait featured in the books.
Suchet also goes to Florin Court, a place that the production company found to represent his home Whitehaven Mansions. There he meets first producer Brian Eastman, with whom he discusses the set that was built based on the flats and Eastman's decision to fix the stories in 1936. Suchet also visits composer Christopher Gunning who had composed four themes for Eastman, the first being Gunning's favourite. Eastman chose the fourth after having Gunning darken the tone.
Suchet travels to Brussels, where he is feted by the police chief and mayor. He then goes to Ellezelles which claims to be the birthplace of Poirot and is shown a birth certificate as proof.  It says the date was April 1, "fools day" (no year mentioned). Finally, Suchet travels on the Orient Express and recounts filming the episode "Dead Man's Folly" last at Greenway to finish on a high note.
