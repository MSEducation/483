[[Singha]]

CATEGORIES: Beer and breweries in Thailand

Singha ([tpl]lang-th|สิงห์[/tpl], correctly pronounced sing, but typically pronounced by foreigners as sing-ha, reflecting the Latin spelling) is a 5% alcohol-by-volume (abv) pale lager produced by Boon Rawd Brewery. It is also available in 5% abv draught version as Singha Lager Draft, and the 3.5% abv Singha Light introduced in 2006.

==History==

The Singha is a powerful mythological lion, found in ancient Hindu and Thai stories. The royal warrant was given on 25 October 1939, and Boon Rawd is the only brewery permitted to display the royal Garuda on the bottleneck.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.singhabeer.com/download/brochure/Singha_Company_Profile1.pdf |title=The Products |author= |year=2011 |work=|publisher=Singha Corporation Co., Ltd. |accessdate=12 January 2011[/tpl] 
Boon Rawd bought two German breweries at Hartmannsdorf and Mittweida, Saxony in 1994.  At one point these breweries produced a special variant, Singha Gold.  Singha beer is no longer brewed in Germany.
Beginning in September 2007, a 5.0% (abv) version of Singha replaced the 6.0% (abv) original. This new version, while still brewed in Thailand by Pathmthani Brewery Co Ltd, proclaims on its labelling to have been brewed under the supervision of Singha Corporation Co Ltd, instead of Boon Rawd. The last known fill date for Singha Lager 6.0% bottles sold in the United States is 18 October 2007.
Beer production capacity is 1 billion liters per year. Until recently Singha was the best selling beer in Thailand, but is now challenged by Beer Chang, brewed by ThaiBev (formerly the Beer Thai Company). In 2007, Boon Rawd regained its number one spot in Thailand.
Singha has been available in the UK since April 2010 in supermarkets Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and Morrisons, as well as in Thai restaurants. There are growing sales of Singha in bars, following the launch of draught Singha in 2011.
From March 2013, Singha beer will be produced at Carlsberg's Russian plant for distribution in European markets. Singha will also use any of eight Carlsberg plants in Asia for production. This comes as part of cooperation to use each other's production and markets.

==In popular culture==

The Pogues recorded a song, "House of the Gods," for their 1990 album Hell's Ditch, which describes a man relaxing on Pattaya Beach with Singha. The song's refrain repeats the line "Singha beer don't ask no questions; Singha beer don't tell no lies."
