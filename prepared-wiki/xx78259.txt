[[Flag of Mozambique]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Africa, National symbols of Mozambique, 1983 introductions

The flag of Mozambique was adopted on 1 May 1983. It includes the image of an AK-47 with a bayonet attached to the barrel and is the only national flag in the world to feature such a modern rifle. The flag is based on the flag of the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO), the leading political party in Mozambique. The FRELIMO flag, used for a brief period after the country gained its independence from Portugal, looks like the current flag but lacking the emblem, with green, black, and yellow horizontal stripes separated by white fimbriations and a red triangle in the hoist. On independence the colors were rearranged to form the national flag, in diagonals emanating from the upper hoist. Over this was a white cogwheel containing the hoe, rifle, book, and star that appear on the present flag. The flag was altered in 1983; the colors were arranged in horizontal stripes, and the star of Marxism was made larger. Proposals for a new, non-partisan flag have been introduced. Green stands for the riches of the land, the white fimbriations signify peace, black represents the African continent, yellow symbolizes the country's minerals, and red represents the struggle for independence. The rifle stands for defence and vigilance, the open book symbolizes the importance of education, the hoe represents the country's agriculture, and the star symbolizes Marxism and internationalism.

==2005 new flag proposal==

In 2005, a competition was held to design a new flag for Mozambique. 119 entries were received and a winning flag was selected, but to this day the flag remains the same. This came in the context of a drive to create a new crest and anthem for the country. Mozambique's parliamentary opposition would specifically like to see removed from the flag the image of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which symbolizes the nation's struggle for independence, according to press reports.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4550842.stm | work=BBC News | title=Are you passionate about your flag? | date=December 23, 2005[/tpl]
The proposition of a new flag was rejected by the FRELIMO-led parliament in December 2005. 169 proposed flags were turned down, including the current flag without the rifle.[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Mozambique: Parliament Keeps Gun In National Flag |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E4D71730F933A15751C1A9639C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=2005-12-20 |accessdate=2007-11-14 [/tpl]
