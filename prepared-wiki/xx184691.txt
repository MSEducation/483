CATEGORIES: Steamships, Shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean, Maritime incidents in 1860, 1858 ships

The passengers had embarked on Malabar when a gale from the northeast drove the vessel's stern on to a reef. The water began to rise in the ship's stern section and the captain opted to beach the ship in a sandy bay on the opposite side of the harbor. However, the sand turned out to be loose and almost like quicksand, and it was decided to give the order to abandon ship. There was no loss of life.[tpl]cite book |last=Elgin |first=James Bruce |authorlink=James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin |editor-last=Walrond |editor-first=Theodore |title=Letters and Journals of James, Eighth Earl of Elgin |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i5AMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA325 |publisher=John Murray |year=1872 |pages=325–328[/tpl]
