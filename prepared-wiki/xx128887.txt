Live and Sweaty was an Australian sports television program, broadcast on the ABC from 1991 until 1995. Hosted by Andrew Denton (and later Elle McFeast), the show was part panel-based, part talk show and part comedy, and predated The Footy Show which has a similar format.A few drinks with Andrew Denton, Inside Sport.

==Live and Sweaty regulars==

Andrew Denton was the show's host, and this was Denton's third series for the ABC (after Blah Blah Blah and The Money or the Gun). Comedian Libbi Gorr (in her Elle McFeast persona) was a roving reporter, panellist and eventual host of the show when Denton left in 1993.
Other regular panel members were actor Lex "The Swine" Marinos (always introduced with a Zorba the Greek style musical theme), Triple J presenter Debbie "Skull of Rust" Spillane, former NRL player Rex "The Moose" Mossop, and Peter "Crackers" Keenan. A sports news segment was presented by ABC sportscaster Karen Tighe.[tpl]cite book |last=Turner |first=Graeme |authorlink= |coauthors=Stuart Cunningham |title=The Australian TV Book |year=2000 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location=Sydney |isbn=1-86508-014-4 [/tpl]

==Notable stunts==

In 1992, Denton challenged the Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating, to a game of ten-pin bowling. Keating made no comment, but Denton continued to up the ante over the course of the year, protesting outside Parliament House and organising petitions urging the Prime Minister to accept the challenge. Keating eventually relented, not to the game, but appeared in a live interview with Denton.
In the lead up to the 1992 Summer Olympics, Denton and the rest of the regular cast of the show recorded the song I Don't Care As Long As We Beat New Zealand parodying the sporting rivalry between Australia and New Zealand. It was released as a single and reached #38 on the Australian charts.[tpl]cite|author=The Australian Record Industry Association Ltd|title=Australian Top 50 Singles - Week Ending 30 August 1992|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|date=1992-08-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=267518&cat=s|title=australian-charts.com - Andrew Denton And The Live & Sweaty Team - I Don't Care As Long As We Beat New Zealand|accessdate=2008-08-09[/tpl]
