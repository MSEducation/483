[[List of Interstate and U.S. Highways in Utah]]

CATEGORIES: Interstate Highways in Utah, U.S. Highways in Utah, Utah transportation-related lists

Three numbered highway systems are present in the U.S. state of Utah: the Interstate Highway System, the United States Numbered Highways system (more commonly known as "U.S. Routes") and the state route system. Both the Interstate and U.S. Highway system are nationwide systems with only a small portion of these routes entering Utah. The Utah Department of Transportation is responsible for maintaining all of the Interstate, U.S. Routes and state highways in the state. Originally, the State Road Commission of Utah, created on March 23, 1909 was responsible for maintenance, but these duties were rolled into the new Department of Transportation in 1975.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.state.ut.us/cgi-bin//cathtmljava2.cgi?RUN-WHAT=CATHTML&TEMPLATE=AGENCY&AGENCY=831|title=Utah State Archives Catalog|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl]

Five former U.S. Routes exist in the state of Utah, as well as two former interstate highways, all which have been replaced by current interstate and U.S. Routes, with the most recent change being U.S. Route 666 changing to U.S. Route 491 in 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/quirky/67534news07-31-03.htm|title=It's Now U.S. 491, Not U.S. 666 |last=Linthicum|first=Leslie|date=2003-07-31|publisher=Albuquerque Journal|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl] One unique former route would be Interstate 415, which was never signed as such, and was only used as a temporary designation for the eastern portion of what is now the Interstate 215 belt loop around Salt Lake City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609191605231|title=SR-215 History|date=1968-10-14|publisher=State Road Commission of Utah|accessdate=2008-07-29|format=PDF[/tpl]
