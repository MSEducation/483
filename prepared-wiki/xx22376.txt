[[Altitude]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace, Physical geography, Topography

Altitude or height is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or "up" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.
Vertical distance measurements in the "down" direction are commonly referred to as depth.

==Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight==

In aviation, the term altitude can have several meanings, and is always qualified by either explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. "true altitude"), or implicitly through the context of the communication.  Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.[tpl]cite book | date=1 December 1989 | title=Air Navigation |publisher=Department of the Air Force| id=AFM 51-40 [/tpl]
Aviation altitude is measured using either Mean Sea Level (MSL) or local ground level (Above Ground Level, or AGL) as the reference datum.
Pressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30m) as the flight level, and is used above the transition altitude ([tpl]convert|18000|ft|m[/tpl] in the US, but may be as low as [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m[/tpl] in other jurisdictions); so when the altimeter reads 18,000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at "Flight level 180". When flying at a Flight Level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 inHg / 1013.25 mbar).
On the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter, which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.
There are several types of aviation altitude:
These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:

==Altitude regions==

The Earth's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions:[tpl]cite web | title=Layers of the Atmosphere |work=JetStream, the National Weather Service Online Weather School | publisher=National Weather Service | url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm | accessdate=22 December 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20051219190158/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm| archivedate= 19 December 2005 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==High altitude and low air pressure==

Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m|disp=flip[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite book|title=Webster's New World Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8578|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-18928-3|year=2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm|title=An Altitude Tutorial|publisher=International Society for Mountain Medicine|accessdate=2011-06-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110719194849/http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/pressure.html|title=Atmospheric pressure|work=NOVA Online Everest|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=23 January 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090125053918/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/pressure.html| archivedate= 25 January 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Because of the lower pressure, the air expands as it rises, which causes it to cool.[tpl]cite book|first=Mark Zachary|last=Jacobson|title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modelling|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2nd|year=2005|isbn=0-521-83970-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first=C. Donald|last=Ahrens|title=Meteorology Today|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing|edition=8th|year=2006|isbn=0-495-01162-2[/tpl]  Thus, high altitude air is cold, which causes a characteristic alpine climate. This climate dramatically affects the ecology at high altitude.

===Relation between temperature and altitude in Earth's atmosphere===

The environmental lapse rate (ELR), is the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude in the stationary atmosphere at a given time and location. As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 K(°C)/1,000 m (3.56 °F or 1.98 K(°C)/1,000 Ft) from sea level to [tpl]convert|11|km|ft[/tpl]. From [tpl]convert|11|to|20|km|ft|mi[/tpl], the constant temperature is [tpl]convert|−56.5|C|F[/tpl], which is the lowest assumed temperature in the ISA. The standard atmosphere contains no moisture. Unlike the idealized ISA, the temperature of the actual atmosphere does not always fall at a uniform rate with height. For example, there can be an inversion layer in which the temperature increases with height.

===Effects of high altitude on humans===

Medicine recognizes that altitudes above [tpl]convert|1500|m|ft[/tpl] start to affect humans,[tpl]cite web | title=Non-Physician Altitude Tutorial | publisher=International Society for Mountain Medicine | url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm | accessdate=22 December 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20051223065508/http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm| archivedate= 23 December 2005 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above [tpl]convert|5500|-|6000|m|ft[/tpl] for more than two years.[tpl]cite journal|last=West|first=JB|pmid=12631426|title=Highest permanent human habitation|journal=High Altitude Medical Biology|volume=3|pages=401–407|year=2002|doi=10.1089/15270290260512882|issue=4[/tpl] As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen.[tpl]cite journal|title=Oxygen at high altitude|journal=British Medical Journal|first=Andrew J|last=Peacock|date=17 October 1998|volume=317|pages=1063–1066|pmid=9774298|issue=7165|pmc=1114067|doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1063[/tpl] The lack of oxygen above [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m|disp=flip[/tpl] can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Cymerman|first=A|last2=Rock|first2=PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=U.S. Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |year=1994[/tpl] The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry.[tpl]cite book |last1=Young|first1=Andrew J.|last2=Reeves|first2=John T. |title=Human Adaptation to High Terrestrial Altitude.

However, above [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft|-3[/tpl], (in the "death zone"), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible.
There is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes.[tpl]cite journal|last=West|first=John B.|title=Exciting Times in the Study of Permanent Residents of High Altitude|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|date=January 2011|volume=12|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1089/ham.2011.12101[/tpl] Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Voss|first1=JD|last2=Masuoka|first2=P|last3=Webber|first3=BJ|last4=Scher|first4=AI|last5= Atkinson|first5=RL|title=Association of Elevation, Urbanization and Ambient Temperature with Obesity Prevalence in the United States|journal=International Journal of Obesity|year=2013|pmid=23357956|doi=10.1038/ijo.2013.5|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1407–1412[/tpl] In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kindney in response to hypoxia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ismailov|first=RM|title=Erythropoietin and epidemiology of Alzheimer disease|journal=Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord.|date=Jul–Sep 2013|volume=27|issue=3|pages=204–6|doi=10.1097/WAD.0b013e31827b61b8|pmid=23314061[/tpl]
However, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Barry|last2=Cheng|first2=David|last3=Clark|first3=Sunday|last4=Camargo|first4=Carlos A., Jr|title=Positive Association between Altitude and Suicide in 2584 U.S. Counties|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|date=Spring 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=31–5|pmid=21214344|doi=10.1089/ham.2010.1058|pmc=3114154[/tpl] The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.

====Athletes====

For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=16|pages=655–658|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1|pmid=6643537|first1=AJ|issue=8[/tpl] For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft[/tpl] with the letter "A".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/06/32/50/63250_PDF_English.pdf|title=IAAF World Indoor Lists 2012|date=2012-03-09|publisher=IAAF Statistics Office[/tpl]
Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Wehrlin|first1=JP|last2=Zuest|first2=P|last3=Hallén|first3=J|last4=Marti|first4=B |title=Live high—train low for 24 days increases hemoglobin mass and red cell volume in elite endurance athletes |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=100 |issue=6 |pages=1938–45 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16497842 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01284.2005 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/6/1938.long |accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Gore|first1=CJ|last2=Clark|first2=SA|last3=Saunders|first3=PU |title=Nonhematological mechanisms of improved sea-level performance after hypoxic exposure |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1600–9 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17805094 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180de49d3 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00005768-200709000-00023 |accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl] These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming.

===Effect of altitude on animals===

Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny.

====Fish====

Fish at high altitudes may also have a lower metabolic rate, as has been shown in highland westslope cutthroat trout compared to introduced lowland rainbow trout in the Oldman River basin.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Joseph B.|first2=Michael D.|last2=Robinson|first3=Alice|last3=Hontela|first4=Daniel D.|last4=Heath|title=Metabolic traits of westslope cutthroat trout, introduced rainbow trout and their hybrids in an ecotonal hybrid zone along an elevation gradient|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105|pages=56–72|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01768.x|date=8 July 2011[/tpl] There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes observed in aquatic invertebrates, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Verberk|first1=Wilco C.E.P.|first2=David T.|last2=Bilton|first3=Piero|last3=Calosi|first4=John I.|last4=Spicer|title=Oxygen supply in aquatic ectotherms: Partial pressure and solubility together explain biodiversity and size patterns|journal=Ecology|volume=92|issue=8|pages=1565–1572|doi=10.1890/10-2369.1|pmid=21905423|date=11 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Peck|first1=L.S.|first2=G.|last2=Chapelle|title=Reduced oxygen at high altitude limits maximum size|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year=2003|volume=270|pages=166–167|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0054[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Dean|title=Low oxygen pressure as a driving factor for the altitudinal decline in taxon richness of stream macroinvertebrates|journal=Oceologia|volume=154|pages=795–807|doi=10.1007/s00442-007-0877-x|issue=4|pmid=17960424|date=24 September 2007[/tpl] These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity, which provides an advantage to fish with lower metabolic demands.
The naked carp from Lake Qinghai, like other members of the carp family, can use gill remodelling to increase oxygen uptake in hypoxia.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Matey|first1=Victoria|first2=Jeffrey G.|last2=Richards|first3=Yuxiang|last3=Wang|first4=Chris M.|last4=Wood|first5=Joe|last5=Rogers|first6=Rhiannon|last6=Davies|first7=Brent W.|last7=Murray|first8=X.-Q.|last8=Chen|first9=Jizeng|last9=Du|first10=Colin J.|last10=Brauner|displayauthors=4|title=The effect of hypoxia on gill morphology and ionoregulatory status in the Lake Qinghai scaleless carp, Gymnocypris przewalskii|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=211|pages=1063–1074|doi=10.1242/jeb.010181|pmid=18344480|issue=Pt 7|date=30 January 2008[/tpl]  The response of naked carp to cold and low-oxygen conditions seem to be at least partly mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1).[tpl]cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Yi-Bin|first2=Xue-Qun|last2=Chen|first3=Shen|last3=Wang|first4=Yu-Xiang|last4=Wang|first5=Ji-Zeng|last5=Du|title=Evolution and regulation of  the downstream gene of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a in naked carp (Gymnocypris przewalskii) from Lake Qinghai, China|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|volume=67|pages=570–580|doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9175-4|pmid=18941827|issue=5|date=6 October 2008[/tpl] It is unclear whether this is a common characteristic in other high altitude dwelling fish or if gill remodelling and HIF-1 use for cold adaptation are limited to carp.

====Rodents====

Rodents living at high altitude include deer mice, guinea pigs and rats. As small mammals they face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their large volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.
There are a number of mechanisms that help them survive these harsh conditions including altered genetics of the hemoglobin gene in guinea pigs and deer mice.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Storz|first1=J.F.|last2=Runck|first2=A. M.|last3=Moriyama|first3=H.|last4=Weber|last5=Fago|first5=A|title=Genetic differences in  hemoglobin function between highland and lowland deer mice|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=213|pages=2565–2574|pmid=20639417|doi=10.1242/jeb.042598|pmc=2905302|issue=15|first4=R. E.|date=1 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Pariet|first1=B.|last2=Jaenicke|first2=E.|title=Structure of the altitude adapted hemoglobin of guinea pig in the R-state|journal=PloS One|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e12389|pmid=20811494|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012389|pmc=2927554|editor1-last=Zhang|editor1-first=Shuguang|date=24 August 2010[/tpl] Deer mice use a high percentage of fats as metabolic fuel at high altitude to retain carbohydrates for small burst of energy.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Cheviron|first1=Z.A.|last2=Bachman|first2=G. C.|last3=Connaty|first3=A. D.|last4=McClelland|first4=G. B.|last5=Storz|first5=J. F|title=Regulatory changes contribute to the adaptive enhancement of thermogenic capacity in high-altitude deer mice|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|series=22|pages=8635–8640|pmid=22586089|doi=10.1073/pnas.1120523109|issue=22|pmc=3365185|date=29 May 2010[/tpl] To convert fats to energy in the form of ATP, more oxygen is required than to convert the same amount of carbohydrates. The reason they use fats is believed to be because they have it in large stores, but also means that they must eat more or they will begin to lose weight.
Other physiological changes that occur in rodents at high altitude include increased breathing rate[tpl]cite journal|last1=Yilmaz|first1=C.|last2=Hogg|first2=D.|last3=Ravikumar|first3=P.|last4=Hsia|first4=C|title=Ventilatory acclimatization in awake guinea pigs raised at high altitude|journal=Respiratory Physiology and Neurobiology|volume=145|pages=235–243|pmid=15705538|doi=10.1016/j.resp.2004.07.011|issue=2–3|date=15 February 2005[/tpl] and altered morphology of the lungs and heart allowing more efficient gas exchange and delivery.

At high altitudes, some rodents even shift their thermal neutral zone so they may maintain normal basal metabolic rate at colder temperatures.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Broekman|first1=M|last2=Bennett|first2=N.|last3=Jackson|first3=C.|last4=Scantlebury|first4=M.|title=Mole-rats from higher altitudes have greater thermoregulatory capabilities|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=89|pages=750–754|pmid=17020776|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.08.023|issue=5|date=30 December 2006[/tpl]

====Birds====

Birds have been especially successful at living at high altitudes.[tpl]cite journal|last1=McCracken|first1=K. G.|last2=Barger|first2=CP|last3=Bulgarella|first3=M|last4=Johnson|first4=KP|last5=Sonsthagen|first5=SA|last6=Trucco|first6=J|last7=Valqui|first7=TH|last8=Wilson|first8=RE|last9=Winker|first9=K|displayauthors=4|title=Parallel evolution in the major haemoglobin genes of eight species of Andean waterfowl|journal=Molecular Evolution|date=October 2009|volume=18|issue=19|pages=3992–4005|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04352.x|pmid=19754505|last10=Sorenson|first10=M. D.[/tpl]  In general, birds have physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight. The respiratory system of birds moves oxygen across the pulmonary surface during both inhalation and exhalation, making it more efficient than that of mammals.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Foster and Smith.|title=How the Respiratory System of Birds Works|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=15+1829&aid=2721|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl] In addition, the air circulates in one direction through the parabronchioles in the lungs. Parabronchioles are oriented perpendicular to the pulmonary arteries, forming a cross-current gas exchanger. This arrangement allows for more oxygen to be extracted compared to mammalian concurrent gas exchange; as oxygen diffuses down its concentration gradient and the air gradually becomes more deoxygenated, the pulmonary arteries are still able to extract oxygen.[tpl]cite book|last1=Moyes|first1=C.|last2=Schulte|first2=P.|title=Principles of Animal Physiology, 2/E|year=2007|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=0321501551[/tpl] Birds also have a high capacity for oxygen delivery to the tissues because they have larger hearts and cardiac stroke volume (mL / min) compared to mammals of similar body size.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Grubb|first2=B.R.|title=Allometric relations of cardiovascular function in birds|journal=American Journal of Physiology|date=October 1983|volume=245|issue=4|pages=H567–72|pmid=6624925|first1=BR[/tpl] Additionally, they have an increased vascularization in flight muscle due to increased branching of capillaries and small muscle fibres (which increases surface-area-to-volume ratio).[tpl]cite book|last=Mathieu-Costello|first=O.|title=Histology of flight: tissue and muscle gas exchange. In Hypoxia: The Adaptations.|year=1990|publisher=B.C. Decker|location=Toronto|pages=13–19[/tpl] These two features facilitate oxygen diffusion from the blood to muscle, allowing flight to be sustained during environmental hypoxia. Bird's hearts and brains, which are very sensitive to arterial hypoxia, are more vascularized compared to mammals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Faraci|first=F.M.|title=Adaptations to hypoxia in birds: how to fly high|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=1991|volume=53|pages=59–70|pmid=2042973|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.53.030191.000423[/tpl]  The bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) is an iconic high flyer that surmounts the Himalayas during migration,[tpl]cite journal|last=Swan|first=L.W.|title=Goose of the Himalayas|journal=Journal of Natural History|year=1970|volume=70|pages=68–75[/tpl]  and serves as a model system for derived physiological adaptations for high-altitude flight.
