Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) is a rapid transit railroad serving Newark, Harrison, Hoboken, and Jersey City in metropolitan northern New Jersey and Manhattan in New York City. It is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
PATH trains run 24 hours a day and is one of only five mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Staten Island Railway, and the New York City Subway). The system has a route length of [tpl]convert|13.8|mi|km[/tpl], not including any route overlap.Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "PATH at a Glance – April 1995." As of 2012, PATH had an average weekday ridership of 262,900, making it one of the busiest rapid transit systems in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
PATH trains only use tunnels in Manhattan, Hoboken and downtown Jersey City. The tracks cross the Hudson River through century-old cast iron tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. PATH's route from Grove Street in Jersey City west to Newark runs in open cuts, at grade level, and on elevated track.
While some PATH stations are adjacent or connected to New York City Subway, Newark Light Rail, Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and New Jersey Transit stations, there are no free transfers between these different, independently run transit systems; however, PATH does accept the same pay-per-ride MetroCard used by the New York City Subway, with the exception of Unlimited Ride and EasyPay MetroCards.[tpl]cite web|title=PATH|url=http://www.panynj.gov/path/metrocard.html|work=Metrocard|publisher=The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|accessdate=February 2, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The history of PATH, originally known as the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, predates the first underground line of the New York City Subway (the IRT). Although the railroad was first planned in 1874, existing technologies could not safely tunnel under the Hudson River. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but stopped shortly thereafter when funding ran out. Construction resumed in 1900 under the direction of William Gibbs McAdoo, an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from Chattanooga, Tennessee. McAdoo later became president of what was known, for many years, as the H&M, Hudson Tubes or McAdoo Tunnels.[tpl]cite web|author=Fitzherbert, Anthony|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/path/hmhistory.html|title="The Public Be Pleased": William G. McAdoo and the Hudson Tubes|date=June 1964|publisher=Electric Railroaders Association, nycsubway.org|accessdate=January 9, 2012[/tpl]

===Construction of the tunnels===

The first tunnel (the more northern of the uptown pair) was originally built without an excavation shield or iron construction because the chief engineer of the time, Dewitt Haskin, believed that the river silt was strong enough to maintain the tunnel's form (with the help of compressed air) until a [tpl]convert|2|ft|6|in|cm|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] brick lining could be constructed. Haskin's plan was to excavate the tunnel, then fill it with compressed air to expel the water and to hold the iron plate lining in place. They succeeded in building the tunnel out by approximately [tpl]convert|1200|ft|m[/tpl] from Jersey City until a series of blowouts—including a particularly serious one in 1880 that took the lives of 20 workers—ended the project.
When the New York and Jersey Tunnel Company resumed construction on the tunnels in 1902, chief engineer Charles M. Jacobs employed a different method of tunneling using tubular cast iron plating. An enormous mechanical shield was pushed through the silt at the bottom of the river. The displaced mud was then placed into a chamber, where it was later shoveled into small cars that hauled it to the surface. In some cases, the silt was baked with kerosene torches to facilitate easier removal of the mud. The southern tunnel of the uptown pair was constructed using the tubular cast iron method.[tpl]cite book |title=The Subways and Tunnels of New York |last1=Gilbert |first1=Gilbert H. |last2=Wightman |first2=Lucius I. |last3=Saunders |first3=W.L. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1912 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn= |pages=155–159 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6JJ-AAAAMAAJ&dq=subways%20and%20tunnels%20of%20new%20york&pg=PA155 [/tpl] Construction of the uptown tunnels was completed in 1906.[tpl]cite news |title=$100,000,000 Capital for M'Adoo Tunnels |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C1EF63C5A12738DDDAB0994DA415B868CF1D3 |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 12, 1906[/tpl] A second pair of tunnels was built about [tpl]convert|1+1/4|mi|km[/tpl] south of the first pair. Construction began in 1906 and was completed in 1909, also using the tubular cast iron method.Cudahy, p. 18.
The tunnels are separate for each track, which enables a better ventilation by so-called piston effect. When a train passes through the tunnel it pushes out the air in front of it toward the closest ventilation shaft in front, and "sucks-in" the air to the tunnel from the closest ventilation shaft behind it.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=J.

By contrast, the eastern ends of the tunnels, located underneath Manhattan, employed cut and cover construction methods.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Hudson and Manhattan Railroad years===

The first trains ran in 1907 and revenue service started between Hoboken and 19th Street at midnight on February 26, 1908, after President Theodore Roosevelt pressed a button at the White House that turned on the electric lines in the uptown tubes.[tpl]cite news |title=Trolley Tunnel Open to New Jersey |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9507E2D81F3EE233A25755C2A9649C946997D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1908 |page=1 |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |quote=The natural barrier which has separated New York from New Jersey since those States came into existence was, figuratively speaking, wiped away at 3:40½ o'clock yesterday afternoon when the first of the two twin tubes of the McAdoo tunnel system was formally opened, thus linking Manhattan with Hoboken, and establishing a rapid transit service beneath the Hudson River.[/tpl] On July 19, 1909, service began between the Hudson Terminal in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City, through the downtown tubes. After the completion of the uptown Manhattan extension to 33rd Street and the westward extension to the now-defunct Manhattan Transfer and Park Place Newark terminus in 1911, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad was considered to be complete. The cost of the entire project was estimated at between $55 and $60 million, equal to more than $1 billion in present-day.Consumer Price Index (CPI) Conversion Factors 1774 to estimated 2018 to Convert to Dollars of 2008, Robert Sahr, Associate Professor Oregon State University.

Originally, the Hudson Tubes were designed to link three of the major railroad terminals on the Hudson River in New Jersey—the Lackawanna in Hoboken, the Erie and Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in Jersey City—with New York City. While it still provides a connection to train stations in Hoboken and Newark, the commuter train stations at Erie (now Pavonia-Newport) and Exchange Place (the PRR station) have since closed down and been demolished. Towards the end of the 20th century the old rail yards at Pavonia and Exchange Place were replaced with large-scale office, residential, and retail developments.
There were early negotiations for Pennsylvania Station to also be shared by the two railroads.[tpl]cite news |title=McAdoo Co.

There was also a plan to build an extension from the curve west of Hoboken Terminal to where Secaucus Junction is now, and a plan for a north–south connection from the 33rd Street Station south on Broadway to Union Square and then a new alignment to Hudson Terminal.
The opening of the Holland Tunnel in 1927, coupled with the Depression that began shortly after, marked the decline of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. Later, the construction of the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge further enticed people away from the railroad. All of these tunnels were intended to increase the flow of auto-traffic, providing an alternative to the railway.[tpl]clear left[/tpl]

===Port Authority takeover===

Promotions and other advertising proved ineffectual at slowing the financial decline. In the 1950s, H&M fell into bankruptcy, but continued to operate. It remained under bankruptcy court protection for years, a source of embarrassment. For decades, New Jersey politicians asked the Port Authority to operate the vital transit link, but Port Authority officials were reluctant to assume the money-losing operation, and New York politicians did not want extra Port Authority money spent in New Jersey.
The World Trade Center finally enabled the three parties to compromise. The Port Authority agreed to purchase and maintain the Tubes in return for the rights to build the World Trade Center on the land occupied by H&M's Hudson Terminal, which was the Lower Manhattan terminus of the Tubes.
In 1962, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company ceased operation of the Hudson Tubes, and service began through the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH), a subsidiary organization of the Port Authority. Upon taking over the H&M Railroad, the Port Authority spent $70 million to modernize PATH's infrastructure.[tpl]cite news |title=Authority Trains Winning Plaudits |date=September 4, 1967|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F4061FFC3D5B117B93C6A91782D85F438685F9 |quote=Five years ago, the Port of New York Authority took over the bankrupt and antiquated Hudson Tubes.

During the 1980s, the PATH system experienced substantial growth in ridership, which meant the infrastructure needed expansion and rehabilitation. The Port Authority announced a plan in 1988 to upgrade the infrastructure so that stations on the Newark – WTC line could accommodate longer 8-car trains while 7-car trains could operate between Journal Square and 33rd Street.[tpl]cite news |title=No Free Rides Business |publisher=Journal of New Jersey |date=April 1988 |author=Wilson, Joyce Wells[/tpl]  In August 1990, the Port Authority put forth a $1 billion plan to renovate the PATH stations and add new rail cars.[tpl]cite news |title=Port Authority Plans Outlined |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 12, 1990 |author=Yarrow, Andrew L. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D7133CF931A2575BC0A966958260[/tpl]  To help provide revenue, the Port Authority installed video monitors in its stations that display advertising.[tpl]cite news |title=TV Ads Are Spreading To Subways and Malls |work=The New York Times |date=January 1, 1990 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DA173BF932A35752C0A966958260|quote=The newest transit video network is now being installed in the PATH rail system, which shuttles 200,000 passengers daily between New Jersey and Manhattan.

A new car maintenance facility was also added in Harrison, at a cost of $225 million.[tpl]cite news |title=For PATH, On-Time Record of 90 Percent |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 15, 1992 |author=Romano, Jay |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD163AF936A25750C0A964958260[/tpl]
On December 11, 1992, a storm caused extensive flooding in the PATH tunnels, resulting in the system being out of service for 10 days. A [tpl]convert|2500| -|3000|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] section of track between Hoboken and Pavonia was flooded, as were other locations within the system.

===September 11, 2001 and Recovery===

The World Trade Center station, which is one of PATH's two New York terminals, was destroyed on September 11, 2001, when the Twin Towers above it collapsed. Just prior to the collapse, the station was closed and any waiting passengers that were in the station were evacuated by a train that was already inside the terminal.
With the station destroyed, service to Lower Manhattan was suspended for over two years. Exchange Place, the next station on the Newark – World Trade Center line, also had to be closed because it could not operate as a "terminal" station.Downtown Restoration Program[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Instead, two uptown services (Newark – 33rd Street (red) and Hoboken – 33rd Street (blue)) and one intrastate New Jersey service (Hoboken-Journal Square (green)) were put into operation. Only one after-hours train was put into service, Newark – 33rd Street (via Hoboken).

====Restoration of service to Exchange Place====

Modifications were made to a stub end tunnel (also known as the Penn Pocket, which was originally built for short turn World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs to handle PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal) to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH to bore through the bedrock dividing the stub tunnel and the tunnels to and from Newark. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to/from Hoboken use separate tunnels from the Newark service.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] From Newark, trains cross over to the Newark/Hoboken bound track just north of Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. From Hoboken, trains enter on the Manhattan-bound track at Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used the same crossover switch to go to the Newark-bound tracks before entering Grove Street.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

====Restoration of service to World Trade Center====

PATH service to Lower Manhattan was restored when a $323 million temporary station opened on November 23, 2003; the inaugural train was the same one that had been used for the evacuation. The new station still contains portions of the original station but it does not have heating or air conditioning systems installed. The temporary entrance was closed on July 1, 2007, and demolished to make way for the permanent station, while the Church Street entrance opened.[tpl]cite web | title =The path to a new PATH | date =June 29, 2007 to July 5, 2007 | url =http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_216/thepathtoanew.html | accessdate =July 10, 2007 | postscript =[/tpl] On April 11, 2007, the Port Authority announced that it will build a new entrance to the World Trade Center PATH station on Vesey Street. The new entrance opened in March 2008, and the entrance on Church Street has since been demolished. The contract to build the permanent World Trade Center PATH station, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark, was awarded to a joint-venture of Granite Construction North-East (formally Granite Halmar), Fluor Enterprises, Bovis Lend Lease, and Slattery Skanska. The City Room blog of the New York Times reported that the first platform of the permanent station, serving Hoboken-bound riders, opened February 25, 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Imperfect already?|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/imperfect-already/|date=February 25, 2014[/tpl]

===Bomb plot of 2006===

On July 7, 2006, an alleged plot to detonate explosives in the PATH tunnels (initially said to be a plot to bomb the Holland Tunnel) was uncovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The plot included the detonation of a bomb that could significantly destroy and flood the tunnels, endangering all the occupants and vehicles in the tunnel at the time of the explosion. The terror planners believed that Lower Manhattan could, as a result of the explosion, be flooded due to river water surging up the remaining tunnel after the blast. Officials say that this plan was unsound due to the strength of the tunnels. Since semi-trailer trucks are currently not allowed to pass through the Holland Tunnel, and it was unfeasible to carry such a bomb on board a PATH train, it was very difficult to get sufficient explosives into the tunnel to accomplish the plan. If the tunnel were to explode and allow water from the Hudson River to flood the (Holland) tunnel, Lower Manhattan would be spared since the area is [tpl]convert|2|–|10|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. Of the eight planners based in six different countries, three were arrested.ThreatsWatch.Org: InBrief: Foreign Plot to Bomb Holland Tunnel Thwarted – Updated

===Hurricane Sandy===

On October 29, 2012, PATH service was suspended system-wide due to Hurricane Sandy. The following day, Governor Christie of New Jersey stated that PATH train service would be out for 7–10 days as a result of the damage caused by the hurricane.http://online.wsj.com/article/APda7e4850e4484e0ca3d94672397fcc38.html [tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Storm surge from the hurricane caused significant flooding to PATH train stations in Hoboken and Jersey City, as well as at the World Trade Center. An image captured from a PATH security camera showing the ingress of water at Hoboken at 8:23 p.m. on October 29, quickly spread across the Internet and became one of several representative images from the hurricane.[tpl]cite web|last=Goldman|first=Russell|title=Hurricane Sandy: Live Updates|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-live-updates/|work=ABC News|publisher=American Broadcasting Company|accessdate=November 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Rudd|first=Andy|title=Hurricane Sandy: At least 16 dead as superstorm batters New Jersey coastline|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/hurricane-sandy-at-least-16-dead-1407719|accessdate=November 18, 2012|newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=October 30, 2012[/tpl]
The first revenue PATH trains after the hurricane were the Journal Square to 33rd Street service, which recommenced on November 6 with modifications, running from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. Service was extended west to Harrison and Newark on November 12, in place of the Newark - World Trade Center service.
