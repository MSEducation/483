FIFA, football's international governing body selected China as host nation as Guangdong had hosted a prototype world championship three years earlier, the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament. Matches were played in the state capital, Guangzhou, as well as in Foshan, Jiangmen and Zhongshan. The competition was sponsored by Mars, Incorporated. With FIFA still reluctant to bestow their "World Cup" brand, the tournament was officially known as the 1st FIFA World Championship for Women's Football for the M&M's Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.topofthecircle.com/OMwusa1.html|title=WUSA opening a feast for the eyes -- and ears |publisher=TopOfTheCircle.com |accessdate=21 April 2013|first=Al|last=Mattei[/tpl]

==Tournament review==

FIFA's technical report demonstrates that, after the tournament, players and officials were undecided whether to persist with 80 minute matches, or to change to 90 minutes in line with men's football. Opinion was also divided about the suitability of using a size five football. Some teams reported difficulty in sourcing good quality equipment in the correct size.
The tournament was considered a major success in the quality of play and attendances at the games. FIFA president João Havelange wrote that:[tpl]harvnb|Lopez|1997|p=173[/tpl]
The perceived success of the tournament was a significant factor in the subsequent inclusion of women's football in the 1996 Summer Olympics.[tpl]harvnb|Lopez|1997|p=175[/tpl] Sue Lopez reported that although attendances were very high, many tickets were complimentary. The "novelty factor" of women from foreign lands playing football also encouraged local people to attend.[tpl]harvnb|Lopez|1997|p=207[/tpl]

For three days prior to the final both teams stayed at the White Swan Hotel, a cost saving measure which upset the players. Many felt that male teams would not be asked to share a hotel before a game of comparable importance.[tpl]harvnb|Lisi|2010|p=16[/tpl]
