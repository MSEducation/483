Ramkhamhaeng University ([tpl]lang-th|มหาวิทยาลัยรามคำแหง[/tpl]) is one of two open universities in Thailand. The university was named in honour of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great of Sukhothai, who traditionally is credited for creating the Thai alphabet.
Before the establishment of Ramkhamhaeng University in 1971, Thailand had what has been described as "a crisis in the quest for higher education", since the number of high school graduates seeking competitive place in the government universities far outnumbered the capacity of all universities combined. Parliament finally passed a law authorizing the establishment of Ramkhamhaeng University, the kingdom's first open-admission university.
The university is composed of the Faculties of Law, Business Administration, Humanities, Education, Science, Political Science, Economics, Engineering, and Education Technology. The Faculty of Engineering admits a limited number of students, while other faculties are open to anyone who wishes to enroll.
Ramkhamhaeng University has two major campuses, both located in Bangkok. Freshman classes are held at Bang Na campus in Phra Khanong District. Most others classes are conducted at the main campus at Hua Mak, Bang Kapi District.
