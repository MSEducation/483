Matthew Richard "Matt" Stone is an American actor, animator, screenwriter, television director, producer, comedian, and recording artist. He is best known for being the co-creator of South Park along with his creative partner and best friend Trey Parker, as well as co-writing the 2011 multi-Tony Award winning musical The Book of Mormon.
Stone and Parker launched their largely collaborative careers in 1989 when they met at the University of Colorado. In 1992 they made a holiday short titled Jesus vs. Frosty which would eventually become South Park. Their first success came from Alferd Packer: The Musical, subsequently distributed as Cannibal! The Musical. From there he made another short title Jesus vs. Santa, leading him and college friend Parker to create South Park, which has been airing for over fifteen years. He has four Emmy Awards for his role in South Park, winning for both "Outstanding Programming More Than One Hour" and "Outstanding Programming Less Than One Hour".

==Career==

===South Park===

In 1992, Stone and Parker created the short film Jesus vs. Frosty.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/Treats/SOC1script.htm |title = The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Frosty |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com [/tpl] It included four boys, two resembling Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski, one called Kenny who looked like Cartman, and a fourth unnamed boy who looked like Kenny. Both Jesus and Cannibal! The Musical were made while they were students at the University of Colorado film school, studying under both Stan Brakhage and Jerry Aronson. After the duo released Cannibal! The Musical, they were asked to make another animated short.VH1 Press | BRIAN GRADEN's BioBrian Graden Biography - life, family, childhood, children, death, history, wife, school, young They came down to two ideas: one a sequel to Jesus vs. Frosty, and one about a character that would later be recurring in South Park, Mr. Hankey.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/SPinfo/SPTimeline1990s.htm |title = The South Park Timeline |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com [/tpl] They chose to write about the four boys, and their decision ultimately opened the door for them to present a show (South Park) to Comedy Central.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/Treats/SOC2script.htm |title = The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com [/tpl] Stone and Parker produced 13 episodes for season 1.South Park The video landed in the hands of Comedy Central's Doug Herzog.

In June 1999, Stone and Parker made South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, which gave the series prominence.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/6E0862C5BA46199D802567A700246877 |title = South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher =British Board of Film Classification[/tpl] The film's music was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to "You'll Be In My Heart" from Tarzan.
As of 2007, Parker is credited with directing and writing the vast majority of South Park episodes, and voicing most of the regular and guest characters, leading fans to question Stone's involvement in the creative process. According to a 2007 Maclean's article by Jaime J. Weinman, however, Stone handles the business side of the series as its production coordinator, responsible for assembling its various elements, and making sure they arrive on time and under budget. Stone commented to IGN, "I am not a good director, I know that. I am not a very good actor either, and I know it, but it is good to know that." As Parker is "self-admittedly anti-social" and non-confrontational, Stone is the one who handles conflicts with the network over issues of censorship and contracts, grants interviews with the media in the wake of controversial episodes, and acts as a go-between between Parker and others when Parker says provocative things. Weinman compared Parker and Stone's relationship to that of Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in which the diplomatic Seinfeld would defuse tension created by more volatile David, and suggested that Parker would not be able to get away with saying offensive things without Stone.Weinman, Jaime J. (April 23, 2007). "South Park has a silent partner". Maclean's On September 25, 2013, South Park's seventeenth season premiered.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/30/south-park-season-17-delayed-until-fall |title=South Park: Season 17 Delayed Until Fall |author=Max Nicholson|date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate = 2013-02-01 |publisher = ign.com[/tpl]
