==Career==

===Early career===

Early in his career, Enbert skated with Viktoria Kazantseva. The pair placed 12th at the 2006 World Junior Championships.
In 2007, Enbert began a partnership with Ksenia Ozerova, coached by Oksana Kazakova. During the 2008–09 season, they won silver and bronze medals on the Junior Grand Prix series. This qualified them for the Junior Grand Prix Final, however, they withdrew after the short program. They made their senior international debut at the 2008 Cup of Russia, where they placed 5th. They were given a berth to the 2009 World Championships after Lubov Iliushechkina / Nodari Maisuradze withdrew due to injury. They finished 24th at the event.
The following season, Ozerova/Enbert won silver at the 2009 Cup of Nice, finished 8th at the 2009 Skate Canada International and 6th at Russian senior nationals. They split up at the end of the season.

===Partnership with Gerboldt===

Enbert's coaches suggested he try out with single skater Katarina Gerboldt, whom he knew since childhood. In March 2010, it was announced that he and Gerboldt had formed a partnership. They were originally coached by Tamara Moskvina and Artur Dmitriev at Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg.
During the 2010–11 season, Gerboldt/Enbert made their international debut at the 2010 Cup of Nice, which they won. They finished fourth at the 2010 Cup of Russia, their sole Grand Prix event of the season. At the 2011 Russian Nationals, they placed fourth in the short program and fifth in the long, to finish fourth overall. As Tatiana Volosozhar / Maxim Trankov were ineligible to compete at the 2011 European Championships, Gerboldt/Enbert were named in the team for the event. They placed fifth in the short program with a new personal best score of 57.50, fourth in the free program, also with a new personal best (112.45), and finished fourth overall with 169.95 points, their best combined total.
In the 2011–12 season, Gerboldt/Enbert competed in one Grand Prix event, the 2011 Cup of Russia. In 2012–13, they were assigned to Skate Canada but withdrew due to injury – Gerboldt tore a ligament. Coached by Oleg Vasiliev, Gerboldt/Enbert returned to competition in the 2013–14 season but split in April 2014.

===Partnership with Davankova===

On 30 April 2014, Nina Mozer announced that Enbert and Vasilisa Davankova had formed a partnership, coached by her in Moscow.
