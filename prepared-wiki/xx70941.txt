==Company history== 
The company began in 1888 with an encounter between a worker and an executive at a Columbus, Georgia textile mill.[tpl]cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.synovus.com/?ID=1001|work=Synovus.com|accessdate=2013-08-23[/tpl]
The worker’s dress became tangled in factory machinery, and money she had sewn into her hem spilled onto the floor. Explaining she felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, a mill executive offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest. That same service was soon offered to all the workers, and those deposits marked the beginning of Synovus.
The company built a comprehensive financial services company that today operates in five states across the Southeast.

===Caught up in the financial crisis===

In mid-August 2009 the bank was named as one of the biggest of more than 150 U.S. lenders which owned nonperforming loans equal to 5 percent or more of their holdings. Five percent is a threshold that former regulators have stated can wipe out a bank’s equity and threaten its survival.[tpl]Cite news |author= Levy, Ari |title= Toxic Loans Topping 5% May Push 150 Banks to Point of No Return |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aTTT9jivRIWE |work=Bloomberg News |location=New York City, NY |date=August 14, 2009 |date=August 24, 2009[/tpl]
