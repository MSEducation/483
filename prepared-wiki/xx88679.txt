==Civil War==

Buchanan was the captain of the ironclad CSS Virginia (formerly the [tpl]USS|Merrimack|1855|6[/tpl]) during the Battle of Hampton Roads in Virginia.Symonds, p. 152. He climbed to the top deck of Virginia and began furiously firing toward shore with a carbine as the [tpl]USS|Congress|1841|6[/tpl] was shelled.Jones, Terry L., Historical dictionary of the Civil War, Lanham, Scarecrow Press, 2011, p . 638. He soon was brought down by a sharpshooter's minie ball to the thigh. He would eventually recover from his leg wound. He never did get to command Virginia against the [tpl]USS|Monitor[/tpl]. That honor went to Catesby ap Roger Jones. But Buchanan had handed the United States Navy the worst defeat it would take until the Attack on Pearl Harbor.United States Naval Institute Proceedings, Volume 88, U.S. Naval Institute, 1962, p. 68.
In August 1862, Buchanan was promoted to the rank of admiral and sent to command Confederate naval forces at Mobile Bay, Alabama.Tucker, Spencer, Almanac of American military history, Santa Barbara, ABC-CLIO, 2013, p. 668. He oversaw the construction of the ironclad CSS Tennessee and was on board her during the Battle of Mobile Bay with Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut's Union fleet on August 5, 1864.Symonds, p. 254. Wounded and taken prisoner, Admiral Buchanan was not exchanged until February 1865. He was on convalescent leave until the Civil War ended a few months later.
