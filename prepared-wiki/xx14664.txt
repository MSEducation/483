Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 along with her then romantic partner Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, Rumours, released in 1977, was the best-selling album of the year of its release and, to date, made claimed sales of 40 million copies worldwide, which makes it the sixth biggest selling studio album of all time. The album remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks and reached the top spot in various countries worldwide. The album won Album of the Year in 1978 and produced four U.S. Top 10 singles, with Nicks' "Dreams" being the band's first and only U.S. number one hit.
Nicks began her solo career in 1981 with the album Bella Donna, which reached Platinum status less than three months after its release, and has since been certified quadruple-platinum.[tpl]certification Cite|region=United States|type=album|artist=Stevie Nicks|title=Bella Donna[/tpl] She has produced seven more solo studio albums to date, with her most recent titled In Your Dreams, released on May 3, 2011.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, to Jess Nicks, former president of Greyhound's Armour-DialStevie Nicks, The Source, 1981 and Barbara Nicks, a homemaker. Nicks' grandfather, Aaron Jess Nicks, a struggling country music singer, taught Nicks to sing, performing duets with her by the time she was four years old. Nicks' mother was very protective of her, keeping her at home "more than most people were" and fostering in her a love of fairy tales.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |title=Five Not So Easy Pieces |work=Rolling Stone |author=Daisann McLane |date=1980 – Issue 310 |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/azrepub9.htm |title=Oh, Mother! – Fleetwood Mac's Stevie, 49, still Barbara's little girl |publisher=Arizona Republic |author=Randy Cordova |date=October 21, 1997 |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl] As a young child, Nicks had difficulty pronouncing her given name Stephanie, instead pronouncing it "tee-dee", which became the nickname, "Stevie".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Family |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl]
Her father's career as a food business executive necessitated frequent moves, and the family lived in Phoenix, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco during Nicks' youth. With the Goya guitar that she received for her sixteenth birthday, Nicks wrote her first song called "I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad But Not Blue." She spent her adolescence playing records constantly, and existing in her "own little musical world".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emin-your-dreamsem-docume_b_1937997.html |title= In Your Dreams Documentary Premieres at Hampton's: Chatting With Stevie Nicks|work=Huffington Post |author=Mike Ragogna |year=2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2013[/tpl] She joined her first band, "The Changing Times", while attending Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California.FleetwoodMac.net: Stevie Nicks
Nicks first met her future musical and romantic partner, Lindsey Buckingham, during her senior year at Menlo Atherton High School.MTV.com: Stevie Nicks. She was attending a high school party and saw Buckingham playing "California Dreamin'", and joined in with the harmony.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/qmagazine_may2001.htm |title=Queen of the Stoned Age |work=Q Magazine |date = May 2001|accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl] Buckingham contacted Nicks a few years later and asked her to join him and his bandmates, Javier Pacheco and Calvin Roper, in a band called Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band. Fritz became popular as a live act from 1968 until 1972, opening for popular musicians Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin - both of whom Nicks credits as inspiring her own stage intensity and performances - among others, in the San Francisco Bay Area.[tpl]cite news |url=http://fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/javierpacheco_qa1.htm |title=Javier Pacheco Question and Answer Session |publisher=fleetwoodmac.net |date=July 5–24, 1999 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] Both Nicks and Buckingham attended San Jose State University in Northern California, where Nicks majored in Speech Communication. She had planned on becoming an English teacher, but she and Buckingham dropped out in 1968 to move to Los Angeles in pursuit of a music career when Nicks' family moved to Chicago.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/stevie.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Biography |publisher=fleetwoodmac.net |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl]

===1972-74: Buckingham Nicks===

After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write and record as a duo, producing demo tapes at the coffee plant belonging to Buckingham's father, Morris.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] They then secured a deal with Polydor Records, which used tracks from their demo tapes to release the album Buckingham Nicks in 1973. The album was not a commercial success, despite the live shows that Nicks and Buckingham performed together to support it, and Polydor dropped the pair from the label. To support herself and Buckingham, who wrote music while recovering from mononucleosis, Nicks worked a variety of jobs, which included waiting tables and a stint cleaning engineer/producer Keith Olsen's house, where Nicks and Buckingham lived for a time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks – Behind the Music |publisher=nicksfix.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] Nicks says that she first used cocaine during this time.[tpl]cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=132659&page=1 |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABC News |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] "We were told that it was recreational and that it was not dangerous," Nicks recalled to Chris Isaak in 2009.The Chris Isaak Hour: Stevie Nicks 2009 | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU
Nicks and Buckingham briefly relocated to Aspen, Colorado. While there, Buckingham landed a guitar playing gig with the Everly Brothers, and toured with them while Nicks stayed behind. During this time, Nicks wrote "Rhiannon" after seeing the name in the novel Triad by Mary Leader, unaware at the time of the Mabinogi legend of Rhiannon. She also wrote "Landslide", inspired by the scenery of Aspen, and her inner turmoil over her decision to pursue music and her relationship with Buckingham:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/landslide.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on 'Landslide' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/stevie-nicks-landslide/|title=Stevie Nicks Tells the Story Behind 'Landslide' |publisher=performingsongwriter.com |accessdate=February 3, 2014[/tpl]
"I realized then that everything could tumble, and when you're in Colorado, and you're surrounded by these incredible mountains, you think avalanche. It meant the whole world could tumble around us and the landslide would bring you down."Stevie Nicks, In the Studio with Red Beard, May 1992 "Everybody seems to think that I wrote this song about them...and my dad, my dad did have something to do with it, but he absolutely thinks that he was the whole complete reason it was ever written. I guess it was about September 1974, I was home at my dad and mom's house in Phoenix, and my father said, 'You know, I think that maybe... you really put a lot of time into this singing career, maybe you should give this six more months, and if you want to go back to school, we'll pay for it...Lindsey and I went up to Aspen, and we went to somebody's incredible house, and they had a piano, and I had my guitar with me, and I went into their living room, looking out over the incredible, like, Aspen sky way, and I wrote Landslide...three months later, Mick Fleetwood called."Stevie Nicks, VH1 Storytellers, 1998

===1975-78: Fleetwood Mac and Rumours===

Nicks and Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac on January 1, 1975 after Keith Olsen played their track "Frozen Love" for drummer Mick Fleetwood, who had come to Sound City in California, in search of a studio to record Fleetwood Mac's next album. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work after guitarist Bob Welch's departure to pursue a solo career. Initially extending the offer only to Buckingham, Fleetwood later included Nicks in the offer when Buckingham insisted that he and Nicks were "a package deal."
In 1975, the band achieved success with the album Fleetwood Mac. Nicks' "Rhiannon", which appeared on the album, would eventually be voted one of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a theatrical intensity not present on the album's single. The song built to a climax in which Nicks' vocals were so impassioned that Mick Fleetwood declared, "her Rhiannon in those days was like an exorcism. "[tpl]cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks - Behind the Music|accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] Also included on the album was "Landslide", which would go on to achieve collected millionaire status with over three million airplays and spawn multiple cover versions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20031104_stevie_nicks_wins_in_a_landslide_at_bmi_country_awards_jeffrey |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards; Steele Named Songwriter of the Year|date=November 3, 2002|accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl]
Also in 1975, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop Nicks's unique onstage look, with costumes that featured flowing skirts, shawls and platform boots.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/latimes8.htm |title=Airy Godmother |work=LA Times |author=Booth Moore |date=October 23, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl]
Following the success of Fleetwood Mac, increasing tension between Nicks and Buckingham began to take its toll on their creativity, and Nicks ended the relationship.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio in Toronto |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/lindsey2.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Lindsey Buckingham |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] Fleetwood Mac began recording their follow-up album, Rumours, in early 1976 and continued until late in the year.

Among Nicks's contributions to Rumours was "Dreams", which became the band's only Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit single to date. Nicks had also written and recorded the song "Silver Springs", but it was ultimately not included on the album because of space limitations for studio albums on vinyl records, which were limited to 24  minutes per side. Instead, it was released as a B-side of the "Go Your Own Way" single, and would remain in some obscurity until it appeared on the four-disc Fleetwood Mac retrospective 25 Years – The Chain in 1992. The song, the rights to which are owned by Nicks' late mother Barbara, has always been very special to Nicks, and she was devastated when told about the omission after the decision had been made.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/offtherecord.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview – Off The Record |publisher=nicksfix.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl]
In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert for the Rumours tour, Nicks and Fleetwood, who was married to Jenny Boyd, secretly began an affair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1970s.html |title=Fleetwood Mac Timeline for the 1970s |publisher=fleetwoodmac-uk.com |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] The pair mutually decided to end the affair. "Never in a million years could you have told me that would happen," Nicks has stated. "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't."[tpl]cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index_vp.php?id=208&c=18 |title=UnCut Magazine – Five Go Mad|accessdate=Oct 14, 2012[/tpl] She has also stated that had the affair progressed, it "would have been the end of Fleetwood Mac".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart128.html |title=Fleetwood Mac – The Rumour Mill, Classic Rock, June 2003 |publisher=Google |date=February 15, 2004 |accessdate=January 9, 2011[/tpl] Soon after, in October 1978, Mick Fleetwood left his wife for Nicks' best friend Sara Recor.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_mojo_dec2003.htm |title=Take it to the Limit |work=Mojo |author=Phil Sutcliffe |date = December 2003|accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]
After the success of the Rumours album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Buckingham and Nicks, Tusk, in the spring of 1978. That year, Nicks sang back-up on virtually every track of Not Shy, recorded by musician Walter Egan, a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. One track, "Magnet & Steel", prominently featured Nicks on back-up vocals and became a hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978. Lindsey Buckingham also played guitar and provided backing vocals on some of the tracks recorded for that album.

===1978-82: Tusk, Bella Donna and Mirage===

By 1978, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs dating back to her Buckingham Nicks days that she had been unable to record and release with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks – Behind the Music |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] Nicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during Tusk sessions in 1979 and the Tusk world tour of 1979–80. Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded Modern Records to record and release Nicks's material. Nicks recorded the hit duets "Whenever I Call You Friend" with Kenny Loggins in 1978, and "Gold" with John Stewart in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac's Tusk was released on October 19, 1979. During 1981, Nicks toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and New Zealand band Split Enz as a guest.
Nicks first solo album, Bella Donna, was released on July 27, 1981 to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with four singles making the Billboard Hot 100, and Rolling Stone deeming her "The Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |title=Bella Donna |publisher=All Music |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl]
The day that Bella Donna reached #1 on the Billboard 200, Nicks' best friend Robin Anderson was diagnosed with leukemia. Robin gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. "I never got to enjoy Bella Donna at all because my friend was dying. Something went out that day; something left."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/robin.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Robin Snyder Anderson |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] Following Robin's death in 1982, Nicks married Robin's widower Kim Anderson, believing that her friend would want her to care for the baby. "We were all in such insane grief, just completely deranged," she told The Telegraph in 2007. The couple divorced eight months after the marriage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks- A Survivor's Story |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]
Bella Donna introduced Nicks' back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks' solo albums since then. In November 1981, Nicks embarked on the White Winged Dove tour, which she had to cut short to record the Mirage album with Fleetwood Mac. After the Mirage tour in 1982, Nicks prepared to record her second solo album.

===1983-86: Wild Heart and Rock a Little===

Nicks released her second solo album, The Wild Heart, on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached #5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer Sandy Stewart as co-writer and vocalist.
Nicks performed at the second US Festival at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, and later toured the US from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1983, performing "Stand Back" and "Nightbird".
Following the tour for The Wild Heart, Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled Mirror Mirror, Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rock A Little' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] Rock a Little, as it was re-titled, was released November 18, 1985 to commercial success, supported by three hit singles.
Nicks toured for Rock a Little in 1986. The tour ended on October 10, 1986.
The tour marked a turning point in Nicks' life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=September 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] "I said, 'What do you think about my nose?'," she recalled on The Chris Isaak Hour in 2009. "And he said, 'Well, I think the next time you do a hit of cocaine, you could drop dead." At the end of the Australian tour, Nicks checked herself into the Betty Ford Center for 30 days to overcome her cocaine addiction.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU|title=The Chris Isaak Hour: Stevie Nicks, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_dailynews_sep7_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABCNEWS.com |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7, 2001 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] Recalling the strong influence of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix on her music and life, she told a UK interviewer, "I saw how they went down, and a part of me wanted to go down with them...but then another part of me thought, I would be very sad if some 25-year-old lady rock and roll singer ten years from now said, 'I wish Stevie Nicks would have thought about it a little more.'

Later that year, on the advice of friends concerned that she might relapse, she visited a psychiatrist who prescribed the sedative Klonopin to help her remain free from cocaine.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Toronto Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]

===1987-90: Tango in the Night, The Other Side of the Mirror, and Behind the Mask===

In 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on Tango in the Night, which was released in April 1987.
Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist John McVie, a "physically ugly" confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham's decision to leave the band.Sykes, Graham. Rock Family Trees Transcript.
The band embarked on the Shake the Cage tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by Rick Vito and Billy Burnette. The tour was suspended during Nicks' bout with chronic fatigue syndrome and developing addiction to Klonopin, though it resumed in 1988. Tango in the Night met with commercial success and was followed in 1988 by Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits album in November 1988.
Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer Rupert Hine. The Other Side of the Mirror was released on May 11, 1989 to commercial success. Nicks became romantically involved with Hine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rooms.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rooms on Fire' |publisher=inherownwords.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl]
Nicks toured the US and Europe from August to November 1989, the only time she has toured Europe as a solo act. She has famously been quoted since as stating that she has "no memory of this tour" due to her increasing dependency on the tranquillizer Klonopin,[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=231&c=11 |publisher=People |date=January 19, 1998 |title=High Priestess |author=Steve Dougherty, Todd Gold[/tpl] prescribed in ever increasing amounts by a psychiatrist between 1987 and 1994, in an attempt to keep Nicks from regressing to her former abuse of cocaine.
In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on a new album, Behind the Mask, which was released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the US. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at #1 and was certified Platinum. The band went on a world tour to promote the album, on the last night of which Buckingham and Nicks reunited on stage to perform "Landslide".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart55.htm |title=Fleetwood Mac, Live at the Great Western Forum, Inglewood, California December 7th, 1990 |work=Rolling Stone |author=Steve Pond |date=February 7, 1991 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] After the tour concluded, Nicks left the group over a dispute with Mick Fleetwood, who would not allow her to release the 1977 track "Silver Springs" on her album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, because of his plans to release it on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1990s.html |title=Timeline 1990s |publisher=Go Your Own Way |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]

===1991-96: Timespace and Street Angel===

On the tenth anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks on September 3, 1991. Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, 25 Years – The Chain, which included "Silver Springs".
During the 1992 US presidential campaign, Bill Clinton used the Fleetwood Mac hit "Don't Stop" as his campaign theme song, and Nicks joined her bandmates to perform the song at Clinton's 1993 Inaugural Gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LXNUWWuzscMC&lpg=PA367&dq=clinton%20inauguration%20%22stevie%20nicks%22%20fat&pg=PA367#v=onepage&q=clinton%20inauguration%20%22stevie%20nicks%22%20fat&f=false |title=Milk it!: collected musings on the ... – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=January 9, 2011|isbn=0306812711|year=2003[/tpl] Nicks, who is [tpl]convert|5|ft|1|in|m[/tpl], had gained weight, peaking at 175 lb (79.4 kg). "Klonopin was worse than the cocaine," she has said. "I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn't write, and I had gained so much weight."
In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. "I'm one of those people who doesn't injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn't had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin," she said, realising that she needed help, and endured a painful 47-day detox in a hospital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks - Goes her own way |work=US Weekly |publisher=Nicksfix.Com |date=June 11–18, 2001 |accessdate=October 5, 2011[/tpl] "I thought I was going to die...I had a little picture of my niece on the wall and I kept saying to her, 'I'm so sorry I'm not going to be there for you.

Following her successful detox in May 1994, Nicks used material written mostly in previous years to record a solo album in 1992 and 1993 entitled Street Angel. She has expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of production work took place during her second stint in rehab, meaning she had little to no say over the final product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |title=Nicksfix.Com |publisher=Nicksfix.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl]
Released on May 23, 1994, Street Angel was poorly received. Despite praise from critics and fans for her vocals on the three-month Street Angel tour, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album itself. Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, she vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she slimmed down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nicksfix.com/mccalls1.htm |title=Nicksfix.Com |publisher=Nicksfix.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl]
In 1995, Nicks was reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet "Twisted" to the Twister movie soundtrack, while in 1996 the Sheryl Crow penned "Somebody Stand by Me" featured on the Boys on the Side soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit Party of Five.

===1997-98: The Dance===

In 1996 Lindsey Buckingham, working on a planned solo album, enlisted the help of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, which eventually led to a reunion of the entire band. A newly invigorated and slimmed down Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac for The Dance, a highly successful 1997 tour that coincided with the 20th anniversary of the release of Rumours. Prior to the tour, Nicks started work with a voice coach, to lend her voice more control and protect it from the stress of lengthy touring schedules. She also went on a diet and started jogging to lose weight.
The live CD release, The Dance, was released to commercial and critical acclaim, earning the group several Grammy nominations, including their live performance of Nicks' "Silver Springs".[tpl]cite web|url=http://rockalittle.com/silversp.htm |title=Silver Springs |publisher=Rock a Little |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl]
In 1998, she joined the group for its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That same year, Nicks won the Outstanding Contribution at the BRIT Awards.
She put work on a new solo album on hold when she was approached by Warner Music to release a solo career-spanning box set, to finish her contract with Atlantic Records in the US. After the culmination of the Fleetwood Mac reunion tour, Nicks settled down in Los Angeles and Phoenix with close friends and colleagues to devise a track list for this three-disc collection.

===1998–2001: Enchanted and Trouble in Shangri-La===

The box set Enchanted was released to acclaim on April 28, 1998 with liner notes from Nicks, as well as exclusive rare photographs, and pages from her journals. Nicks supported the box set with a successful US tour. In 1998, Nicks contributed to the Practical Magic soundtrack and performed in Don Henley's benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project.
Nicks had begun writing actively for Trouble in Shangri-La in 1994 and 1995 as she came out of her Klonopin dependency. According to her, friend and former musical partner Tom Petty was responsible for convincing her to write music again when he rebuffed her request that he write a song with her. She resumed recording songs for the Trouble in Shangri-La album with Sheryl Crow, who produced and performed on several tracks. When a scheduling conflict forced Crow to drop out of the project, Nicks first approached R&B producer Dallas Austin, but these sessions have never surfaced. Nicks finally called on John Shanks to produce the remainder of the album, with additional contributions from David Kahne, Rick Nowels, Pierre Marchand, and Jeff Trott. Artists Natalie Maines, Sarah McLachlan, and Macy Gray contributed to some of the tracks.
Released May 1, 2001, Trouble in Shangri-La restored Nicks's solo career to critical and commercial success. "Planets of the Universe" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and Nicks was named VH1's "Artist of the Month" for May 2001. Nicks was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People, was featured in a well-received Behind the Music episode, and performed an episode of the VH1 Storytellers Concert Program. Nicks made several television appearances in support of the album and performed at the 2001 Radio Music Awards.
Nicks supported the album with a successful tour, although some shows were canceled or postponed because of her bout with acute bronchitis. Shows were also canceled because of the September 11 attacks in the U.S.

===2001-07: Say You Will and hiatus===

In 2001, Fleetwood Mac began work on a new studio album. After the end of her solo tour, Nicks convened with the other members of the band for recording during 2002.
Say You Will was released in April 2003 and met with commercial success but mixed reviews. Nicks joined the group to support the album with a world tour lasting until September 2004.
She has subsequently stated in several interviews that she was not happy with the album or the successful world tour that followed, citing production disputes with Buckingham as a core factor, as well as the absence of fellow female band member Christine McVie.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=A magical life – Music – Entertainment |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2011 |first=Guy |last=Blackman[/tpl] A documentary of the making of the album, Destiny Rules, was released on DVD in 2004 and chronicles the sometimes turbulent relationships between band members, especially Buckingham and Nicks, during that time in the studio.
After a few months' respite from the Say You Will tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and then did a 10-show tour with Don Henley. During the summer of 2005, Nicks continued the tour solo with pop singer Vanessa Carlton as the opening act, playing over 20 dates nationwide.

===2007-09: Crystal Visions and Soundstage Sessions===

On March 27, 2007, Reprise Records released Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks in the US. The album debuted at #21 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll". There are two versions of this album, one with just the audio CD and the deluxe version which includes a DVD featuring all of Nicks's music videos with audio commentary from Nicks, as well as rare footage from the Bella Donna recording sessions.
A tour with Chris Isaak, opening in Concord, California on May 17, 2007 supported the release.
Reprise Records initially released two radio only promos, the live version of "Landslide" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and "Rock and Roll". Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released "Stand Back" (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. "Stand Back", which peaked at #5 on the pop singles chart in 1983, reached #2 on the Billboard Club chart. Nicks previously reached #1 on this chart, with "Planets of the Universe" (from Trouble in Shangri-La) in 2001. The remix single of "Stand Back" debuted on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007 at #10, peaking at #4 the following week. It also debuted on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at #3, later peaking at #1.
On March 31, 2009, Stevie released the album, The Soundstage Sessions, via Reprise Records. The album debuted at#47 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The first single from the album was "Crash Into Me" and was released as a digital download, along with "Landslide" (orchestra version) as a B-side, on March 17, 2009.

===2010-13: In Your Dreams===

After completing the Unleashed Tour with Fleetwood Mac, Stevie began work on her first solo album in a decade with David A. Stewart (musician and record producer, best known for his work with Eurythmics), who announced this via his Twitter in February 2010. During 2010, Stewart used Twitter to confirm various facts about the album; in one of the tweets, Stewart stated that he, Nicks, Waddy Wachtel, Mike Campbell (of the Heartbreakers), Mike Rowe, and Steve Ferrone were all working on the album, and that Mick Fleetwood has also contributed drums to at least one track. Waddy Wachtel has been Nicks's lead guitarist for most of her solo career, featuring prominently on all of her albums to date. It was also later confirmed that Lindsey Buckingham would appear on the track "Soldiers Angel".
Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 ("it's not really a tour, " she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer.
On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Stevie's upcoming album In Your Dreams would be released on May 3, and the lead single, "Secret Love", would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who pre-ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote "Secret Love" in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, Rumours. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on In Your Dreams. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks' goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Stevie Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks' 62 year-old self. On the US Billboard Charts, "Secret Love" was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles Chart, peaking at #20, and at #25 on the Triple A Singles Chart. Another song on the album "For What It's Worth" features Nicks' niece in the video.  This song was inspired by a good friend, as well as a former band member, who accompanied Nicks on her first tour after leaving rehab at the Betty Ford Center.  This was the first tour that Nicks used a bus, usually she used a plane.  Nick's said she felt frightened and extremely fragile at that time, and that this man helped her get through one of the most difficult periods of her life. In her documentary, "In Your Dreams" she explain why she felt that this man actually saved her life.[tpl]cite web|title=Stevie Nicks Reveals Inspiration Behind For What It's Worth|url=http://wcbsfm.cbslocal.com/2011/07/07/stevie-nicks-reveals-the-inspiration-behind-new-single-for-what-its-worth/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] The song reached #25 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in September 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/467382/chart-highlights-rodney-atkins-takes-back-road-to-no-1-on-country |title=Chart Highlights: Rodney Atkins Takes 'Back Road' To No. 1 On Country Songs |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]
Stevie promoted the album with appearances on such television shows as: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The X Factor, The Talk, Good Morning America, The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Dancing with the Stars and more.
In Your Dreams received overwhelmingly positive reviews, rivaling that of Stevie's 1981 debut. Rolling Stone commented "It's not just her first album in 10 years, it's her finest collection of songs since the Eighties", which mirrored the reception from most other critics and music industry members. The album debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200 giving Nicks her fifth top ten album on that chart,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471634/beastie-boys-score-no-2-debut-on-billboard-200-adele-holds-at-no-1 |title=Beastie Boys Score No. 2 Debut on Billboard 200, Adele Holds at No. 1 |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] with 52,000 copies sold in the first week. Elsewhere, the album has made numerous Top 50 debuts, including #24 on the Australian ARIA Chart and #22 in Canada.
The same day that Nicks' new album was released, Fox Network broadcast the Glee episode (Season 2, Episode 19) "Rumours" that featured six songs from Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, including Nicks' song "Dreams" (the band's only #1 song on the US charts).[tpl]cite web|last=Semigran|first=Aly|title=Fleetwood Mac Teach 'Glee' Kids A Lesson On Rumours|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663211/glee-fleetwood-mac-rumours.jhtml|publisher=MTV.com|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2011[/tpl] The show sparked renewed interest in the band and its most commercially successful album, and Rumours re-entered the Billboard 200 chart at #11, the same week that In Your Dreams debuted at #6.

===2014: Fleetwood Mac reunion and continued solo ventures===

In 2014, Nicks appeared in an episode of the third season of television series American Horror Story titled Coven.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/stevie-nicks-spills-american-horror-story-secrets-20131203|title=Stevie Nicks Talks 'American Horror Story'|publisher=RollingStone.Com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl] She played a fictional version of herself, portraying a "white witch" with supernatural powers in two episodes. On the show, she performed the songs "Rhiannon", "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?", and "Seven Wonders". "I said, 'That's perfect,'" she told Us Magazine[tpl]cite web|last=Drew |first=Ian |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/stevie-nicks-talks-filming-american-horror-story-coven-katy-perry-and-john-mayer-dating-don-henley-and-more-201481 |title=Stevie Nicks Talks 'American Horror Story' |publisher=Usmagazine.com |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] in response to the show's music request. "Because that's exactly how I like to affect people. I want people to put my songs on because they are unhappy and need a boost to dance around their apartment a little and feel good. That's why I write. Of course you can use my music. Take it!'"
On April 29, 2014, Dave Stewart posted a photo to his Instagram and Facebook, showing Nicks in a recording studio complete with rabbit ears and the caption, "Been here in Nashville since Easter Sunday rocking out with @stevienicks." Though he wouldn't elaborate, the following day, April 30, 2014, he posted: "Who thinks there should be a Design Stevie Nicks album Cover Contest hosted by Talenthouse? Me for a start!" Although no official announcement has been made by Nicks, her record label, or her management, a new solo album is expected in 2014 or 2015. Nicks' Fleetwood Mac bandmate, Christine McVie, has also been spotted several times in Nashville since Nicks and Stewart arrived but it is not known if her presence is merely for support or she is having an active role in Nicks' recording sessions. 
Liz Rosenberg Media, Nicks' longtime publicity team, is expected to issue a statement to the press regarding the new album soon.

==Artistry==

Stevie Nicks is known for her mystical image, her billowing chiffon skirts, shawls, layers of lace and long blonde hair. Margi Kent, a designer from California, has worked with Nicks since the 1970s to perfect her style. Perhaps the most famous part of Nicks's wardrobe is her platform boots. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Nicks has worn suede platform boots in various colors, usually black, cream, tan or maroon in almost all of her performances since 1975. Standing at [tpl]convert|5|ft|1|in[/tpl], Nicks has stated she felt a little ridiculous standing next to Mick Fleetwood, who is [tpl]convert|6|ft| 6|in[/tpl].Interview by Liz Derringer, High Times magazine – March 1982. For this reason she developed a penchant for [tpl]convert|6|in|cm|adj=on[/tpl] platform boots. "Even when platforms went completely out of style, I kept wearing them because I didn't want to go back to being [tpl]convert|5|ft|3|in|m[/tpl] in heels", she told Allure magazine in 1995."How I Got That Look", Allure magazine, April 1995 Interview. Over the years, Nicks has developed a style which she calls her "uniform",Transcribed by Jane Fijal, "Spotlight on Stevie Nicks", Aired on 96.1 WSRS Worcester, Massachusetts  on August 5, 2001. which is best exemplified by the outfit worn on the cover of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. Another trademark of Nicks's is a Dickens-style gentleman's formal top hat, which she began wearing in the late 1970s. During the early 1980s she wore Renaissance poets' velvet berets with plume feathers (as shown in the vintage photo used on the cover of her March 2007 CD release Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she wore fashionable hats on stage, and she often still wears a black top hat adorned with giant plumes.
Many of Nicks's shawls and capes also have an association with her songs in her live performances, many becoming as signature in live performances. These include a red/crimson shawl for "Sara", white for "Edge of Seventeen", gold for "Gold Dust Woman" and black with round gold circles for "Stand Back". One of her trademarks is twirling across the stage with shawls flying during the interlude of her classic songs, notably "Stand Back" and "Gypsy".
Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like Grace Slick and Janis Joplin. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for with her first band "Fritz") shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a Gibson Girl hairstyle and big boots and Nicks knew she wanted something similar. She took the look and made it her own.On someone who influenced her look, Glamour (magazine), December 1981. The crescent moon pendant is arguably the most iconic of all Nicks's jewelry – the original was bought while she was in England on tour with Fleetwood Mac during the Tusk era. Nicks then had her personal jeweler, Henri David of Philadelphia, make replicas of the moon pendant which she gave to her friends. In recent years, celebrity friends such as Bette Midler and ice-skating star Tai Babilonia have been photographed wearing their "Stevie moons".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Over the years she has decorated her microphone stand with roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal beads, scarves and small stuffed toys.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.16.07/style-0720.html |title= Stevie Nicks: Style Icon |publisher=metroactive.com |author=Joseph Rosenfeld |date= May 16–22, 2007 |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071005024651/http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.16.07/style-0720.html |archivedate = October 5, 2007[/tpl]
When asked about the tambourine, Nicks replied that she began playing the instrument when she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, feeling the need to do something onstage during songs that featured Buckingham or McVie.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Like her microphone, her tambourine usually features scarves and/or streamers. The tambourine is sometimes silenced using tape. She has spoken of being embarrassed about handing President Bill Clinton a silenced tambourine when he joined Fleetwood Mac on stage.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Other interests==

===Philanthropy===

Nicks has started a charity foundation entitled "Stevie Nicks' Band of Soldiers" which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.Andrew Gumbel. Stevie Nicks: Rock follies. The Independent 06 Oct. 2007
In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, D. C. While visiting wounded service men and women, Nicks became determined to find an object she could leave with each soldier that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and playlists which she would hand select, and autograph them:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |title=Stevie's Journal Entries Regarding Visits to the Injured Troops |publisher=The Nicks Fix |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]

===Rumors of witchcraft===

A rumor that has trailed Nicks through the years is that she is a witch and is heavily involved in Wicca. While she admits to having a high regard for the mythic and gothic, she denies any solitary dedication to any one religion, including Wicca. She has spoken about this erroneous image in numerous interviews.See, e.g., [tpl]cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html |title= A magical life |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |author=Guy Blackman |date= February 12, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl]; Yahoo! interview, April 28, 1998 ("I have no idea what precipitated those rumors... I am not a witch. Get a life!"). Nicks's music is copyrighted under the name Welsh Witch Music, a reference to her song "Rhiannon", which she introduced as "a song about a Welsh witch" in concerts between 1975 and 1978.  Nicks has stated: "I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time because a lot of people scared me. And that's really unfair to me, I think, for people - other people - to conjure up their ideas of what I am or what I believe in."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tv.com/people/stevie-nicks/|title= stevie-nicks|date= |website= TV.com|publisher= |accessdate=25 October 2013[/tpl]

She has participated in duets or provided guest vocals for several of their albums, as have they, on her albums.
The Dixie Chicks covered her 1975 classic "Landslide", which became a Top 10 hit (#1 on the Adult Contemporary chart) and a No.1 Hit on the Country Chart. This cover also earned her a BMI Songwriters Award in 2003 when it won "Song of the Year" (the award is given to the songwriter of the track, regardless of the performer). According to BMI, "Landslide" also earned Nicks the 35th Robert J. Burton Award as "Most Performed Country Song of the Year". This distinction is given to the song tallying the most feature US broadcast performances during the eligibility period. Included on the Dixie Chicks' platinum Monument album Home, "Landslide" was a Country, Adult Top 40, Hot 100 and AC Billboard charts smash.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233884 |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a ‘Landslide’ at BMI Country Awards |publisher=Broadcast Music Incorporated |date=November 3, 2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] Alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins made an acoustic cover of the song that was featured on their 1994 B-side collection Pisces Iscariot. The cover was also a hit and made it to the top three on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US that year.
Other successful covers have included The Corrs' "Dreams" and Courtney Love's band Hole with "Gold Dust Woman". "Edge Of Seventeen" was sampled on Destiny's Child's 2001 No.1 single "Bootylicious". Nicks appeared in the video for "Bootylicious" and in an episode of MTV's Making The Video that featured it, in which she expressed her admiration for both the song and the group. Lindsay Lohan covered "Edge of Seventeen" on her 2005 album, A Little More Personal. Deep Dish fulfilled their "Dreams" of working with Nicks in 2005 when Nicks offered to re-record vocals on a remix of her No. 1 penned song, "Dreams".
