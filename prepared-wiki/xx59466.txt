[[Beaches of Hong Kong]]

CATEGORIES: Places in Hong Kong, Beaches of Hong Kong, Hong Kong geography-related lists

Hong Kong has a long coastline that is full of twists and turns with many bays and beaches. Many of them are well sheltered by mountains nearby, as Hong Kong is a mountainous place. As a result, large waves seldom appear at the bays, making them suitable for swimming.
However, with the increasing development and urbanisation of Hong Kong, water quality has worsened resulting in the closure of several beaches previously suitable for swimming.  These include Approach Beach, Ting Kau Beach, Anglers' Beach, Gemini Beaches, Hoi Mei Wan Beach, Casam Beach and Lido Beach in Tsuen Wan. In 2011, Lido Beach, Casam Beach, Approach Beach and Hoi Mei Wan Beach were reopened following an improvement in water quality."Four beaches in Tsuen Wan to reopen with improved water quality", Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Press Release, June 13, 2011
About half of the beaches suitable for swimming in Hong Kong are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and are officially referred to as gazetted beaches. A number of other beaches are privately owned or not gazetted, but are nonetheless publicly accessible.

==Beaches managed by the LCSD==

As of November 2013, a total of forty-one beaches in Hong Kong are managed by the LCSD. Twelve of them are located on Hong Kong Island, and the remaining 29 are located across the New Territories, including the Outlying Islands. Some are not open for swimming: see here for update.

Note: some of these beaches are difficult to reach.  Because they are not maintained by the government, some may be unclean at times.  As no lifeguards are on duty, swimmers are recommended to exercise caution.

==Grading system of beaches==

Gazetted beaches in Hong Kong are classified into four grades ( Grades 1 – 4 ) according to the level of E. coli in the water of the beaches. This is done by the Environmental Protection Department. Every week, water samples of each beach are collected for analysis to find out their bacterial level.
Grade 1 means that the water qualities of the beaches are good. The amount of E. coli is no more than 24 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also no related case of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses has been reported by swimmers who have swum at these beaches.
Grade 2 means that the water qualities of the beaches are fair. The amount of E. coli is about 25 – 180 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is no more than 10 cases per 1000 swimmers.
Grade 3 means that the water qualities of the beaches are poor. The amount of E. coli is about 181 – 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is about 11 – 15 cases per 1000 swimmers.
Grade 4 means that the water quality is very poor. The amount of E. coli is greater than 610 counts per 100 mL of beach water. Also the rate of skin and gastrointestinal illnesses is greater than 15 cases per 1000 swimmers. As a result, swimmers are advised not to swim at Grade 4 beaches.
