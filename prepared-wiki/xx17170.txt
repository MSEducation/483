 Seal of the National Ice Center
The National Ice Center is a tri-agency operational center whose mission is to provide world-wide navigational ice analyses for the armed forces of the United States, allied nations, and U.S. government agencies.
It is represented by the United States Navy (Department of Defense); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Department of Commerce); and the United States Coast Guard (Department of Homeland Security). The National Ice Center is a subordinate command of the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). Originally known as the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center, which was established on December 15, 1976 in a memorandum of agreement between the U.S. Navy and NOAA, the National Ice Center was formed in 1995 when the U.S. Coast Guard became a partner. The National Ice Center produces global sea ice charts and various cryospheric GIS products.  They also name and track Antarctic icebergs if greater than [tpl]convert|10|nmi|km|-1[/tpl] on its longest axis.
