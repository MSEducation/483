Eugene Luther Gore Vidal ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|ɔr|_|v|ɨ|ˈ|d|ɑː|l[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/nls/other/sayhow/uvwx.html#v |title=NLS Other Writings |publisher=Loc.gov |date=February 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |quote=Vidal, Gore (və-DÄL)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/biographies/index.cfm?author_number=497 |title=Gore Vidal Biography |publisher=BookBrowse |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl] born Eugene Louis Vidal, October 3, 1925 – July 31, 2012) was an American writer known for his essays, novels, screenplays, and Broadway plays. As a well-known public intellectual, he was known for his patrician manner and witty aphorisms. Vidal's grandfather was the U.S. Senator Thomas Gore of Oklahoma.
A lifelong Democrat, Gore ran for political office twice and was a seasoned political commentator. As well known for his essays as his novels, Vidal wrote for The Nation, New Statesman, the New York Review of Books and Esquire. Vidal's major subject was America, and through his essays and media appearances he was a longtime critic of American foreign policy. He developed this into a portrayal of the United States as a decaying empire from the 1980s onwards. He was also known for well-publicized spats with such figures as Norman Mailer, William F. Buckley, Jr. and Truman Capote.
His most widely regarded social novel was Myra Breckinridge; his best known historical novels included  Julian,  Burr, and Lincoln. His third novel, The City and the Pillar (1948), outraged conservative critics as one of the first major American novels to feature unambiguous homosexuality. Vidal rejected the terms of "homosexual" and "heterosexual" as inherently false, claiming that the vast majority of individuals had the potential to be pansexual. His screenwriting credits include the epic historical drama Ben-Hur (1959), which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1959.

==Early life==

Vidal was born Eugene Louis Vidal in West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895–1969) and Nina Gore (1903–1978).Vidal, Gore, "West Point and the Third Loyalty[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]", The New York Review of Books, Volume 20, Number 16, October 18, 1973. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, "who could not remember for certain whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther." As Vidal explained in his memoir Palimpsest (Deutsch, 1995), "... my birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal, Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening 1939; then at fourteen I got rid of the first two names."Gore Vidal, Palimpsest (Deutsch, 1995), page 401
Vidal was born in the Cadet Hospital of the United States Military Academy (West Point), where his father, a first lieutenant, was the first aeronautics instructor. According to Conversations with Gore Vidal, the future writer was not baptised until January 1939, at age 13, by the headmaster of St. Albans, where Vidal was attending preparatory school. The ceremony took place so Vidal "could be confirmed the Episcopal faith at the Washington Cathedral in February 1939 as Eugene Luther Gore Vidal."Gore Vidal, Richard Peabody, and Lucinda Ebersole, Conversations with Gore Vidal, (University Press of Mississippi, 2005), page xix He later stated that although Gore was added to his names at the time of the baptism, "I wasn't named for him, although he had a great influence on my life."Gore Vidal, Richard Peabody, and Lucinda Ebersole, Conversations with Gore Vidal, (University Press of Mississippi, 2005), page 4 In 1941,Gore Vidal, Richard Peabody, and Lucinda Ebersole, Conversations with Gore Vidal, (University Press of Mississippi, 2005), page xx Vidal dropped both of his first two names, saying that he "wanted a sharp, distinctive name, appropriate for an aspiring author or national political leader. 'I wasn't going to write as Gene since there was already one. I didn't want to use the Jr.'"
Vidal's father served as director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Air Commerce (1933–1937) in the Roosevelt administration,"Aeronatics: $8,073.61", Time, September 28, 1931 was one of the first Army Air Corps pilots and, according to biographer Susan Butler, was the great love of Amelia Earhart's life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/95192-1/Susan+Butler.aspx |title=Booknotes |publisher=Booknotes |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2011[/tpl] In the 1920s and 1930s, he was a co-founder of three American airlines: the Ludington Line, which merged with others and became Eastern Airlines, Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT), which became TWA), and Northeast Airlines, which he founded with Earhart, as well as the Boston and Maine Railroad. The elder Vidal had also been a West Point football quarterback, coach, and captain and an all-American basketball player. He also participated in the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics (seventh in the decathlon; U.S. pentathlon team coach).[tpl]cite news |title=Eugene L.

Vidal had four half-siblings from his parents' later marriages (Vance Vidal, Valerie Vidal, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss) and four stepbrothers from his mother's third marriage to Army Air Forces Major General Robert Olds, who died in 1943, ten months after marrying Vidal's mother.[tpl]cite news |title=Maj.

Vidal was raised in Washington, D.C., where he attended Sidwell Friends School and then St. Albans School. Since Senator Gore was blind, his grandson read aloud to him and was often his guide. The senator's isolationism contributed a major principle of his grandson's political philosophy, which is critical of foreign and domestic policies shaped by American imperialism.Rutten, Tim, "'The Selected Essays of Gore Vidal'", Los Angeles Times, June 18, 2008. Gore attended St. Albans in 1939, but left to study in France. He returned following the outbreak of World War II and studied at the Los Alamos Ranch School in 1940, later transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.Gore Vidal: a critical companion.

==Writing career==

===Fiction===

Vidal, whom a Newsweek critic called "the best all-around American man of letters since Edmund Wilson,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clairviewbooks.com/pages/perpetual.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080207072736/http://www.clairviewbooks.com/pages/perpetual.html |archivedate=February 7, 2008 |title=Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] began his writing career in 1946, aged twenty-one, with the publication of the military novel Williwaw, based upon his Alaskan Harbor Detachment duty. The novel was about World War II and proved a success for Vidal.Vidal, Gore. The City and the Pillar and Seven Early Stories (NY: Random House), xiii Published two years later in 1948, The City and the Pillar caused a furor for its dispassionate presentation of homosexuality. The novel was dedicated to "J.T." Decades later, after a magazine published rumors about J.T.'s identity, Vidal confirmed they were the initials of his alleged St. Albans-era love, James "Jimmy" Trimble III, killed in the Battle of Iwo Jima on March 1, 1945;Roberts, James "The Legacy of Jimmy Trimble", ESPN, March 14, 2002. Vidal later said that Trimble was the only person he had ever loved.Chalmers, Robert, "Gore Vidal: Literary feuds, his 'vicious' mother and rumours of a secret love child", The Independent, May 25, 2008.
According to Vidal, Orville Prescott, the book critic for the New York Times, found The City and the Pillar so objectionable that he refused to review or allow the Times to review Vidal's next five books.Gore Vidal, Point to Point Navigation (New York: Doubleday, 2006), 245 In response, Vidal wrote several mystery novels in the early 1950s under the pseudonym Edgar Box. Featuring public relations man Peter Cutler Sargeant II,Boston Globe: Diane White, "Murder, he wrote, before becoming a man of letters," March 25, 2011[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl], Retrieved July 11, 2011 their success financed Vidal for more than a decade.Gore Vidal, "Introduction to Death in the Fifth Position", in Edgar Box, Death in the Fifth Position (Vintage, 2011), 5–6
He wrote plays, films, and television series. Two plays, The Best Man (1960) and Visit to a Small Planet (1955), were both Broadway and film successes. Two early television plays were A Sense of Justice (1955) and Honor.[tpl]cite web|title=Philco Television Playhouse: A Sense of Justice (TV)|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=Goodyear+Television+Playhouse&p=1&item=T:40573|work=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl]
In the 1960s, Vidal wrote three novels. The first, Julian (1964) dealt with the apostate Roman emperor, while the second, Washington, D.C. (1967) focused on a political family during the Franklin D. Roosevelt era. The third was the satirical transsexual comedy Myra Breckinridge (1968), a variation on Vidal's familiar themes of sex, gender, and popular culture. In the novel, Vidal showcased his love of the American films of the '30s and '40s, and he resurrected interest in the careers of the forgotten players of the time including, for example, that of the late Richard Cromwell, who, he wrote, "was so satisfyingly tortured in The Lives of a Bengal Lancer."
After the staging of the plays Weekend (1968) and An Evening With Richard Nixon (1972), and the publication of the novel Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir (1970), Vidal focused on essays and two distinct themes in his fiction. The first strain comprises novels dealing with American history, specifically with the nature of national politics.[tpl]cite news | author=John Leonard | url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-sisters.html | title=Not Enough Blood, Not Enough Gore | work=The New York Times | date=July 7, 1970 | accessdate=October 30, 2008[/tpl] Critic Harold Bloom wrote, "Vidal's imagination of American politics ... is so powerful as to compel awe." Titles in this series, the Narratives of Empire, include Burr (1973), 1876 (1976), Lincoln (1984), Empire (1987), Hollywood (1990), The Golden Age (2000). Another title devoted to the ancient world, Creation, appeared in 1981 and then in expanded form in 2002.
The second strain consists of the comedic "satirical inventions": Myron (1974, a sequel to Myra Breckinridge), Kalki (1978), Duluth (1983), Live from Golgotha: The Gospel according to Gore Vidal (1992), and The Smithsonian Institution (1998).

===Screenplays===

In 1956, Vidal was hired as a contract screenwriter for Metro Goldwyn Mayer. In 1959, director William Wyler needed script doctors to re-write the script for Ben-Hur, originally written by Karl Tunberg. Vidal collaborated with Christopher Fry, reworking the screenplay on condition that MGM release him from the last two years of his contract. Producer Sam Zimbalist's death complicated the screenwriting credit. The Screen Writers Guild resolved the matter by listing Tunberg as sole screenwriter, denying credit to both Vidal and Fry. This decision was based on the WGA screenwriting credit system, which favors original authors. Vidal later claimed in the documentary film The Celluloid Closet that to explain the animosity between Ben-Hur and Messala, he had inserted a gay subtext suggesting that the two had had a prior relationship, but that actor Charlton Heston was oblivious.[tpl]cite news|title=Gore Vidal, aloof in art and in life|author=Ned Rorem|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|date=December 12, 1999|page=18S[/tpl] Heston denied that Vidal contributed significantly to the script.[tpl]cite news|title= A Commanding Presence: Actor Charlton Heston sets his epic career in stone—or at least on paper|author=Mick LaSalle|publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 2, 1995|page=E1[/tpl] Vidal accused Heston of being a compulsive liar and a bad actor.
Two plays, The Best Man (1960) and Visit to a Small Planet (1955), were both Broadway and film successes.
Vidal occasionally returned to writing for film and television, including the television movie Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid with Val Kilmer and the mini-series Lincoln.
He also wrote the original draft for the controversial film Caligula, but later had his name removed when director Tinto Brass and actor Malcolm McDowell rewrote the script, changing the tone and themes significantly. The producers later made an attempt to salvage some of Vidal's vision in the film's post-production."Show Business: Will the Real Caligula Stand Up?", Time, January 3, 1977.

===Essays and memoirs===

Vidal is — at least in the United States — respected more for his essays than his novels.[tpl]cite news |first=Deborah |last=Solomon |title=Literary Lion |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15wwln-Q4-t.html?ref=magazine |work= The New York Times Magazine  |date=June 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2008 [/tpl] Even an occasionally hostile critic like Martin Amis admitted, "Essays are what he is good at ... he is learned, funny and exceptionally clear-sighted.  Even his blind spots are illuminating."
For six decades, Gore Vidal applied himself to a wide variety of sociopolitical, sexual, historical and literary themes.  In 1987, Vidal wrote the essays titled Armageddon?, exploring the intricacies of power in contemporary America.  He pilloried the incumbent president Ronald Reagan as a "triumph of the embalmer's art."  In 1993, he won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for the collection United States: Essays 1952–1992.[ref]
"National Book Awards – 1993". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-12.  (With acceptance speech by Vidal, read by Harry Evans.)[/ref]
According to the citation, "Whatever his subject, he addresses it with an artist's resonant appreciation, a scholar's conscience and the persuasive powers of a great essayist."[tpl]cite web|title=United States|url=http://www.amazon.com/United-States-Gore-Vidal/dp/product-description/0767908066|work=amazon.com|accessdate=27 November 2013[/tpl]
A subsequent collection of essays, published in 2000, is The Last Empire. He subsequently published such self-described "pamphlets" as Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta, and Imperial America, critiques of American expansionism, the military-industrial complex, the national security state and the George W. Bush administration.  Vidal also wrote a historical essay about the U.S.'s founding fathers, Inventing a Nation.  In 1995, he published a memoir Palimpsest, and in 2006 its follow-up volume, Point to Point Navigation.  Earlier that year, Vidal also published Clouds and Eclipses: The Collected Short Stories.
Because of his matter-of-fact treatment of same-sex relations in such books as The City and The Pillar, Vidal is often seen as an early champion of sexual liberation.Décoration de l’écrivain Gore Vidal. In the September 1969 edition of Esquire, for example, Vidal wrote: [tpl]quote|We are all bisexual to begin with. That is a fact of our condition. And we are all responsive to sexual stimuli from our own as well as from the opposite sex. Certain societies at certain times, usually in the interest of maintaining the baby supply, have discouraged homosexuality. Other societies, particularly militaristic ones, have exalted it. But regardless of tribal taboos, homosexuality is a constant fact of the human condition and it is not a sickness, not a sin, not a crime ... despite the best efforts of our puritan tribe to make it all three. Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word 'natural,' not normal.[tpl]cite news|author=Gore Vidal|title=A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley Jr.|publisher=Esquire|date=September 1969|page=140[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1995, Jay Parini was appointed as Vidal's literary executor.
In 2009, he won the annual Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation, which called him a "prominent social critic on politics, history, literature and culture."[ref]

==Acting appearances and popular culture==

In the 1960s, Vidal moved to Italy; he gave a cameo appearance in Federico Fellini's film Roma.  In 1992, Vidal appeared in the film Bob Roberts (starring Tim Robbins) and appeared in other films, notably Gattaca, With Honors, and Igby Goes Down, which was directed by his nephew Burr Steers.  In 2005 he appeared as himself in artist, Francesco Vezzoli's "Trailer for the Remake of Gore Vidal's Caligula" piece of video art, which was included in the 2005 Venice Biennale and is in the permanent collection of the Guggenheim Museum.[tpl]cite web | title = Collection Online, Francesco Vezzoli.

Vidal voiced himself on both The Simpsons and Family Guy and appeared on the Da Ali G Show, where Ali G mistakes him for Vidal Sassoon. He provided the narrative for the Royal National Theatre's production of Brecht's Mother Courage in the autumn of 2009.
Vidal was portrayed as a child in Amelia (2009) by Canadian actor William Cuddy, and as a young adult in Infamous (2006), the story of Truman Capote, by American actor Michael Panes.
Comedian Robin Williams depicted him as a drunk trying to push Thunderbird wine in a commercial on his first stand-up album, Reality...What a Concept.  The weekly American sketch comedy television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-in did a recurring theme covertly featuring his personality by Lily Tomlin as Ernestine the Telephone Operator, such as one titled: "Mr. Veedul, this is the Phone Company calling! (snort! snort!)" (but other citations are spelled as; "Veedle").StarNewsOnline.com (blog) - On “Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In,”  [http://books.blogs.starnewsonline.com/16317/gore-vidal-rip/ Lily Tomlin as Ernestine the telephone operator would often call “Mr. Veedle”Ernestine the Operator - TV Acres www.tvacres.com  - Lily Tomlin as Ernestine the Telephone Operator - ...a conversation with writer Gore Vidal as Ernestine says "Mr. Veedle, you owe us ..."

==Political views and activities==

Besides his politician grandfather, Vidal had other connections with the Democratic Party: his mother, Nina, married Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr., who later was stepfather of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.

In 1960, Gore Vidal was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Congress, losing an election in New York's 29th congressional district, a traditionally Republican district on the Hudson River, encompassing all of Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Schoharie, and Ulster Counties to J. Ernest Wharton, by a margin of 57% to 43%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1960election.pdf |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 8, 1960|publisher= Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives|year=1960 |page=31, item #29|accessdate=August 4, 2012[/tpl] Campaigning with a slogan of "You'll get more with Gore", he received the most votes any Democrat in 50 years received in that district.

Despite this, Vidal said "I think of myself as a conservative."Real Time With Bill Maher, Season 7, Episode 149, April 10, 2009 Vidal had a protective, almost proprietary attitude toward his native land and its politics: "My family helped start country", he wrote, "and we've been in political life ... since the 1690s, and I have a very possessive sense about this country."Gore Vidal, "Sexually Speaking: Collected Sexual Writings", Cleis Press, 1999. At a 1999 lecture in Dublin, Vidal said:

He suggested that President Roosevelt deliberately provoked the Japanese to attack the United States at Pearl Harbor to facilitate American entry to the war, and believed FDR had advance knowledge of the attack.Gore Vidal, "Three Lies to Rule By" and "Japanese Intentions in the Second World War", from Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta, New York, 2002, ISBN 1-56025-502-1  During an interview in the 2005 documentary Why We Fight, Vidal asserts that during the final months of World War II, the Japanese had tried to surrender to the United States, to no avail. He said, "They were trying to surrender all that summer, but Truman wouldn't listen, because Truman wanted to drop the bombs." When the interviewer asked why, Vidal replied, "To show off. To frighten Stalin. To change the balance of power in the world. To declare war on communism. Perhaps we were starting a pre-emptive world war."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.say2.org/why-we-fight/09.htm |title=Why We Fight (9 of 48) |publisher=Say2.org (Series of Subtitles for Documentary Video) |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
During domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh's imprisonment, Vidal corresponded with McVeigh and concluded that he bombed the federal building as retribution for the FBI's role in the 1993 Branch Davidian Compound massacre near Waco in Elk, Texas.Gore Vidal, "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh".

===Vidal versus Buckley===

In 1968, ABC News invited Vidal and William F. Buckley, Jr. to be political analysts of the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions.[tpl]cite web|title=Political Animals: Vidal, Buckley and the '68 Conventions |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html|accessdate=November 2, 2009[/tpl] Verbal and nearly physical combat ensued. After days of mutual bickering, their debates degraded to vitriolic, ad hominem attacks. During discussions of the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests, the men were arguing about freedom of speech with regard to American protesters displaying a Viet Cong flag when Vidal told Buckley to "shut up a minute", after Buckley had interrupted him, and, in response to Buckley's reference to "pro-Nazi" protesters, went on to say: "As far as I'm concerned, the only sort of pro-crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself." The visibly livid Buckley replied, "Now listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi, or I'll sock you in the goddamn face and you'll stay plastered." After an interruption by anchor and facilitator Howard K. Smith, the men continued to discuss the topic in a less hostile manner.[tpl]cite web|title=William Buckley/Gore Vidal Debate|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYymnxoQnf8|accessdate=August 3, 2012[/tpl] Buckley later expressed regret for having called Vidal a "queer," but nonetheless described Vidal as an "evangelist for bisexuality."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898542,00.html |title=Feuds: Wasted Talent |work=Time |date=August 22, 1969 |accessdate=November 7, 2011[/tpl]
Later, in 1969, the feud was continued as Buckley further attacked Vidal in the lengthy essay, "On Experiencing Gore Vidal", published in the August 1969 issue of Esquire. The essay is collected in The Governor Listeth, an anthology of Buckley's writings of the time. In a key passage attacking Vidal as an apologist for homosexuality, Buckley wrote, "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction homosexuality, and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher."
Vidal responded in the September 1969 issue of Esquire, variously characterizing Buckley as "anti-black", "anti-semitic", and a "warmonger". The presiding judge in Buckley's subsequent libel suit against Vidal initially concluded that "the court must conclude that Vidal's comments in these paragraphs meet the minimal standard of fair comment. The inferences made by Vidal from Buckley's editorial statements cannot be said to be completely unreasonable."[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] However, Vidal also strongly implied that, in 1944, Buckley and unnamed siblings had vandalized a Protestant church in their Sharon, Connecticut, hometown after the pastor's wife had sold a house to a Jewish family. Buckley sued Vidal and Esquire for libel. Vidal counter-claimed for libel against Buckley, citing Buckley's characterization of Vidal's novel Myra Breckinridge as pornography.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
The court dismissed Vidal's counter-claim.Buckley v. Vidal 327 F. Supp. 1051 (1971) Buckley settled for $115,000 in attorney's fees and an editorial statement from Esquire magazine that they were "utterly convinced" of the untruthfulness of Vidal's assertion."Buckley Drops Vidal Suit, Settles With Esquire", The New York Times, September 26, 1972, page 40 However, in a letter to Newsweek, the Esquire publisher stated that "the settlement of Buckley's suit against us" was not "a 'disavowal' of Vidal's article. On the contrary, it clearly states that we published that article because we believed that Vidal had a right to assert his opinions, even though we did not share them."
As Vidal's biographer, Fred Kaplan, later commented, "The court had 'not' sustained Buckley's case against Esquire ... the court had 'not' ruled that Vidal's article was 'defamatory.' It had ruled that the case would have to go to trial in order to determine as a matter of fact whether or not it was defamatory. original. The cash value of the settlement with Esquire represented 'only' Buckley's legal expenses damages based on libel ... " Ultimately, Vidal bore the cost of his own attorney's fees.
In 2003, this affair re-surfaced when Esquire published Esquire's Big Book of Great Writing, an anthology that included Vidal's essay. Buckley again sued for libel, and Esquire again settled for $55,000 in attorney's fees and $10,000 in personal damages to Buckley.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
After Buckley's death on February 27, 2008, Vidal summed up his impressions of his rival with the following obituary on March 20, 2008: "RIP WFB—in hell."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20080320_gore_vidal_speaks_seriously_ill_of_the_dead/ |title=Reports — Gore Vidal Speaks Seriously Ill of the Dead |publisher=Truthdig |date=March 20, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2009[/tpl] In a June 15, 2008, interview with the New York Times, Vidal was asked by Deborah Solomon, "How did you feel when you heard that Buckley died this year?" Vidal responded: [tpl]quote|I thought hell is bound to be a livelier place, as he joins forever those whom he served in life, applauding their prejudices and fanning their hatred.Solomon, Deborah.

===Criticism of the George W. Bush administration===

In May 2007, discussing the many conspiracy theories surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, Vidal said: [tpl]quote|I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst. Everything the Bushites touch is screwed up. They could never have pulled off 9/11, even if they wanted to. Even if they longed to. They could step aside, though, or just go out to lunch while these terrible things were happening to the nation.

==Personal life==

Vidal had affairs with both men and women. The novelist Anaïs Nin claimed an involvement with Vidal in her memoir The Diary of Anaïs Nin but Vidal denied it in his memoir Palimpsest. Vidal also discussed having dalliances with people such as actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to the possibility that he may have a daughter.Joy Do Lico and Andrew Johnson, "The rumours about my love child may be true, says Gore Vidal", The Independent, May 25, 2008. He was briefly engaged to Joanne Woodward, before she married Paul Newman; after eloping, the couple shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles for a short time. In 1950, he met his long-term partner Howard Austen."What I've Learned", Esquire, June, 2008, p. 132.
Vidal once reported that the secret to his lengthy relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other:  "It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part and impossible, I have observed, when it does."[tpl]cite web|last=Robinson|first=Charlotte|title=Outtake Blog Author & Gay Icon Gore Vidal Dies|url=http://blog.outtakeonline.com/2012/08/author-gay-icon-gore-vidal-dies.html|publisher=Outtake Blog|accessdate=August 1, 2012[/tpl]
In 1995, Vidal told Judy Wieder of The Advocate magazine that he refused to call himself gay because he was not an adjective. "To be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim." Later in the interview, Vidal concedes, "I've said—a thousand times?—in print and on TV that everyone is bisexual."

According to literary critic Harold Bloom, Vidal believed his sexuality had denied him the full recognition of the literary community. Bloom, meanwhile, claimed this had more to do with Vidal's association with the unfashionable genre of historical fiction.[tpl]cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_-QzKinSsz0C|accessdate=August 1, 2012|year=1994|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=9781573225144|page=20[/tpl]

During the latter part of the twentieth century Vidal divided his time between Italy and California. In 2003, he sold his 5,000-square-foot (460 m²) Italian Villa, La Rondinaia (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast, and moved to Los Angeles.  Austen died in November 2003 and, in February 2005, was buried in a plot for himself and Vidal at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
Vidal died at his home in Hollywood Hills, California, at about 6:45 p.m. PDT July 31, 2012, of complications from pneumonia."Gore Vidal, celebrated author, playwright, dies" by Tina Fineberg, USA Today, August 1, 2012Hillel Italie and Andrew Dalton, "Gore Vidal, celebrated author, playwright, dies", Associated Press, August 1, 2012. He was 86.
On September 27, 2013, screenwriter and author Kim Krizan published an article on The Huffington Post revealing she had found a previously unpublished love letter written by Vidal to the diarist Anaïs Nin. This letter contradicts Vidal's previous characterization of his relationship with Nin, showing that Vidal did have feelings for Nin that he later heavily disavowed in his autobiography, Palimpsest. Krizan did this research in the run up to the release of the latest volume of Anaïs Nin's uncensored diary, Mirages, for which Krizan provided the foreword.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-krizan/gore-vidals-secret-unpubl_b_4004916.html?utm_hp_ref=books|title=Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter To Anaïs Nin|date=September 27, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2013-09-20|first=Kim|last=Krizan[/tpl]

==Legacy==

After Vidal's death, tributes immediately poured in from various media sources. The New York Times described him in his obituary as being in his old age "an Augustan figure who believed himself to be the last of a breed, and he was probably right.

In the UK The Guardian said "Vidal's critics disparaged his tendency to formulate an aphorism rather than to argue, finding in his work an underlying note of contempt for those who did not agree with him. His fans, on the other hand, delighted in his unflagging wit and elegant style."[tpl]cite news|author=Jay Parini |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/01/gore-vidal-dies |title=Gore Vidal obituary|publisher=Guardian |date= August 1, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-05 |location=London[/tpl] The Daily Telegraph described him as "an icy iconoclast" who "delighted in chronicling what he perceived as the disintegration of civilisation around him",[tpl]cite news|author=|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9443260/Gore-Vidal.html |title=Gore Vidal|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |location=London[/tpl] while BBC News said he was "one of the finest post-war American writers... an indefatigable critic of the whole American system. Writing in Los Angeles, BBC journalist Alastair Leithead said: "Gore Vidal saw himself as the last of the breed of literary figures who became celebrities in their own right.

On August 23, 2012, a celebration of Vidal's life and work was held at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in New York, where a revival of his play The Best Man was running.
