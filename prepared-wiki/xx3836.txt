GM Holden Ltd, commonly designated Holden, is an Australian automaker that operates in Australasia and is headquartered in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, before becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based General Motors (GM) in 1931. After becoming a subsidiary of GM, the company was named General Motors-Holden's Ltd, becoming Holden Ltd in 1998—the current name was adopted in 2005.
Holden is responsible for GM's vehicle operations in Australasia, and on their behalf, held partial ownership of GM Daewoo in South Korea between 2002 and 2009. Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, supplemented by imported GM models. Holden has offered the following badge engineered models in sharing arrangements: Chevrolet, Isuzu, Nissan, Opel, Suzuki, Toyota and Vauxhall Motors.  As of 2013, the vehicle lineup consists of models from GM Korea, GM Thailand, GM in the US, and self-developed Commodore, Caprice, and Ute. Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until the brand's Australian demise in mid-2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Opel Australia shuts its doors|url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/opel-australia-shuts-its-doors-20130802-2r4ch.html|work=Drive.com.au|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=26 August 2013|author=Matt Campbell| date = 2 August 2013[/tpl]
All Australian-built Holden vehicles are manufactured at Elizabeth in South Australia, and engines are produced at the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland states of Australia, with GM's New Zealand subsidiary Holden New Zealand operating a plant until 1990. The consolidation of car production at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until 1996.
Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia has led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability.
Holden announced on 11 December 2013 that production in Australia would cease by the end of 2017.[tpl]cite web|title=Holden to cease local production in 2017|url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2013/12/11/holden-to-cease-local-production-in-2017.html|publisher=AUSmotive.com|accessdate=11 December 2013|author=AUSmotive.com| date = 11 December 2013[/tpl] They will also close the Lang Lang Proving Ground, and reduce the staffing of their product development centre substantially.http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/956123AC30531953CA257C3E00834698 In the last few years, Holden incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, with government grants being reduced in future.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25328924 |title=GM's Holden to stop making cars in Australia | date = December 11, 2013 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

==History of the company==

===Early history===

In 1852, James Alexander Holden emigrated to South Australia from Walsall,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/hnames.doc | format = DOC | title = Street name | publisher = City of Burnside | accessdate = 2009-06-03[/tpl] England and in 1856 established J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 16. In 1885 German-born Henry Frederick Frost joined the business as a junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (1998): p. 7. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles.[tpl]cite web | url = http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=913304 | title = James Alexander Holden family papers, 1801–1975 | publisher = State Library of New South Wales | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60I7htO2r | archivedate = 2011-07-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885–1947) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography | publisher = Melbourne University Publishing | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Milestones | publisher = General Motors | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080322141257/http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | archivedate = 2008-03-22 | accessdate = 2010-03-18[/tpl] After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and utilising a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.Darwin (2002), p. 3. By 1923, HMBB were producing 12,000 units per year. During this time, HMBB was the first company to assemble bodies for Ford Australia until their Geelong, plant was completed.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/25843/sub048.pdf | format = PDF | title = Submission to Automotive Enquiry | work = Productivity Commission | publisher = Government of Australia | accessdate = 2008-07-17[/tpl] From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville, South Australia plant.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/holdencar/index.htm | title = The Holden car in Australia | publisher = Government of Australia | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 General Motors (Australia) was established with assembly plants at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne, Victoria; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western AustraliaDarwin (2002), p. 7. utilizing bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete knock down (CKD) chassis.Darwin (2002), p. 4. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000 units annually in 1930 to just 1,651 units one year later. In 1931 General Motors purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). 
Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. Several have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.

===1940s===

Holden's second full-scale car factory, located in Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), was completed in 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies, field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.[tpl]cite web | date = 2007-08-22 | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/news/article/114 | title = The Holden Ute History | publisher = Holden New Zealand | accessdate = 2008-02-26[/tpl] Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | title = Road transport | publisher = National Archives of Australia | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051025213951/http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | archivedate = 2005-10-25[/tpl] After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Holden-Ltd-Company-History.html | title = Holden Ltd.| encyclopedia = International Directory of Company Histories | volume = 62 | year = 2004 | editor = Grant, Tina | publisher = Thomson Gale | accessdate = 2008-02-28[/tpl] The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.[tpl]cite web | last = Russell | first = Rohan | url = http://home.vicnet.net.au/~oldsclub/acehist.html | title = The Oldsmobile "ACE" – 1946 to 1948 | location = Gladstone Park, Victoria | publisher = Oldsmobile Club of Australia | accessdate = 2010-06-08[/tpl]
From here, Holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an Australian car. This involved compromise with GM, as Holden's managing director, Laurence Hartnett, favoured development of a local design, while GM preferred to see an American design as the basis for "Australia's Own Car".Loffler (2006), p. 5–7. In the end, the design was based on a previously rejected post-war Chevrolet proposal.Loffler (2000), p. 5. The Holden was launched in 1948, creating long waiting lists extending through 1949 and beyond.Balderstone, Bowan, Lewis (2006), p. 184–188.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/chifley.jsp | title = The Birth of 'Australia's Own Car' | publisher = GM Holden | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723092757/http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/chifley.jsp | archivedate = 2008-07-23 | accessdate = 2008-03-05[/tpl] The name "Holden" was chosen in honour of Sir Edward Holden, the company's first chairman and grandson of J.A. Holden. Other names considered were "GeM", "Austral", "Melba", "Woomerah", "Boomerang", "Emu" and "Canbra", a phonetic spelling of Canberra.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/holden_prototype_car_no_1 | title = Holden Prototype Car No. 1 | publisher = National Museum of Australia | accessdate = 2011-04-06[/tpl] Although officially designated "48-215", the car was marketed simply as the "Holden".[tpl]cite web | year = 1948 | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/gallery/pdf/Holden_48215.pdf | format = PDF | title = Holden – General Motors new Australian car | publisher = General Motors–Holden's | accessdate = 2008-03-02[/tpl] The unofficial usage of the name "FX" originated within Holden, referring to the updated suspension on the 48-215 of 1953.Loffler (2002), p. 4.

===1950s===

During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian car market. GM invested heavily in production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars. Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's ability to deal with rugged rural areas.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 38. 48-215 sedans were produced in parallel with the 50-2106 coupé utility from 1951; the latter was known colloquially as the "ute" and became ubiquitous in Australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice. Production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until 1953, when they were replaced by the facelifted FJ model, introducing a third panel van body style.[tpl]cite web | date = 2001-04-24 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_53869/cms/newsarticle.html | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 – The Holden Ute: 1951 – 2001 | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 40. A new horizontally slatted grille dominated the front-end of the FJ, which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions.Bebbington (1998), p. 14. "...the FJ was easily identified by its bold new, Buick-style grille, new hubcaps and new torpedo-style tail-lights."Loffler (2002), p. 5. In 1954 Holden began exporting the FJ to New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|title=Aussies Overseas|url=http://www.motoringorient.com/Aussiesoverseas.html|publisher=MotoringOrient.com|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] Although little changed from the 48-215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept FJ sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/fj_holden/index.html | title = FJ Holden, 1953–1956 | publisher = National Museum of Australia | accessdate = 2008-03-04[/tpl] At the 2005 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden paid homage to the FJ with the Efijy concept car.Carey (2005), p. 16.
Holden's next model, the FE, launched in 1956; offered in a new station wagon body style dubbed "Station Sedan" in the company's sales literature.[tpl]cite web | date = 1998-03-24 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_50400/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Golden Holden Oldies – The FE Holden: 1956 | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-06[/tpl] In the same year Holden commenced exports to Malaya, Thailand and North Borneo. Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50 percent in 1958 with the revised FC model.Wright (1998), p. 117. This was the first Holden to be tested on the new Holden Proving Ground based in Lang Lang, Victoria.[tpl]cite web | date = 1997-10-14 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_50167/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Holden's Lang Lang Proving Ground Passes Forty-Year Milestone | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-06[/tpl] 1957 saw Holden's export markets grow to 17 countries, with new additions including Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Fiji, Sudan, the East Africa region and South Africa. The opening of the Dandenong, Victoria, production facility in 1956 brought further jobs; by 1959 Holden employed 19,000 workers country-wide.[tpl]cite news | date = 1959-11-02 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892818,00.html | title = The New Blokes | work = The Times | publisher = Time Inc. | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] In 1959 complete knock down assembly began in South Africa and Indonesia.

===1960s===

In 1960, Holden introduced its third major new model, the FB. The car's style was inspired by 1950s Chevrolets, with tailfins and a wrap-around windshield with "dog leg" A-pillars. By the time it was introduced, many considered the appearance dated. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden.Wright (1998), p. 122. The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for left-hand-drive markets, enhancing its export potential, and as such was exported to New Caledonia, New Hebrides, the Philippines, and Hawaii.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 46.
In 1960, Ford unveiled the new Falcon in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holden's advantage, the Falcon was not durable, particularly in the front suspension, making it ill-suited for Australian conditions.Wright (1998), p. 133–134. In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK series in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork and optional Hydramatic automatic transmission.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 48. A restyled EJ series came in 1962, debuting the new luxury oriented Premier model.Wright (1998), p. 135. The EH update came a year later bringing the new Red motor, providing better performance than the previous Grey motor.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder Red Motor | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] The HD series of 1965 saw the introduction of the Powerglide automatic transmission.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 54. At the same time, an "X2" performance option with a more powerful version of the [tpl]convert|179|cuin|L|1|adj=on[/tpl] six-cylinder engine was made available.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hd.htm | title = Holden HD | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2009-01-24[/tpl] In 1966, the HR was introduced, including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines. More significantly, the HR fitted standard front seat belts; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 57. This coincided with the completion of the production plant in Acacia Ridge, Queensland. By 1963, Holden was exporting cars to Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean.
Holden began assembling the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a development of the Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_hb.htm | title = Holden Torana HB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-03-06[/tpl] Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model.Wright (1998), p. 191–192. The LC Torana was the first application of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission.Bebbington (1998), p. 103. "Also introduced on the LC was the Tri-matic automatic transmission. This was GM-H's own three-speed unit." This was the result of Holden's A$16.5 million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia factory for its production.
Holden's association with the manufacture of Chevrolets and Pontiacs ended in 1968, coinciding with the year of Holden's next major new model, the HK .Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 5, 31. This included Holden's first V8 engine, a Chevrolet engine imported from Canada.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 59. Models based on the HK series included an extended-length prestige model, the Brougham, and a two-door coupé, the Monaro.Davis (1987), p. 102. The mainstream Holden Special was rebranded the Kingswood, and the basic fleet model, the Standard, became the Belmont.Wright (1998), p. 171. On 3 March 1969 Alexander Rhea, managing director of General Motors-Holden's at the time, was joined by press photographers and the Federal Minister of Shipping and Transport, Ian Sinclair as the two men drove the two millionth Holden,Autocar (1969), p. 62. an HK Brougham off the production line. This came just over half a decade since the one millionth car, an EJ Premier sedan rolled off the Dandenong line on 25 October 1962.Wright (1998), p. 137. "The millionth Holden, a Eura Gold EJ Premier sedan, passing down the Dandenong production line on 25 October 1962." Following the Chevrolet V8 fitted to the HK, the first Australian-designed and mass-produced V8, the Holden V8 engine debuted in the Hurricane concept of 1969 before fitment to facelifted HT model. This was available in two capacities: [tpl]convert|253|cuin|L|1[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|308|cuin|L|1[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | date = 1999-06-28 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_51435/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Holden Employees Farewell The Last Aussie-Built V8 | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-05[/tpl] Late in HT production, use of the new Tri-Matic automatic transmission, first seen in the LC Torana was phased in as Powerglide stock was exhausted, but Holden's official line was that the HG of 1971 was the first full-size Holden to receive it.Bebbington (1998), p. 36. "Tri-matic automatic transmission replaced Powerglide late in the HT model run (May '70) (except Monaro GTS] 350)."Bebbington (1998), p. 38. "HG signified the official introduction of the Tri-matic three-speed automatic transmission to the full-size car range."
Despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely, the Ford Falcon, Chrysler Valiant, and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally-produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa in complete knock down form.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 31.

===1970s===

Holden launched the new HQ series in 1971.Strauss (1998), p. 11. At this time, the company was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque (unibody) construction. Other firsts included an all-coil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons, while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coil/leaf suspension configuration.[tpl]cite web | date = 1998-10-26 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_50813/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Golden Holden Oldies – Stars of the Seventies | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-05[/tpl] The series included the new prestige Statesman brand, which also had a longer wheelbase, replacing the Brougham.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/0BF19BA5E77986D6CA256D2100149EA4 | title = Car review – Holden Statesman V6 sedan | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-03-05[/tpl] The Statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a "Holden", but rather a "Statesman".Luck (1971), p. 62.
The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door Monaros, and, despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ range became the top-selling Holden of all time, with 485,650 units sold in three years.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 67–68. 14,558 units were exported and 72,290 CKD kits were constructed. The HQ series was facelifted in 1974 with the introduction of the HJ, heralding new front panel styling and a revised rear fascia.Wright (1998), p. 226. This new bodywork was to remain, albeit with minor upgrades through the HX and HZ series.Wright (1998), p. 340–341. Detuned engines adhering to government emission standards were brought in with the HX series, whilst the HZ brought considerably improved road handling and comfort with the introduction of "Radial Tuned Suspension" (RTS).Wright (1998), p. 239–241. As a result of GM's toying with the Wankel rotary engine, as used by Mazda of Japan, an export agreement was initiated in 1975. This involved Holden exporting with powertrains, HJ, and later, HX series Premiers as the Mazda Roadpacer AP. Mazda then fitted these cars with the 13B rotary engine and three-speed automatic transmission. Production ended in 1977, after just 840 units sold.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_mazda_roadpacer.htm | title = Mazda Roadpacer | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2009-04-21[/tpl]McCarthy (2007), p. 142. "...a faction within General Motors had a serious case of the hots for Dr Wankel's rotary engine. ... The Premier, in all its glory (except drivetrain), was shipped to Hiroshima where Mazda partially fitted the empty engine bay with a 13B rotor motor, backed by a three-speed auto. ... Production lasted just two years and 840 units...".
During the 1970s, Holden ran an advertising jingle "Football, Meat Pies, Kangaroos and Holden cars", based on the "Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pies and Chevrolet" jingle used by Chevrolet in the United States.[tpl]cite news | last = King | first = Philip | date = 2008-08-16 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/cars-at-a-fork-in-the-road/story-e6frgafo-1111117208528 | title = Cars at a fork in the road | work = The Australian | publisher = News Limited | accessdate = 2008-11-19[/tpl] Also, development of the Torana continued in with the larger mid-sized LH series released in 1974, offered only as a four-door sedan.Wright (1998), p. 340. The LH Torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to occupy four-, six-and eight-cylinder engines.Wright (1998), p. 198. This trend continued until Holden introduced the Sunbird in 1976; essentially the four-cylinder Torana with a new name. Designated LX, both the Sunbird and Torana introduced a three-door hatchback variant.Wright (1998), p. 244. A final UC update appeared in 1978.Bebbington (1998), p. 115. During its production run, the Torana achieved legendary racing success in Australia, achieving victories at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales.[tpl]cite web | date = 1998-11-04 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_50858/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Golden Holden Oldies – The Holden Torana (1967–78) – A Bathurst Legacy | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-06-09[/tpl]
In 1975, Holden introduced the compact Gemini, the Australian version of the "T-car", based on the Opel Kadett C. The Gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with Isuzu, GM's Japanese affiliate; and was powered by a 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl]
Holden's most popular car to date, the Commodore, was introduced in 1978 as the VB.Tuckey (1999), p. 27. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E body shell, but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.Tuckey (1999), p. 33. However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers.Robinson (2006), p. 23, 26–27. With the abandonment of left-hand drive markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.
Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the Commodore, the Torana became the "in-between" car, surrounded by the smaller and more economical Gemini and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the Camira, released in 1982 as Australia's version of GM's medium-sized "J-car".Robinson (2006), p. 24.

===1980s===

The 1980s were challenging for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.Wright (1998), p. 277. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive chassis cab models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 82. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 87, 95. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia."Reborn!" (1985), p. 19. "We have been waiting a long time for this front wheel drive replacement for the original Gemini. The Isuzu people have not exactly been speedy signing off the development for the RB, or what has been known as the R-car...".
The new Holden WB commercial vehicles and the Statesman WB limousines were introduced in 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, HX and HZ models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in 1984. Sales of the Commodore also fell, with the effects of the 1979 energy crisis lessening, and for the first time the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota gained market share.[tpl]cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | date = 2006-07-29 | url = http://www.carsales.com.au/advice/2006/large-passenger/holden/commodore/crossing-the-lion-7422 | title = Crossing the Lion | publisher = carsales.com.au | accessdate = 2007-06-16[/tpl] When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over A$500 million by the mid-1980s.Robinson (2006), p. 26.
In 1984 Holden introduced the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes from the previous VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 89–94. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Car | date = September 1984 | page = 9 | title = Oracle: Headlines | editor-last = Cropley | editor-first = Steve | publisher = FF Publishing | location = London, UK [/tpl] The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol.[tpl]cite web | date = 2007-06-21 | url = http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091213160823/http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | archivedate = 2009-12-13 | title = Caring for our air | publisher = State of Queensland | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the VL.Robinson (2006), p. 25. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780 million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters’ request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process.Robinson (2006), p. 27. "...on 19 December 1986 GM paid off Holden's accumulated losses of around A$780m, leaving the company free of debt. This was a new beginning, but GM insisted the company be split in two..." This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC).Davis, Davis (1988), p. 91. "In December 1986, GM-H announced a major restructure of its activities replacing the existing General Motors-Holden's Ltd with two sister firms, Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC)." For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas.[tpl]cite web | date = 2004-11-09 | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_103082/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Holden Reaches Golden Milestone With 50 Years Of Exports | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.
Holden began to sell the subcompact Suzuki Swift-based Barina in 1985. The Barina was launched concurrently with the Suzuki-sourced Holden Drover, followed by the Scurry later on in 1985.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 91. In the previous year, Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the Holden Astra, as a result of a deal with Nissan.Earl (2002), p. 29. This arrangement ceased in 1989 when Holden entered a new alliance with Toyota, forming a new company: United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI). UAAI resulted in Holden selling rebadged versions of Toyota's Corolla and Camry, as the Holden Nova and Apollo respectively, with Toyota re-branding the Commodore as the Lexcen.Earl (2002), p. 27–28.

===1990s===

The company changed throughout the 1990s, increasing its Australian market share from 21 percent in 1991 to 28.2 percent in 1999.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share_ARCHIVE.html | title = Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991–2002) | publisher = General Motors | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829033825/http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share_ARCHIVE.html | archivedate = 2007-08-29 | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Besides manufacturing Australia's best selling car, which was exported in significant numbers, Holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere. In this decade, Holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | title = GM Global Operations: Australia | publisher = General Motors | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427004252/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | archivedate = 2005-10-25[/tpl] During 1998, General Motors-Holden's Ltd name was shortened to "Holden Ltd".Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part One, p. 9.
On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand subsidiary Holden New Zealand announced that production at the assembly plant based in Trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone assembly line due to low output volumes.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | title = Heart of Holden – Holden Heritage | publisher = Holden New Zealand | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080601180944/http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | archivedate = 2008-06-01[/tpl] During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, the federal government had already cut tariffs to 22.5 percent, from 57.5 percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15 percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.[tpl]cite news | last = Richardson | first = Michael | date = 1997-04-24 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-cars.t_0.html | title = Automakers Say Cuts in Duties Would Maim Industry : Tussle on Tariffs in Australia | work = International Herald Tribune | publisher = The New York Times Company | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl]
Holden re-introduced its defunct Statesman title in 1990—this time under the Holden marque, as the Statesman and Caprice. For 1991, Holden updated the Statesman and Caprice with a range of improvements, including the introduction of four-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS);Wright (1998), p. 343. although, a rear-wheel system had been standard on the Statesman Caprice from March 1976. ABS was added to the short-wheelbase Commodore range in 1992.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Two, p. 103–104. Another returning variant was the full-size utility, and on this occasion it was based on the Commodore.Robinson (2006), p. 26–27. The VN Commodore received a major facelift in 1993 with the VR—compared to the VN, approximately 80 percent of the car model was new. Exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a "twin-kidney" grille—a Commodore styling trait that remained until the 2002 VY model and,[tpl]cite web | last = Smith | first = Graham | date = 2002-09-06 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/holden-vr-commodore/story-e6frfj7f-1111112104526 | title = 1993 Holden VR Commodore | work = Herald Sun | publisher = News Limited | accessdate = 2008-03-02[/tpl]  as of 2013, remains a permanent staple on HSV variants.
Holden introduced the all-new VT Commodore in 1997, the outcome of a A$600 million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety.McCarthy, McKay, Newton, Robinson (2006), p. 158. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007): Part Three, p. 11.
The UAAI badge-engineered cars first introduced in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/60DB5F93CC0B207FCA256D21001310D6 | title = Car review – Holden Nova 5-dr hatch | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. This signalled the closure of the Dandenong, Victoria facility, the sole plant for Corolla and Nova production.Wright (1998), p. 294. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This came after the 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D928D7E37EE64519CA256D210003F9D7 | title = Car review – Holden Barina Swing 5-dr hatch | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001.[tpl]cite web | date = 2001-05-10 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/CCFB67BA3E9FCE77CA256A480019218D | title = Car review – Holden Suburban 1500 LT 5-dr wagon | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2009-04-22[/tpl] Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia.

===2000s===

Holden's market surge from the 1990s reversed in the 2000s decade. In Australia, Holden's market share dropped from 27.5 percent in 2000 to 15.2 percent in 2006.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share.html | title = Sales and Share of Australian Market (2003–Present) | publisher = General Motors | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807233256/http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share.html | archivedate = 2007-08-07 | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] From March 2003, Holden no longer held the number one sales position in Australia, losing ground to Toyota."Number Crunching" (2003), p. 181.
This overall downturn affected Holden's profits; the company recorded a combined gain of A$842.9 million between 2002 and 2004, and a combined loss of A$290 million between 2005 and 2006.[tpl]cite web | date = 2007-06-18 | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/3250/holden-posts-146-million-loss/ | title = Holden Posts $146 Million Loss | publisher = CarAdvice | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Factors contributing to the loss included the development of an all-new model, the strong Australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the Elizabeth plant, including the loss of 1,400 jobs after the closure of the third-shift assembly line in 2005, after two years in operation.[tpl]cite news | date = 2006-01-20 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Mitsubishi-to-cut-250-jobs-says-union/2006/01/20/1137553752787.html | title = Mitsubishi to cut more jobs | work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax Media | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Holden fared better in 2007, posting an A$6 million loss.[tpl]cite web | last = Pettendy | first = Marton | date = 2008-07-30 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D0F21ACCD85E4C94CA25749500261F3B | title = GM Holden posts a $6 million loss for 2007 as domestic and export sales slow | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-07-30[/tpl] This was followed by an A$70.2 million loss in the 2008,[tpl]cite web | last = McDonald | first = Neil | date = 2009-06-26 | url = http://www.carsguide.com.au/site/news-and-reviews/car-news/holden_posts_70m_loss_in_australia | title = Holden posts $70m loss in Australia | work = The Sun-Herald | publisher = Fairfax Media | accessdate = 2009-06-26[/tpl] an A$210.6 million loss in 2009, and a profit of A$112 million in 2010.[tpl]cite web | last = Hammerton | first = Ron | date = 2011-04-13 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/18E4D6AA2E88214ECA257870000F2CB0 | title = Red team back in black | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2011-04-13[/tpl] On 18 May 2005, "Holden Ltd" became "GM Holden Ltd", coinciding with the resettling to the new Holden headquarters on 191 Salmon Street, Port Melbourne, Victoria.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nextcar.com.au/n.holden.2005.office.05may.html | title = Holden Unveils New Headquarters In Port Melbourne | publisher = Next Car | date = 2005-05-19 | accessdate = 2010-09-28[/tpl]
Holden caused controversy in 2005 with their Holden Employee Pricing television advertisement, which ran between October and December 2005. The campaign publicised, "for the first time ever, all Australians can enjoy the financial benefit of Holden Employee Pricing". However, this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received. At the same time, employees were given a further discount between 25 and 29 percent on selected models.[tpl]cite web | date = 2006-04-19 | url = http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/732368/fromItemId/2332 | title = Holden employee pricing backfires | publisher = Australian Competition and Consumer Commission | accessdate = 2008-01-28[/tpl]
Holden revived the Monaro coupe in 2001.

A mildly facelifted VZ model launched in 2004, introducing the High Feature engine.McCarthy, McKay, Newton, Robinson (2006), p. 159. This was built at the Fishermans Bend facility completed in 2003, with a maximum output of 900 engines per day.

In contrast to previous models, the VE no longer utilises an Opel-sourced platform adapted both mechanically and in size.Robinson (2006), p. 34–35, 55–56.
Throughout the 1990s, Opel had also been the source of many Holden models. To increase profitability, Holden looked to the South Korean Daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6 percent stake—worth US$251 million—in the company in 2002 as a representative of GM.[tpl]cite web | date = 2005-02-01 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/spanner-in-the-works-20100824-13kzd.html | title = Spanner in the works | work = Drive | publisher = Fairfax Media | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Gratton | first = Ken | date = 2009-11-02 | url = http://www.carsales.com.au/news/2009/daewoo/gm-to-take-larger-stake-in-daewoo-17241 | title = GM to take larger stake in Daewoo | publisher = Carsales | accessdate = 2010-10-20[/tpl] This was increased to 50.9 percent in 2005,[tpl]cite web | last = Hassal | first = David | date = 2009-04-07 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D2691139F3368A53CA257612000B82F4 | title = GM Daewoo seeks vital cash | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2010-10-20[/tpl] but when GM further increased its stake to 70.1 percent around the time of its 2009 Chapter 11 reorganisation, Holden's interest was relinquished and transferred to another (undisclosed) part of GM.[tpl]cite news | date = 2009-10-23 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKHKG29812220091023 | title = Update 1-GM buys all new shares in S.Korea unit | publisher = Reuters | accessdate = 2010-10-20[/tpl]
The commencement of the Holden-branded Daewoo models began with the 2005 Holden Barina, which based on the Daewoo Kalos, replaced the Opel Corsa as the source of the Barina.Carey (2005), p. 131. In the same year, the Viva, based on the Daewoo Lacetti, replaced the entry-level Holden Astra Classic, although the new-generation Astra introduced in 2004 continued on.Carey (2005), p. 128–129. The Captiva crossover SUV came next in 2006. After discontinuing the Frontera and Jackaroo models in 2003, Holden was only left with one all-wheel drive model: the Adventra, a Commodore-based station wagon.Ponchard (2006), p. 106–112. The fourth model to be replaced with a South Korean alternative was the Vectra by the mid-size Epica in 2007.Newton (2007), p. 104–108. As a result of the split between GM and Isuzu, Holden lost the rights to use the "Rodeo" nameplate.

Following the government grant announcement, Kevin Rudd, Australia's Prime Minister at the time, stated that production would support 600 new jobs at the Elizabeth facility; however, this failed to take into account Holden's previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would be shed when production of the Family II engine ceased in late 2009.[tpl]cite news | last = Kerin | first = Paul | date = 2009-03-17 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/too-easy-for-gm/story-e6frg9if-1111119152290 | title = Rudd has made it too easy | work = The Australian | publisher = News Limited | accessdate = 2009-03-17[/tpl] In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265 million, in addition to the A$275 million that was already committed by the governments of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia. A source close to Holden informed the Australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to A$200 per week to cut costs, following the announcement of 400 job cuts and an assembly line reduction of 65 (400 to 335) cars per day.

===2010s===

In March 2012, Holden was given a $270 million lifeline by the Gillard, Weatherill, and Baillieu Ministrys. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1 billion into car manufacturing in Australia. They estimated the new investment package would return around $4 billion to the Australian economy and see GM Holden continue making cars in Australia until at least 2022.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.australianmanufacturing.com.au/holden-secures-over-200-million-subsidy-promises-to-stay/ |title=Holden To Stay After Government Promises $270 Million Assistance |publisher=Australian Manufacturing |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

The logo, or "Holden lion and stone" as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden's identity. In 1928, Holden's Motor Body Builders appointed Rayner Hoff to design the emblem. The logo refers to a prehistoric fable, in which observations of lions rolling stones led to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the 48-215, Holden revised its logo and commissioned another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.Wright (2004), p. 152. The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | title = The Story of the Holden Lion | publisher = GM Holden | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080208222349/http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | archivedate = 2008-02-08[/tpl]

===Exports===

Holden began to export vehicles in 1954, sending the FJ to New Zealand.Tuckey (2003), p. 120. Exports to New Zealand have continued ever since, but to broaden their export potential, Holden began to cater their Commodore, Monaro and Statesman/Caprice models for both right- and left-hand drive markets. The Middle East is now Holden's largest export market, with the Commodore sold as the Chevrolet Lumina since 1998, and the Statesman since 1999 as the Chevrolet Caprice. Commodores are also sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in Brunei, Fiji and South Africa, and as the Chevrolet Omega in Brazil.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/corporate/about-holden/exports/vehicle-exports | title = Vehicle Exports | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Pontiac in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8 Unfortunately, Pontiac went bankrupt in late 2009 and GM had to shut down Pontiac in 2010.[tpl]cite web | last = Gover | first = Paul | date = 2009-05-01 | url = http://www.carsguide.com.au/site/news-and-reviews/story/pontiac_pays_the_price | title = Pontiac pays the price | work = Herald Sun | publisher = The Herald and Weekly Times | accessdate = 2009-07-15[/tpl] The G8's cessation was a consequence of GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy resulting in the demise of the Pontiac brand.[tpl]cite web | last1 = Hammerton | first1 = Ron | last2 = Pettendy | first2 = Marton | date = 2009-07-13 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1F5919FB1BB6E4E6CA2575F200013D12 | title = Holden in US comeback | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2009-07-15[/tpl]
