The National Academy of Sciences is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU). The ICSU Advisory Committee, which is in the Research Council's Office of International Affairs, facilitates participation of members in international scientific unions and is a liaison for U.S. national committees for the individual scientific unions. Although there is no formal relationship with state and local academies of science, there often is informal dialogue.
The National Academy of Sciences meets annually in Washington, D.C., documented in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, its scholarly journal. The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies, and makes more than 3,600 publications freely available on its website.
There are several books on the National Academy of Sciences and the advice the National Research Council gives the U.S. government, including a critical piece of journalism The Brain Bank of AmericaBoffey, Philip, The Brain Bank of America (McGraw-Hill, 1975). by Philip Boffey and a sociological study Science on Stage: Expert Advice as Public Drama.Stephen Hilgartner, Science on Stage (Stanford University Press, 2000).
Since 2004, the National Academy of Sciences has administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum, to provide public exhibits and programming related to its policy work. The museum's current exhibits focus on climate change and infectious disease.
Since June 2011, the NAS made a digital copy of most books and reports published by the National Academies Press available for free at their website. The catalog includes more than 4,000 works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=06022011 |title=Newsroom |publisher=National-Academies.org |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]

===Facilities===

The National Academy of Sciences maintains multiple buildings around the United States.
The historic National Academy of Sciences building is located at 2101 Constitution Avenue, in northwest Washington, DC; it sits on the National Mall, adjacent to the Federal Reserve and in front of the State Department. This neoclassical building was dedicated in 1924[tpl]cite web | author = National Academy of Sciences | title = The NAS Building... a Temple of Science | url = http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ABOUT_building | accessdate = 12 October 2010[/tpl] and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is used for lectures, symposia, exhibitions, and concerts, in addition to annual meetings of the NAS, NAE, and IOM. The 2012 Presidential Award for Math and Science Teaching ceremony was held here on March 5, 2014. Approximately 150 staff members work at the NAS Building. In June 2012, it reopened to visitors after a major two-year restoration project which restored and improved the building’s historic spaces, increased accessibility, and brought the building's aging infrastructure and facilities up to date.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cpnas.org/visit/nas-building-restoration.html |title=Restoration of Historic National Academy of Sciences Building |year=2013 |website=CPNAS |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
More than 1,000 National Academies staff members work at The Keck Center of the National Academies at 500 Fifth Street in northwest Washington, D.C. The Keck Center provides meeting space and houses the National Academies Press Bookstore.[tpl]cite web | author = National Academy of Sciences | title = Visiting Our Buildings | url = http://www.nationalacademies.org/about/contact | accessdate = 12 October 2010[/tpl] The Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences – located at 525 E St., N.W. – hosts visits from the public, school field trips, traveling exhibits, and permanent science exhibits.[tpl]cite web | title = Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences | url = http://www.koshland-science-museum.org | accessdate = 12 October 2010[/tpl]
The NAS also maintains conference centers in California and Massachusetts. The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the National Academies is located on 100 Academy Drive in Irvine, California, near the campus of the University of California, Irvine; it offers a conference center and houses several NAS programs.

==Highlights==

===Joint declaration on global warming===

In 2005, the national science academies of the G8 nations (including the National Academy of Sciences) plus science academies of Brazil, China, and India (three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world) signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change had become sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.[tpl]cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Joint-science-academies-statement-Global-response-to-climate-change/ |title=Joint academies statement on climate change |publisher=Royalsociety.org |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=5689 |title=Joint science academies’ statement: Global response to climate change (Adobe PDF File) |publisher=Royalsociety.org |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]
On 7 May 2010, a letter signed by 255 Academy members was published in Science magazine, decrying "political assaults" against climate change scientists.[tpl]cite news|title=U-Va. urged to fight Cuccinelli subpoena in probe of scientist|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|date=May 9, 2010|work=Washington Post|page=C5[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/06/climate-science-open-letter| title=Open letter: Climate change and the integrity of science| date=May 6, 2010|work=The Guardian[/tpl] This responded to a civil investigative demand being served on the University of Virginia  by Virginia  Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, seeking a broad range of documents from Michael E.
