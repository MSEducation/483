Cognitive distortions are exaggerated or irrational thought patterns that are believed to perpetuate the effects of psychopathological states, especially depression and anxiety. Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. Most notably, Burns’ 1989 book, The Feeling Good Handbook[tpl]cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=The Feeling Good Handbook: Using the New Mood Therapy in Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=W. Morrow |year=1989 |isbn=0688017452 [/tpl]  presented information on these thought patterns along with a proposal of how to eliminate them.
Moreover, cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality negatively. These negative thinking patterns are simply convincing the mind of individuals that what they see is true when it is not. They are inaccurate thoughts that usually reinforce negative thoughts or emotions.

Since the way a person feels intervenes with how they think, these distorted thoughts feed their negative emotions. As a result, an individual affected by cognitive distortions may have an overall negative outlook on the world.

==History==

In 1972, psychiatrist and  psychoanalyst Aaron T. Beck, widely regarded[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] as the founder of cognitive therapy, published the book, Depression: Causes and Treatment.[tpl]cite book |last=Beck |first=Aaron T. |title=Depression; Causes and Treatment |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1972 |isbn=0812276523 [/tpl] Beck was dissatisfied with the conventional Freudian treatment of depression. He concluded that there was no empirical evidence for the success of Freudian psychoanalysis in the understanding or treatment of depression. In his book, Beck provided a comprehensive and empirically supported look at depression – its potential causes, symptoms, and treatments. In Chapter 2, Symptomatology of Depression, Beck describes certain “cognitive manifestations” of depression. The manifestations that Beck lists are low self-evaluation, negative expectations, self-blame and self-criticism, indecisiveness, and distortion of body image, and these are the precursors to the distortions that Burns would later describe.
In 1980, Burns published his book, Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,[tpl]cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy |location=New York |publisher=Morrow |year=1980 |isbn=0688036333 [/tpl] (with a preface from Beck) and nine years later published The Feeling Good Handbook in 1989. These books delved deeper into the concept of the definition, development, and treatment of cognitive distortions, specifically in regards to individuals diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders. This book marked the popularization[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] of cognitive behavioral therapy.

==Main types==

The cognitive distortions listed below are categories of automatic thinking, and are to be distinguished from logical fallacies.[tpl]cite web |url= http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/cds.htm#cogdis |title=Cognitive Distortions |first=John |last=Tagg |year=1996 |accessdate=October 24, 2011[/tpl]

==Cognitive restructuring==

Cognitive restructuring (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and break down maladaptive cognitive distortions. It is typically used with individuals with depression.[tpl]cite journal |first=Ryan C. |last=Martin |first2=Eric R. |last2=Dahlen |title=Cognitive emotion regulation in the prediction of depression, anxiety, stress, and anger |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=2005 |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1249–1260 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.004 [/tpl] CR therapies aim to eliminate “automatic thoughts” which create dysfunctional or negative views for individuals. Cognitive restructuring is the main component of Beck’s and Burns's cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[tpl]cite journal |last=Rush |first=A. |first2=M. |last2=Khatami |last3=Beck |first3=A. |title=Cognitive and Behavior Therapy in Chronic Depression |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=1975 |pages=398–404 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(75)80116-X[/tpl]
