Gilles Duceppe ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʒil dysɛp[/tpl]; born July 22, 1947) is a Canadian politician, and proponent of the Québec sovereignty movement. He was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada for over 20 years and was the leader of the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois for almost 15 years. He is the son of a well-known Quebec actor, Jean Duceppe. He was Leader of the Official Opposition in the Parliament of Canada from March 17, 1997, to June 1, 1997.  He resigned as party leader after the 2011 election, in which he lost his own seat to New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Hélène Laverdière and his party suffered a heavy defeat.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/05/02/cv-election-bloc-wrap-652.html|title=Duceppe quits after BQ crushed in Quebec|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=2 May 2011[/tpl]

==Early life==

Duceppe was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Hélène (née Rowley) and actor Jean Duceppe. His maternal grandfather was John James Rowley, a Briton by birth and a home child. Duceppe's British roots had him once quip that "I'm a bloke who turned Bloc."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIeelMJSFGM |title=Gilles Duceppe on Quebec Sovereignty‏ |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl]
Duceppe has told the story of an Anglophone Grade 6 teacher slapping him after he complained about preferential treatment being given to anglophone students.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/canadavotes/leadersparties/leaders-duceppe.html|title=Gilles Duceppe, elegant separatist|year=2008|work=CBC News|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] Duceppe claimed he slapped the teacher back. In any event, he became a sovereigntist by the age of 20, inspired by René Lévesque and the founding of the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2004/leadersparties/leaders/bio_duceppe.html|title=Gilles Duceppe: Leader, Bloc Québécois |publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl]
Duceppe completed his high school studies at the Collège Mont-Saint-Louis. Duceppe then studied political science at the Université de Montréal but did not complete his program of study. While attending the Université de Montréal, he became general manager of the school's newspaper, Quartier Latin. In his youth, he advocated communism, and held membership in the Workers' Communist Party of Canada (WCP), a Maoist group. Duceppe later claimed that his three-year membership in the WCP was a mistake brought on by a search for absolute answers.
However, during this period—which lasted well into his thirties—he subscribed to militant Maoist ideology and was fired from his job as a hospital orderly for belligerent activities.[tpl]cite news|title=The Globe and Mail on Duceppe|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040901171152/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040614/ELECDUCEPPE14|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=14 June 2004[/tpl] Duceppe even went so far as to intentionally spoil his 1980 sovereignty-association referendum ballot arguing that Québécois should instead focus their efforts on staying united to fight capitalism.
Before becoming a member of the federal parliament of Canada, Duceppe worked as a hospital orderly and later became a trade union negotiator. In 1968 he became vice-president of the Union générale des étudiants du Québec (General Union of Quebec Students) and in 1970 manager of the Université de Montréal student paper, Quartier latin. In 1972 he launched his career in community and union settings, as moderator for the citizen's committee of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, then in 1977 as a representative for the Royal Victoria Hospital employees. In 1981 he became a union organizer for the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (Confederation of National Trade Unions), where he became a negotiator in 1986.

==Election to Parliament==

In 1990, Duceppe was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in a by-election for the eastern Montreal riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie.  He defeated Liberal Denis Coderre, who would later serve alongside Duceppe in Parliament before becoming Mayor of Montreal. Duceppe would be handily re-elected at each election from 1993 to 2008.
Duceppe originally sat as an independent because the Bloc had not been registered by Elections Canada as a political party. All of the Bloc's other Members of Parliament had crossed the floor from either the Progressive Conservative Party or the Liberal Party earlier that year. Duceppe's victory demonstrated — for the first time — that the party had electoral support in Quebec and could win elections. Previously, many pundits (and members of other parties) predicted that the Bloc would not gain traction with ordinary voters in Quebec.[tpl]cite news|title=Gilles Duceppe: a pledge to sovereignty|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Digital+Archives/Politics/Federal+Politics/ID/1630387565/?page=6|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Digital Archives|date=23 September 1990[/tpl]

==Leadership of the Bloc Québécois==

In 1996, when Lucien Bouchard stepped down as Bloc leader to become leader of the Parti Québécois, Duceppe served as interim leader of the party. Michel Gauthier eventually became the official leader later that year. However, Gauthier's lack of visibility in both Quebec and English Canada coupled with his weak leadership resulted in the party forcing him out in 1997. Duceppe won the ensuing leadership contest and became the official leader of the Bloc Québécois and Leader of the Opposition.
In the 1997 general election, the Bloc lost official opposition status, slipping to third place in the House of Commons behind the Reform Party. Of particular note during the campaign was a visit by Duceppe to a cheese factory where he was photographed wearing a hairnet resembling a shower cap.[tpl]cite news|title=Gilles Duceppe's hairnet raises eyebrows|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Digital+Archives/Politics/Federal+Politics/ID/1632288703/?page=4|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Digital Archives|date=9 June 1997[/tpl] The photo became widely parodied on Canadian television. The Bloc  lost more support during the 2000 election, winning just 38 seats. Over this period, critics derided Duceppe as an ineffectual campaigner, though no serious challenge to his leadership emerged.
When Jean Chrétien stepped down as Prime Minister, to be succeeded by Paul Martin, the Bloc's fortunes improved markedly, particularly after the sponsorship scandal erupted. Duceppe strongly criticized the Liberals over the misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec. During the election's national debates, Duceppe's lucid explanations of Bloc Québécois policies and his chastising of the other national party leaders' promises, resulted in both the French and English media ruling him the best speaker. In the 2004 election, Duceppe's Bloc won 54 seats in the Commons, nearly equaling what it had won in its 1993 breakthrough.
With Chrétien's departure, Duceppe became the longest-serving leader of a major party in Canada. With the recent success of the Bloc, and his recently well-received performance as leader, speculation mounted that Duceppe might seek the leadership of the Parti Québécois – particularly when Bernard Landry stepped down as party leader on June 4, 2005. On June 13, 2005, Duceppe announced that he would not run for the leadership of the PQ.[tpl]cite news|title=CBC News Indepth: Parti Quebecois Timeline|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parti_quebecois/|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 November 2005[/tpl]
In the 2006 federal election, many Bloc insiders believed that Duceppe's popularity, combined with the unpopularity of the Liberal Party in Quebec, would push the Bloc Québécois over the symbolic majority vote mark among Quebec voters. Many Quebec separatists felt that a strong performance by the Bloc in the 2006 federal election would boost the sovereigntist movement and perhaps set the stage for a new referendum on secession after the anticipated Quebec provincial election expected in 2007. In actuality, a late surge in Conservative and federalist support kept the Bloc's share of the popular vote below 43% giving the Bloc only 51 seats.[tpl]cite news|title=Conservatives make breakthrough in Quebec; Bloc wins 51 seats|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conservatives-make-breakthrough-in-quebec-bloc-wins-51-seats-1.586146|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 January 2006[/tpl] The unimpressive and lackluster results on election night has called into question the level of separatist support in Quebec. In the March 26, 2007 Quebec provincial election, the Parti Québécois found itself reduced to third place in the National Assembly of Quebec, behind both the governing Quebec Liberal Party and the opposition Action démocratique du Québec. Following this disappointing result, the PQ leader, André Boisclair, announced his resignation on May 8, 2007. Duceppe confirmed on May 11, 2007, that he would seek the PQ leadership[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/duceppe-marois-will-run-for-the-pq-s-top-spot-1.675574|title=Duceppe, Marois will run for the PQ's top spot|publisher=CBC News|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] but the next day he withdrew from the race.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2007/05/12/duceppe-pq.html|title=Duceppe drops out of PQ race|publisher=CBC News|date=2007-05-12|accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl] After his withdrawal, Duceppe announced that he would support two-time leadership hopeful Pauline Marois.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/national/archives/2007/05/20070512-174804.html |title=Gilles Duceppe se retire|publisher=Lcn.canoe.com|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl]
In the 2008 federal election, Duceppe led the Bloc Québécois to 49 seats, up one from its pre-dissolution standing of 48.[tpl]cite news|title=Harper 'very pleased' with stronger minority|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/10/15/elexn-wednesday.html|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 October 2008[/tpl] However, the Bloc's share of the popular vote fell again, to 38%, its lowest result since 1997. In the 2011 federal election, the Bloc suffered a massive 43-seat loss—including many seats they'd held since their 1993 breakthrough—cutting them down to a rump of four seats. Much of that support bled to the NDP, which won 58 seats, including a sweep of the Bloc's heartlands in Quebec City and eastern Montreal. Duceppe lost his own seat to NDP challenger Hélène Laverdière by 5,400 votes. Accepting responsibility for the Bloc's crushing defeat, Duceppe announced his pending resignation as Bloc leader soon after the result was beyond doubt. He remained defiant, however, vowing not to rest "until Quebec becomes a country."[tpl]cite news|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/duceppe-resigns-as-bloc-leader-after-losing-riding/article2007598/?service=mobile|title=Duceppe resigns as Bloc leader after losing riding|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=26 May 2013[/tpl]

===Spending allegations===

In January 2012, Duceppe was accused of having used funds designated for his parliamentary office to pay the Bloc Québécois' general manager over a seven-year period. Duceppe denied any wrongdoing when testifying before the House of Commons Board of Internal Economy in February.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/02/13/pol-duceppe-internal-economy.html|title=Ex-Bloc leader's testimony raises more questions|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=13 February 2012[/tpl] In November 2012, the House of Commons Board of Internal Economy found that Duceppe misused funds. However, the board cannot take disciplinary action as the money was spent before the by-laws around the issue were changed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/11/27/pol-cp-duceppe-commons-spending-misuse.html|title=Commons board finds ex-BQ leader Duceppe misused House funds|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=27 November 2012[/tpl]
