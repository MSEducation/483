===Renovations and expansions===

In 1928 permanent seating for 3,000 was is built on the west side $15,000. In addition, there were portable stands with a similar capacity bringing the seating total to around 6,000.  In 1936, with the use of WPA labor, concrete stands seating 8,000 people were added to the west side and steel bleachers were built on the east side and in the end zones bringing the total capacity to 20,000.  1948 saw the stadium enlarged once again with the expansion of the west side structure and the addition of 12,000 concrete seats and stands in both end zones to bring the total capacity to 35,000.  In 1983, the end zone seating was removed, reducing the capacity to 32,000.  A 1986 expansion costing $7.2 million, raised without state budget appropriations, added almost 9,000 seats, consisting primarily of a 5,500-seat upper deck as well as permanent lighting and a computerized scoreboard which was replaced in 1997 with a Sony JumboTron. The Frank Turman Fieldhouse received an additional floor to its facility in 1990. Named the Leo W. Seal M-Club Centre, the addition was named in honor of Leo W. Seal, Sr., a two-year letterwinner at State, is a meeting place for the letterman organization, the M-Club. In 1999, the Turman Fieldhouse underwent numerous changes, including remodeled dressing rooms for both teams, and an all-new recruiting lounge.
In 1999, the stadium began a $50 million expansion and renovation partially funded by Floyd Davis Wade, Sr., co-founder and director of Aflac, which was completed in 2002.  As a result, the stadium was renamed Davis Wade Stadium in his honor in 2000.  The playing surface is still known as Scott Field and it seats 55,082â€”including  50 skyboxes, 1,700 club-level seats and a second upper deck seating 7,000.

The LED video system is the seventh largest high-definition video board in college football. The new board was used for the first time on November 1, 2008, during the Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Kentucky Wildcats football game. The main video display is complemented with two high definition LED advertising boards on each side of the main board, as well as a high definition LED "ribbon ticker" which spans the width of the structure below the main board. Therefore, the total video board square footage (on one structure) is 6,896 sq. ft.Construction Underway For New Video Screen To complement the all-new video system, a new state-of-the-art sound system has been installed by Pro Sound, headquartered in Miami, Florida.Of Largest HD Video Boards To Stand At Scott Field
