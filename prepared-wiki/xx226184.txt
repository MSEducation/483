The Rodes Baronetcy, of Barlborough in the County of Derby, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 14 August 1641 for Francis Rodes, of Barlborough Hall, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. The early family of Rodes was seated in Nottinghamshire. A William Rodes acquired an estate in Derbyshire by marriage. Sir Francis Rodes built Barlborough Hall in 1583-4. The first Baronet was his grandson. The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1743, when the estates passed to his sister's heirs, the Heathcotes and Heathcote-Rodes families.
