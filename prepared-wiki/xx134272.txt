[[Small Solar System body]]

CATEGORIES: Minor planets

A small Solar System body (SSSB) is an object in the Solar System that is neither a planet, nor a dwarf planet, nor a satellite.[tpl]#tag:ref|The formally correct typography for common nouns such as "small Solar System bodies" and "trans-Neptunian objects" is sentence case,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] rather than title case as used by the IAU in this instance.|group="note"[/tpl] The term was first defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.
This encompasses all comets and all minor planets other than those that are dwarf planets. Thus SSSBs are: the classical asteroids with the exception of the dwarf planet Ceres; the trojans; and the centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects with the exception of Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, Eris, and others that will turn out to be dwarf planets.

==Definition==

It is not presently clear whether a lower size bound will be established as part of the definition of small Solar System bodies in the future, or if it will encompass all material down to the level of meteoroids, the smallest macroscopic bodies in orbit around the Sun. (On a microscopic level there are even smaller objects such as interplanetary dust, particles of solar wind and free particles of hydrogen.)
Except for the largest, which are in hydrostatic equilibrium, moons differ from small Solar System bodies not in size, but in their orbits. Moons' orbits are not  centered on the Sun but around other Solar System objects such as planets, dwarf planets, and even small Solar System bodies themselves.
Some of the larger small Solar System bodies may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets, pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium.
The orbits of the vast majority of small Solar System bodies are located in two distinct areas, namely the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. These two belts possess some internal structure related to perturbations by the major planets (particularly Jupiter and Neptune, respectively), and have fairly loosely defined boundaries. Other areas of the Solar System also encompass small bodies in smaller concentrations. These include the near-Earth asteroids, centaurs, comets, and scattered disc objects.
