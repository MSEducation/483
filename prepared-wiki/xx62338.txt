[[Synovial membrane]]

CATEGORIES: Soft tissue

Synovial membrane (also known as synovium or stratum synoviale)[tpl]EMedicineDictionary|synovial+membrane[/tpl] is the soft tissue found between the articular capsule (joint capsule) and the joint cavity of synovial joints.[tpl]cite web|archivedate=2012-02-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120205102047/http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iii_1/s/synovial_membrane.aspx |url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iii_1/s/synovial_membrane.aspx |title=Medcyclopaedia - Synovial membrane |accessdate=2008-01-29 |format= |work=[/tpl] 
The word "synovium" is related to the word "synovia" (synovial fluid), which is the clear, viscous, lubricating fluid secreted by synovial membranes. The word "synvovia" or "sinovia" was coined by Paracelsus,The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and may have been derived from the Greek word "syn" ("with") and the Latin word "ovum" ("egg") because the synovial fluid in joints that have a cavity between the bearing surfaces is similar to egg white. 

==Structure==

Synovium is very variable but often has two layers 
Where the underlying subintima is loose, the intima sits on a pliable membrane, giving rise to the term synovial membrane. 
This membrane, together with the cells of the intima, provides something like an inner tube, sealing the synovial fluid from the surrounding tissue (effectively stopping the joints from being squeezed dry when subject to impact, such as running). 
The intimal cells are of two types, fibroblasts and macrophages, both of which are different in certain respects from similar cells in other tissues. 
The surface of synovium may be flat or may be covered with finger-like projections or villi, which, it is presumed, help to allow the soft tissue to change shape as the joint surfaces move one on another. 
Just beneath the intima, most synovium has a dense net of small blood vessels that provide nutrients not only for synovium but also for the avascular cartilage.  
In any one position, much of the cartilage is close enough to get nutrition direct from synovium.  
Some areas of cartilage have to obtain nutrients indirectly and may do so either from diffusion through cartilage or possibly by 'stirring' of synovial fluid.

==Mechanics==

Although a biological joint can resemble a man-made joint in being a hinge or a ball and socket, the engineering problems that nature must solve are very different because the joint works within an almost completely solid structure, with no wheels or nuts and bolts. 
In general, the bearing surfaces of manmade joints interlock, as in a hinge. This is rare for biological joints (although the badger's jaw interlocks). 
More often the surfaces are held together by cord-like ligaments. Virtually all the space between muscles, ligaments, bones, and cartilage is filled with pliable solid tissue. The fluid-filled gap is at most only a twentieth of a millimetre thick. This means that synovium has certain rather unexpected jobs to do. These may include:

==Pathology==

Synovium can become irritated and thickened in conditions such as synovitis or rheumatoid arthritis. When this happens, the synovium can become a danger to the bearing surface structure in a variety of ways. Excess synovial fluid weeping from inflamed synovium can provide a barrier to diffusion of nutrients to cartilage. The synovial cells may also use up nutrients so that the glucose level in the tissue is almost zero. These factors may lead to starvation and death of cartilage cells. Synovial cells may also produce enzymes that can digest the cartilage surface, although it is not clear that these will damage cartilage with healthy cells.
