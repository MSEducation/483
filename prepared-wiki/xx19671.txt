The Office of National Assessments (ONA) is an Australian intelligence agency.  ONA was established by the Office of National Assessments Act 1977 as an independent body directly accountable to the Prime Minister of Australia. ONA provides all-source assessments on international political, strategic and economic developments to the Prime Minister and senior ministers in the National Security Committee of Cabinet.  It also coordinates and evaluates the work and performance of Australia’s foreign intelligence agencies.  ONA is not an intelligence collection agency.
ONA is in the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio of the Australian Public Service. Its financial framework is governed by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act).

==Locations==

In October 2011, ONA moved into the Robert Marsden Hope Building, a refurbished building in the Parliamentary Triangle.New Building, Office of National Assessments.  The building is named for Justice Hope, who led two Royal Commissions into Australia's intelligence and security agencies and operations, the first of which led to the creation of ONA.Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security Third Report on Intelligence Co-ordination Machinery – Abridged Findings and Recommendations, dated 1 December 1976, National Archives of Australia.  Before its move, ONA had been a sub-tenant in the Central Office building of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in Russell, Canberra.
The Director-General of ONA is an independent statutory officer who is not subject to external direction on the content of ONA assessments. ONA has about 150 staff, including 100 analysts. The current Director-General of ONA is Allan Gyngell, a distinguished Australian diplomat, former senior advisor to former Prime Minister Paul Keating, and founder of the Lowy Institute.

==Role==

The Office of National Assessments is not a producer of intelligence; it collates intelligence data generated by DIO, ASIS, ASIO, DIGO and DSD to create analytical products. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is the primary consumer of these products, which are designed to assist the Australian Government in strategic decision making and ensure that government is fully briefed on emergent threats both in the region and globally.  Its independence from the Defence and Foreign Affairs portfolios is a deliberate attempt to generate balanced and fair analysis.

==In the media==

Although not a secret organisation, ONA usually attracts little attention. However, a striking exception occurred in 2001 when the former Prime Minister, John Howard, publicly relied upon an ONA assessment to support his claims about asylum seekers on the MV Tampa, in an incident which became known as the "Tampa affair". The ONA assessment was later leaked to the public in its entirety, showing that the assessment was ultimately based on nothing more than press releases from various government ministers.
In 2003, in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an ONA intelligence officer named Andrew Wilkie resigned from the agency, citing ethical concerns in relation to selective and exaggerated use of intelligence by the Australian Government on the matter of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.

==Flood report==

ONA has experienced substantial growth since the release of the report into intelligence agencies by Philip Flood which recommended a doubling of the agency's budget and staffing resources and formalisation of the agency's role as a coordinator and evaluator of the other Australian foreign intelligence agencies. The only ONA specific recommendation not implemented from the Flood report was the renaming of ONA to the Australian Foreign Intelligence Assessment Agency (AFIAA).Report of the Inquiry into Australian Intelligence Agencies, chapter 7

The ONA is divided into branches: Atlantic Branch; Corporate and I.T. Services; Executive & Foreign Intelligence Coordination; International Economy Branch; South Asia & Middle East Branch; North Asia Branch; Oceania Branch; Open Source Centre; Southeast Asia Branch; Strategic Analysis Branch; Transnational Issues Branch.http://www.directory.gov.au/osearch.php?ou%3DOffice%20of%20National%20Assessments%2Cou%3DOther%20Portfolio%20Bodies%5C%2C%20Committees%5C%2C%20Boards%20and%20Councils%2Co%3DPrime%20Minister%20and%20Cabinet%2Co%3DPortfolios%2 Australian Government Directory ONA
