ZZ Top (pronounced zɪː tɒp) is an American Texas blues and Hard rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, and drummer Frank Beard. One of the few major label recording groups to have consisted of the same lineup for more than forty years, ZZ Top has been praised by critics and fellow musicians alike for their technical mastery. Of the group, music writer Cub Koda said "As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers; Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom... while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zz-top-mn0000690254/biography|title=All Music Guide Artist Biography[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years (1969–1972)===

The original line-up formed in Houston, by Billy Gibbons, organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013)Houston Chronicle, February 16, 2013[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2013.html#sthash.DtdEh0NS.dpbs|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - January to June 2013|publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] and drummer Dan Mitchell. On The Tonight Show, Jimi Hendrix stated that Billy Gibbons would be the next hottest guitarist.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] There were longstanding rumors that, at the end of a tour, Hendrix gave Gibbons the pink Stratocaster he had been playing as token of his appreciation for Gibbons' level of talent. ZZ Top was managed by Waxahachie-native Bill Ham, who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, "Salt Lick", in 1969, and side B contained the song "Miller's Farm"; both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of "Salt Lick", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a band mate of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of the American Blues. Due to lack of interest from record companies, ZZ Top was presented with a record deal from London Records.[tpl]Clarify| reason = 'Due to...' doesn't make any sense in this sentence.| date = June 2013[/tpl] Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont on February 10.
In addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ZZ Top's First Album (1971) was released and saw the inclusion of the band's humor, with "barrelhouse" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres and innuendo. The music and songs  reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released Rio Grande Mud (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.

===First decade and signature sound (1973–1982)===

ZZ Top released Tres Hombres in 1973. The album's earthy and infectious sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' "growling" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album "brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process". The album included the boogie-driven "La Grange", which was written about a brothel in La Grange, Texas. On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, Fandango!, during this tour; the album showcased their prowess in exciting live audiences. Fandango! was a top ten album and its single, "Tush", peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tejas, released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to No.17 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart.[ref]
</ref> ZZ Top continued the Worldwide Texas Tour in support of ''Tejas'', though they had been touring for seven years.
The band went on what was supposed to be a 90-day break from public appearances. Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to Jamaica, and Hill went to Mexico.[ref]
