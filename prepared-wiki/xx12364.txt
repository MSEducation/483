</ref> The origins of the cow mascot are unknown, but one possibility is that it was inspired by the ''Purple Cow'' humor magazine, a student publication begun in 1907, which used the college color along with a cow.<ref name="purple cow" /> The title of the humor magazine was in reference to [[Gelett Burgess]]'s nonsense poem:
 I never saw a purple cow  
 I never hope to see one;  
But I can tell you, anyhow,  
I'd rather see than be one!  

===Alma Mater===

Williams claims the first alma mater song written by an undergraduate, "The Mountains," was by Washington Gladden of the class of 1859. [tpl]Wikisource|The Mountains[/tpl]

===Mountain Day===

On one of the first three Fridays in October, the president of the college cancels classes and declares it Mountain Day. The bells ring, announcing the event, members of the Outing Club unfurl a banner from the roof of Chapin Hall and students hike up Stony Ledge. At Stony Ledge, they celebrate with donuts, cider and a cappella performances.
The first known mention of Mountain Day was made by Williams president Edward Dorr Griffin in his notebook on college business. He wrote, under 'Holidays': "About the 24th of June a day to go to the mountain. If not then about the 14th of July. Prayers at night."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.williams.edu/home/traditions/|title=About Williams – Williams Traditions|publisher=Williams College|accessdate=2009-01-16[/tpl]
In 2009, with the threat of bad weather for each of the first three Fridays of the month, Interim-president Wagner declared "Siberian Mountain Day." Festivities were relocated from Stony Ledge to the much more accessible Stone Hill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://record.williams.edu/wp/?p=552/|title=Wagner declares 'Siberian' Mountain Day|publisher=Williams Record|accessdate=2009-11-09[/tpl]

==Athletics==

The school's athletic teams are called the Ephs (rhymes with "chiefs"), a shortening of the first name of founder Ephraim Williams.  The mascot is a Purple Cow. They participate in the NCAA's Division III and the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC). Williams also competes in skiing and squash at the Division I level. Williams is ranked first among Division III schools for athletic spending per student.Equity in Athletics
Williams has a traditional rivalry with Amherst College and Wesleyan University.  The "Little Three", a subset of NESCAC, comprises the three schools. Williams and Amherst participate in notably intense competition, dating back more than a century.[tpl]cite web| author =  Reynolds, Lauren| title =Sibling rivalry: Williams-Amherst remains heated| publisher =ESPN  | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2945751&type=story  | accessdate = 2007-09-20 [/tpl] Although Williams College typically sports purple and gold as their school colors, purple is in fact the only school color. The gold was added in order to differentiate its colors from that of rival school Amherst's purple and white uniforms. On May 3, 2009, Williams and Amherst alumni played a game of vintage baseball at Wahconah Park according to 1859-rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first college baseball game, which was played on July 2, 1859, between the two schools. Amherst-alumnus Dan Duquette was instrumental in organizing the event.[tpl]cite news | first=Gordon| last=Edes| title=Amherst and Williams re-enact first college game| date=May 4, 2009| publisher=Yahoo!

Until 1994, Williams was not permitted, by NESCAC rules, to compete in team NCAA competition. The Williams women's swimming and diving team won the school's first national title in 1981, and claimed the title in 1982 as well.  Williams played in the 2003, 2004, and 2010 men's basketball Division III national championship games, winning the title in March 2003. Men's basketball also played in the 1997, 1998 and 2011 Final Fours.  Williams was the first New England basketball team to win a Division III championship, and since they have been eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament, no team in the country has played in more Final Fours.
Williams teams to win national titles since Williams began participating in NCAA tournaments in 1994 include women's crew (nine titles, including eight straight from 2006–2013), men's tennis (four), women's tennis (eight, including six straight from 2008–2013), men's cross country (two), women's cross country (two), men's basketball, women's indoor track and field, and men's soccer.
Williams also has had success winning the NACDA Director's Cup, presented to the institution within each NCAA division that has the greatest overall success in NCAA sanctioned-championships.  Williams has won the NACDA Director's Cup 16 of the 18 years since its inception, including 13 years in a row from 1999 through 2011.
In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013 the college achieved No. 1 rankings in both academics and athletics within its peer groups (liberal arts colleges as ranked by U.S. News and World Report and NCAA Division III institutions as ranked by the Director's Cup calculations, respectively).  Dual No. 1 rankings in any single year was an unprecedented achievement among the 1,053 NCAA member institutions.[ref]
