Neopallasia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the daisy familyAuthors: Zhu Shi, Christopher J. Humphries & Michael G. Gilbert. Flora of China; Neopallasia page. Accessed Oct. 31, 2012. http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=122037 although some authors consider the genus to include three species which occur in central Asia (southern Siberia, Mongolia, and China).Watson, Linda E.; Bates, Paul L,; Evans, Timothy M,; Unwin Matthew M,; and James R. Estes. 2002. Molecular phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae (Asteraceae), including Artemisia and its allied and segregate genera. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2:17. doi:10.1186/1471-2148-2-17 Molecular data indicate that Neopallasia is closely related to Seriphidium sensu stricto and could be included with that genus within a more broadly conceived Artemisia.  

==Neopallasia pectinata==

Neopallasia includes the Neopallasia pectinata (Pallas) Poljakov (previously known as Artemisia pectinata Pallas).  Neopallasia pectinata is an erect herb, 12-40 cm tall with pectinately divided sessile oblong-elliptic leaves.  This plant of deserts grows in gravelly river valleys and wastelands at 1300-3400 m elevation.  This variable species is known from northern Chinese areas of Gansu, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Nei Mongol, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang as well as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia.  Two additional species, N. tibetica and N. yunnanensis were later treated by their author, R. Y. Ling, as synonyms of Neopallasia pectinata.Authors: 栉叶蒿 Zhi Yehao.
