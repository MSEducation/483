Theodore Lyman II (September 20, 1792 – July 18, 1849) was an American philanthropist, politician, and author, born in Boston, the son of Theodore Lyman and Lydia Pickering Williams.  He graduated at Harvard in 1810, visited Europe (1812–14), studied law, and with Edward Everett, revisited Europe in 1817–19.  From 1819 to 1822 he was an aide to John Brooks, the Governor of Massachusetts. He became brigadier general of militia in 1823, and from 1820 to 1825 he served in the State Legislature,

==Mayor of Boston==

In 1833 Lyman defeated William Sullivan, the Whig candidate, and was elected the first Democratic Mayor of Boston.  He served for two years from January 1834 through January 1836.  Lyman was such a popular mayor that when he ran for reelection he was nominated by the Whigs.

==Abolitionist==

He was a steadfast opponent of the radical abolitionists, and in August 1835 presided over a pro-slavery meeting in Boston; though a few weeks later, during an anti-Abolitionist riot, he rescued William Lloyd Garrison from the mob and confined him to jail to save his life.
He was a liberal benefactor of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and of the Farm School and was the founder of the Lyman School for Boys, a reform school in Westborough to which he gave $72,000.
