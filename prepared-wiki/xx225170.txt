[[Jar (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: Units of electrical capacitance

A jar was an early unit of capacitance once used by the Royal Navy.Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy, 1931, p.119. HMSO, London. The term relates to the capacitance of a Leyden jar.
Its value is such that one Farad is approximately 900 million jars and one jar is 1.111 nanoFarads.[tpl]cite web|title=Metal pass, English-Metric Unit Conversion Table - Electric and Magnetic|url=http://www.metalpass.com/unit/unit9.aspx|publisher=Metal Pass|accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]

==History==

With early spark-gap transmitters, changing the transmission frequency was most easily accomplished by changing the number of Leyden jars connected to the tank circuit. While it was possible to calculate the required capacitance directly, it was more usual to simply have a book of lookup tables which gave the number of jars needed for any likely wavelength.
