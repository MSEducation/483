[[Hilbert's basis theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Commutative algebra, Invariant theory, Articles containing proofs, Theorems in abstract algebra

In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, Hilbert's basis theorem states that every ideal in the ring of multivariate polynomials over a Noetherian ring is finitely generated. This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=David Hilbert|last=Hilbert|year=1890[/tpl] proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants. 
Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases.

==Proof==

Remark. We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered, the proof for the right case is similar.

===First Proof===

Suppose [tpl]math|a ⊆ RX[/tpl] were a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of countable choice) there is a sequence [tpl]math|{f0, f1, ...}.[/tpl] of polynomials such that if [tpl]math|bn[/tpl] is the left ideal generated by [tpl]math|f0, ..., fn−1[/tpl] then [tpl]math|fn[/tpl] in [tpl]math|a\bn[/tpl] is of minimal degree. It is clear that [tpl]math|{deg(f0), deg(f1), ...},[/tpl] is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let [tpl]math|an[/tpl] be the leading coefficient of [tpl]math|fn[/tpl] and let [tpl]math|b[/tpl] be the left ideal in [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl] generated by [tpl]math|{a0, a1, ...}.[/tpl] Since [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl] is left-Noetherian, we have that [tpl]math|b[/tpl] must be finitely generated; and since the [tpl]math|an[/tpl] comprise an [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl]-basis, it follows that for a finite amount of them, say [tpl]math|{a0, ..., aN−1},[/tpl] will suffice. So for example, 
Now consider 
whose leading term is equal to that of [tpl]math|fN[/tpl]; moreover, [tpl]math|g ∈ bN[/tpl]. However, [tpl]math|fN ∉ bN[/tpl], which means that [tpl]math|fN − g ∈ a\bN[/tpl] has degree less than [tpl]math|fN[/tpl], contradicting the minimality.
===Second Proof=== 
Let [tpl]math|a ⊆ RX[/tpl] be a left-ideal. Let [tpl]math|b[/tpl] be the set of leading coefficients of members of [tpl]math|a[/tpl]. This is obviously a left-ideal over [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl], and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of [tpl]math|a[/tpl]; say [tpl]math|f0, ..., fN−1[/tpl]. Let [tpl]mvar|d[/tpl] be the maximum of the set [tpl]math|{deg(f0), ..., deg(fN−1)},[/tpl] and let [tpl]math|bk[/tpl] be the set of leading coefficients of members of [tpl]math|a[/tpl], whose degree is [tpl]math|≤ k[/tpl]. As before, the [tpl]math|bk[/tpl] are left-ideals over [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl], and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of [tpl]math|a[/tpl], say 
with degrees [tpl]math|≤ k[/tpl].  Now let [tpl]math|a* ⊆ RX[/tpl] be the left-ideal generated by 
We have [tpl]math|a* ⊆ a[/tpl] and claim also [tpl]math|a ⊆ a*[/tpl]. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let [tpl]math|h ∈ a\a*[/tpl] be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl].
Thus our claim holds, and [tpl]math|a [tpl]=[/tpl] a*[/tpl] which is finitely generated.
Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] multiplying the factors, were non-negative in the constructions.

==Applications==

Let [tpl]mvar|R[/tpl] be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries. 

==Mizar System==

The Mizar project has completely formalized and automatically checked a proof of Hilbert's basis theorem in the HILBASIS file.
