SECME is a nonprofit organization originally established in 1975.  The organization is based in Atlanta, Georgia at the Georgia Institute of Technology. SECME is a strategic alliance to renew and strengthen the professional capacity of K-12 educators, motivate and mentor students, and empower parents so that all students can learn and achieve at higher levels. 

==History==

SECME, Inc., a premier primary and secondary (K-12) alliance, links engineering universities, school systems, and corporate/government investors. Its mission is to increase the pool of historically under-represented,* under-served, and differently-abled students who will be prepared to enter and complete post-secondary studies in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (under-represented being identified with African American, Hispanic, Mexican American, Native American, Pacific Islander and "differently abled".)
SECME was established in 1975 by the Engineering Deans at seven Southeastern universities: Alabama, Florida, Georgia Tech, South Carolina, Tennessee, Tennessee State, and Tuskegee. Today that alliance extends to schools, universities, science and technology based business and industry, and public and private agencies in 17 states (from New York to Arizona), the District of Columbia, and Grand Bahamas. 
For its first 22 years, SECME was an acronym for Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering. In 1997, the name was changed to SECME, Inc. SECME is chartered in the State of Georgia as a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) corporation. Initially its National Office and administrative home has been in the College of Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in midtown Atlanta. 
In creating SECME, the founding Deans acted to address two urgent—and enduring—national challenges: 1) declining engineering enrollments on campuses across the U.S., and 2) growing evidence of shortfalls in technical talent to sustain an economy—and global leadership position—increasingly dependent on technology and innovation as primary engines of growth. Their solution: to tap new talent in two groups then grossly under-represented (at less than 1 percent each) in the engineering profession—namely, minorities and women. 
Thus SECME began as a collaborative effort of school districts, engineering universities, business and industry, and government. The noble dream and determined pursuit of the founders was excellence and equity as well as needed change in K-12 education. The school-university partnership was the defining element in the original SECME “framework.” That model is, very intentionally, teacher-centered. But by impacting teachers, it is hoped all students benefit.Stabile, Tom "Tuning in to technical careers through SECME"

==Competitions==

Annually, SECME holds one main event, the Olympiad. Here, a year's worth of study, experimentation and creativity coalesces in a series of county-wide competitions between schools. Depending on the grade level and the district, events can include
Winners from district competitions may continue on to national competitions.
