Bill Crozier was the 2006 Republican candidate for Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction losing to Sandy Garrett.
Crozier had a quixotic campaign for state superintendent, which received publicity as he was advocating students to use textbooks as shields against projectiles in the event of a school invasion.
On January 8, 2007 Bill Crozier demonstrated his plan. When using handguns, the textbooks stopped bullets. Using an AK-47, the books proved no match.
