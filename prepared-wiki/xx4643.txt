===Climate===

The Atlantic Ocean and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream affect weather patterns in Ireland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp|publisher=Met.ie|title=Climate in Ireland |accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl] Temperatures differ regionally, with central and eastern areas tending to be more extreme.

Southwestern areas experience the most rainfall as a result of south westerly winds, while Dublin receives the least. Sunshine duration is highest in the southeast of the country. The far north and west are two of the windiest regions in Europe, with great potential for wind energy generation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.met.ie/climate/wind.asp|publisher=Met.ie|title=Wind over Ireland |accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl]

==Politics==

Ireland is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary system of government. The [tpl]lang|ga|Oireachtas[/tpl] is the bicameral national parliament composed of the President of Ireland and the two Houses of the Oireachtas:
[tpl]lang|ga|Seanad Éireann[/tpl] (Senate) and [tpl]lang|ga|Dáil Éireann[/tpl] (House of Representatives).Article 15.2 of the Constitution of Ireland. Áras an Uachtaráin is the official residence of the President of Ireland, while the houses of the Oireachtas meet at Leinster House in Dublin.
The President serves as head of state, and is elected for a seven-year term and may be re-elected once. The President is primarily a figurehead, but is entrusted with certain constitutional powers with the advice of the Council of State. The office has absolute discretion in some areas, such as referring a bill to the Supreme Court for a judgement on its constitutionality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=15&lang=eng |title=Office of the President – Powers and Functions |accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl] Michael D.

The [tpl]lang|ga|Taoiseach[/tpl] serves as the head of government and is appointed by the President upon the nomination of the [tpl]lang|ga|Dáil[/tpl]. Most [tpl]lang|ga|Taoisigh[/tpl] have served as the leader of the political party that gains the most seats in national elections. It has become customary for coalitions to form a government, as there has not been a single-party government since 1989.[tpl]cite book|last=McGrath|first=Conor|coauthors=Eoin O'Malley|title=Irish political studies reader: key contributions|editor=Conor McGrath, Eoin O'Malley|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|page=54|isbn= 978-0-415-44648-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H_fcNWfZ7hIC&pg=PA54&dq=%22in+1989+Haughey+called+a+snap+general+election+in+the+hope+of+gaining+an+overall+majority%22#v=onepage&q=%22in%201989%20Haughey%20called%20a%20snap%20general%20election%20in%20the%20hope%20of%20gaining%20an%20overall%20majority%22&f=false|accessdate=15 March 2011[/tpl] Enda Kenny assumed the office of Taoiseach on 9 March 2011.
The [tpl]lang|ga|Seanad[/tpl] is composed of sixty members, with eleven nominated by the [tpl]lang|ga|Taoiseach[/tpl], six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The [tpl]lang|ga|Dáil[/tpl] has 166 members ([tpl]lang|ga|Teachtaí Dála[/tpl]) elected to represent multi-seat constituencies under the system of proportional representation and by means of the single transferable vote.
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members can be selected from the [tpl]lang|ga|Seanad[/tpl], and the [tpl]lang|ga|Taoiseach[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ga|Tánaiste[/tpl] (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance must be members of the [tpl]lang|ga|Dáil[/tpl]. The Dáil must be dissolved within five years after its first meeting following the previous election,[tpl]cite irish legislation |year=1992 |type=pub |number=23 |section=33 |name=Electoral Act, 1992[/tpl] and a general election for members of the Dáil must take place no later than thirty days after the dissolution. According to the Constitution of Ireland, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current government is a coalition administration led by [tpl]lang|ga|Fine Gael[/tpl] with Enda Kenny as [tpl]lang|ga|Taoiseach[/tpl], supported by the Labour Party with Eamon Gilmore as [tpl]lang|ga|Tánaiste[/tpl]. Opposition parties in the current [tpl]lang|ga|Dáil[/tpl] are Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Socialist Party, the PBPA, the WUAG, as well as a number of Independents.
thumb|Government BuildingsIreland has been a member state of the European Union since 1973, but has chosen to remain outside the Schengen Area. Citizens of the United Kingdom can freely enter the country without a passport due to the Common Travel Area, which is a passport-free zone comprising the islands of Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. However, some identification is required at airports and seaports.

===Local government===

The Local Government Act 1898 is the founding document of the present system of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment to the constitution of 1999 provided for its constitutional recognition. The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are not always coterminous with administrative divisions although they are generally used as a geographical frame of reference by the population of Ireland. County Tipperary was divided into North Tipperary and South Tipperary in 1898, while County Dublin was divided into Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin in 1994. The Local Government Act 2001 established a two-tier structure, with the top tier consisting of twenty-nine county councils and five city councils. The five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford are administered separately by their own city councils.

|}

The second tier consists of five borough councils and seventy-five town councils. The five boroughs of Kilkenny, Sligo, Drogheda, Clonmel, and Wexford have a certain level of autonomy within their counties, but have no additional responsibilities.[tpl]cite book|last=Callanan|first=Mark |coauthors=Justin F.

Dáil constituencies are required to follow county boundaries as much as possible. Counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies, some of more than one county, but generally do not cross county boundaries. The counties are grouped into eight regions, each with a Regional Authority composed of members delegated by the various county and city councils in the region. The regions do not have any direct administrative role as such, but they serve for planning, coordination and statistical purposes.

===Law===

Ireland has a common law legal system with a written constitution that provides for a parliamentary democracy. The court system consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, all of which apply the law of Ireland. Trials for serious offences must usually be held before a jury. The High Court and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of judicial review, to determine the compatibility of laws and activities of other institutions of the state with the constitution and the law. Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public. The Criminal Courts of Justice is the principal building for the criminal courts.First case set for new criminal courts, Carol Coulter, The Irish Times, 24 November 2009New order in court as €140m legal 'Pantheon' opens doors, Dearbhail McDonald, Irish Independent, 24 November 2009 It includes the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, Court of Criminal Appeal, Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and Central Criminal Court.
Garda Síochána na hÉireann (Guardians of the Peace of Ireland), more commonly referred to as the Gardaí, is the state's civilian police force. The force is responsible for all aspects of civil policing, both in terms of territory and infrastructure. It is headed by the Garda Commissioner, who is appointed by the Government. Most uniformed members do not routinely carry firearms. Standard policing is traditionally carried out by uniformed officers equipped only with a baton and pepper spray.[ref]

The Póilíní Airm (Military Police) is the corps of the Irish Army responsible for the provision of policing service personnel and providing a military police presence to forces while on exercise and deployment. In wartime, additional tasks include the provision of a traffic control organisation to allow rapid movement of military formations to their mission areas.

===Foreign relations===

Foreign relations are substantially influenced by membership of the European Union, although bilateral relations with the United States and United Kingdom are also important.See Michael J. Geary, An Inconvenient Wait: Ireland's Quest for Membership of the EEC, 1957–73 (Institute of Public Administration, 2009) (ISBN 978-1-904541-83-7) It held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on six occasions, most recently from January to June 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:001:0011:0012:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl]
Ireland tends towards independence in foreign policy, thus the country is not a member of NATO and has a longstanding policy of military neutrality. This policy has helped the Irish Defence Forces to be successful in their contributions to peace-keeping missions with the United Nations since 1960, during the Congo Crisis and subsequently in Cyprus, Lebanon and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.military.ie/overseas/index.htm|title=Ireland and the United Nations|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]

The Irish Air Corps is the air component of the Defence Forces and operates sixteen fixed wing aircraft and eight helicopters. The Irish Naval Service is Ireland's Navy, and operates eight patrol ships, and smaller numbers of inflatable boats and training vessels, and has highly trained armed boarding parties capable of seizing a ship and a special unit of frogmen. Although the Naval Service has no heavy warships, all Irish vessels have significant firepower. The military includes the Reserve Defence Forces (Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) for non-active reservists. Ireland's special forces are the elite Army Ranger Wing, which trains and operates with international special operations units. The President is the formal Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, but in practice he answers to the Government via the Minister for Defence.

==Economy==

===Development===

The Irish economy has transformed since the 1980s from being predominantly agricultural to a modern knowledge economy focused on high technology industries and services. Ireland adopted the euro currency in 2002 along with eleven other EU member states. The country is heavily reliant on Foreign Direct Investment and has attracted several multinational corporations due to a highly educated workforce and a low corporation tax rate.[tpl]cite web |title = Annual Competitiveness Report 2008, Volume One: Benchmarking Ireland's Performance |publisher = NCC |year = 2009 |url=http://www.forfas.ie/media/ncc090108_acr_2008.pdf |accessdate =1 July 2009[/tpl]
Companies such as Intel invested in Ireland during the late 1980s, later followed by Microsoft and Google. Ireland is ranked as the ninth most economically free economy in the world, according to the Index of Economic Freedom. In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the OECD and EU. However, the country ranks below the OECD average in terms of GNP per capita. GDP is significantly greater than GNP due to the large number of multinational corporations based in Ireland.
Beginning in the early 1990s, the country experienced unprecedented economic growth fuelled by a dramatic rise in consumer spending, construction and investment, which became known as the Celtic Tiger period. The pace of growth slowed during 2007 and led to the burst of a major property bubble which had developed over time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esri.ie/irish_economy |title=ESRI – Irish Economy |publisher=Esri.ie |accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl] The dramatic fall in property prices highlighted the over-exposure of the economy to construction and contributed to the Irish banking crisis.

===Trade and energy===

Although multinational corporations dominate Ireland's export sector, exports from other sources also contribute significantly to the national income. The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices and software-related goods and services in the world. Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies (such as Ryanair, Kerry Group and Smurfit Kappa Group) and exports of mineral resources: Ireland is the seventh largest producer of zinc concentrates, and the twelfth largest producer of lead concentrates. The country also has significant deposits of gypsum, limestone, and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite. Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment.
Other goods exports include agri-food, cattle, beef, dairy products, and aluminum. Ireland's major imports include data processing equipment, chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, textiles, and clothing. Financial services provided by multinational corporations based at the Irish Financial Services Centre also contribute to Irish exports.The difference between exports (€89.4 billion) and imports (€45.5 billion) resulted an annual trade surplus of €43.9 billion in 2010, which is the highest trade surplus relative to GDP achieved by any EU member state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/statistics/botmaintrpartners.htm |title=CSO – Main Trading Partners 2010 |publisher=Cso.ie |accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

Railway services are provided by Iarnród Éireann, which operates all internal intercity, commuter and freight railway services in the country. Dublin is the centre of the network with two main stations, Heuston station and Connolly station, linking to the country's cities and main towns. The Enterprise service, which runs jointly with Northern Ireland Railways, connects Dublin and Belfast. Dublin has a steadily improving public transport network including the DART, Luas, Dublin Bus, and dublinbikes.
Motorways, national primary roads and national secondary roads are managed by the National Roads Authority, while regional roads and local roads are managed by the local authorities in each of their respective areas. The road network is primarily focused on the capital, but motorways have been extended to other cities as part of the Transport 21 capital investment programme, as a result motorways have been completed between Dublin and a number of other major Irish cities including Cork, Limerick and Galway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.transport21.ie/What_Is_Transport_21/Transport_21/What_is_Transport_21.html |title=Transport 21 Website – What is Transport 21? |publisher=Transport21.ie |accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Dublin has been the focus of major projects such as the East-Link and West-Link toll-bridges, as well as the Dublin Port Tunnel.

An ESRI report from 2006 found that 35% of migrants surveyed reported having experienced harassment on the street, on public transport or in public places. However, discrimination was not experienced equally among immigrants. North Africans and Asians generally experienced much lower levels of discrimination than black south/central Africans, as did Central Europeans from the more recent newcomers to the European Union (mainly Poles after Poland joined the EU as a full member in 2004), who comprise the majority of Irish immigrants. In the same survey, immigrants reported being most likely to socialise with people from their own country of origin in Ireland, followed by Irish people. Although this varied too between regional groups with Asians, for example, reporting the least difficulty in socialising with Irish people and North Africans reporting the most difficulty.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.esri.ie/UserFiles/publications/20061106142132/BKMNINT193.pdf|title=Migrants' Experience of Racism and Discrimination in Ireland|author1=Frances McGinnity|author2=Philip J.

===Languages===

Irish is the "national language" according to the Constitution, but English is the dominant language. In the 2006 census, 39% of the population regarded themselves as competent in Irish. Irish is spoken as a community language only in a small number of rural areas mostly in the west of the country, collectively known as the Gaeltacht. Except in Gaeltacht regions, road signs are usually bilingual.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/si/0164.html |title=S.I.

Most Government publications are available in both languages, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish. Media in Irish exist on TV (TG4), radio (e.g. RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta) and print (e.g. Foinse). In the Irish Defence Forces, all foot and arms drill commands are given in the Irish language.
As a result of immigration, Polish is the most widely spoken language in Ireland after English and Irish. Several other Central European languages (namely Polish, Czech, Hungarian and Slovak), as well as Northern European languages (Lithuanian and Latvian) are also spoken on a day-to-day basis. Other languages spoken in Ireland include Shelta, spoken by Irish Travellers, and a dialect of Scots is spoken by some descendants of Scottish settlers in Donegal.An introduction to the Ulster-Scots Language, Ulster-Scots Agency. Most secondary school students choose to learn one or two foreign languages. Languages available for the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate include French, German, Italian and Spanish; Leaving Certificate students can also study Arabic, Japanese, Swedish, Finnish and Russian. Some secondary schools also offer Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin. The study of Irish is compulsory for Leaving Certificate students, but some may qualify for an exemption in some circumstances, such as learning difficulties or entering the country after age 11.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.education.ie/robots/view.jsp?pcategory=17216&language=EN&ecategory=42741&link=link001&doc=38941 |title=Pupils exempt from the study of the Irish language (per Circular M10/94 – Revision of Rule 46 of the "Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools" in relation to exemption from Irish) |publisher=Department of Education and Skills |accessdate=27 October 2010 [/tpl]

===Healthcare===

Although the Irish healthcare system comes under constant criticism from politicians and the public, Ireland has one of the most developed systems of healthcare in the world and healthcare professionals who are highly trained. Healthcare in Ireland is provided by both public and private healthcare providers.
The Minister for Health has responsibility for setting overall health service policy. Every resident of Ireland is entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are provided free of charge and children up to the age of 6 months. Emergency care is provided to patients who present to a hospital Emergency Department. However, visitors to Emergency Departments in non-emergency situations who are not referred by their GP may incur a fee of €100. In some circumstances this fee is not payable or may be waived.[tpl]citation|title=Charges for hospital services |publisher=Citizens Information board |date=26 July 2011[/tpl]
Anyone holding a European Health Insurance Card is entitled to free maintenance and treatment in public beds in Health Service Executive and voluntary hospitals. Outpatient services are also provided for free. However, the majority of patients on median incomes or above are required to pay subsidised hospital charges. Private health insurance is available to the population for those who want to avail of it.
The average life expectancy in Ireland in 2012 is 81 years (OECD average life expectancy in 2012 was 80 years), with 78.2 years for men and 83.6 years for women.OECD Better Life Index It has the highest birth rate in the EU (16.8 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to an EU average of 10.7)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0727/breaking38.html |title=Ireland has EU's highest birth rate |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date= 7 July 2010|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl] and a very low infant mortality rate (3.5 per 1,000 live births). The Irish healthcare system ranked 13th out of 34 European countries in 2012 according to the European Health Consumer Index produced by Health Consumer Powerhouse. The same report ranked The Irish healthcare system as having the 8th best health outcomes but only the 21st most accessible system in Europe.

===Education===

Ireland has three levels of education: primary, secondary and higher education. The education systems are largely under the direction of the Government via the Minister for Education and Skills. Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities. Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination.Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 (Section 17)[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The Leaving Certificate, which is taken after two years of study, is the final examination in the secondary school system. Those intending to pursue higher education normally take this examination, with access to third-level courses generally depending on results obtained from the best six subjects taken, on a competitive basis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.educationireland.ie/irish-education/secondary-education/leaving-certificate.html |title=Education Ireland – Leaving Certificate |publisher=Educationireland.ie |accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl] Third-level education awards are conferred by at least 38 Higher Education Institutions - this includes the constituent or linked colleges of seven universities, plus other designated institutions of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.

===Religion===

Religious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland. Christianity is the predominant religion, with the Roman Catholic Church as the largest church. In 2011, 84.2% of the population identified themselves as Roman Catholic, 4.6% as Protestant or another Christian religion, 1.1% as Muslim, and 6.2% as having no religion – making them the second largest group after Roman Catholicism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile,7,Education,Ethnicity,and,Irish,Traveller,entire,doc.pdf |title=Amended Final Principal Demographic Results 2011 |format=PDF |year=2011 |accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] According to a Georgetown University study, the country has one of the highest rates of regular Mass attendance in the Western World.Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980–2000] – World Values Survey (WVS)

The Church of Ireland is the second largest Christian denomination. Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but has recently experienced an increase, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively.[tpl]cite book|title=Final Principal Demographic Results 2006|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2010|year=2007|publisher=Central Statistics Office |isbn=0-7557-7169-9|pages=31 (Table Q)[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Ireland's patron saints are Saint Patrick, Saint Bridget and Saint Columba. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations.
As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the Fifth Amendment in a referendum. Article 44 still remains in the Constitution: The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion. The article also establishes freedom of religion, prohibits endowment of any religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.
Religious studies was introduced as an optional Junior Certificate subject in 2001. Despite many schools being run by religious organisations, a secularist trend is occurring among younger generations.[tpl]cite news|last=Daniszewski|first=John|title=Catholicism Losing Ground in Ireland|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-ireland17apr17,0,5254747.story|newspaper=LA Times|accessdate=29 August 2011|date=17 April 2005[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|last=Lawler|first=Phil|title=Ireland threatened by secularism, Pope tells new envoy|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=53564|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=Catholic World News|date=17 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Irish poll shows parents no longer want to force religion on to children|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/irishpollshowsparentsnolongerwan.html|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=29 August 2011|location=United Kingdom|date=13 April 2007[/tpl] Religious schools cannot discriminate against pupils concerning religion. A sanctioned system of preference does exist, where students of a particular religion may be accepted before those who do not share the ethos of the school, in a case where a school's quota has already been reached.

===Literature===

Ireland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages. Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield. Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross. Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel Dracula.
James Joyce (1882–1941) published his most famous work Ulysses in 1922, which is an interpretation of the Odyssey set in Dublin. Edith Somerville continued writing after the death of her partner Martin Ross in 1915. Dublin's Annie M. P. Smithson was one of several authors catering for fans of romantic fiction in the 1920s and 1930s. After the Second World War, popular novels were published by, among others, Brian O'Nolan, who published as Flann O'Brien, Elizabeth Bowen, and Kate O'Brien. During the final decades of the 20th century, Edna O'Brien, John McGahern, Maeve Binchy, Joseph O'Connor, Roddy Doyle, Colm Tóibín, and John Banville came to the fore as novelists.
Patricia Lynch (1898–1972) was a prolific children's author, while Eoin Colfer has been particularly successful in this genre in recent years. In the genre of the short story, which is a form favoured by many Irish writers, the most prominent figures include Seán Ó Faoláin, Frank O'Connor and William Trevor. Well known Irish poets include Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas McCarthy, Dermot Bolger, and Nobel Prize in Literature laureates William Butler Yeats and Seamus Heaney (born in Northern Ireland but resided in Dublin). Prominent writers in the Irish language are Pádraic Ó Conaire, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Séamus Ó Grianna, and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill.
The history of Irish theatre begins with the expansion of the English administration in Dublin during the early 17th century, and since then, Ireland has significantly contributed to English drama. In its early history, theatrical productions in Ireland tended to serve political purposes, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments were staged. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their London equivalents, and British productions frequently found their way to the Irish stage. However, most Irish playwrights went abroad to establish themselves. In the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan were two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage at that time. At the beginning of the 20th century, theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of writers, directors and performers began to emerge, which allowed many Irish playwrights to learn their trade and establish their reputations in Ireland rather than in Britain or the United States. Following in the tradition of acclaimed practitioners, principally Oscar Wilde and Literature Nobel Prize laureates George Bernard Shaw (1925), and Samuel Beckett (1969), playwrights such as Seán O'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Brendan Behan, Conor McPherson, and Billy Roche have gained popular success.[tpl]cite book|last =Houston|first =Eugenie|title =Working and Living in Ireland|publisher =Working and Living Publications|year =2001|isbn=0-9536896-8-9[/tpl] Other Irish playwrights of the 20th century include Denis Johnston, Thomas Kilroy, Tom Murphy, Hugh Leonard, Frank McGuinness, and John B. Keane.

===Music and dance===

Irish traditional music has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects. It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues.
There are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the RTÉ Performing Groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmc.ie/links/index.html |title=Contemporary Music Ireland |publisher=Contemporary Music Centre – Links |accessdate=9 July 2009[/tpl] Ireland also has three opera organisations. Opera Ireland produces large-scale operas in Dublin, the Opera Theatre Company tours its chamber-style operas throughout the country, and the annual Wexford Opera Festival, which promotes lesser-known operas, takes place during October and November.
Ireland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1965.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rte.ie/ten/2001/0404/mooreb.html |title=Showband legend Butch Moore dies |publisher=RTÉ |date=4 April 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Its first win was in 1970, when Dana won with All Kinds of Everything.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/thedailyshow/2011/0307/dana107.html |title=Dana |publisher=RTÉ Television |work=The Daily Show: Celebrity Guests |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] It has subsequently won the competition six more times,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eurovisioncovers.co.uk/stats.htm |title=Eurovision Song Contest Statistics |publisher=eurovisioncovers.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/a_little_bit_eurovision.html |title=A Little Bit Eurovision |publisher=RTÉ Television |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] the highest number of wins by any competing country.

Irish dance can broadly be divided into social dance and performance dance. Irish social dance can be divided into céilí and set dancing. Irish set dances are quadrilles, danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while céilí dances are danced by varied formations of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as stepdance. Irish stepdance, popularised by the show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in "soft shoe" or "hard shoe".

With the erection of buildings such as The Custom House, Four Courts, General Post Office and King's Inns, the neoclassical and Georgian styles flourished, especially in Dublin. Georgian townhouses produced streets of singular distinction, particularly in Dublin, Limerick and Cork. Following Catholic Emancipation, cathedrals and churches influenced by the French Gothic Revival emerged, such as St Colman's and St Finbarre's.

===Cuisine===

Irish cuisine was traditionally based on meat and dairy, supplemented with vegetables and seafood. The potato eventually formed the basis of many traditional Irish dishes after its introduction in the 16th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irelandby.com/recipes/recipes.htm |title=Traditional Irish Cuisine |accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl] Examples of popular Irish cuisine include boxty, colcannon, coddle, stew, and bacon and cabbage. Ireland is famous for the full Irish breakfast, which involves a fried or grilled meal generally consisting of bacon, egg, sausage, pudding, and fried tomato. Apart from the significant influence by European and international dishes, there has been a recent emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline. The most popular fish include salmon and cod. Traditional breads include soda bread and wheaten bread. Barmbrack is a yeasted bread with added sultanas and raisins.
Popular everyday beverages among the Irish include tea and coffee. Alcoholic drinks associated with Ireland include Poitín and the world famous Guinness, which is a dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate in Dublin. Irish whiskey is also popular throughout the country, and comes in various forms, including single malt, single grain and blended whiskey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irelandlogue.com/food-drink |title=Food & Drink in Ireland |accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl]

===State symbols===

The state shares many symbols with the island of Ireland. These include the colours green and blue, animals such as the Irish wolfhound and stags, structures such as round towers and celtic crosses, and designs such as Celtic knots and spirals. These symbols are used by state institutions as well as private bodies in the Republic of Ireland. This section only describes the official symbols of the state: official flags, arms, anthems and trademarks.
The flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange. The flag originates with the Young Ireland movement of the mid-19th century but was not popularised until its use during the Easter Rising of 1916. The colours represent the Gaelic tradition (green) and the followers of William of Orange in Ireland (orange), with white representing the aspiration for peace between them. It was adopted as the flag of the Irish Free State in 1922 and continues to be used as the sole flag and ensign of the state. A naval jack, a green flag with a yellow harp, is set out in Defence Forces Regulations and flown from the mast head of ships in addition to the national flag in limited circumstances (e.g. when a ship is not underway). It is based on the unofficial green ensign of Ireland used in the 18th and 19th centuries and the traditional green flag of Ireland dating from the 16th century.
Like the national flag, the national anthem, [tpl]lang|ga|Amhrán na bhFiann[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-en|A Soldier's Song[/tpl]), has its roots in the Easter Rising, when the song was sung by the rebels. Although originally composed in English in 1912, the song was translated into Irish in 1923 and the Irish-language version is more commonly sung today. The song was adopted as the national anthem of the Irish Free State in 1926 and continues as the national anthem of the state. The first four bars of the chorus followed by the last five comprise the presidential salute. [tpl]lang|ga|An Amhran Dochais[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-en|The Song of Hope[/tpl]), set to a traditional air called [tpl]lang|ga|Mor Chluana[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-en|More of Cloyne[/tpl]), collected by Patrick Weston Joyce, and once a potential national anthem, is played as a salute on the Taoiseach's (Prime Minister) arrival at formal occasions.
The arms of Ireland originate as the arms of the monarchs of Ireland and can be is recorded was being the arms of the King of Ireland in the 12th century. From the union of the crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1603, they have appeared quartered on the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Today, they are the personal arms of the President of Ireland whilst he or she is in office and are flown as the presidential standard. The harp symbol is used extensively by the state to mark official documents, Irish coinage and on the seal of the President of Ireland.
Shamrock, a type of clover or trefoil, is a national symbol of Ireland since the 17th century when it became customary to wear it as a symbol on St. Patrick's Day. Both the harp and shamrock are registered by the state as trademarks of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day, the 17th of March, is the national holiday.
