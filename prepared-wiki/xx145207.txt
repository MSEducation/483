==Career as an activist==

Rosalie Kunoth spent ten years from 1960 as a nun in the Melbourne Anglican Community of the Holy Name. She then left the order, married and started work with the department of Aboriginal Affairs, setting up the first home in Victoria for Aboriginal children.[tpl]cite web|last=Whennan|first=Irene|title=Report to Marion Council, SA on the Australian Local Government Women's Association Conference 2009|url=http://www.marion.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/GC230609_-_Clr_Whennan_ALGWA_Report.pdf|accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]
Returning to the Alice Springs region, she worked for Aboriginal Hostels, the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
The then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, appointed her an adviser on Aboriginal affairs. Kunoth stood for election to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1979. She campaigned to oppose the proposed construction of a dam that threatened to destroy land sacred to her people. She lost that election but went on to continuing activism working to improve the lives of indigenous people.  Presently she is Chancellor of the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education.
By 2008 she had returned to the Utopia homelands, 260k north east of Alice Springs. They have about 1200 people in 16 different communities. Since 2008 she has been president of Barkly Shire.[tpl]cite web|last=ABC News 17 November 2008|title=Central Australian shires elect presidents|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-17/central-australian-shires-elect-presidents/208158|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl]  In August of that year she went to Canberra for Amnesty International and denounced Federal government intervention in the Northern Territory as a "huge violation of human rights," displacing "more indigenous people from their traditional lands, depriving them of opportunities to speak their native language and severing links with their culture. … Our beings are very fragile. We disagree with being herded by the army into the big centres."The Age, Melbourne, 10 August 2011, p. 5.  Film star turned politician blasts intervention
Two months later: "It's not that they're coming here with bulldozers or getting the army to move us. It's that they're trying to starve us out of our home. … They won't support us becoming sustainable in our own right. If you're made to feel a second-class humanity, if it's not ethnic cleansing, please let me know what is." Utopia, which is world-famous for its dot paintings, was trying to start its own cattle business and wanted to be a cultural centre, she said.The Age, Melbourne, 10 October 2010, p. 7. Conditions in Utopia devastating, says Amnesty chief
At the 2013 Federal election, Rosalie Kunoth-Monks stood unsuccessfully as a senate candidate in the Northern Territory on behalf of the First Nations Political Party.[tpl]cite web|title=Respect and listen|url=http://www.respectandlisten.org/miscellaneous/rosalie-kunoth-monks.html|accessdate=23 August 2013[/tpl]
