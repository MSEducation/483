MacWEEK was a controlled-circulation weekly Apple Macintosh trade journal based in San Francisco founded by Michael Tchong, John Anderson, Glenn Patch, Dick Govatski, and Michael F. Billings. It featured a back-page rumor column penned by the pseudonymous Mac the Knife.
Founded in 1987, it was acquired by Ziff-Davis in 1988. In 1998, as part of a strategy change, the print publication was relaunched as eMediaWeekly,http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-211229.html&st.ne.2.head which caused a number of its existing sponsors to withhold their advertising. eMediaWeekly was published from August 24, 1998[tpl]cite web|url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/04890 |title=Farewell MacWEEK, Welcome e/media Weekly |accessdate=July 30, 2009 |last=Engst |first=Adam C. |date=May 18, 1998 |work=TidBITS |publisher=TidBITS Publishing, Inc.

Apple employees, following the example of executive Jean-Louis Gassee, at times referred to it as "MacLeak", yet some relied on it to distribute information they could not officially disclose, to draw internal corporate attention or funding to their projects, or to find out what was happening in their own company.
