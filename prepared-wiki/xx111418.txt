==Career==

Plouffe began his political career by working for Senator Tom Harkin's 1990 re-election campaign.Obama's Aide Plouffe Plots Victory From Background, by Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg.com, June 16, 2008. (url accessed July 4, 2008). He later worked as a state field director for Harkin's unsuccessful 1992 Presidential campaign. In the same year he successfully managed Congressman John Olver's first re-election bid in Massachusetts. In 1994 Plouffe managed Delaware Attorney General Charles M. Oberly's unsuccessful campaign against Senator William V. Roth. He then worked as campaign director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1995. In 1996 Plouffe managed Bob Torricelli's successful campaign to fill Bill Bradley's New Jersey seat in the United States Senate. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
From 1997-98, Plouffe served as Democratic leader Dick Gephardt's Deputy Chief of Staff. In 1999-2000, as executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Plouffe led Democrats to gains that came within several thousand votes of winning back the House.  He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to unusually high fundraising amounts, during his tenure at the DCCC. In the winter of 2000, Plouffe joined AKPD Message and Media but left briefly to serve as a strategist for Gephardt's unsuccessful Presidential bid. He returned to the firm and became a partner in February 2004. Beginning in 2003, Plouffe and fellow AKPD partner David Axelrod worked on Barack Obama's 2004 Illinois Senate campaign, beginning his association with Obama. Plouffe worked with Axelrod on the successful 2006 campaign of Deval Patrick for Governor of Massachusetts. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign==

Plouffe was the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign. He is credited with the campaign's successful overall strategy in the race (primarily against Senator Hillary Clinton) for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, to focus on the first caucus in Iowa and on maximizing the number of pledged delegates, as opposed to focusing on states with primaries and the overall popular vote. He is also credited by The New Republic for Obama's success in the Iowa caucus and for crafting an overall strategy to prolong the primary past Super Tuesday. The Chicago Tribune writes, "Plouffe was the mastermind behind a winning strategy that looked well past Super Tuesday's contests on Feb. 5 and placed value on large and small states."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-plouffe-obamajun09,0,3326662.story|title=Obama's campaign chief: low profile, high impact|first=John|last=McCormick|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-09[/tpl] Plouffe also maintained discipline over communications in the campaign, including controlling leaks and releasing information about the campaign on its terms. Averse to publicity himself, Plouffe's control over the internal workings of the Obama campaign successfully avoided the publicly aired squabbles that frequently trouble other campaigns.
In June 2008, when then-Senator Obama clinched the Democratic Party nomination, he thanked Plouffe for being the one "who never gets any credit, but has built the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States."  In May 2008, David Axelrod praised Plouffe, stating he had "done the most magnificent job of managing a campaign that I've seen in my life of watching presidential politics. To start something like this from scratch and build what we have built was a truly remarkable thing."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/01/AR2008050103509.html?nav=hcmodule|title=The Player at Bat - David Axelrod, the Man With Obama's Game Plan, Is Also the Candidate's No. 1 Fan|first=Robert G.|last=Kaiser|publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2008-05-06[/tpl] After winning the election on November 4, Obama credited Plouffe in his acceptance speech, calling him "the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the . . . best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America."[ref]

==2011–2013 Senior Advisor to the President==

In January 2011, Plouffe joined the White House as Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor. Plouffe replaced David Axelrod as Senior Advisor when Axelrod returned to Chicago to help run President Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.[tpl]cite news|last=Stone|first=Daniel|title=David Plouffe, Obama's Whiz Kid, Returns|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/01/07/david-plouffe-obamas-whiz-kid-returns-to-the-white-house.html|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=The Daily Beast/Newsweek|date=1/7/2011[/tpl]
In his role as Senior Advisor, Plouffe led the crafting of White House strategy and communicating the President’s message.  After a successful reelection and inauguration of President Obama, Plouffe departed the White House in January 2013. During a national news event, on his final day in the White House, Plouffe was singled out by the President saying, “What people don’t always realize, because he doesn’t like to show it, is the reason he does this stuff is because he cares deeply about people. And he cares about justice, and he cares about making sure that everybody gets a shot in life.  And, those values have motivated him to do incredible things, and were it not for him, we would not have been as effective a White House and I probably wouldn’t be here.”[tpl]cite web|last=White House|first=The|title=Remarks by the President at a Personnel Announcement|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/25/remarks-president-personnel-announcemente|accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl]

==Controversy==

Plouffe has drawn criticism for his paid speaking engagements abroad while on hiatus from advising Obama. In early 2009, Plouffe spoke in Baku, Azerbaijan for $50,000. The event's sponsor had ties to the authoritarian government in the country. Following complaints from human rights groups, Plouffe donated his speaking fees to the National Democratic Institute.[tpl]cite news |title=From Knife Seller to the President’s Hard Edge |author=Mark Leibovich |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/us/politics/plouffe-obama-aide-lends-firm-hand-to-campaign.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 February 2012 |page=A1 |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Plouffe speech in Azerbaijan draws fire |author=Kenneth Vogel |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/18818.html |newspaper=Politico |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl]
In December 2010, Plouffe received $100,000 for two speeches in Nigeria from an affiliate of the South African telecommunications company MTN Group. At the time, MTN had been doing business with the government of Iran since 2005. Recently, MTN has come under increased scrutiny by the U.S. for allegations that the Iranian government has used the MTN network in the country to track and monitor dissidents. MTN has been listed on the "Iran Business Registry" of prominent watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran since 2009.[tpl]cite news |title=Obama associate got $100,000 fee from affiliate of firm doing business with Iran |author=Tom Hamburger and Peter Wallsten |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-associate-got-100000-fee-from-affiliate-of-firm-doing-business-with-iran/2012/08/05/5e6888a2-dda2-11e1-8e43-4a3c4375504a_print.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=5 August 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl]
White House spokesman Eric Schultz explained that Plouffe only spoke to the group about digital communications and cellular technology, and declined to meet with the company's leadership. Schultz also said the criticism of Plouffe's speeches before he joined the White House was "misplaced."

In 2013, in response to Congressman Darrell Issa's accusations that the Obama administration knew about the IRS targeting of not-for-profit conservative groups for extra scrutiny, Plouffe tweeted: "Strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler. And loose ethically today" referring to two incidents in Issa's past. In 1972, while a teenager, Issa was accused of stealing a Maserati sports car; the charges were later dropped. In 1982, a Cleveland warehouse belonging to Issa burned to the ground. The fire was ruled suspicious and Issa collected an insurance payout, but he was not charged with any crime.Washington Post: "Plouffe calls Issa ‘Mr. Grand Theft Auto’" By Aaron Blake June 3, 2013Baltimore Jewish Life: "Plouffe, White House Aides Target Issa" by Bill Hoffmann June 3, 2013USA Today: "Rep.
