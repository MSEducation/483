BBC Sessions is a compilation album featuring studio sessions and a live concert recorded by English rock group Led Zeppelin for the BBC. It was released on 11 November 1997, by Atlantic Records. This was the first release of new Led Zeppelin material in seven years. Disc 1 consists of material from four different 1969 BBC sessions. Disc 2 contains most of the 1 April 1971 concert from the Paris Theatre in London.[tpl]cite book | author= Lewis, Dave| title=Led Zeppelin: The 'Tight but Loose' Files': Celebration II| edition=1st | location=London| publisher= Omnibus Press | year=2003| page=8| chapter=Led Zeppelin at the BBC| isbn=1-84449-056-4[/tpl] Disc 3 was only included in a limited run of album releases and features rare interviews from 1969, 1976/1977, and 1990.
Countless bootlegs of these recordings circulated for years before the official release. This release was widely welcomed by Led Zeppelin fans as the first live release since The Song Remains the Same in 1976. Others have criticised the decision to edit some of the songs and drop others that were recorded for the BBC. Most notable are one session from 1969 which included the unreleased song "Sunshine Woman", and about 7 minutes of the "Whole Lotta Love" medley from 1971.[tpl]cite book | author= Lewis, Dave| title=Led Zeppelin: The Complete Guide to Their Music| edition=1st | location=London| publisher= Omnibus Press | year=2004| page=76| chapter=BBC Sessions| isbn=1-84449-141-2[/tpl]
