CATEGORIES: Novial, Constructed languages, International auxiliary languages, 1928 introductions

Novial ("new") + IAL, International Auxiliary Language is a constructed international auxiliary language (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different native languages.  It was devised by Otto Jespersen, a Danish linguist who was previously involved in the Ido movement, and subsequently in the development of Interlingua.
Its vocabulary is based largely on the Germanic and Romance languages and its grammar is influenced by English.
Novial was first introduced in Jespersen's book An International Language in 1928.Jespersen, Otto (1928). An international language. London: Allen & Unwin. LC no 29000603.  It was updated in his dictionary Novial Lexike in 1930,Jespersen, Otto (1930). Novial lexike, international dictionary, dictionnaire international, internationales Wörterbuch. London: G. Allen & Unwin. LC no 31014004. and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943.Ager, Simon. Novial (Nov International Auxiliari Lingue). Retrieved from omniglot.com on the 20th Dec. 2011 In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the Internet, some people rediscovered Novial.

==An international language==

Novial was first described in Jespersen’s book An International Language (1928). Part One of the book discusses the need for an IAL, the disadvantages of ethnic languages for that purpose, and common objections to constructed IALs. He also provides a critical overview of the history of constructed IALs with sections devoted to Volapük, Esperanto, Idiom Neutral, Ido, Latino sine Flexione and Occidental (Interlingue). The author makes it clear that he draws on a wealth of earlier work on the problem of a constructed IAL, not only the aforementioned IALs.
Part Two of An International Language describes Novial in detail. Alternative possible solutions for problems in the phonology, orthography, grammar and vocabulary are considered. The choices made are explained by comparison with ethnic languages and previously constructed IALs.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==

Jespersen suggested that it might be possible instead of the digraph SH to use the phonetic symbol ʃ.

==Grammar==

===Personal pronouns, subject and object===

Note that in Novial the Nominative and Oblique pronouns are the same.
The standard word order is subject-verb-object, as in English. Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:
E.g.:
The accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, -m (-em after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition em is equivalent to this ending.
The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding -n or after a consonant -en. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so men means both "my" and "mine" ("of me"):
E.g.:
Possession may also be expressed with the preposition de: de me, de vu, and so on.

===Verbs===

Verb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The pronouns are indicated with parentheses and are given for example purposes.
Novial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being.  In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb to be followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb to get which is used in the examples below.
The passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary bli followed by the root verb form.
The passive voice of being is formed with the auxiliary es followed by the past passive participle (stem + -t).

===Articles===

The definite article is li which is invariant. It is used as in English.
There is no indefinite article, although un (one) can be used.

===Nouns===

The plural noun is formed by adding –s to the singular (-es after a consonant).
The accusative case is generally identical to the nominative but can optionally be marked with the ending -m (-em after a consonant) with the plural being -sem (-esem after a consonant) or with the preposition em.
The genitive is formed with the ending -n (-en after a consonant) with the plural being -sen (-esen after a consonant) or with the preposition de.
Other cases are formed with prepositions.

===Adjectives===

All adjectives end in -i, but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.

===Adverbs===

An adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding -m after the -i ending of the adjective.

==Vocabulary==

===Affixes===

==Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido==

Jespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator. He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Additionally, he objected to those languages' inflectional systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.
In Novial:
A major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns noun endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]. Instead, Novial nouns may end in -o, -a, -e, or -u or -um. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.

==Criticism==

As Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of one sound, one letter :Jespersen, Otto (1995 1938).
