[[Pluronic P-123]]

CATEGORIES: Copolymers

Pluronic P-123 is the tradename for a triblock copolymer manufactured by the BASF Corporation. The nominal chemical formula is HO(CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH2O)20H, which corresponds to a molecular weight of around 5800 Da. Triblock copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(propylene glycol)-poly(ethylene glycol) are known generically as poloxamer, and similar materials are manufactured by other companies.
Poloxamers have behaviors similar to those of hydrocarbon surfactants, and will form micelles when placed in a selective solvent such as water. They are capable of forming both spherical and cylindrical micelles  Wanka G, Hoffmann H, Ulbricht W, "Phase-Diagrams and Aggregation Behavior of Poly(Oxyethylene)-Poly(Oxypropylene)-Poly(Oxyethylene) Triblock Copolymers in Aqueous-Solutions", Macromolecules, 1994, 27, 4145.

==Uses==

P-123 has recently been used in the synthesis of mesoporous materials including FDU-14.Wan Y, Zhao D, "On the Controllable Soft-Templating Approach to Mesoporous Silicates", Chem. Rev., 2007, 107, 2821. Dissolved P-123 forms micelles that are used as the backbone to make structured mesoporous materials such as SBA-15.
