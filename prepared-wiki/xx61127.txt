[[Languedocien dialect]]

CATEGORIES: Occitan language, Languages of France

Languedocien (French name) or Lengadocian (native name) is an Occitan dialect spoken in rural parts of southern France such as Languedoc, Rouergue, Quercy, Agenais and Southern Périgord. 
About 10% of the population of Languedoc are fluent in the language, and another 20% "have some understanding" of the language. All speak French as their first or second language.
Some lingüistics had also provided this term to the Valentian Language, which is considered to be a variety of the catalan.  Some native valentian speakers still address their language as "llemosi"(Limousin)
