James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 – September 30, 1955) was an American actor.Obituary Variety, October 5, 1955. He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956). Dean's enduring fame and popularity rest on his performances in only these three films, all leading roles.
Dean's premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status.[tpl]cite news|title=Delirium over dead star|last=Goodman|first=Ezra|date=September 24, 1956|work=Life|pages=75–88|location=Vol. 41 No. 13[/tpl] He became the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations.[tpl]cite book|author1=David S.

==Early life==

Dean was born at the Seven Gables apartment house at the corner of 4th Street and McClure Street in Marion, Indiana,[tpl]cite book|author=Chris Epting|title=The Birthplace Book: A Guide to Birth Sites of Famous People, Places, & Things|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xn5IhA7OAZsC&pg=PA163|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-4018-0|page=163[/tpl] the son of Winton Dean (January 17, 1907 {–} February 21, 1995) and Mildred Wilson (September 15, 1910 {–} July 14, 1940). Six years after his father had left farming to become a dental technician, Dean and his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He was enrolled at Brentwood Public School in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, but transferred soon afterward to the McKinley Elementary school.[tpl]cite book|author=George C. Perry|title=James Dean|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VAFUQQAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=DK Publishing, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7566-0934-4|page=27[/tpl] The family spent several years there, and by all accounts, young Dean was very close to his mother. According to Michael DeAngelis, she was "the only person capable of understanding him".[tpl]cite book|author=Michael DeAngelis|title=Gay Fandom and Crossover Stardom: James Dean, Mel Gibson, and Keanu Reeves|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aZkshPsocwgC&pg=PA97|date=15 August 2001|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2738-4|page=97[/tpl] In 1938, she was suddenly struck with acute stomach pains and began to lose weight quickly. She died of uterine cancer when Dean was nine years old.
Unable to care for his son, Dean's father sent him to live with his sister Ortense and her husband Marcus Winslow on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana,[tpl]cite book|author=Val Holley|title=James Dean: tribute to a rebel|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RMmQmsJjYCcC&q=%22James+Dean%22+%22Ortense+and+her+husband+Marcus+Winslow%22|date=September 1991|publisher=Publications International|isbn=978-1-56173-148-0|page=18[/tpl] where he was raised in a Quaker household.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Tanitch|title=The Unknown James Dean|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l3odAQAAIAAJ&q=%22%22quaker+upbringing%22|year=1997|publisher=Batsford|isbn=978-0-7134-8034-4|page=114[/tpl] Winton served in World War II and later remarried. In his adolescence, Dean sought the counsel and friendship of a local Methodist pastor, the Rev. James DeWeerd. DeWeerd seemed to have had a formative influence upon Dean, especially upon his future interests in bullfighting, car racing, and theater.[tpl]cite book|author=Marie Clayton|title=James Dean: A Life in Pictures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XqH4tLngGmsC&q=%22james+dean%22+%22James+DeWeerd%22|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-7607-5614-0[/tpl] According to Billy J. Harbin, Dean had "an intimate relationship with his pastor, which began in his senior year of high school and endured for many years".[tpl]cite book|author1=Billy J.

Their alleged sexual relationship was earlier suggested in the 1994 book Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The Life, Times, and Legend of James Dean by Paul Alexander.Paul Alexander, Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The Life, Times, and Legend of James Dean, Viking, 1994, p. 44. In 2011, it was reported that he once confided in Elizabeth Taylor that he was sexually abused by a minister approximately two years after his mother's death.[tpl]cite web|last=Sessums|first=Kevin|title=Elizabeth Taylor Interview About Her AIDS Advocacy|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-23/elizabeth-taylor-interview-about-her-aids-advocacy-plus-stars-remember/?cid=sexybeast:mainpromo4[/tpl] Other reports on Dean's life also suggest that he was either sexually abused by DeWeerd as a child or had a sexual relationship with him as a late teenager.
In high school, Dean's overall performance was mediocre. However, he was considered to be a popular student, having played on the baseball and varsity basketball teams, studied drama, and competed in public speaking through the Indiana High School Forensic Association. After graduating from Fairmount High School in May 1949,[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Ferguson|title=Idol Worship: A Shameless Celebration of Male Beauty in the Movies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4f--vTO9LIC&pg=PA106|year=2003|publisher=STARbooks Press|isbn=978-1-891855-48-1|page=106[/tpl] Dean moved back to California with his dog, Max, to live with his father and stepmother. He enrolled in Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in pre-law.

==Acting career==

Dean's first television appearance was in a Pepsi Cola television commercial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQfikxbS4zE |title=1950 Pepsi commercial |publisher=YouTube |date=1950-12-13 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl] He quit college to act full-time and was cast as John the Beloved Disciple in Hill Number One, an Easter television special, and three walk-on roles in movies, a soldier in Fixed Bayonets!, Sailor Beware, and a youth in Has Anybody Seen My Gal?[tpl]cite book|author=R.

In October 1951, following the encouragement of actor James Whitmore's and his mentor Rogers Brackett's advice, Dean moved to New York City. There he worked as a stunt tester for the game show Beat the Clock. He also appeared in episodes of several CBS television series, The Web, Studio One, and Lux Video Theatre, before gaining admission to the legendary Actors Studio to study method acting under Lee Strasberg.[tpl]cite book|author=Claudia Springer|title=James Dean Transfigured: The Many Faces of Rebel Iconography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U8-ok0mQF-wC&pg=PA14|date=17 May 2013|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75288-7|pages=14–15[/tpl] Proud of this accomplishment, Dean referred to the Studio in a 1952 letter to his family as "The greatest school of the theater. It houses great people like Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Arthur Kennedy, Mildred Dunnock. ... Very few get into it ... It is the best thing that can happen to an actor. I am one of the youngest to belong."
Dean's career picked up and he performed in further episodes of such early 1950s television shows as Kraft Television Theatre, Robert Montgomery Presents, Danger, and General Electric Theater. One early role, for the CBS series Omnibus in the episode "Glory in the Flower", saw Dean portraying the type of disaffected youth he would later immortalize in Rebel Without a Cause. (This summer 1953 program was also notable for featuring the song "Crazy Man, Crazy", one of the first dramatic TV programs to feature rock and roll.) Positive reviews for Dean's 1954 theatrical role as "Bachir", a pandering North African houseboy, in an adaptation of André Gide's book The Immoralist, led to calls from Hollywood.Reise, R. The Unabridged James Dean, 1991

===East of Eden===

In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for a substantive actor to play the emotionally complex role of 'Cal Trask', for screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel East of Eden. The lengthy novel deals with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California, from the mid-19th century through the 1910s. In contrast to the book, the film script focused on the last portion of the story, predominantly with the character of Cal. Though he initially seems more aloof and emotionally troubled than his twin brother Aron, Cal is soon seen to be more worldly, business savvy, and even sagacious than their pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey) who seeks to invent a vegetable refrigeration process. Cal is bothered by the mystery of their supposedly dead mother, and discovers she is still alive and a brothel-keeping 'madam' (Jo Van Fleet).
Before casting Cal, Elia Kazan said that he wanted "a Brando" for the role and Osborn suggested the relatively unknown young actor, James Dean. Dean met with Steinbeck who did not like the moody, complex young man personally, but thought him to be perfect for the part. Dean was cast in the role and on April 8, 1954, left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting.Holley, pages x–196.Perry, pages 109-226.Rathgeb, page 20.
Much of Dean's performance in the film is unscripted,[tpl]cite book|author=Bruce Levene|title=James Dean in Mendocino: The Filming of East of Eden|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jtOz61XEuMMC&pg=PA70|year=1994|publisher=Pacific Transcriptions|isbn=978-0-933391-13-0|page=70[/tpl] including his dance in the bean field and his fetal-like posturing while riding on top of a train boxcar (after searching out his mother in nearby Monterey). The most famous improvisation of the film occurs when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000, money Cal earned by speculating in beans prior to World War I. Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and in a gesture of extreme emotion, lunged forward and grabbed him in a full embrace, crying. Kazan kept this and Massey's shocked reaction in the film.  Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause. Both characters are angst-ridden protagonists and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving approval from a father figure.
For the 1955 Academy Awards, Dean received a posthumous nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in East of Eden, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history. (Jeanne Eagels was unofficially nominated for Best Actress in 1929, when the rules for selection of the winner were different.) East of Eden was the only film starring Dean that he would see released in his lifetime.

===Rebel Without a Cause===

Dean quickly followed up his role in Eden with a starring role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause, a film that would prove to be hugely popular among teenagers. The film has been cited as an accurate representation of teenage angst. It co-starred teen actors Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Dennis Hopper and was directed by Nicholas Ray.

===Giant===

Giant, which was posthumously released in 1956, saw Dean play a supporting role to Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. This was due to his desire to avoid being typecast as Jim Stark and Cal Trask. In the film, he plays Jett Rink, an oil-rich Texan ranch hand who strikes oil and becomes wealthy. His role was notable in that, in order to portray an older version of his character in the film's later scenes, Dean dyed his hair gray and shaved some of it off to give himself a receding hairline.
Giant would prove to be Dean's last film. At the end of the film, Dean was supposed to make a drunken speech at a banquet; this is nicknamed the 'Last Supper' because it was the last scene before his sudden death. Dean mumbled so much due to his desire to make the scene more realistic by actually being inebriated for the take that director George Stevens decided the scene had to be overdubbed by Nick Adams, who had a small role in the film, because Dean had died before the film was edited.
For the 1956 Academy Awards, Dean received his second posthumous Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his role in Giant.

==Personal life==

Screenwriter William Bast was one of Dean's closest friends, a fact acknowledged by Dean's family.Perry, George, James Dean, London, New York: DK Publishing, 2005, p. 68 ("Authorized by the James Dean Estate") According to Dean's first biographer (1956),William Bast, James Dean: a Biography, New York: Ballantine Books, 1956 Bast was his roommate at UCLA and later in New York, and knew Dean throughout the last five years of his life. Fifty years after Dean's death, he stated that their friendship had included some sexual intimacy.Bast, William: Surviving James Dean (Barricade Books, 2006), pp. 133, 183-232. 
While at UCLA, Dean dated Beverly Wills, an actress with CBS, and Jeanette Lewis, a classmate. Bast and Dean often double-dated with them. Wills began dating Dean alone, later telling Bast, "Bill, there's something we have to tell you. It's Jimmy and me. I mean, we're in love."Dalton, David. James Dean: The Mutant King: A Biography, Chicago Review Press (1974) p. 151[tpl]rp|71[/tpl] Dean also kept in contact with his girlfriend in New York, Barbara Glenn, whom he dated for two years. Their love letters sold at auction in 2011 for $36,000."For sale: James Dean's private letters to his girlfriend plus rare photos are up for grabs at auction", Mail Online, Sept. 13, 2011"James Dean – James Dean Letters Sell For $36,000", Contactmusic.com, Nov. 25, 2011
Early in Dean's career, after Dean signed his contract with Warner Brothers, the studio's public relations department began generating stories about Dean's liaisons with a variety of young actresses who were mostly drawn from the clientele of Dean's Hollywood agent, Dick Clayton. Studio press releases also grouped "Dean together with two other actors, Rock Hudson and Tab Hunter, identifying each of the men as an 'eligible bachelor' who has not yet found the time to commit to a single woman: 'They say their film rehearsals are in conflict with their marriage rehearsals.'"Michael DeAngelis, Gay Fandom and Crossover Stardom: James Dean, Mel Gibson and Keanu Reeves, p. 98.
Dean's best-remembered relationship was with young Italian actress Pier Angeli, whom he met while Angeli was shooting The Silver Chalice on an adjoining Warner lot, and with whom he exchanged items of jewelry as love tokens.In his 1992 biography, James Dean: Little Boy Lost, journalist Joe Hyams, who claims to have known Dean personally, devotes an entire chapter to Dean's relationship with Angeli. Angeli, during an interview fourteen years after their relationship ended, described their times together:
[tpl]quote|We used to go together to the California coast and stay there secretly in a cottage on a beach far away from prying eyes. We'd spend much of our time on the beach, sitting there or fooling around, just like college kids. We would talk about ourselves and our problems, about the movies and acting, about life and life after death. We had a complete understanding of each other. We were like Romeo and Juliet, together and inseparable. Sometimes on the beach we loved each other so much we just wanted to walk together into the sea holding hands because we knew then that we would always be together.[tpl]rp|196[/tpl][/tpl]
In his autobiography East of Eden, director Elia Kazan dismissed the notion that Dean could possibly have had any success with women, although he remembered hearing Dean and Angeli loudly making love in Dean's dressing room. In 1997, the television movie Race with Destiny was produced,Race with Destiny, TV movie, IMDB a true-story account of the love affair between Dean and Pier Angeli. It was shot on location "where he lived and loved" until his death.Brris, George. Barris TV and Movie Cars, MotorBooks International (1996) p. 112
Despite their strong love for each other, a number of forces led them apart. Angeli's mother disapproved of Dean's casual dress and what were, for her at least, radical behavior traits: his t-shirt attire, late dates, fast cars, and the fact that he was not a Catholic. Her mother said that such behavior was not acceptable in Italy. In addition, MGM, where he worked, tried to talk him out of marrying and he himself told Angeli that he didn't want to get married.[tpl]rp|197[/tpl]
After finishing his role for East of Eden, he took a brief trip to New York in October 1954.[tpl]rp|197[/tpl] While he was away, Angeli unexpectedly announced her engagement to Italian-American singer Vic Damone. The press was shocked and Dean expressed his irritation.Bast, William, Surviving James Dean, p. 196, New Jersey: Barricade Books, 2006 Angeli married Damone the following month. Gossip columnists reported that Dean watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so "dumb."[tpl]rp|197[/tpl]
Some, like Bast and Paul Alexander, believe the relationship was a mere publicity stunt.Alexander, Paul, Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The Life, Times, and Legend of James Dean, New York: Viking, 1994William Bast, Surviving James Dean, p. 197, (2006). Pier Angeli talked only once about the relationship in her later life in an interview, giving vivid descriptions of romantic meetings at the beach. Dean biographer John Howlett said these read like wishful fantasies,John Howlett, James Dean: A Biography, Plexus 1997 as Bast claims them to be.William Bast, Surviving James Dean
Actress Liz Sheridan asserts that she and Dean had a short affair in New York.Liz Sheridan, Dizzy & Jimmy (ReganBooks HarperCollins, 2000), pp. 144–151. Again Bast is skeptical as to whether this was a true love affair and says Dean and Sheridan did not spend much time together. Dean also dated Swiss actress Ursula Andress. "She was seen riding around Hollywood on the back of James's motorcycle," writes biographer Darwin Porter. She was also seen with Dean in his sports cars, and was with him on the day he bought the car that he died in.Porter, Darwin. Brando Unzipped, Blood Moon Productions, Ltd, (2006) p. 484 At the time, Andress was also dating Marlon Brando. Andress remembered her courtship with Dean: "He came by my house late. He came in room like wild animal, and smell of everything I don't like," she said. "We go hear jazz music and he leave table. Say he go play drums. He no come back. I don't like to be alone. I go home. He come by my home later and say he sorry." She added that Brando was "particularly interested in finding out from Ursula who the better lover was: James Dean or himself. It drove him crazy."
Rumors that Dean avoided the draft by registering as a homosexual appear to be of doubtful authenticity. Not only was he extremely near-sighted and required glasses, he was also a Quaker, either of which was sufficient cause for him to be excused from service.[tpl]cite web| last=Melody|first=Clark| title=The True Story of James Dean| url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-true-story-james-dean-5821302.html |work=The Hollywood Legend's Shocking Untold Story |publisher=Yahoo Voices| accessdate=24 December 2013| date=16 April 2010[/tpl]

==Death==

===Auto racing career===

In April 1954, after securing the co-starring role of Cal Trask in East of Eden, Dean purchased a 1955 Triumph Tiger T110, 650 cc motorcycle and later, a used red, 1953 MG TD sports car.Wasef and Leno (2007) pp. 13–19. In March 1955, Dean traded the MG for a new 1955 Porsche Super Speedster purchased from Competition Motors in Hollywood. He traded the Triumph T110 for a 1955 Triumph TR5 Trophy three days after filming wrapped on East of Eden.
Just before filming began on Rebel Without a Cause, Dean entered the Palm Springs Road Races with the Speedster on March 26–27. He finished first overall in Saturday's novice class and second overall in the Sunday main event. Dean also raced the Speedster at Bakersfield on May 1–2, finishing first in class and third overall. His final race with the Speedster was at Santa Barbara on Memorial Day, May 30, where he started in the eighteenth position, worked his way up to fourth, before over-revving his engine and blowing a piston. He did not finish the race.Raskin (2005) pp. 47–48; 68–71; 73–74; 78–81; 83–86 His racing career was put on hold when Warner Brothers barred him from all racing during the production of Giant.Raskin (2005) pp. 101–02.

===Accident and aftermath===

Longing to return to the "liberating prospects" of motor racing, James Dean was scheduled to compete at a racing event in Salinas, California on October 1, 1955. On September 30, 1955, Dean and his Porsche factory-trained mechanic, Rolf Wütherich, were at Competition Motors in Hollywood preparing Dean's new Porsche 550 Spyder for the weekend sports car races at Salinas. Dean originally intended to trailer the Porsche to Salinas behind his 1955 Ford Country Squire station wagon, driven by friend and movie stunt man, Bill Hickman, and accompanied by professional photographer Sanford H. Roth, who was planning a photo story of Dean at the races for Colliers Magazine. Because the Porsche did not have enough "break-in" miles prior to the race, Wütherich recommended that Dean drive the Spyder to Salinas to get more "seat time" behind the wheel, and subsequently accompanied Dean on the journey.
The group had coffee and doughnuts at the Hollywood Ranch Market on Vine Street across from Competition Motors (not the legendary Farmer's Market at W 3rd St & S Fairfax Ave as previously reported) before leaving around 1:15pm PST. They stopped at the Mobil station for gasoline on Ventura Blvd. at Beverly Glen Blvd. in Sherman Oaks around 2:00 p.m. The group then headed north on the Golden State Freeway US 99 (today, the route of Interstate 5) and then over the "Grapevine" toward Bakersfield.Raskin (2007) pp. 111–115.
At 3:30 p.m., Dean was stopped and ticketed by California Highway Patrolman O.V. Hunter at Mettler Station on Wheeler Ridge, just south of Bakersfield, for driving 65 mph (105 km/h) in a 55 mph (89 km/h) zone.9 Hickman, following behind the Spyder in the Ford with the trailer, was also ticketed for driving 20 mph (32 km/h) over the limit, as the speed limit for all vehicles towing a trailer was 45 mph (72 km/h). After receiving the speeding citations, Dean and Hickman turned left onto Route 166/33 to avoid going through Bakersfield's slow 25 mph downtown district. Route 166/33 was a known shortcut for sports car drivers going to Salinas called "the racer's road", which took them directly to Blackwells Corner at Route 466 (now State Route 46). At Blackwells Corner, Dean stopped briefly for refreshments and met up with fellow racers Lance Reventlow and Bruce Kessler, who were also on their way to the Salinas road races in Reventlow's Mercedes-Benz 300SL coupe. As Reventlow and Kessler were leaving, they agreed to meet for dinner in Paso Robles.Raskin (2007) pp.116–118.
At approximately 5:15 p.m., Dean and Hickman left Blackwells Corner, driving west on Route 466 (now State Route 46) toward Paso Robles, approximately 60 miles away. Dean accelerated in the Porsche and left the Ford station wagon far behind. Further along on Route 466, the Porsche crested Polonio Pass and headed down the long Antelope Grade, passing cars along the way toward the junction floor at Route 466 and Route 41. At approximately 5:45 p.m. PST, a black-and-white 1950 Ford Tudor coupe driven at high speed was headed east on Route 466 just west of the junction near Shandon. Its driver, 23-year-old Cal Poly student Donald Turnupseed, made a left turn onto Route 41 headed north, toward Fresno. As Turnupseed's Ford crossed over the center line, Dean, who was driving at a reported speed of 85 Miles per hour, apparently tried to steer the Spyder in a "side stepping" racing maneuver, but with insufficient time and space, the two cars crashed almost head-on. The Spyder flipped up into the air and landed back on its wheels in a gully, northwest of the junction. The sheer velocity of the impact sent the much-heavier Ford broad-sliding 39 feet down Route 466 in the westbound lane.Raskin (2007) pp. 122–127.
According to a story in the October 1, 2005, edition of the Los Angeles Times,Chawkins, Steve, "Remembering a 'Giant'", Los Angeles Times, October 1, 2005. California Highway Patrol Captain Ernest Tripke and his partner, Corporal Ronald Nelson, were finishing a coffee break in Paso Robles when they were called to the scene of the accident at the Route 466/41 junction. Before Officers Tripke and Nelson arrived, James Dean had been extricated from the Spyder's mangled cockpit, his left foot having been crushed between the clutch and brake pedal. Dean was severely injured from the crash with a broken neck and several internal and external injuries. Nelson witnessed an unconscious and dying Dean placed into an ambulance, and a barely conscious Wütherich, who had been thrown from the Spyder, lying on the shoulder of the road next to the wrecked Porsche. Dean and Wütherich were taken in the same ambulance to the Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital, 28 miles away. Dean was pronounced dead on arrival at the Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital at 6:20 pm.Raskin (2005) p. 129.
Though initially slow to reach newspapers in the eastern United States, details of Dean's death rapidly spread via radio and television. By October 2, his death had received significant coverage from domestic and foreign media outlets.Perry (2012) pp. 194–95 Dean's funeral was held on October 8, 1955 at the Fairmount Friends Church in Fairmount, Indiana. An estimated 600 mourners were in attendance, while another 2400 fans gathered outside the building during the procession.
An inquest into Dean's death occurred on October 11, 1955 at the Paso Robles City Hall, where a verdict governed that he was at fault due to reckless speeding, thus making Turnupseed innocent.Beath (2005) pp. 50–51.Perry (2012) pp. 196–97
Ironically, Dean had appeared in an episode of Warner Brothers Presents a few weeks prior to his death. The segment concerned the subject of drivers' safety and Dean's experience on the road. At the end of the segment, instead of saying the phrase "The life you save may be your own," Dean ad-libbed the line "The life you might save might be mine." After his fatal car accident, the segment was never aired.

==Legacy and iconic status==

===Impact on culture and media===

American teenagers of the mid-1950s, when James Dean's major films were made, identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially that of Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause. This film depicts the dilemma of a typical teenager of the time, who feels that no one, not even his peers, can understand him. Joe Hyams says that Dean was "one of the rare stars, like Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift, whom both men and women find sexy".[tpl]cite book|author=Joe Hyams|title=James Dean: Little Boy Lost|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ti3YGwAACAAJ|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Grand Central Pub|isbn=978-0-446-36529-1[/tpl] According to Marjorie Garber, this quality is "the undefinable extra something that makes a star."Marjorie B. Garber, Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life (2000), p.140. See also "Bisexuality and Celebrity." In Rhiel and Suchoff, The Seductions of Biography, p.18. Dean's iconic appeal has been attributed to the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era,Perry, G., James Dean, p. 204, New York, DK Publishing, Inc., 2005 and to the air of androgynyDavid Burner, Making Peace with the 60s (Princeton University Press, 1997), p.244. that he projected onscreen. Dean's "loving tenderness towards the besotted Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause continues to touch and excite gay audiences by its honesty. The Gay Times Readers' Awards cited him as the male gay icon of all time."Garry Wotherspoon and Robert F. Aldrich, Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History: from Antiquity to World War II (Routledge, 2001), p.105.
Dean is mentioned or featured in various songs. The chorus of David Essex's original Rock On includes the refrain "Jimmy Dean. James Dean." Dean is mentioned in Rob Zarro's song Infamous Route 66: "I'm seeing really cool things, pictures of Marilyn and James Dean." The Eagles song named after Dean explores his fast and dangerous lifestyle. John Mellencamp mentions James Dean in the lyrics of Jack & Diane. Phil Ochs has a song titled Jim Dean of Indiana.[tpl]cite book|author1=Nathan Brackett|author2=Christian David Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t9eocwUfoSoC&pg=PA599|year=2004|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8|page=599[/tpl] In addition, James Dean is often noted within television shows, films, books and novels. In an episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation, the character Liberty likens the rebellious, antisocial Sean Cameron to James Dean. On the sitcom Happy Days, Fonzie has a picture of Dean in his closet next to his mirror. A picture of Dean also appears on Rizzo's wall in the film Grease. On the American version of the TV series Queer as Folk, the main character Brian Kinney mentions James Dean together with Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix, saying, "They're all legends. They'll always be young, and they will always be beautiful". In the alternative history book Homeward Bound by Harry Turtledove, Dean is stated to have not died in a car crash and to have made several more films, including Rescuing Private Ranfall, based on Saving Private Ryan.

On April 20, 2010, a long "lost" live episode of the General Electric Theater called "The Dark, Dark Hours" featuring James Dean in a performance with Ronald Reagan was uncovered by NBC writer Wayne Federman while working on a Ronald Reagan television retrospective.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/21/entertainment/main6417586.shtml |title=Rare Film of Ronald Reagan, James Dean Unearthed (April 21, 2010) |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl] The episode, originally broadcast December 12, 1954,[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Paul Metzger|title=Reagan: American Icon|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6M6EAs_LAXwC&pg=PA106|date=1 January 1989|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-916279-05-7|page=106[/tpl] drew international attention and highlights were featured on numerous national media outlets including: CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and Good Morning America.

===Debated sexual orientation===

Today, Dean is often considered an icon because of his "experimental" take on life, which included his ambivalent sexuality. There have been several claims that Dean has had sexual relationships with both men and women. When questioned about his sexual orientation, he is reported to have said, "No, I am not a homosexual. But I'm also not going to go through life with one hand tied behind my back."[tpl]cite book|author=Randall Riese|title=The unabridged James Dean: his life and legacy from A to Z|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-2VZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22homosexual%22|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Contemporary|isbn=978-0-8092-4061-6|page=239[/tpl]
William Bast, one of Dean's closest friends, was Dean's first biographer (1956).William Bast, James Dean: a Biography, New York: Ballantine Books, 1956. He published a revealing update of his first book, in which, after years of successfully dodging the question as to whether he and Dean were sexually involved,Riese, Randall, The Unabridged James Dean: His Life from A to Z, Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1991, pp. 41, 238Alexander, Paul, Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The Life, Times, and Legend of James Dean, New York: Viking, 1994, p. 87 he finally stated that they experimented. In this second book, Bast describes the difficult circumstances of their involvement and also deals frankly with some of Dean's other reported gay relationships, notably the actor's friendship with Rogers Brackett, the influential producer of radio dramas who encouraged Dean in his career and provided him with useful professional contacts.Bast, Surviving James Dean, pp. 133, 150, 183.
Robert Aldrich and Garry Wotherspoon include an entry on James Dean in their book on gay and lesbian history, while journalist Joe Hyams suggests that any gay activity Dean might have been involved in appears to have been strictly "for trade", as a means of advancing his career. Val Holley notes that, according to Hollywood biographer Lawrence J. Quirk, gay Hollywood columnist Mike Connolly "would put the make on the most prominent young actors, including Robert Francis, Guy Madison, Anthony Perkins, Nick Adams and James Dean."Val Holley, Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip (2003), p.22. However, the "trade only" notion is debated by Bast and other Dean biographers.Donald Spoto, Rebel: The Life and Legend of James Dean (HarperCollins, 1996), pp.150–151. See also Val Holley, James Dean: The Biography, pp.6, 7, 8, 78, 80, 85, 94, 153. Aside from Bast's account of his own relationship with Dean, Dean's fellow biker and "Night Watch" member John Gilmore claims he and Dean "experimented" with gay acts on one occasion in New York, and it is difficult to see how Dean, then already in his twenties, would have viewed this as a "trade" means of advancing his career.John Gilmore, Live Fast – Die Young: Remembering the Short Life of James Dean (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1998).
Screenwriter Gavin Lambert, himself gay and part of the Hollywood gay circles of the 1950s and 1960s, described Dean as being gay. Rebel director Nicholas Ray is on record as saying that Dean was gay.See Lawrence Frascella and Al Weisel, Live Fast, Die Young – The Wild Ride of Making Rebel Without a Cause. Author John Howlett believes that Dean was "certainly bisexual". George Perry's biography reduces these aspects of Dean's sexuality to "experimentation".George Perry, James Dean, DK Publishing 2005 Bast also shows that Dean had knowledge of gay bars and customs.William Bast, Surviving James Dean, Barricade 2006, p. 53–54, p. 135 However, he concludes: "Jimmy was a dabbler, he was'' learning through experiment… But to say he was gay? That's ridiculous."Dalton, David. James Dean: The Mutant King: A Biography, Chicago Review Press (1974) p. 151
