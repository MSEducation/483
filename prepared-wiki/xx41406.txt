==History==

===2000-2002: Formation, debut album and tour===

No Secrets was formed by Carly's father who was a music producer in London. She wrote a letter to him asking to put a group together, so they began with Carly. Soon after, Jade was invited to be the next member involved. Carly's mom and Jade's mom were family friends that's how they knew each other. The next member to join was Erin, she is Jade's cousin so they gave her a phone call. Later on, while the three girls did a search, they found Angel in an advertisement for a singing group, and then Angel joined and brought Jessica with her. Once the group line-up had been completed, No Secrets began recording songs for their first album. To make their debut album, the girls worked with a variety of producers and songwriters, including Adrian Gurvitz, Andy Goldmark and Riprock 'n' Alex G. The process took a number of months and wasn't finished yet. they took a break from recording and album prep to go touring and promoting their group.  In June 2001, No Secrets joined Aaron Carter in Toronto, Canada, for the shooting of his video "Oh Aaron", and also collaborated in the taping of the song, providing background vocals. they were also featured in another track of off his album. the song was titled "Stride (Jump on the Fizzy"). In 2002, after touring with Aaron for 4 months, they filmed their first video, a home VHS and DVD video named No Secrets - Get to Know Us, and then continued working on the album which was released a few months after the video.
Later that year, the group released their self-titled debut album, with singles of "That's What Girls Do" and "Kids in America", the latter of the two was featured in the soundtrack for 2001 film Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and its music video was included as a bonus for the film's VHS release. Another single on the album was "That's What Girls Do" which has a music video featured. It was also a bonus feature on The Powerpuff Girls Movie[tpl]'[/tpl]s DVD and in the ending credits. The song then made it to a few soundtracks for future productions for The Powerpuff Girls. Also, they recorded "Little Angel Of Mine", for the soundtrack of Stuart Little 2.

===2003-2004: Faith's departure and Friends Forever===

In early 2003, No Secrets was one of the many artists who recorded a song on the album DisneyMania and its follow up DisneyMania 2. On the first album, they recorded a cover of "Kiss the Girl" from The Little Mermaid. At one point, Carly, Jade, Erin, and Jessica recorded a remake of Atomic Kitten's hit "Whole Again," excluding (and unbeknownst to) Angel. Soon after singing the majority of leads in the band, Angel left the group to pursue a solo career, releasing the album Believe in Angels... Believe in Me in 2004, just as the finishing touches were being put on the second album for No Secrets. They still ended up releasing the album with Angel featured in the artwork because it was to close to the release date and too far in production to make any (sudden) changes. Long after the success of "Comes Back" The four remaining members recorded and shot a video for the song "Once Upon Another Dream" for  Disney's 2003 re-release of Sleeping Beauty which was also on the DVD menu for the new release of the movie, reviving No Secrets' popularity.
At on point, many rumors floated about a new member joining the girl group but, no official statements were ever made. Until blog posts and other articles were created a few years later stating, Lady Gaga was confirmed to promptly replace Angel in late 2003 but after her manager backed out of the project too early, Gaga (then known as Stefani) didn't make it into the group.

===2005: Cancelled movie and break-up===

With No Secrets being a constant client for Disney media, writers from the Disney head-courters wrote a movie starring No Secrets entitled Summer Stage. The movie went through 5 phases of production and even began the filming process. Aaron Carter, Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan all were cast as well. Aaron left the movie to go on tour and the disagreements between members of the group led to the eventual break-up of No Secrets in early 2005, which halted the production of the movie. After this, Jessica Fried took on a solo career, signing with Warner Bros. under the name Jessi Malay. Erin Tanner adopted the stage name "Nicki Foxx" (sometimes just "Nicki") and began working on solo material. In a 2007 interview, Fried commented on the break stating that the girls got along great but, due to one member's greedy parent actions, it ended up breaking the group apart and sinking the ship to nothing.
Also, in 2007, Angel chose to retire from the entertainment industry and has since pursued an education. In June 2009, she graduated magna cum laude from UCLA and is currently attending veterinary school. She completed her graduate education in 2013.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl]
