==Reception==

Allmusic awarded the album with 3 stars and its review by Richard S. Ginell states: "McLaughlin sounds rejuvenated and refreshed in this format, as he switches between acoustic guitar and a guitar synthesizer attachment that softens and rounds his attacks while creating some luminous timbres and textures. McLaughlin's on-again, off-again Indian kick rises prominently into view here as Trilok Gurtu's role broadens into that of an all-purpose percussionist, producing some amazing sounds as backdrops." The trio performed the title track from the album at the Guitar Legends Festival in Seville, October 1991.
