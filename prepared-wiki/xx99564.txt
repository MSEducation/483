CATEGORIES: Dispositional beliefs, Prediction, Fear

Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm about a real or imagined threat e.g. the increases in deaths from infectious disease.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xu472710j0670176/ |title=Alarmism is an infectious disease |journal=Society |doi=10.1007/BF02912206 |volume=34 |author=David Murray, Joel Schwartz |issue=4 |pages=35 |date=May 25, 2008[/tpl]
The alarmist prefers intimidation and coercion to reasoned debate, and is often motivated by the desire to bring themselves to the forefront of discussion.[tpl]cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Alarmist personality==

The alarmist person is subject to the cognitive distortion of catastrophizing â€“ of always expecting the worst of possible futures.P. Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (1999) p. 88-90
They may also be seeking to preserve feelings of omnipotence by generating anxiety and concern in others.T. Pitt-Aikens, Loss of the Good Authority (1989) p. 99

==False accusation==

The charge of alarmism can of course be used to discredit a legitimate warning, as when Churchill was widely dismissed as an alarmist in the Thirties.M. Makovsky, Churchill's Promised Land (2007) p. 140-1
