==Emperor (193)==

After the murder of Pertinax (28 March 193), the Praetorian assassins announced that the throne was to be sold to the man who would pay the highest price.Herodian, ii.6.4 Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus, prefect of the city, father-in-law of the murdered emperor, being at that moment in the camp to which he had been sent to calm the troops, began making offers,Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.1; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 2.4, 2.6 when Julianus, having been roused from a banquet by his wife and daughter,Herodian, ii.6.7 arrived in all haste, and being unable to gain admission, stood before the gate, and with a loud voice competed for the prize.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.3; Herodian, ii.6.8
As the bidding went on, the soldiers reported to each of the two competitors, the one within the fortifications, the other outside the rampart, the sum offered by his rival. Eventually Sulpicianus promised 20,000 sesterces to every soldier; Julianus, fearing that Sulpicianus would gain the throne, then offered 25,000.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.5 The guards immediately closed with the offer of Julianus, threw open the gates, saluted him by the name of Caesar, and proclaimed him emperor.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 11.5; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 2.7; Herodian, ii.6.11 Threatened by the military, the Senate declared him emperor.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 12; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 3.3 His wife and his daughter both received the title Augusta.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 3.4, 4.5

==Reign==

Upon his accession, Julianus immediately devalued the Roman currency, decreasing the silver purity of the denarius from 87% to 81.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.75 grams to 2.40 grams.Tulane University "Roman Currency of the Principate"
After the initial confusion had subsided, the population did not tamely submit to the dishonour brought upon Rome.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 13.2–5; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 4.2–7; Herodian, ii.7.3 Whenever Julianus appeared in public he was saluted with groans, imprecations, and shouts of "robber and parricide."Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 13.3 The mob tried to obstruct his progress to the Capitol, and even threw stones.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 4.2, 4.4
When news of the public anger in Rome spread across the Empire, the generals Pescennius Niger in Syria, Septimius Severus in Pannonia, and Clodius Albinus in Britain, each having three legions under his command, refused to recognize the authority of Julianus.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 14.3–4; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 5.1–2 Julianus declared Severus a public enemy because he was the nearest of the three and, therefore, the most dangerous foe.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 5.3; Septimius Severus, 5.5 Deputies were sent from the Senate to persuade the soldiers to abandon him;Historia Augusta, Septimius Severus, 5.5 a new general was nominated to supersede him, and a centurion dispatched to take his life.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 5.4–8
The Praetorian Guard, long strangers to active military operations, were marched into the Campus Martius, regularly drilled, and trained in the construction of fortifications and field works.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.1–2; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 5.9; Herodian, ii.11.9 Severus, however, having secured the support of Albinus by declaring him Caesar,Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 15.1–2 progressed towards the city and made himself master of the fleet at Ravenna.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.5; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 6.3 He defeated Tullius Crispinus, the Praetorian Prefect, who had been sent to halt his progress,Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 6.4 and gained over to his cause the ambassadors sent to turn his troops.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.1; Historia Augusta, Septimius Severus, 5.6
The Praetorian Guard, lacking discipline and sunk in debauchery and sloth, were incapable of offering any effectual resistance.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 16.3 Matters being desperate, Julianus now attempted negotiation and offered to share the empire with his rival.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.2; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 6.9, Septimius Severus, 5.7; Herodian, ii.12.3 Severus ignored these overtures and pressed forward, all Italy declaring for him as he advanced.Herodian, ii.11.6 At last the Praetorians, having received assurances that they would suffer no punishment – provided they surrendered the actual murderers of Pertinax –  seized the ringleaders of the conspiracy and reported what they had done to Silius Messala, the consul, by whom the Senate was summoned and informed of the proceedings.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.3
The Senate passed a motion proclaiming Severus emperor, awarded divine honours to Pertinax, and sentenced Julianus to death.Cassius Dio, lxxiv, 17.4; Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 8.7; Herodian, ii.12.6 Julianus was deserted by all except one of the prefects and his son-in-law, Repentinus.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 8.6

Whom have I killed?" His body was given to his wife and daughter, who buried it in his great-grandfather's tomb by the fifth milestone on the Via Labicana.Historia Augusta, Didius Julianus, 8.10
