The Netball Association of Malawi (NAM) held negotiations with the three retired players to try to convince them to return to the Queens. On 15 June 2011, the NAM announced that Waya had agreed to return to the national team,[tpl]cite news |last=Chirwa |first=Garry |title=Netball veterans surprised by NAM's move |newspaper=The Nation |url=http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=21221:netball-veterans-surprised-by-nams-move&catid=33:national-sports&Itemid=31 |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-16[/tpl] along with Queens veterans Esther Nkhoma and Sylvia Mtetemela; Peace Chawinga-Kalua had earlier signed as assistant coach for the team. Media reports in Malawi indicated that the return of the three veterans players had caused major tension in the Queens squad, which led Waya to withdraw early from the squad's training camp.[tpl]cite news |last=Chibewa |first=Joe |title=New-look Queens resent veterans return (sic) |publisher=The Maravi Post |url=http://www.maravipost.com/malawi-politics/society/5334-new-look-queens-resent-veterans-return.html |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author1=Ndovi, Joy |author2=Malidadi, Mphatso |title=Mary Waya bolts camp |newspaper=The Daily Times |url=http://www.bnltimes.com/sports/46-all/1611-mary-waya-bolts-camp.html |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011[/tpl]
