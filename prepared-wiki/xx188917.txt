Vertin was born in Dobliče in White Carniola at that time part of the province of Lower Carniola, in the Duchy of Carniola, a part of the Austrian Empire (now in the Municipality of Črnomelj, Slovenia) on 17 July 1844.Kerže, Frank. 1899.

Vertin received his primary education in Novo Mesto and emigrated to America at the age of nineteen with his family. His parents presented him to the fellow immigrant from Slovenia, Bishop Frederic Baraga, who, upon accepting him into the diocese, sent him to St. Francis, Wisconsin, where he completed his theological training. On 31 August 1866, Vertin was ordained a priest by Baraga.
Upon the resignation of Ignatius Mrak as Bishop of Marquette in May 1879, Pope Leo XIII elevated Vertin to the episcopate to succeed him. He was consecrated at Negaunee, Michigan, on 14 September 1879 by Michael Heiss, then still Bishop of La Crosse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvertin.html|work=Catholic Hierarchy|title=Bishop John Vertin|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl] The following year he undertook the renovation of his cathedral.
