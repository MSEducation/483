Jorge Newbery Airfield ([tpl]lang-es|Aeroparque "Jorge Newbery"[/tpl], [tpl]airport codes|AEP|SABE|p=n[/tpl]) is located in Palermo neighbourhood, [tpl]convert|2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast of downtown Buenos Aires, Argentina. The airport covers an area of [tpl]convert|138|ha|acre|0[/tpl] and is operated by Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 S.A. It is located in the Palermo ward, along the Río de la Plata, and serves as the main hub for domestic flights from Buenos Aires as well as to Uruguay. The airport is named in honor of Argentine aviator Jorge Newbery.
The Argentine Air Force Station located on the eastern end of the airport is where authorities normally board the Tango 01 presidential aircraft.
Newbery Airfield is roughly equal to Ezeiza International Airport (located [tpl]convert|38|km|mi[/tpl] to the south) in airline traffic among the nation's 33 airports, handling 93,346 aircraft movements in 2009 and serving 9,552,504 passengers in 2013 (one third of all scheduled air traffic in Argentina); it thus surpassed Ezeiza International in 2013 as the nation's busiest airport by passenger traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aa2000.com.ar/news.aspx?idnoticia=676|title=Aumento del 4.4 por ciento en el tráfico de pasajeros en 2013|date=January 14, 2014|work=Aeropuertos Argentina 2000[/tpl]

==History==

The airport was originally proposed by Mayor Carlos Noël in 1925.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atlasdebuenosaires.gov.ar/aaba/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158&Itemid=40&lang=es|title=Aeroparque Jorge Newbery|work=Atlas Ambiental de Buenos Aires[/tpl] A number of feasibility studies and zoning disputes followed. In 1938, plans were submitted for an island airport connected via causeway to Avenida General Paz (then under construction).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/592112-aeroparque-no-se-muda-aunque-si-se-modifica|title=Aeroparque no se muda, aunque sí se modifica|date=April 14, 2004|work=La Nación[/tpl] A former wetland reclaimed in 1916 from the Río de la Plata and closer to downtown was selected instead, and the facility, designed by Aeronatics Secretariat engineer Víctor Acuña in 1945, was inaugurated in 1947 as Aeroparque 17 de Octubre (October 17 Airfield).[tpl]cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Aeroparque-2-low.jpg|title=Un moderno aeropuerto a 15 minutos del centro|work=Correo de la Tarde|date=January 18, 1960[/tpl] 
Initially served by a [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft[/tpl] runway, it began operations in January 1948 as the main hub for domestic flights from Buenos Aires as well as flights to Uruguay. Its first terminal was completed in 1951, by which time the runway was extended to [tpl]convert|1550|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.palermo.edu/dyc/pgraduacion/archivos_bajada/mejores_pg/reznik.pdf|title=Proyecto de graduación - Seguridad aeroportuaria|author=Reznik, Constanza|date=2008|work=Universidad de Palermo[/tpl] The airport was renamed following the 1955 coup against President Juan Perón in honor of the pioneer of Argentine aviation, Jorge Newbery, and was re-inaugurated in 1960 following work that expanded its main runway to [tpl]convert|2070|m|ft[/tpl] and added a new terminal. The Argentine Air Force had a small base built near the eastern end of the airport in 1965;[tpl]cite web|url=http://aeromilitaria.com.ar/faa/aob/index.htm|title=Fuerza Aérea: Guarniciones y unidades|work=Aeromilitaria Argentina[/tpl] it was at this site that President Isabel Perón was formally deposed by the military in the March 1976 coup.[tpl]cite book|author=Lewis, Paul|title=Guerrillas and Generals|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=127|year=2002|isbn=0-275-97360-3[/tpl] A new terminal for national air carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas was inaugurated in 1981, expanding total terminal area to 30,000 m² (323,000 ft²). 
Plans to merge Newbery with Ezeiza International Airport in a new facility located on an artificial island were revived in 1996 by a commission headed by Congressman Álvaro Alsogaray, though these plans were ultimately dropped. Its operations, like those of all the nation's public airports, were privatized in 1998 and transferred to Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 (part of the conglomerate owned by local businessman Eduardo Eurnekian). The runway was further extended by [tpl]convert|180|m|ft[/tpl] in 2007,[tpl]cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/07/20/laciudad/h-04401.htm|title=Avanza con demoras el plan para ampliar la pista de Aeroparque|date=July 20, 2007|work=Clarín[/tpl] and work began in 2009 to create greater distance between the nearby Rafael Obligado Coast Highway and the eastern end of the runway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2010/03/25/laciudad/h-02166495.htm|title=No avanza la extensión de la autopista Illia hacia el Norte|date=March 25, 2010|work=Clarín[/tpl] Routes were added in March 2010 to destinations in Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/3/15/economia-478014.asp |title=Ya operan desde Aeroparque los vuelos a países limítrofes|date=March 15, 2010|work=Los Andes[/tpl] Work began in 2011 on Terminals III and IV, totaling 35,000 m² (377,000 ft²).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arhelport.com/noticias/-/blogs/nuevas-obras-en-el-aeroparque-jorge-newbery|title=Nuevas obras en el Aeroparque Jorge Newbery|date=May 10, 2011|work=Helport[/tpl] These terminals were inaugurated in March 2014, effectively doubling the airport's passenger capacity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201403/56692-cristina-inaugura-los-nuevos-edificios-del-aeroparque-porteno.html|title=Cristina destacó la transformación del aeroparque "desde que se incremento la economía y el turismo|work=Telam|date=March 26, 2014[/tpl]
