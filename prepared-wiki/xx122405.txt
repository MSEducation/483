George Allen Frazier (born October 13, 1954 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1978–1987, primarily as a set-up reliever.
Frazier played high school baseball as a member of "the Hornets", which is the name of the teams at Hillcrest High School in Springfield, Missouri. Frazier was offered a college scholarship in baseball, football, and basketball.
In 1981 while with the Yankees, Frazier tied a World Series record with 3 losses (with Lefty Williams). Williams, however, is widely suspected to have thrown those games in the 1919 World Series (as part of the Black Sox Scandal), and furthermore, the third game Williams lost was Game Eight - the Series of 1919 through 1921 were best of nine affairs, leaving Frazier as the only pitcher to lose three games in a best of seven World Series.
Frazier later appeared in the 1987 World Series as a member of the Twins.
Frazier currently serves as a television commentator for the Colorado Rockies organization. His son, Parker Frazier was drafted in the eighth round of the 2007 MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
