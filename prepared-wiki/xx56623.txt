Jacques Brault (born March 29, 1933) is a French Canadian poet and translator who lives in Cowansville, Quebec, Canada. He was born to a poor family, but received an excellent education at the Université de Montréal and at the Sorbonne in Paris. He became a professor at the Université de Montréal, in the Département d'études françaises and the Institut des sciences médiévales, and made frequent appearances as a cultural commentator on Radio-Canada.
Jacques Brault's extensive body of writings includes work of outstanding merit in most literary genres. He is the author of plays, novels and works of short fiction, translations and several seminal works of Canadian literary criticism. However, it is primarily for his work as a poet that Jacques Brault is admired by readers and known outside of Canada.Canadian Writers, an examination of archival manuscripts, typescripts, correspondence, journals and notebooks at Library and Archives Canada
