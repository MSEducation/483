After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Organisms may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]] and leftover [[organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms that recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]].
One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins. However, determining when death has occurred requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of afterlife or reincarnation for the soul, or resurrection of the body at a later date.
Extinction is the process by which a group of taxa or species dies out, reducing biodiversity.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=Extinction – definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwseRB80 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing habitat or against superior competition. In Earth's history, over 99% of all the species that have ever lived have gone extinct;[tpl]cite web | url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Triassic/extinction.htm | title=What is an extinction? | work=Late Triassic | publisher=Bristol University | accessdate=2012-06-5-27 [/tpl] however, mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Van Valkenburgh |first=B. |year=1999 |title=Major patterns in the history of carnivorous mammals |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=27 |pages=463–493 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463 |bibcode=1999AREPS..27..463V[/tpl]
Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing rock formations and sedimentary layers (strata) is known as the fossil record. A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago.[ref]
