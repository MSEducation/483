Secondary Highway 534, commonly referred to as Highway 534, is a provincially maintained secondary highway in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Between those communities, the highway travels mostly through thick boreal forest. It was assumed in 1956, following its present course and remaining unchanged since. It is a lightly travelled route accommodating, on an average day, no more than 850 vehicles.
