[[Tin Lids]]

CATEGORIES: Australian musical groups

The Tin Lids were an Australian children's pop group comprising Mahalia Barnes, Eliza-Jane Barnes, Elly-May Barnes and Jackie Barnes.
The band released three albums following their first hit single, a cover of Was (Not Was)'s song "Walk the Dinosaur". The first, in 1991, was a collection of Christmas songs called Hey Rudolph, which sold over 100,000 copies. Two further albums were released including Snakes and Ladders (1992), which is now considered rare, and Dinosaur Dreaming (1993).
Tin Lids is rhyming slang for the kids, as the band are all children of Australian rock legend Jimmy Barnes and his Thai-born wife Jane Mahoney (born Jane Dejakasaya). The group were also the back-up singers for their father's song "When Your Love Is Gone".
Their maternal-uncle is also an Australian rock artist Mark Denis Lizotte, who performs as Johnny Diesel.
