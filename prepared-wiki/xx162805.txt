==Route description==

Route 317 begins at an intersection with Stateline Road on the Ohio–Pennsylvania state line as a continuation of Ohio State Route 630 (East Calla Road). The highway progresses eastward from the state line as a two-lane rural highway through North Beaver Township as West Poland Road. Route 317 crosses a dirt road and soon through some swamplands before entering the borough of Bessemer. In Bessemer, the highway becomes the main thoroughfare, where it crosses through a large residential stretch until the intersection with First Covenant Road, where businesses follow the main street. Route 317 then passes to the south of Kennedy Park, a local borough-run park, and passes to the north of a large industrial site. 
After the industrial complex, the highway continues eastward through a mix of surroundings ranging from the residences to the north and more industry to the south. Just before the intersection with Smalls Ferry Road, Route 317 leaves Bessemer. This route turns to the northeast and becomes largely rural once again. At the intersection with Mohawk School Road, the highway makes a turn to the southeast off of East Poland Road and onto Mohawk School Road, where the highway becomes residential once again. Continuing directly southwest, the surroundings mix and amidst a large residential area, Route 317 intersects with Route 551 (North Edinburg Road). Route 317 and Route 551 become concurrent, following North Edinburgh Road into Mount Jackson, where the road intersects with Route 108 (Mount Jackson Road). Here, Route 551 follows a concurrency with Route 108 west, while Route 317 terminates at this intersection.[tpl]bing maps|url=|title=Overview map of Pennsylvania Route 317|accessdate=April 5, 2011[/tpl]
