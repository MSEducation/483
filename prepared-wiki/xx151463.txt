[[Argument from desire]]

CATEGORIES: Arguments for the existence of God

The argument from desire is an argument for the existence of God. It is most known in recent times through the writings of C. S. Lewis, for whom it played pivotal role in his own conversion to theism and thence to Christianity. 
As a syllogism it can be expressed as follows.
The argument is not meant to be a proof. The conclusion may not necessarily be the only possibility satisfying the premises. Yet the argument from desire can be persuasive because the premises and conclusion can be not merely understood but "seen" in a much more direct way than similar arguments, such as the Ontological Argument. It is more directly applicable to the human experience.

==Criticisms==

The argument from desire has attracted criticisms from both religious and non-religious commentators; whilst using it as evidence for God's existence, Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas did not consider it a valid argument for the existence of God on its own.[tpl]cite book| last = Pasnau| first = Robert| title = Thomas Aquinas on Human Nature A Philosophical Study of Summa Theologiae, 1a 75-89| year = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-00189-2 [/tpl] In examining the use of the argument from desire in Aquinas's philosophy, historian Robert Pasnau criticises the argument as being "based on strong teleological assumptions few would accept today. It seems clear, contrary to his Aquinas's central assumption, that there are things in nature that have no point".
