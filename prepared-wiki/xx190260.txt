[[Livin' in the Life]]

CATEGORIES: 1977 singles, The Isley Brothers songs

"Livin' in the Life" is the second song released from The Isley Brothers' 1977 album, Go for Your Guns. It was also the next-to-last song on the album, which only included seven tracks, with the last track actually a "part two" version of the song under the title of the album, in which was led by Ernie Isley, brother Marvin and Chris Jasper.
Much like the band's 1975 hit, "Fight the Power", it was written by Ernie Isley and, in some parts, lead singer Ronald Isley and his brothers, Rudolph and Kelly, tripled in unison lead vocals though Ronald remained the dominant vocalist over the three. Ronald also helps close out the ending of the album before it fades.
The song became a hit on the R&B and dance charts, reaching #4 on the former, while also crossing over on the top 40 of the pop charts, reaching #40, making it their first top 40 pop hit in little over two years.
