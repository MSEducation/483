Foley was born in Liverpool and began his career with local club Liverpool FC, signing a professional in 1980. Foley never made a first team appearance at Anfield, and spent a loan spell with Fulham, lasting from December 1983 to January 1984, in which he made three league appearances. Foley left Liverpool in the summer of 1984, signing a permanent deal with Grimsby Town. Foley remained at Blundell Park for just one season, making 40 appearances scoring six goals – before signing with Sheffield United. Foley spent two seasons with the Baldes making 79 appearances scoring 18 goals before moving to Lou Macari's Swindon Town for a fee of £40,000. Foley spent four-and-a-half years at Swindon making 190 appearances scoring 29 goals before moving to Stoke City in January 1992 for a fee of £50,000 to again work under Macari.
Foley filled in at right back for the remainder of the 1991–92 season which saw him play 26 games helping Stoke reach the play-offs where they lost to Stockport County and he did play in the 1992 Football League Trophy Final which Stoke won 1–0 against Stockport. He played in 54 matches, scoring ten goals in 1992–93 as Stoke won the Football League Division Two title.
