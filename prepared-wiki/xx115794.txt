==Format==

Since the introducation of the so-called "back-door" system, a number of changes have taken place in the championship format. In 2004 the following system was used:
The provincial championships in Munster, Leinster, Ulster and Connacht will run as usual on a "knock-out" basis.  These provincial games will then be followed by the "Qualifier" system:
The All-Ireland Quarter-Finals: Each of the four Provincial Champions will play one of the four winners from Round 4. The All-Ireland Semi-Finals shall be on a Provincial rots basis, initially determined by the Central Council. If a Provincial Championship winning team is defeated in its Quarter-Final, the team that defeats it shall take its place in the Semi-Final.
