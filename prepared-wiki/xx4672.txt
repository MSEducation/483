[[Transport in India]]

CATEGORIES: Public transport in India, Transport in India

Transport in the Republic of India is an important part of the nation's economy. Since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, development of infrastructure within the country has progressed at a rapid pace, and today there is a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, India's relatively low GNP per capita has meant that access to these modes of transport has not been uniform.
In the interim, public transport remains the primary mode of transport for most of the population, and India's public transport systems are among the most heavily used in the world. India's rail network is the 4th longest and the most heavily used system in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/EXTSARREGTOPTRANSPORT/0,,contentMDK:20703625~menuPK:868822~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:579598,00.html |title=India Transport Sector|publisher=World Bank[/tpl] transporting 8224 million passengers and over 969 million tonnes of freight annually, as of 2012.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/stat_econ/pdf/YEAR_BOOK_ENG_2011_12/1.pdf | title=Indian Railways Yearbook-2011-12 | publisher=Indian Railways | accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]

Despite ongoing improvements in the sector, several aspects of the transport sector are still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure and lack of investment in less economically active parts of the country. The demand for transport infrastructure and services has been rising by around 10% a year with the current infrastructure being unable to meet these growing demands. According to recent estimates by Goldman Sachs, India will need to spend [tpl]USD[/tpl]1.7 trillion on infrastructure projects over the next decade to boost economic growth, of which [tpl]USD[/tpl]500 billion is budgeted to be spent during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.[tpl]cite news |title= U.S. Pension Funds May Invest in Indian Road Projects, Nath Says  |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=aRSTVq.5UVt8 |date=17 September 2009 |work =Bloomberg |location =New York |author=Shobana Chandra[/tpl]
