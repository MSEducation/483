[[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]]

CATEGORIES: Hungarian royalty, Hungarian monarchs

Grand Prince ([tpl]lang-hu|Nagyfejedelem[/tpl]) was the title used by contemporary sources to name the leader of the federation of the Hungarian tribes in the tenth century.Kōnstantinos Porhyrogennētos mentioned Árpád in his book De Administrando Imperio as [tpl]lang|la|megas Turkias arkhon[/tpl], while Bruno of Querfurt referred to Géza in his Sancti Adalberti Pragensis episcopi et martyris vita altera as [tpl]lang|la|Ungarorum senior magnus[/tpl].
The Grand Prince ([tpl]lang|hu|Nagyfejedelem[/tpl]) was probably elected by the leaders of the federation of the seven Hungarian tribes, and, the three Kabar tribes (dissident Khazar tribes) that joined the Hungarians after 881. However, the first Grand Prince, Álmos, father of Árpád, was more likely appointed by the Khagan of the Khazars[tpl]cn|date=September 2012[/tpl]. It is still under discussion whether the Grand Prince was the spiritual leader of the federation ([tpl]lang|hu|kende[/tpl]), the military commander of the Hungarian tribes ([tpl]lang|hu|gyula[/tpl]), or, the title was a new creation.
When the Hungarians were pushed out of [tpl]lang|hu|Etelköz[/tpl] and moved to the Carpathian Basin ([tpl]lang|hu|Honfoglalás[/tpl]), the Grand Prince's power seemed to be decreasing. By the time of Géza, Transylvania had been ruled by a (semi-)independent leader ([tpl]lang|hu|gyula[/tpl]). Stephen ([tpl]lang|hu|Vajk[/tpl]) had to conquer not only the territories of the [tpl]lang|hu|gyula[/tpl], but also the lands of Ahtum ([tpl]lang|hu|Ajtony[/tpl]) and the Black Magyars.
The title disappeared by the coronation of Stephen I ([tpl]lang|hu|Vajk[/tpl]) on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001.
