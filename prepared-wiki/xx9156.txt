Nuclear winter (also known as atomic winter) is a hypothetical climatic effect of countervalue nuclear war. Models suggest that detonating dozens or more nuclear weapons on cities prone to firestorm, comparable to the Hiroshima city of 1945,[tpl]cite web |url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf |title=Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism.[/tpl] could have a profound and severe effect on the climate causing cold weather and reduced sunlight for a period of months or even years by the emission of large amounts of the firestorms smoke and soot into the Earth's stratosphere.http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/nuclear/
Similar climatic effects are believed to have followed large comet and asteroid impacts in the past, due to sulfate bearing rock being pulverized and lofted high into the air combined with the ignition of multiple forest firestorms,[tpl]cite journal |title=Comet Caused Nuclear Winter |journal=Discover |date=January 2005 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jan/comet-caused-nuclear-winter[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/05/63613|title=A Fiery Death for Dinosaurs?|author=Amit Asaravala|publisher=Wired|date=May 26, 2004[/tpl] which is sometimes termed an impact winter, and following a supervolcano eruption, pluming sulfate aerosols high into the stratosphere, known as a volcanic winter.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/628515.stm|title=Supervolcanoes could trigger global freeze|publisher=BBC | date=February 3, 2000[/tpl]

==Mechanism==

The nuclear winter scenario assumes that if 100 or more city firestorms follow the nuclear explosions of a nuclear war,http://bos.sagepub.com/content/68/5/66.abstract Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear war.  Alan Robock, Owen Brian Toon. Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, September/October 2012; vol. 68, 5: pp. 66-74 and the firestorms loft large enough amounts of sooty smoke into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, soot lifted by the conveyor belt offered by the pyrocumulonimbus clouds that form during a firestorm. At [tpl]convert|10|-|15|km|mi|abbr=off|0[/tpl] above the Earth's surface, the absorption of sunlight could further heat the smoke, lifting some, or all of it, into the stratosphere, where the smoke could persist for years, if there is no rain to wash it out. This aerosol of particles could block out much of the sun's light from reaching the surface, with this causing surface temperatures to drop drastically, and with that, it is predicted surface air temperatures would be akin to, or colder than, a given region's winter, for years on end.

===Aerosol removal timescale===

The exact timescale for how long this smoke remains, and thus how severely this smoke affects the climate once it reaches the stratosphere, is dependent on both chemical and physical removal processes.
The physical removal mechanisms affecting the timescale of smoke particle removal are how quickly the aerosol particles coagulate,Transformation and removal J. Gourdeau, LaMP Clermont-Ferrand, France, March 12, 2003 and fall out of the atmosphere via  dry deposition, and to a slower degree, the time it takes for solar radiation pressure to move the particles to a lower level in the atmosphere. Whether by coagulation or radiation pressure, once the aerosol of smoke particles are at this lower atmospheric level cloud seeding can begin, permitting precipitation to wash the smoke aerosol out of the atmosphere by the wet deposition mechanism.
The chemical processes that affect the removal are dependent on the ability of atmospheric chemistry to oxidize the smoke, via reactions with oxidative species such as ozone and nitrogen oxides,  both of which are found at all levels of the atmosphere.Distribution & concentration (2) Dr. Elmar Uherek - Max Planck Institute for Chemistry Mainz, April 6, 2004 Historical data on residence times of aerosols, albeit a  different mixture of aerosols, in this case stratospheric sulfur aerosols and volcanic ash, from megavolcano eruptions, appear to be in the 1-2 year time scale.How Volcanoes Work - volcano climate effects

===Climatic effects===

A study presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December 2006 found that even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the subtropics would each use 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major populated centres, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and according to the research could be "catastrophic".Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate, Science Daily, December 11, 2006The published papers that were first presented at the AGU Meeting.

===Ozone depletion===

A 2008 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that a nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near-global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and causing environmental damage for at least a decade.[tpl]cite journal |title=Massive global ozone loss predicted following regional nuclear conflict |journal=Proc.

The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, causing a series of chemical reactions that would break down the stratospheric ozone layer protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

==Recent modeling==

Based on new work published in 2007 and 2008 by some of the authors of the original studies, several new hypotheses have been put forth.Climatic Consequences of Nuclear Conflict Department of Environmental Sciences, Rutgers UniversityEnvironmental consequences of nuclear war by Owen B. Toon, Alan Robock, and Richard P. Turco. Physics Today, December 2008.
A minor nuclear war with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as airbursts on urban areas could produce climate change unprecedented in recorded human history. A nuclear war between the United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with temperatures plunging below freezing in the summer in major agricultural regions, threatening the food supply for most of the planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and oceans, show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.
Compared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately A.D. 1600 and A.D. 1850). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 teragrams (Tg) case produce a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 1012 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.

===2007 study on global nuclear war===

A study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in July 2007,Abstract on Journal of Geophysical Research website "Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences",paper available online from Rutgers University website used current climate models to look at the consequences of a global nuclear war involving most or all of the world's current nuclear arsenals (which the authors judged to be one the size of the world's arsenals twenty years earlier). The authors used a global circulation model, ModelE from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which they noted "has been tested extensively in global warming experiments and to examine the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate." The model was used to investigate the effects of a war involving the entire current global nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 150 Tg of smoke into the atmosphere, as well as a war involving about one third of the current nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 50 Tg of smoke. In the 150 Tg case they found that:
In addition, they found that this cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global precipitation by about 45%. As for the 50 Tg case involving one third of current nuclear arsenals, they said that the simulation "produced climate responses very similar to those for the 150 Tg case, but with about half the amplitude," but that "the time scale of response is about the same." They did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that "most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then" and commented that their own results show that "this period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought."
