On September 1, 2009, Flowers was called up from AAA Charlotte Knights after hitting .297 with 15 home runs and 56 RBI between AA Birmingham Barons and AAA Charlotte Knights. He served as the Chicago White Sox third catcher. Flowers had his first major league hit on September 19, 2009 against the Kansas City Royals. In 10 games, Flowers finished the 2009 season batting .188 with no home runs and no RBIs.
Flowers started the 2010 season at AAA Charlotte. He hit .220 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI in 346 at-bats before getting another September call up. Flowers played in 8 games with the White Sox and only had 1 hit in 11 at-bats.
Flowers again started the 2011 season at AAA Charlotte. There he hit .261 with 15 home runs and 32 RBI in 222 at-bats. He was then called up in July to serve as the backup to A.J. Pierzynski after Ramón Castro went down with an injury. Flowers then became the stating catcher mid-August because of an injury to Pierzynski. Flowers hit his first Major League home run on August 13, 2011 against Luke Hochevar and the Kansas City Royals.
Flowers blasted his first Major League grand slam on August 28, 2011 against Jason Vargas and the Seattle Mariners.
With the departure of veteran catcher A.J. Pierzynski in the off season, Flowers became the starting catcher for the White Sox in 2013. Due to his poor play (apparently due to an injury sustained before the season began), Flowers was demoted to backup as the White Sox brought up one of their top rookie prospects, Josh Phegley. Flowers left in early September to have season-ending shoulder surgery. After the season, Flowers signed a one-year deal for $950,000 with Chicago, avoiding arbitration.Twitter / Ken_Rosenthal: Source: Tyler Flowers re-signs with #White Sox, one year, $950,000.
