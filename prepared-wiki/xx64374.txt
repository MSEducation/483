[[National Environmental Directory]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental websites, Directories, Online databases

The National Environmental Directory is the biggest directory of environmental NGOs in the U.S., currently listing over 13,000 organizations.
It is maintained by Harbinger Communications, who started developing their first environmental directory back in 1978. The directory is available online (free) and also as a FileMaker Pro template (for a price).
The Marian Gould Gallagher Law Library of the University of Washington School of Law chose the website as "Website of the Week for Jan. 26, 2004". http://lib.law.washington.edu/webweek/2004/Jan26.html
