[[√Üsir]]

CATEGORIES: Germanic paganism, √Üsir

In Old Norse, [tpl]lang|non|«´ÃÅss[/tpl] (or [tpl]lang|non|√°ss, √°s[/tpl], plural [tpl]lang|non|√¶sir[/tpl]; feminine [tpl]lang|non|√°synja[/tpl], plural [tpl]lang|non|√°synjur[/tpl]) is the term denoting a member of the principal pantheon in the indigenous Germanic religion known as Norse paganism. This pantheon includes Odin, Frigg, Thor, Baldr and T√Ωr. The second pantheon comprises the Vanir. In Norse mythology, the two pantheons wage the √Üsir-Vanir War, which results in a unified pantheon.
The cognate term in Old English is [tpl]lang|ang|≈çs[/tpl] (plural  [tpl]lang|ang|ƒìse[/tpl]) denoting a deity in Anglo-Saxon paganism. The Old High German is [tpl]lang|goh|ans[/tpl], plural [tpl]lang|goh|ens√Æ[/tpl].Jacob Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie 
The Gothic language¬†had  [tpl]lang|got|ans-[/tpl] (based only on Jordanes who glossed anses with uncertain meaning, possibly 'demi-god' and presumably a Latinized form of actual plural [tpl]lang|got|*anseis[/tpl]).Grimm, ch. 2 
The reconstructed  Proto-Germanic form is *[tpl]lang|gem|ansuz[/tpl] (plural *[tpl]lang|gem|ansiwiz[/tpl]). The  ''a''-rune [tpl]Runic|·ö´[/tpl] was named after the √¶sir.
Unlike the Old English word god (and Old Norse [tpl]lang|non|go√∞[/tpl]), the term [tpl]lang|ang|≈çs[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|non|√°ss[/tpl]) was never adopted into Christian use and survived only in a secularized meaning of "pole, beam, stave, hill" or "yoke".

==Etymology==

√Üsir is the plural of √°ss, √≥ss "god" (gen. ƒÅsir) which is attested in other Germanic languages, e.g., Old English ≈çs (gen. pl. ƒìsa) and Gothic (as reported by Jordanes) anses "half-gods". These all stem from Proto-Germanic *ansis ~ ansuz, which itself comes from Proto-Indo-European *[tpl]PIE|h‚ÇÇ√©nsus[/tpl] (gen. [tpl]PIE|h‚ÇÇnÃ•s√≥us[/tpl]) "life force" (cf. Avestan a≈ãh≈´ "lord; lifetime", ahura "godhood", Sanskrit √°su "life force",http://vedabase.net/a/asu √°sura "god" (Old Norse [tpl]lang|non|√°ss[/tpl] has the genitive [tpl]lang|non|√°ss[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|non|√°sar[/tpl], the accusative [tpl]lang|non|√¶si[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|non|√°su[/tpl]. In genitival compounds, it takes the form [tpl]lang|non|√°sa-[/tpl], e.g. in [tpl]lang|non|√Åsa-√û√≥rr[/tpl] "Thor of the Aesir", besides  [tpl]lang|non|√°s-[/tpl] found in √°s-br√∫ "gods' bridge" (the rainbow), [tpl]lang|non|√°s-gar√∞r[/tpl], [tpl]lang|non|√°s-kunnigr[/tpl] "gods' kin", [tpl]lang|non|√°s-li√∞ar[/tpl] "gods' leader", [tpl]lang|non|√°s-mogin[/tpl] "gods' might" (especially of Thor), [tpl]lang|non|√°s-m√≥√∞r[/tpl] "divine wrath" etc. [tpl]lang|non|Land√¢s[/tpl] "national god" ([tpl]lang|la|patrium numen[/tpl]) is a title of Thor, as is  [tpl]lang|non|allm√°ttki √°s[/tpl] "almighty god", while it is Odin who is "the" [tpl]lang|non|√°s[/tpl].
The feminine's [tpl]lang|non|-ynja[/tpl] suffix is known from a few other nouns denoting female animals, such as [tpl]lang|non|apynja[/tpl] "female monkey", [tpl]lang|non|vargynja[/tpl] "she-wolf".
The word for "goddess" is not attested outside of Old Norse.
The latinization of Danish Aslak as Ansleicusthe name of a Danish Viking converted to Christianity in AD 864 according to the Miracles de St. Riquier indicates that the nasalization in the first syllable persisted into the 9th century.
The cognate Old English form to [tpl]lang|non|√°ss[/tpl] is [tpl]lang|ang|≈çs[/tpl], preserved only as a prefix [tpl]lang|ang|≈ås-[/tpl] in personal names (e.g. Oscar, Osborne, Oswald) and some place names, and as the genitive plural [tpl]lang|ang|ƒìsa[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ang|ƒìsa gescot[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|ang|ylfa gescot[/tpl], "the shots of anses and of elves", [tpl]lang|la|jaculum divorum et geniorum[/tpl]). In Old High German and Old Saxon the word is only attested in personal and place names, e.g. Ansebert, Anselm, Ansfrid, Vihans.
Jordanes has anses for the gods of the Goths."[tpl]lang|la|Tum Gothi, magna potiti per loca victoria, jam proceres suos quasi qui fortuna vincebant, non puros homines, sed semideos, id est anses vocavere.[/tpl]" (ch. 13)

==Norse mythology==

The interaction between the √Üsir and the Vanir has provoked an amount of scholarly theory and speculation. While other cultures have had "elder" and "younger" families of gods, as with the Titans versus the Olympians of ancient Greece, the √Üsir and Vanir were portrayed as contemporaries. The two clans of gods fought battles, concluded treaties, and exchanged hostages (Freyr and Freyja are mentioned as such hostages).
An √°ss like Ullr is almost unknown in the myths, but his name is seen in a lot of geographical names, especially in Sweden, and may also appear on the 3rd century Thorsberg chape, suggesting that his cult was widespread in prehistoric times.
The names of the first three √Üsir in Norse mythology, Vili, V√© and Odin all refer to spiritual or mental state, vili to conscious will or desire, v√© to the sacred or numinous  and √≥√∞r to the manic or ecstatic.

===√Üsir and Vanir===

A second clan of gods, the Vanir, is also mentioned in Norse mythology: the god Njord and his children, Freyr and Freyja, are the most prominent Vanir gods who join the √Üsir as hostages after a war between √Üsir and Vanir. The Vanir appear to have mainly been connected with cultivation and fertility and the √Üsir were connected with power and war. The √Üsir and Vanir may correspond to the Indo-Iranian and vedic Asuras and Devas.
In the Eddas, however, the word √Üsir is used for gods in general, while Asynjur is used for the goddesses in general. For example, in the poem Sk√≠rnism√°l, Freyr was called "Prince of the √Üsir". In the Prose Edda, Njord was introduced as "the third among the √Üsir", and among the Asynjur, Freyja is always listed second only to Frigg.
In surviving tales, the origins of many of the √Üsir are unexplained. Originally, there are just three: Odin and his brothers Vili and V√©. Odin's sons by giantesses are naturally counted as √Üsir. Heimdall and Ullr's connection with the √Üsir is not clearly mentioned. Loki is a j√∂tunn with no evidence of being worshipped, and Njord is a Vanir hostage, but they are often ranked among the √Üsir.
Given the difference between their roles and emphases, some scholars have speculated that the interactions between the √Üsir and the Vanir reflect the types of interaction that were occurring between social classes (or clans) within Norse society at the time.Dum√©zil, 3-4, 18; Turville-Petre, 159-162. According to another theory, the Vanir (and the fertility cult associated with them) may be more archaic than that of the more warlike √Üsir, such that the mythical war may mirror a half-remembered religious conflict.This argument was first suggested by Wilhelm Mannhardt in 1877 (as described in Dum√©zil, xxiii and Munch, 288). On a similar note, Marija Gimbutas argues that the √Üsir and the Vanir represent the displacement of an indigenous Indo-European group by a tribe of warlike invaders (in following her Kurgan hypothesis). See her case in The Living Goddess for more details. Another historical theory is that the inter-pantheon interaction may be an apotheosization of the conflict between the Romans and the Sabines.Turville-Petre, 161. See especially ff. 37. Finally, the noted comparative religion scholar Mircea Eliade speculated that this conflict is actually a later version of an Indo-European myth concerning the conflict between and eventual integration of a pantheon of sky/warrior/ruler gods and a pantheon of earth/economics/fertility gods, with no strict historical antecedents.See this pattern discussed in Eliade's Patterns in Comparative Religion - Section II (30) - The Supplanting of Sky Gods by Fecundators. New York: Sheed & Ward, 1958. Supporting this position, Turville-Petre notes, "In one civilization, and at one time, the specialized gods of fertility might predominate, and in another the warrior or the god-king. The highest god owes his position to those who worship him, and if they are farmers, he will be a god of fertility, or one of the Vanir" (162).

===List of √Üsir===

Gylfaginning (20.ff) gives a list of twelve male aesir, not including Odin their chief, nor including Loki, "whom some call the backbiter of the asas":
 
 Then said Gangleri: Which are the √Üsir in whom it is man‚Äôs duty to believe? Har answers: Twelve are the √Üsir of the race of gods. Then said Jafnhar: The Asynjur are not less holy and they are not less capable. Then said Thrithi:  Odin is the greatest and oldest of the √Üsir. ...  Frigg is his wife, and she knows the fate of men, although she tells not thereof. ...
(33.) There is yet one who is numbered among the asas, but whom some call the backbiter of the asas. He is the originator of deceit, and the disgrace of all gods and men. His name is Loki, or Lopt. ... His wife hight Sigyn, and their son, Nare, or Narfe.

Corresponding to the fourteen √Üsir listed above, section 36 lists fourteen asynjur:
 
 Ganglere asked: Which are the goddesses? Har answered:
Sol and Bil are numbered among the goddesses, but their nature has already been described.

==The A-rune==

The a-rune [tpl]Runic|·ö´[/tpl], Younger Futhark [tpl]Unicode|·ö¨[/tpl] was probably named after the √Üsir. The name in this sense survives only in the Icelandic rune poem as √ìss,  referring to Odin in particular, identified with Jupiter:
The name of [tpl]script|Goth|êå∞[/tpl] a in the Gothic alphabet is ahsa. The common Germanic name of the rune may thus have either been ansuz "God, one of the √Üsir", or ahsam "ear (of corn)"

==Asleikr==

The personal names Old Norse √Åsleikr (Latinized  Ansleicus), Old English √ìsl√°c (modern "Hasluck") and Old High German Ansleh may continue the term for a sacrificial performance for the gods in early Germanic paganism (*[tpl]lang|gem|ansu-laikom[/tpl]). Grimm's Deutsches W√∂rterbuch (s.v. "Leich") compares *laikom to the meaning of Greek [tpl]lang|grc|œáŒøœÅŒøœÇ[/tpl], denoting first the ceremonial procession to the sacrifice, but also ritual dance and hymns pertaining to religious ritual. Hermann (1906)[ref]Paul Hermann, 
Deutsche Mythologie in Gemeinverst√§ndlicher Darstellung (1906) p. 342; also in Altdeutsche Kultgebr√§uche, Jena (1928)[/ref] identifies as such *ansulaikom  the victory songs of the Batavi after defeating Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus' account), and also the "nefarious song" accompanied by "running in a circle" around the head of a decapitated goat sacrificed to (he presumes) Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579 according to the report of Pope Gregory the Great (Dialogues ch. 28).

==Personal names==

Theophoric Anglo-Saxon names containing the os element:
Osmund, Osburh, Oslac, Oswald, Oswiu, Oswin, Osbert, Oswudu, Osred, Oslaf, Oesa (i-mutated from a *√ìs-i-), Osgar (Anglo-Saxon form of √Åsgeir''). These names were notably popular in the Bernician dynasty.
Still-current are the surname Osgood and Osborn.
As occurs in many Scandinavian names: Asbj√∏rn, Asgeir (Asger, Asker), Asmund, Astrid, Asd√Æs, Asgautr, Aslaug, √Öse etc. Gothic has Ansila and Ansemund, Old High German has Anso, Anshelm, Anshilt, Anspald, Ansn√¥t, and Lombardic  has Answald and Ansprand.
As also occurs in some English names.
In 874, King Asketil was one of four Viking nobles who sacked Repton, the capital of Mercia, England. As 'ketil' means 'cauldron' (from whence the English word 'kettle' is derived), his name means 'God's cauldron'. The English surname Astle is derived from his name, however it is not related to the name Astley. Less common alternative spellings of Astle include Astel, Astell, Astill, Astyll and Astull.

==√Åsatr√∫==

√Åsatr√∫, meaning "faith in the √Üsir", is a new religious movement of polytheistic reconstructionism based on Norse paganism. As of 2007, √Åsatr√∫ is a religion officially recognized by the governments of Iceland, Norway, Denmark,[tpl]Failed verification|date=April 2009[/tpl]Kirkeministeriet and Sweden.
In spite of the literal meaning of √Åsatr√∫, most adherents do not emphasize worship of the √Üsir in particular. The Icelandic √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ describes √Åsatr√∫ as "Nordic pantheism" involving "belief  in the Icelandic/Nordic folklore" including all the "spirits and entities" besides "gods and other beings" this entails.The Icelandic version has "√Åsatr√∫ is a pagan tradition based on tolerance, honesty, magnanimity and respect for nature and all life." (√Åsatr√∫ e√∞a hei√∞inn si√∞ur byggir √° umbur√∞arlyndi, hei√∞arleika, drengskap og vir√∞ingu fyrir n√°tt√∫runni og √∂llu l√≠fi.) (2006) The American Asatru Folk Assembly  defines √Åsatr√∫ as "an expression of the native, pre-Christian spirituality of Europe" postulating it as "native European religion" in general "just as there is Native American religion and native African religion"."The soul of Asatru, however, is not confined to the Scandinavian model, but encapsulates the belief of all the Germanic peoples. Indeed, Asatru reflects the deeper religiosity common to virtually all the nations of Europe." runestone.org, accessed December 2007
