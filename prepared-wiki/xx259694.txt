CATEGORIES: Referendums in Egypt, 1987 in Egypt, 1987 referendums

A referendum on electoral reform was held in Egypt on 12 February 1987. The reform would set aside 48 seats for independent candidates at elections. The change in the law had been hastily adopted in December 1986 in order to pre-empt the Constitutional Court ruling that the 1984 elections had been unconstitutional as they had not allowed independent candidates to stand. The changes were approved by 88.9% of voters,Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p341 ISBN 0-19-829645-2 leading to the early dissolution of the People's Assembly and early elections in April.The Middle East and North Africa 2003 p292
