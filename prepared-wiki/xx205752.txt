CATEGORIES: Music schools in Scotland, Schools in Aberdeen

The North East of Scotland Music School is an independent charitable foundation established in Aberdeen, Scotland by the late Dorothy Hately MBE in 1975 with the encouragement of
Lady Aberdeen. Its aim is to provide advanced tuition not normally available within the statutory sector by bringing internationally recognised teachers to Aberdeen on a regular basis. Entry to the school is by audition on the basis of musical ability regardless of age but limited to persons living in Scotland.NESMS Official site 
The school is financed through a mixture of local authority grant aid (Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire Councils), corporate sponsorship, donations from trusts, and volunteer fund-raising. Students pay their own (subsidised) fees but competitive scholarships are awarded annually on a balance of musical potential and financial need. 
Patrons include Murray McLachlan, Eileen Croxford Parkhouse, Evelyn Glennie, Fiona Kennedy and Neil Mackie. Current tutors include Alan Watt and Donald Maxwell (voice), Roger Williams (organ), Joseph Long and Nigel Clayton (piano), Ian Wilson (recorder) and Paul Anderson (Scottish fiddle).
