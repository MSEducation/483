The Quebec general election of 1939 was held on October 25, 1939 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by former premier Adélard Godbout, defeated the incumbent Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis.
This was Godbout's second non-consecutive term of office and his only victory out of four consecutive general elections opposing Duplessis.
The Action libérale nationale, which had won 25 seats in the 1935 election and then merged with the Quebec Conservative Party, was re-formed by Paul Gouin, who had split with Duplessis soon after the formation of the Union Nationale.  However the ALN obtained only 4.5% of the vote and no seats. It soon disbanded.  Also, a rump Conservative Party ran three candidates who won 0.2% of the vote and no seats. This party also disbanded.
