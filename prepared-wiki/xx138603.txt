The United Nations Act 1946 (c 45) was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as a means of putting the job of implementing the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in the hands of the government rather than Parliament. A similar mechanism is used in the European Communities Act 1972.

Sub-section (1) allows The Crown to implement United Nations Security Council Resolutions without the official approval of Parliament.

Subsection (5) authorizes the implementation of these orders to come from general taxation. Section 1 reads as follows.

On 27 January 2010 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that the 2006 Order was ultra vires and void, because the 1946 Act was not intended to authorise coercive measures which interefere with fundamental rights without Parliamentary scrutiny.UK Supreme Court website (see 27.1.2010) On 4 February the Court refused to stay the effect of its judgement until Parliament could change the law.ibid. This led to Parliament passing the temporary Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Act 2010 on 10 February to retrospectively legitimise the 2006 Order until Parliament has time to pass permanent legislation complying with the Court's ruling.
