Narsapur is one of the major towns in Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is located 60 km north of Hyderabad. The history of this town dates back to the Kakatiya reign. Although people of various religious backgrounds live in Narsapur town, they have embraced the Telangana culture.
Narsapur is a small town with greenery, surrounded by hills and thick forest. Earlier Narsapur was known for "Naxalites"; but more recently it has changed substantially because of modernization and development in AP, especially in areas surrounding Hyderabad. Narsapur has one of the largest village irrigation tanks (Rai Rao Cheruvu) in Medak District.
