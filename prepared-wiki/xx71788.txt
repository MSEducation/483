Nanga Parbat (literally, Naked Mountain Urdu: [tpl]Nastaliq|نانگا پربت[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-hns|nəŋɡaː pərbət̪|[/tpl]) is the ninth highest mountain in the world.  It is the western anchor of the Himalayas around which the Indus river skirts before it debouches into the plains of Pakistan.  It is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is locally known as 'Deo Mir' ('mir' meaning 'mountain').The Pamirs and the Source of the Oxus. (1896) George Nathaniel Curzon. Royal Geographical Society, London, p. 16.
Nanga Parbat is one of the eight-thousanders, with a summit elevation of [tpl]convert|8126|m|ft|0[/tpl]. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain, Nanga Parbat is also a notoriously difficult climb. Numerous mountaineering deaths in the mid and early 20th century lent it the nickname "killer mountain".  Along with K2, it has never been climbed in winter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/786151/nanga-parbat-repels-climbers/|title=Nanga Parbat repels climbers|publisher=dawn.com|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=2013-06-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://altitudepakistan.blogspot.com.es/|title=History of Winter Climbing Nanga Parbat|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=2013-06-25[/tpl]

==Location==

Nanga Parbat forms the western anchor of the Himalayan Range and is the westernmost eight-thousander. It lies just south of the Indus River in the Diamer District of Gilgit–Baltistan in Pakistan.  Not far to the north is the western end of the Karakoram range.

==Notable features==

Nanga Parbat has tremendous vertical relief over local terrain in all directions.[tpl]cn|date = March 2014[/tpl]
To the south, Nanga Parbat boasts what is often referred to as the highest mountain face in the world: the Rupal Face rises [tpl]convert|4600|m|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] above its base. To the north, the complex, somewhat more gently sloped Rakhiot Flank rises [tpl]convert|7000|m|ft|0|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Indus River valley to the summit in just [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], one of the 10 greatest elevation gains in so short a distance on Earth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Nanga Parbat is one of only two peaks on Earth that rank in the top twenty of both the highest mountains in the world, and the most prominent peaks in the world, ranking ninth and fourteenth respectively. The other is Mount Everest, which is first on both lists.[tpl]cn|date = March 2014[/tpl]
Nanga Parbat along with Namcha Barwa on the Tibetan Plateau are both considered[tpl]bywhom|date=March 2014[/tpl] to mark the west and east ends of the Himalayas.[tpl]cn|date = March 2014[/tpl]

==Layout of the mountain==

The core of Nanga Parbat is a long ridge trending southwest–northeast. The ridge is an enormous bulk of ice and rock. It has three faces, Diamir face, Rakhiot and Rupal. The southwestern portion of this main ridge is known as the Mazeno Wall, and has a number of subsidiary peaks. In the other direction, the main ridge arcs northeast at Rakhiot Peak (7,070 m / 23,196 ft). The south/southeast side of the mountain is dominated by the massive Rupal Face, noted above. The north/northwest side of the mountain, leading to the Indus, is more complex. It is split into the Diamir (west) face and the Rakhiot (north) face by a long ridge. There are a number of subsidiary summits, including North Peak (7,816 m / 25,643 ft) some 3 km north of the main summit. Near the base of the Rupal Face is a beautiful glacial lake called Latbo, above a seasonal shepherds' village of the same name.

==Climbing history==

===Early attempts===

Climbing attempts started very early on Nanga Parbat. In 1895 Albert F. Mummery led an expedition to the peak, and reached almost 7,000 m (23,000 ft) on the Diamir (West) Face, but Mummery and two Gurkha companions later died reconnoitering the Rakhiot Face.
In the 1930s, Nanga Parbat became the focus of German interest in the Himalayas. The German mountaineers were unable to attempt Mount Everest, as only the British had access to Tibet. Initially German efforts focused on Kanchenjunga, to which Paul Bauer led two expeditions in 1930 and 1931, but with its long ridges and steep faces Kanchenjunga was more difficult than Everest and neither expedition made much progress. K2 was known to be harder still, and its remoteness meant that even reaching its base would be a major undertaking. Nanga Parbat was therefore the highest mountain accessible to Germans which they seemed to have a chance of climbing.Neale, pp. 63–64
The first German expedition to Nanga Parbat was led by Willy Merkl in 1932. It is sometimes referred to as a German-American expedition, as the eight climbers included Rand Herron, an American, and Fritz Wiessner, who would become an American citizen the following year. While the team were all strong climbers, none had Himalayan experience, and poor planning (particularly an inadequate number of porters), coupled with bad weather, prevented the team progressing far beyond the Rakhiot Peak northeast of the Nanga Parbat summit, reached by Peter Aschenbrenner and Herbert Kunigk, but they did establish the feasibility of a route via Rakhiot Peak and the main ridge.Mason, pp. 226–228
Merkl led another expedition in 1934, which was better prepared and financed with the full backing of the new Nazi government. Early in the expedition Alfred Drexel died, probably of high altitude pulmonary edema.Neale, pp. 123-130 The Tyrolean climbers Peter Aschenbrenner and Erwin Schneider reached an estimated height of (7,895 m / 25,900 ft) on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7 they and 14 others were trapped by a ferocious storm at 7,480 m (24,540 ft). During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers, Uli Wieland, Willo Welzenbach and Merkl himself, and six Sherpas died of exhaustion, exposure and altitude sickness, and several more suffered severe frostbite. The last survivor to reach safety, Ang Tsering, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm.Mason pp. 230-233 It has been said that the disaster, "for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals."Simpson, pp. 196–197
In 1937, Karl Wien led another expedition to the mountain, following the same route as Merkl's expeditions had done. Progress was made, but more slowly than before due to heavy snowfall. Some time around the 14th of June seven Germans and nine Sherpas, almost the entire team, were at Camp IV below Rakhiot Peak when it was overwhelmed by an avalanche. All sixteen men died instantly in what remains the worst single disaster to occur on an 8000 m peak.Neale, pp. 212-213
The Germans returned in 1938 led by Paul Bauer, but the expedition was plagued by bad weather, and Bauer, mindful of the previous disasters, ordered the party down before the Silver Saddle, halfway between Rakhiot Peak and Nanga Parbat summit, was reached.Mason pp. 236-237 The following year a small four man expedition, including Heinrich Harrer, explored the Diamir Face with the aim of finding an easier route. They concluded that the face was a viable route, but the Second World War intervened and the four men were interned in India.Mason pp. 238-239 Harrer's escape and subsequent travels became the subject of his book Seven Years in Tibet.

===First ascent===

Nanga Parbat was first climbed, via the Rakhiot Flank (East Ridge), on July 3, 1953 by Austrian climber Hermann Buhl,nangaroutesnew.pdf, Eberhard Jurgalski (rosemon), last updated 17 June 2010, retrieved from http://www.8000ers.com/cms/en/nanga-parbat-general-info-197.html 22 July 2011. a member of a German-Austrian team. The expedition was organized by the half-brother of Willy Merkl, Karl Herrligkoffer from Munich, while the expedition leader was Peter Aschenbrenner from Innsbruck, who had participated in the 1932 and 1934 attempts. By the time of this expedition, 31 people had already died on the mountain.This includes two British climbers who disappeared low on the mountain in December 1950. They were studying conditions on the Rakhiot glacier, not attempting the summit. See Mason p. 306. The final push for the summit was dramatic: Buhl continued alone, after his companions had turned back, and arrived at 7 p.m.; the climbing being harder and more time consuming than he had anticipated. His descent was slowed when he lost a crampon. Caught by darkness, he was forced to bivouac standing upright on a narrow ledge, holding a small handhold with one hand. Exhausted, he dozed occasionally, but managed to maintain his balance. He was also very fortunate to have a calm night, so he was not subjected to wind chill. He finally reached his high camp at 7 p.m. the next day, 40 hours after setting out.Sale & Cleare, pp. 72–73 The ascent was made without oxygen, and Buhl is the only man to have made the first ascent of an 8000 m peak alone.

===Subsequent attempts and ascents===

The second ascent of Nanga Parbat was via the Diamir Face, in 1962, by Germans Toni Kinshofer, S. Lِw, and A. Mannhardt.  The route is now the "standard route" on the mountain. The Kinshofer route does not ascend the middle of the Diamir Face, which is threatened by avalanches from massive hanging glaciers. Instead it climbs a buttress on the left side of the face.
In 1970 the brothers Günther and Reinhold Messner made the third ascent of the mountain and the first ascent of the Rupal Face. They were unable to descend by their original route, and instead descended by the Diamir Face, making the first traverse of the mountain. Unfortunately Günther was killed in an avalanche on the Diamir Face. (Messner's account of this incident has been disputed. In 2005 Günther's remains were found on the Diamir Face.)
In 1971 Ivan Fiala and Michael Orolin summited Nanga Parbat via Buhl's 1953 route while other expedition members climbed the SE peak (7,600 m / 24,925 ft) above the Silbersattel and the foresummit (7,850 m / 25,760 ft) above the Bazhin Gap.
In 1978 Reinhold Messner returned to the Diamir Face and achieved the first completely solo ascent (i.e. always solo above Base Camp) of an 8,000 m peak.
In 1984 the French climber Lilliane Barrard became the first woman to climb Nanga Parbat, along with her husband Maurice Barrard.
In 1985, Jerzy Kukuczka, Zygmunt Heinrich, Slawomir Lobodzinski (all Polish) and Carlos Carsolio (Mexico) climbed a bold line up the Southeast Pillar (or Polish Spur) on the right-hand side of the Rupal Face, reaching the summit July 13.  It was Kukuczka's 9th 8000m summit.[tpl]Citation  | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Basecamp | journal = Climbing Magazine | volume = | issue = 93 | pages = 22 | date = December 1995 | year = | url = | doi = | issn = 0045-7159 [/tpl]
Also in 1985, a Polish women's team climbed the peak via the 1962 German Diamir Face route.  Wanda Rutkiewicz, Krystyna Palmowska and Anna Czerwinska reached the summit on July 15.
"Modern" superalpinism was brought to Nanga Parbat in 1988 with an unsuccessful attempt or two on the Rupal Face by Barry Blanchard, Mark Twight, Ward Robinson and Kevin Doyle.[tpl]Cite book | last = Twight | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Kiss or kill: confessions of a serial climber | publisher = The Mountaineers Books | year = 2001 | location = Seattle WA, USA | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-89886-887-4 [/tpl]
2005 saw a resurgence of lightweight, alpine-style attempts on the Rupal Face:
On July 17 or 18, 2006, José Antonio Delgado from Venezuela died a few days after reaching the summit, where he was caught by bad weather for six days and was unable to make his way down. He is the only Venezuelan climber, and one of few Latin Americans, to have reached the summit of five eight-thousanders.NANGA PARBAT 2006 Part of the expedition and the rescue efforts at base camp were captured on video, as Delgado was the subject of a pilot for a mountaineering television series. Explorart Films, the production company, later developed the project into a feature documentary film called Beyond the Summit, which was scheduled to be released in South America in January 2008.Mas Alla de la Cumbre - Beyond the Summit
On July 15, 2008, Italian alpinist Karl Unterkircher fell into a crevasse during an attempt to open a new route to the top with Walter Nones and Simon Kehrer. Unterkircher died, but Kehrer and Nones were rescued by the Pakistani army.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/25/italy.pakistan|title=Italian climbers rescued from Pakistan's Killer Mountain, Nanga Parbat|publisher=Guardian|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl]
On July 12, 2009, after reaching the summit, South Korean climber Go Mi-Young fell off a cliff on the descent in bad weather in her race to be the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.[tpl]cite web|url=https://himalman.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/tragedy-on-nanga-parba-2009-climbing-season-korean-star-climber-miss-go-lost-on-nanga-parbat-normal-route/|title=Korean Alpinist Go Mi-sun Dies After Fall on Nanga Parbat|publisher=himalman.wordpress.com|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl]
On July 15, 2012 Scottish mountaineers Sandy Allan and Rick Allen made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat via the 10 km-long Mazeno Ridge,[tpl]cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2012/07/20/coming-down-nanga-parbat-as-hard-as-going-up/|title=Coming down Nanga Parbat as hard as going up|publisher=dawn.com|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl] and in April 2013 were awarded the Piolet d'Or for their achievement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-22246000|title=Aberdeen and Newtonmore climbers win Piolet d'Or|publisher=BBC News|date=22 April 2013|accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl]

===Winter climbing===

Nanga Parbat is yet to be climbed in winter; 22 expeditions have tried this feat up till 2014. 11 expeditions conducted by Poles, famous for their winter climbing on eight-thousanders.
