The League of Democratic Socialists ([tpl]lang-de|Bund Demokratischer Sozialisten[/tpl]) is an Austrian political party formerly affiliated with the World Socialist Movement, though unlike most other WSM parties, it did not start as an offshoot of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.
BDS contested the 1959 legislative election, getting 2 190 votes (0.1%).http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/nrw_100559.asp
Though nominally favouring a classless, moneyless, egalitarian society, in recent years the Bund's newspaper has printed a number of nationalistic, anti-immigration articles.  As the opinions expressed in these articles could not be reconciled with the WSM's Declaration of Principles, the Bund was dropped as a WSM companion party circa 2003.
