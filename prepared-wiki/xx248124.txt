The Lord of the Rings film series is a series of epic fantasy-drama films directed by Peter Jackson. The three films, entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, were released serially worldwide between December 2001 and 2003. They are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings, adapted for the screen by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens. Set in Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, the plot follows the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his fellow members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, which will rid Middle-earth of the Dark Lord Sauron. A large ensemble cast was featured in the series, which included Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, John Noble, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif.

According to film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 92 percent of critics were favorable about The Fellowship of the Ring. Entertainment Weekly columnist Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film "thrilling – a great picture, a triumphant picture, a joyfully conceived work of cinema that (based on this first installment, with two more ready for release in the next two years) would appear to embrace Tolkien's classic with love and delight, and rewards both adepts and novices with the highest compliment of all: an intelligence and artistry as a movie independent of blind fidelity to the page."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,187102,00.html |title=Review: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) |first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum |authorlink=Lisa Schwarzbaum |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=5 December 2001 |accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl] Nev Pierce of BBC added, "Funny, scary and, totally involving, Peter Jackson's assured adaptation of J. R.

The worldwide theatrical release of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers occurred on 18 December 2002.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2545721.stm |title=Two Towers to make US debut  |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2002 |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] The series' second film earned a worldwide gross of $926,047,111 based on a production budget of $94 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twotowers.htm |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)  |publisher=Box Office Mojo  |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] The film introduced new characters played by Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, David Wenham, and Brad Dourif.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/18/1040174292204.html |title=New players enter the ring  |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |first= Evan |last=Henerson |date=19 December 2002 |accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl]
The Two Towers received critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an "utter triumph",[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-12-17/entertainment/sproject.ca02.review.two.towers_1_gollum-sam-and-frodo-elf-archer?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Review: 'Two Towers' a seamless triumph |publisher=CNN |first=Paul |last=Clinton|date=17 December 2002 |accessdate=12 December 2011[/tpl] and writer Philip French of The Guardian noted in a review of the second film that "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/dec/15/lordoftherings.jrrtolkien |title=That's another fine myth ... |work=The Guardian |first=Philip|last=French |date=15 December 2002 |accessdate=12 December 2011 |location=London[/tpl] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, what it comes down to is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,396271,00.html |title=Movie review: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Owen|last=Gleiberman |date=4 December 2002 |accessdate=12 December 2011[/tpl] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sefca.org/a2002.html|title=Top Ten Films 2002|publisher=Southeastern Film Critics Association |accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl]
The Two Towers won two out of six Academy Award nominations and three accolades out of ten nominations at the 56th British Academy Film Awards.

Various critics groups, such as Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle also awarded the film. In total, The Two Towers received 62 awards out of 129 nominations.

==The Return of the King==

The worldwide theatrical release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King occurred on 17 December 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3608101/The-King-of-Middle-Earth.html |title=The King of Middle-Earth |first=John |last=Hiscock  |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 December 2003 |accessdate=8 December 2011 |location=London[/tpl] The series' third film earned a worldwide gross of $1,119,929,521 off a production budget of $94,000,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=returnoftheking.htm |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)  |publisher=Box Office Mojo  |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] In addition to containing most of the cast from the previous two films, The Return of the King introduced Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, played by John Noble (though the character appeared in the extended edition of The Two Towers).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922580/ |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King |work=Variety |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-11-19-tower-dvd_x.htm |title='Towers Extended' towers with extras |work=USA Today |first=Mike |last=Snider |date=19 November 2003 |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl]
The Return of the King continued the series' critical success, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 94 percent of the critics were positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times believed the film to be the best of the three, as it "certifies the Ring trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031217/REVIEWS/312170301/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date= 17 December 2003 |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum was equally praiseworthy of the final chapter. She explained, "I can't think of another film trilogy that ends in such glory, or another monumental work of sustained storytelling that surges ahead with so much inventiveness and ardor. The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk-taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious, a rarity now that CGI prowess has fallen into the hands of run-of-the-mill studio ring-chasers."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031217/REVIEWS/312170301/1023 |first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum |authorlink=Lisa Schwarzbaum |title=Movie Review The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) |work=Entertainment Weekly |date= 19 December 2003 |accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl] The Guardian[tpl]'[/tpl]s Peter Bradshaw wrote, "With enormous energy and a passionately exacting eye for detail, Jackson has made the regressive-romantic legend live again. He has given the Tolkien myth a turbo-charged rush into the 21st century."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/dec/19/lordoftherings |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King |work=The Guardian |date= 18 December 2003 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |location=London[/tpl] It topped the Southeastern Film Critics top ten films, while the Central Ohio Film Critics Association named it the second best.
The film won eleven Academy Awards, tying Titanic and Ben-Hur for the most Oscars won. The Return of the King also became the first and to date only fantasy film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Return of the King won five BAFTAs, three Empire Awards, four Golden Globes, one Satellite Award, and eight Saturn Awards, among others. In total, the film received 116 awards out of 174 nominations.
