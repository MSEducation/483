The 2010 New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was a tornado outbreak that developed on the night of Thursday, December 30, 2010 with most of the activity on Friday morning, December 31, and a few tornadoes in the early hours of Saturday, January 1, 2011. Many tornadoes developed in a large portion of the central United States from Mississippi northward to Illinois. At least 9 people were killed as a result of the tornadoes, and it is the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US in the month of December since 2000 and one of the largest December outbreaks ever recorded.http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tornadoes/2010/12

==Meteorological synopsis==

After a long lull in activity (only two tornadoes were confirmed in the US in December before this outbreak), a series of intense storms tracked across the Midwest starting late on December 30. The intensifying storm resulting in unseasonably warm weather tracking northward across the Midwest and South ahead of a strong cold front, and the potential for severe weather existed for December 31. However, right up to initiation and even afterward, the degree of activity was seen as quite uncertain, and the Storm Prediction Center only issued a low-end slight risk of severe weather as instability was fairly low despite the very high wind shear.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2010/day1otlk_20101231_1200.html That area was expanded northward during the day, but the probabilities were never increased as it was thought that activity would remain scattered at most given the less-than-optimal conditions.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2010/day1otlk_20101231_1630.html
However, tornadoes touched down early and often that day, overcoming the conditions. Early that morning, a tornado touched down in Washington County, Arkansas, destroying houses and killing at least four people. In nearby Benton County, Arkansas, another tornado caused significant damage and injuries.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/12/31/arkansas.tornado/ | work=CNN | title=Midwest storms leave 6 dead, cause widespread damage | date=January 1, 2011| accessdate= 31 December 2010 [/tpl]
More damaging tornadoes touched down late that morning across much of Missouri and into west-central Illinois. In Rolla, Missouri, at least three people were killed and several others were injured. It is the deadliest December tornado outbreak in the US since December 16, 2000 and they were the first killer US tornadoes since September 16.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/31/national/main7200679.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Deadly Tornado Slams Ark., Mo.; 6 Dead | date=December 31, 2010| accessdate= 31 December 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110101113310/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/31/national/main7200679.shtml| archivedate= 1 January 2011| deadurl= no[/tpl] Numerous tornadoes also touched down in the St. Louis metropolitan area which were embedded in a squall line, including reports in the city of St. Louis itself. The most significant damage was in Sunset Hills and injuries were reported there.http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/101231_rpts.html
Another round of storms developed in the Deep South that afternoon. The worst storms developed in Mississippi and a tornado emergency was issued late that afternoon in the Jackson, Mississippi area. Additional activity continued through the evening hours and into early January 1.
