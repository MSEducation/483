==History==

The Kembara Mahkota Johor is a brainchild of Tunku Ibrahim Ismail, the Crown Prince (Tunku Mahkota) of Johor due to his desire to meet with fellow Johoreans and provide charity to the poor.[tpl]citeweb |url=http://www.kembaramahkotajohor.com.my/pendahuluan.htm |title=Sejarah Kembara Mahkota Johor |language=Malay |publisher=Kembara Mahkota Johor Official Website |date = 2008-07-27 | accessdate = 2008-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080717134315/http://www.kembaramahkotajohor.com.my/pendahuluan.htm  |archivedate = 2008-07-17[/tpl] According to him, during the feudal age, the king or the crown prince rode an elephant to travel all over the state for the same reason as the Kembara Mahkota Johor. The royal tour debuted on 2 July 2001, participated by a group of 28 motorcyclists led by the Tunku Mahkota himself and covered all 8 districts (now 10 districts) in Johor, with the total distance of 870 km.
During the tour, Tunku Ibrahim Ismail is famous for riding his trademark Harley-Davidson motorcycle with the "tiger stripe"-painted body. However, the 2002 edition of the tour was the only tour that he did not ride his Harley-Davidson motorcycle - instead, all participants rode the Modenas Jaguh motorcycle as Modenas became one of the main sponsor for the 2002 Kembara Mahkota Johor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kembaramahkotajohor.com.my/kmj2002.htm |title=Kronologi Sejarah Kembara Mahkota Johor 2002 |language=Malay |publisher=Kembara Mahkota Johor Official Website |date = 2008-07-27 | accessdate = 2008-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730034537/http://www.kembaramahkotajohor.com.my/kmj2002.htm  |archivedate = 2008-07-30[/tpl]
