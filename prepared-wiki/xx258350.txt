==Background and early career==

He was born in Dublin, son of James Hughes, solicitor and Margaret Morton.Ball, F. Elrington  The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.302 He went to a private school at Jervis St., Dublin and matriculated at the University of Dublin in 1825, but did not proceed to a degree. He entered  the King's Inn in 1830, and Gray's Inn in 1832 . He was called to the Irish Bar in 1834, Queen's Counsel in 1844.Ball, p.302
He practiced at the Chancery Bar and rapidly built up a very large practice; he became renowned for his mastery of Chancery procedure, which was then very complex. His book Chancery Practice (1837) enjoyed success.Fitzgerald, John Donohoe  "Henry George Hughes " Dictionary of National Biography Vol.28 p.137 He was equally successful at the Inner Bar.

==Political and legal career==

Before entering Parliament for Longford he had stood unsuccessfully for Cavan in 1855. He was a Roman Catholic and could generally rely on the support of the Catholic hierarchy, although his support for the Ecclesiastical Titles Act offended some of his co-religionists.Fitzgerald p.137
His appointment to the Bench was well -deserved, but is said to have been partly the result of a policy to  increase the number of Catholic judges. The appointment of such a noted Chancery lawyer to a common-law court caused some surprise, but in time he was recognised as one of the few lawyers who had successfully made the transition.Fitzgerald p.137

==Family==

He married Isabella l'Estrange, daughter of Major Francis l'Estrange. They had two daughters, of whom Anna, the elder, married the future Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Michael Morris, 1st Baron Killanin.Ball p.302 He died at Bray in 1872.
