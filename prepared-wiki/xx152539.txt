The 2004 Football League Cup Final (known as the Carling Cup final for sponsorship reasons) was played between Bolton Wanderers and Middlesbrough at the Millennium Stadium on 29 February 2004. Middlesbrough won the game 2–1 to clinch their first major trophy. Middlesbrough forward Joseph-Désiré Job put Middlesbrough ahead inside two minutes from a tap-in after a Boudewijn Zenden cross. The goal was the fastest ever scored in a League Cup final, but this record would be broken a year later by Liverpool's John Arne Riise. Five minutes after Job's goal, Middlesbrough won a penalty when Job was tripped in the Bolton box by Emerson Thome. Boudewijn Zenden stepped up to take the spot kick and beat Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen.
Kevin Davies scored for Bolton on 21 minutes when an error by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer allowed Davies' shot to squirm inside his near post, but it proved to be a consolation as the match finished 2–1 to Middlesbrough.
