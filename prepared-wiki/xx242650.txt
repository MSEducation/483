==Early life==

McGinty was born into a Catholic family in Derry, Northern Ireland, the son of Damian McGinty, Sr., and Joanne McGinty. Damian has two siblings, Emmet and Gemma. He has been performing for over a decade, winning his first singing competition when he was just five years old. In 2006, McGinty won another competition and the following year he made a CD which was recorded for charity. It was then passed along to Celtic Thunder Producer Sharon Browne and Music Director Phil Coulter, who invited McGinty to sing for their first show. McGinty was later accepted into the group at the age of 14 and has been performing, as well as touring the USA and Canada, with Celtic Thunder.

==Career==

In 2011, it was stated that McGinty was leaving Celtic Thunder, as a result of winning the Oxygen reality show The Glee Project, which gave him a seven episode arc on the Fox television show Glee. McGinty was selected as one of the top twelve finalists out of 40,000 contenders in a MySpace audition search, who competed for a role on The Glee Project.[tpl]cite news|title=Filled with GLEE|url=http://irishecho.com/?p=66486|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Irish Echo|date=25 August 2011[/tpl] After making the top twelve, he came close to not being able to continue the competition when he had difficulties securing an O visa.[tpl]cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=[tpl]-'[/tpl]The Glee Project': Winners Share Their Hopes for 'Glee' (Q&A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glee-project-winners-share-hopes-225891|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=22 August 2011[/tpl]
Along with Samuel Larsen, McGinty won a seven-episode arc on the third season of Glee.[tpl]cite news|last=Wang|first=Cynthia|title=The Glee Project Winners 'Honored' to Join Glee|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20521849,00.html|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=People Magazine|date=22 August 2011[/tpl] On his final performance on The Glee Project, McGinty sang "Beyond the Sea", which he chose to show Glee producer Ryan Murphy that he could handle a lead role.[tpl]cite news|last=Stack|first=Tim|title='Glee Project' winners relive last night's shocking twist!|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/22/glee-project-winner/|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=EW|date=22 August 2011[/tpl] Comments from Glee producer Ryan Murphy fuelled speculation that McGinty's character may become a leading role similar to Cory Monteith's character, Finn Hudson.
Following the final episode of The Glee Project, McGinty was featured in a special video on the Oxygen channel website with Cameron Mitchell, who won the Bing Fan Favorite. The two sang Michael Bubl√©'s "Haven't Met You Yet".[tpl]cite web|last=Perez|first=Christina|title=Cameron Mitchell: A Glee Project Winner After All|url=http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2011/08/22/cameron-mitchell-a-glee-project-winner-after-all/|work=FrontBurner|publisher=D Magazine|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl] Mitchell saved McGinty from elimination earlier in the season, when Mitchell chose to leave the competition on the evening that McGinty was slated to be eliminated, though Mitchell hadn't known this when he made his decision. McGinty made his first appearance on Glee in the fourth episode of the season entitled "Pot o' Gold" playing Rory Flanagan, a foreign exchange student who is staying with Brittany S. Pierce's family.[tpl]cite web|title=Keck's Exclusives: First Look at Glee[tpl]'s[/tpl] Lucky Charmer|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Damian-McGinty-1038080.aspx|first=William|last=Keck|work=TV Guide|date=25 September 2011|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] His initial seven-episode stint was later extended.
