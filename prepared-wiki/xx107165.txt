Mirsad Bešlija (born 6 July 1979) is a Bosnian football player  who is currently playing for Bosnian side, FK Željezničar. He has also played for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.
Bešlija started his career with hometown side Slaven Živinice. Although he was among the youngest players in their squad, he became an important part of the first team. He was spotted there and signed by Bosna Visoko, a first division team at that time, in 1997. He spent two seasons in Visoko, during which he was selected for the national U21 team. His rapid footballing ascent attracted the interest of FK Željezničar and he signed for them in 2000, becoming a fans' favourite during his single season in the capital.
Bešlija joined Racing Genk in July 2001, where he stayed for five years, and made over 130 league appearances, and he won the Belgian League with them in 2003-04. He moved to Heart of Midlothian during January 2006 in a deal worth £850,000 (€1.22 million), a record fee paid by the Tynecastle side. A dispute developed about whether the overall transfer fee should include agents percentages or not, leading Hearts to suspend payment after the first installment.Genk threaten Hearts over Beslija, BBC Sport, 16 June 2006.
