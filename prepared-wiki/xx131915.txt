Philip "The Scholar" Cezar is a former Philippine Basketball Association basketball player. He was part of the fabled Crispa Redmanizers ballclub that won two Grand Slams, in 1976 and 1983.

==PBA career==

Coming from the JRU Heavy Bombers, some consider him the best “thinking” power forward in the history of the PBA, hence, he was dubbed as “The Scholar”. He is the premier example of a power forward with finesse unlike the power forwards of today like Eric Menk and Danny Ildefonso, and much earlier, Alvin Patrimonio and Nelson Asaytono, who rely primarily on sheer power and brute strength. Though barely 6'3" and less than 200 pounds, Cezar was usually given the unenviable task of guarding tall imports from opposing teams.  On defense, his unusually long arms served him in good stead, using them in his famous "umbrella-like" defense and two-handed shot-blocks.  And though he played the No. 4 position for most of his career, he was like a second point guard on the floor, often orchestrating big plays and dishing out timely passes.  Cezar could also run the floor and finish fastbreaks with his patented "stretch" lay-up.  He is best remembered as the very first one-on-one champion of the league when he defeated Ramon Fernandez in the finals of the 1979 Sprite One-on-One challenge where he won P25,000.00.  He is also a consummate professional player, as he, though originally from Crispa, served as a long-time assistant coach to Robert Jaworski of the rival Toyota during the champion teams of Ginebra in the late 80s and early 90s. He finished his career with a total of 12,077 points good for No. 6 among all-time PBA scorers.
In 2000, he was named as one of the PBA's 25 greatest players of all-time in elaborate awards ceremonies that highlighted the 25th year anniversary of the league.
In 2005, Cezar, described by the eminent sportswriter Ronnie Nathanielsz as like a gazelle who is graceful and fluid in motion,http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=sports04_may24_2005 was part of the twelve initial inductees to the PBA Hall of Fame alongside fellow Crispa players Atoy Co and Bogs Adornado, and Toyota stalwarts Jaworski, Francis Arnaiz and Fernandez together with former PBA Commissioners Leo Prieto, Emerson Coseteng and Atty. Rudy Salud as well as legendary Crispa coach and team manager, respectively, Virgilio "Baby" Dalupan and Danny Floro, and the late anchorman Joe Cantada.
He finished his illustrious PBA career as the No. 6 leading scorer with 12,077 points behind Fernandez, Abet Guidaben, Alvin Patrimonio, Atoy Co and Nelson Asaytono. He also is the fifth all-time best rebounder with 5,834 total rebounds behind Fernandez, Guidaben, Jerry Codiñera and Patrimonio and was No. 2 in shotblocks with 1,370. He also had 3,130 assists (3.4 assists per game), 599 steals, converted 2066/2767 free throws in 28127:05 minutes played in 918 games. Along with Fernandez, they are the only two players in PBA history who has accumulated at least 12,000 points, 5,000 rebounds and 1,000 shot blocks.

==MBA career==

After his retirement he went to coaching. In 2000, he coached the San Juan Knights to a championship in the now defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association beating the Negros Slashers in six games, 4-2.

==Political career==

He also served as a long-time Vice Mayor of the municipality of San Juan first under Mayor (now Senator) Jinggoy Estrada and later on Jinggoy's brother, Mayor J. V. Ejercito.
