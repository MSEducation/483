Banda, which forms one of the districts included under the general name of Bundelkhand, has formed an arena of contention for the successive races who have struggled for the sovereignty of India. Kalinjar town, then the capital, was unsuccessfully besieged by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1023 AD; in 1196 it was taken by Kutab-ad-din , the general of Muhammad Ghori; in 1545 by Sher Shah Suri, who, however, fell mortally wounded in the assault. About the year 1735 the raja of Kalinjar's territory, including the present district of Banda, was bequeathed to Baji Rao, the Mahratta peshwa; and from the Mahrattas it passed by the treaties of 1802–1803 to the British East India Company. At the time of the Indian Rebellion the district, which was poverty-stricken and over-taxed, joined the rebels. The town of Banda was recovered by General Whitlock on the 20 April 1858.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911[/tpl][tpl]Citation|first=Agha Humayun |last=Amin |date=February 2000 |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/feb/central-indian.htm |title=Opinion: Chapter Seven: The Central India Campaign |journal=Pakistan Defence Journal[/tpl]
