The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is a charity operating in England and Wales that promotes animal welfare. In 2012, the RSPCA investigated 150,833 cruelty complaints.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/webContent/staticImages/Flipbooks/Annual_Review_2012/index.html |title=RSPCA Annual review |accessdate=2013-09-26[/tpl] It is the oldest and largest animal welfare organisation in the world[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dogpages.org.uk/links.htm |title=Dog Rescue Pages - UK dog rescue centres and welfare organizations |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl] and is one of the largest charities in the UK, with 1,453 employees (as of 2009).Charity Insight page on the RSPCA, accessed 22 November 2010
The charity's work has inspired the creation of similar groups in other jurisdictions, starting with the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (founded in 1836), and including the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1839), the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1840), the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1866), the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1882), and various groups which eventually came together as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (1981).
The RSPCA is funded primarily by voluntary donations. In 2012, RSPCA total income was £132,803,000, total expenditure was £121,464,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232733053217&mode=prd |title=Trustees' report and accounts 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl] Its patron is Queen Elizabeth II.

==History==

The organisation was founded in 1824 (without the "royal" prefix) as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; it was established by a group of 22 reformers led by Richard Martin MP, William Wilberforce MP, and the Reverend Arthur Broome in "Old Slaughter's Coffee House", St Martin's Lane, near the Strand. The foundation is marked by a plaque on the modern day building at 77-78 St Martin's Lane.City of Westminster green plaques
The society was the first animal welfare charity to be founded in the world.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] In 1824 it brought sixty three offenders before the courts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animallaw.info/historical/articles/arukrspcahist.htm |title=The History of the RSPCA |accessdate=2008-03-24[/tpl] It was granted its royal status by Queen Victoria in 1840 to become the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as it is today.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/in-action/aboutus/whoweare/heritage |title=Our heritage [/tpl] In the late 1830s the society began the tradition of the RSPCA inspector, which is the image best known of the organisation today.
The RSPCA lobbied Parliament throughout the nineteenth century, resulting in a number of new laws. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 amended Martin's Act and outlawed baiting. In 1876 the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed to control animal experimentation. In 1911 Parliament passed Sir George Greenwood's Animal Protection Act.
Since that time the RSPCA has continued to play an active role, both in the creation of animal welfare legislation and in its enforcement. An important recent new law has been the Animal Welfare Act 2006.DEFRA page on Animal Welfare Act 2006, accessed 22 November 2010[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/in-action/changingthelaw/whatwechanged/animalwelfareact |title=Animal Welfare Act [/tpl]

==Animal welfare establishments==

RSPCA centres, hospitals and branches operate throughout England and Wales. In 2012 RSPCA centres and branches assisted and rehomed 55,459 animals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/webContent/staticImages/Flipbooks/Annual_Review_2012/index.html |title=RSPCA 2012 Annual Review[/tpl]

===Hospitals===

In 2013 the society owned four animal hospitals, Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Putney (south London) and the Harmsworth Memorial Hospital in Holloway (north London),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/inyourarea/detail/-/iya/London%20North%20%28Harmsworth%20Memorial%29%20Animal%20Hospital/About%20Us/408/ |title=London North (Harmsworth Memorial) Animal Hospital[/tpl] and a number of clinics which provide treatments to those who could not otherwise afford it, neuter animals and accept animals from the RSPCA inspectorate.

===Centres===

RSPCA animal centres deal with a wide range of injured and rescued animals, working alongside its inspectorate, volunteers, and others to ensure that each animal is found a new home.
In 2013 the Society had four wildlife centres at East Winch (Norfolk), West Hatch (Somerset), Stapeley Grange (Cheshire) and Mallydams Wood (East Sussex), which provide treatment to sick, injured and orphaned wild animals to maximise their chances of a successful return to the wild.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/allaboutanimals/wildlife/rehabilitation/centres |title=Wildlife centres [/tpl]

==Organisation and structure==

===National organisation===

At the national level, there is a 'National Control Centre', which receives all calls from members of the public, and tasks local Inspectors, AWOs or ACOs to respond to urgent calls.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/contactus |title=Contact the RSPCA [/tpl]
Additionally the £16 million[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1402352/RSPCA-millions-go-on-politics-and-HQ.html|title=RSPCA millions go on politics and HQ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Thomas |last=Penny |date=24 July 2002[/tpl] 'National Headquarters' located at Southwater in West Sussex houses several general 'Departments', each with a departmental head, consistent with the needs of any major organisation. The current Chief Executive Officer is Gavin Grant and he manages five Directors who all have responsibility for a number of relevant departments.

===Regions===

There are five 'Regions' (North, East, Wales & West, South & South West, South East), each headed by a Regional Manager (responsible for all staff and RSPCA HQ facilities) assisted by a Regional Superintendent who has responsibility for the Chief Inspectors, Inspectors, AWOs and ACOs. The Regional Managers are expected to have a broad understanding of operations throughout their regions.9

===Groups===

Each Region of the RSPCA contains 'Groups' of Inspectorate staff. A Group is headed by a Chief Inspector. Each Chief Inspector might typically be responsible for around 8 or more Inspectors, 3 Animals Welfare Officers (AWOs) and 2 Animal Collection Officers (ACOs), working with several local Branches. There are also a small number of Market Inspectors across the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/in-action/aboutus/careers/becomeanofficer |title=Become an RSPCA officer [/tpl]

===Branches===

RSPCA branches operate locally across England and Wales. Some are separately registered charities operating at a local level and are run by volunteers. Some RSPCA branches are self-funding and raise money locally to support the animal welfare work they do. They find homes for about three-quarters of all animals taken in by the RSPCA. RSPCA branches also offer advice, microchipping, neutering and subsidised animal treatments. In 2013 there were also about 215 RSPCA shops.

==Mission statement and charitable status==

The RSPCA is a registered charity (no. 219099) that relies on donations from the public. The RSPCA states that its mission as a charity is, by all lawful means, to prevent cruelty, promote kindness to and alleviate suffering of animals.
RSPCA inspectors respond to calls from the public to investigate alleged mistreatment of animals. They offer advice and assistance to improve animal welfare, and in some cases prosecute under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
Animals rescued by the RSPCA are treated, rehabilitated and rehomed or released wherever possible.Vídeo de cão sendo espancado gera prisão de agressor, Yahoo!, RSPCA
The RSPCA brings private prosecution (a right available to any civilian) against those it believes, based on independent veterinary opinion, have caused neglect to an animal under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The Society has its own legal department and veterinary surgeons amongst the resources which facilitate such private prosecutions. All prosecutions are brought via independent solicitors acting for the RSPCA, as the Association has no legal enforcement powers or authority in its own right.

==Legal standing and inspectors' powers==

In 1829 when the first recognisable police force was established in the UK,See Metropolitan Police Act 1829 See Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom they adopted a similar uniform to that of RSPCA inspectors who had been wearing uniforms since the charities beginning in 1824. This has led to similarities in the RSPCA rank names and rank insignia with British police ranks, which has led some critics (such as Chris Newman, chairman of the Federation of Companion Animal Societies)[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Migration/article65425.ece | work=The Sunday Times | location=London | title=Invasion of privacy | date=2007-06-03 | accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl] [tpl]registration[/tpl] to suggest an attempt to "adopt" police powers in the public imagination.
An RSPCA inspector may also issue a "caution" to a member of the public, similar to that used by the police, i.e. "You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence"; this may strengthen the perception that the RSPCA has statutory powers. 
When Richard Girling of The Times asked about their lack of powers, a spokesman for the RSPCA said "We would prefer you didn’t publish that, but of course it's up to you". Chris Newman claimed that the RSPCA "impersonate police officers and commit trespass. People do believe they have powers of entry"; however, he did not produce any evidence of such impersonation of police officers, and the Society strongly deny the charge of impersonation.
Sally Case, former head of prosecutions, insisted that RSPCA inspectors are trained specifically to make clear to pet-owners that they have no such right. They act without an owner’s permission, she says, "only if an animal is suffering in a dire emergency. If the court feels evidence has been wrongly obtained, it can refuse to admit it".
One recent trial was halted and charges relating to nine dogs were thrown out of court after District Judge Elsey ruled that they had been wrongly seized and that the police and RSPCA acted unlawfully when they entered private property and seized the animals.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/stanley-woman-found-guilty-mistreating-1364926 | work=Chronicle Live (UK) | location=South Tyneside | title=Stanley woman found guilty of mistreating dog | date=2012-05-21 | accessdate=2013-10-09 |author=Sharma, Sonia[/tpl]
While the Protection of Animals Act 1911 provided a power of arrest for police, the British courts determined that Parliament did not intend any other organisation, such as the RSPCA, to be empowered under the Act and that the RSPCA therefore does not possess police-like powers of arrest, of entry or of search (Line v RSPCA, 1902). Like any other person or organisation that the law deems to have a duty to investigate – such as HM Revenue and Customs and Local Authority Trading Standards – the RSPCA is expected to conform to the rules in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 so far as they relate to matters of investigation. RSPCA officers are trained to state, following giving the caution, that the person is "not under arrest and can leave at any time".
The Animal Welfare Act 2006Animal Welfare Act 2006. 8 November 2006 has now replaced the Protection of Animals Act 1911, and it empowers the police and an inspector appointed by a local authority. In cases where, for example, access to premises without the owner’s consent is sought, a local authority or Animal Health inspector or police officer may be accompanied by an RSPCA inspector if he or she is invited to do so, as was the case in previous law.Information for Local Authorities. 15 August 2008
Following a series of Freedom of Information requests in 2011, to police constabularies throughout England and WalesRichard Martin - Freedom of Information requests - WhatDoTheyKnow it was revealed that the RSPCA has developed local information sharing protocols with a number of constabularies, allowing designated RSPCA workers access to confidential information held on the Police National Computer (PNC).  Although RSPCA workers do not have direct access to the PNC, information is shared with them by the various police constabularies which would reveal any convictions, cautions, warnings, reprimands and impending prosecutions.  Information regarding motor vehicles can also be accessed. The Association of Chief Police Officers released a statement clarifying that the RSPCA had no direct access to the PNC, and that in common with other prosecuting bodies, it may make a request for disclosure of records. This indirect access does not include any information that the RSPCA does not need in order to prosecute a case at court.ACPO Media Centre - RSPCA access to PNC records

==Controversy and criticism==

===Fund-raising in Scotland===

The RSPCA has been criticised by the Scottish SPCA for fund-raising in Scotland and thereby "stealing food from the mouths of animals north of the border by taking donations intended for Scotland."Animal groups in bitter cash row BBC News, 3 January 2009 The RSPCA insists that it does not deliberately advertise in Scotland but that many satellite channels only enabled the organisation to purchase UK-wide advertising. In a statement, the RSPCA said it went "to great lengths" to ensure wherever possible that adverts were not distributed outside England and Wales, and "Every piece of printed literature, television advertising and internet banner advertising always features the wording 'The RSPCA is a charity registered in England and Wales[tpl]'"[/tpl]. "All Scottish donors, who contact us via RSPCA fundraising campaigns, are directed to the Scottish SPCA so that they can donate to them if they so wish."  The Scottish SPCA changed its logo in 2005 to make a clearer distinction between itself and the RSPCA in an attempt to prevent legacies being left to its English equivalent by mistake when the Scottish charity was intended.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4736459.stm |title=New identity for animal charity |newspaper= BBC News |date= 1 August 2005[/tpl]

===Live animal export===

In September 2012 the RSPCA euthanized 40 sheep, based on the decision of the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency,0113_5 - rspca.org.uk and were accused of using the photographs to further their campaign against animal exports.[tpl]cite news|author=Farming |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/farming/9797383/RSPCA-accused-of-needlessly-slaughtering-sheep.html |title=RSPCA accused of needlessly slaughtering sheep |publisher=Telegraph |date= 12 January 2013|accessdate=2013-04-11 |location=London[/tpl]
The RSPCA stated that they were present at the request of the Port Authority, Thanet District Council, to ensure that animal welfare laws were fully implemented in the operation headed up by DEFRA. The animals were all checked by several independent vets including two Defra vets, and the decisions on the day to humanely euthanize the sheep was taken by Animal Health, and not by RSPCA inspectors.RSPCA defends role in Ramsgate sheep incident | News | Farmers Guardian
However, the National Farmers' Union said that it "still leaves many questions to be answered, by both AHVLA and the RSPCA", and that "The NFU also still has questions about why the method of slaughter used resulted in so much blood in the photographs".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.farminguk.com/news/RSPCA-has-questions-to-answer-over-Ramsgate-says-NFU_25114.html |title=RSPCA has questions to answer over Ramsgate, says NFU - Farming UK news |publisher=Farminguk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl] The RSPCA responded to this by stating that the amount of blood shown in the photographs was caused by ‘moving the dead bodies to an area where they were piled up pending collection for disposal’.

===Badger culling and politicisation===

The RSPCA's opposition of a badger cull has been commented upon; in 2006 there was controversy about a "political" campaign against culling, with the Charity Commission being asked to consider claims that the charity had breached guidelines by being too overtly 'political'. The charity responded saying that it took "careful account of charity law and the guidance issued by the Charity Commission".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1512742/RSPCA-investigated-over-political-badgers-campaign.html |title=Back off Badgers campaign |date=12 Mar 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Jasper |last=Copping[/tpl]

===Slaughter of sacred cow===

On 13 December 2007 the RSPCA unlawfully trespassed onto Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple and unlawfully slaughtered the sacred cow Gangotri. The cow was under veterinary care and was recovering from an illness.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hindu-monks-sue-rspca-over-slaughter-of-sacred-cow-gangotri-802332.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Emily | last=Dugan | title=Hindu monks sue RSPCA over slaughter of sacred cow Gangotri | date=29 March 2008[/tpl] 200 people protested at the RSPCA headquarters about the killing, and the RSPCA was sued by the Hindu monks of Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple. On 13 December 2008, the RSPCA admitted culpability, apologized for the killing of Gangotri, and donated a pregnant cow to the sanctuary representing a symbol of reconciliation.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7780665.stm | work=BBC News | first=Robert | last=Pigott | title=RSPCA sorry for killing sacred cow | date=12 December 2008[/tpl]

===Heythrop Hunt===

In 2012, the RSPCA spent £326,000 on a successful magistrates’ court prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt. The charity reported: "We believe that this was the first ever prosecution of a traditional hunt as a corporate body. The Heythrop Hunt pleaded guilty to four offences of intentionally hunting a fox with dogs on four separate occasions." The huntsman and hunt master involved also pleaded guilty to the same offences.Wildlife crime - traditional hunt prosecuted for hunting - Details - Prosecutions annual report - Prosecution The relatively large amount spent in securing a prosecution (£6,800 in fines were imposed) led to criticism by the trial judge, who was later investigated for his comments,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10106692/Cameron-fox-hunt-judge-criticised-for-questioning-RSPCA.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=John | last=Bingham | title=Cameron fox hunt judge criticised for questioning RSPCA | date=7 June 2013[/tpl] the media and some MPs, who accused the charity of breaching its "duty of prudence".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9761645/RSPCA-trustees-broke-charity-rules-over-David-Cameron-hunt-prosecution.html | title=RSPCA trustees 'broke charity rules' over David Cameron hunt prosecution | work=Daily Telegraph | date=21 December 2012 | accessdate=28 December 2013 | author=Hope, Christopher | location=London[/tpl] The RSPCA said in response that "the overwhelming support from our supporters and the public confirms that the vast majority of people are right behind us. They want us to speak out and stand up for all animals – farm animals, pets, animals used in research and wildlife – by bringing those who abuse them to justice."RSPCA Annual Review 2012

===Allegations of discrediting of witnesses===

On 7 August 2013 the BBC Radio 4 Face the Facts Radio program broadcast an episode called "The RSPCA - A law unto itself?"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037v4fp |title=BBC Radio 4 Face the Facts The RSPCA - A law unto itself? |date=7 Aug 2013 |accessdate=7 Aug 2013[/tpl]
The program presented a number of cases of where the RSPCA has sought to hound vets and expert witnesses who had appeared in court for the defence in RSPCA prosecutions. In one case it sought to discredit the author of the RSPCA Complete Horse Care Manual (Vogel) after he appeared as an expert witness for the defence team in an RSPCA prosecution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/wildlife/article3835995.ece |title=RSPCA tried to discredit expert who gave evidence against charity |date=7 Aug 2013 |accessdate=7 Aug 2013[/tpl] The RSPCA later released a statement saying that this is untrue and that they do not persecute vets and lawyers who appear for the defence and as defence experts. There have been thousands of lawyers taking defence cases against the RSPCA and they have only ever made a complaint about one.0713_7 - rspca.org.uk

===Chief executive's salary===

Gavin Grant started as RSPCA chief executive in January 2012. Prior to this Grant worked at the RSPCA as the Director of Campaigns and Communication between 1988-1991, before moving on to The Body Shop as their corporate communications manager for eight years.Our people - About us - RSPCA in action His most recent role before moving back to the RSPCA was as the UK Chairman of PR company Burson-Marsteller where he spent 10 years.Gavin Grant, UK Chairman of Burson-Marsteller, has been appointed Chief Executive of the RSPCA – Burson-Marsteller – United Kingdom
In 2013 it was speculated that Gavin Grant is paid between £150,000 and £160,000 a year. The RSPCA responded, saying that the "chief executive’s salary is subject to regular independent review and is within the parameters of the going rate for major UK charities, both animal welfare and other."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2364755/RSPCA-fatcat-rakes-45-previous-boss-reveal-figures-spending-LESS-animal-welfare.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=RSPCA fatcat 'rakes in 45% more' than the previous boss - but the charity is spending LESS on animal welfare[/tpl]

===Deputy chairman raises concerns over 'political' allegations===

In September 2013 the RSPCA deputy chairman Paul Draycott said that 'too political' campaigns threatened the charity's future and could deter donors.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/10309118/RSPCA-deputy-leader-warns-too-political-campaigns-threaten-charitys-future.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=RSPCA deputy leader warns 'too political' campaigns threaten charity's future | date=14 September 2013[/tpl] Draycott said that the RSPCA could go insolvent "We have spent months discussing where we want to be in 10 years time, but unless we develop a strategy for now we won't be here then". In response the chairman Mike Tomlinson said "The trustee body continues to place its full support behind the RSPCA's chief executive, management and all our people who do such outstanding work". The accusations of politicization remain unsubstantiated.
Paul Draycott also warned that the RSPCA fears an exodus of "disillusioned staff" with "poor or even non-existent management training and career paths" for employees. In response the RSPCA’s chief executive, Gavin Grant denied suggestions in the memo that there was "no strategy" in some areas, stating that there was no difficulty in attracting trustees or serious internal concerns about management.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10311154/RSPCA-fears-exodus-of-disillusioned-staff-says-deputy-chairman.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=John | last=Bingham | title=RSPCA fears exodus of 'disillusioned staff', says deputy chairman | date=16 September 2013[/tpl]

===Whistleblower suicide and Charity Commission investigation===

In May 2013 former RSPCA employee Dawn Aubrey-Ward was found hanged at her home when suffering from depression after leaving the animal charity.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10055532/RSPCA-whistleblower-found-hanged.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Hayley | last=Dixon | title=RSPCA whistleblower found hanged | date=14 May 2013[/tpl] The RSPCA subsequently had a meeting with the Charity Commission over its approach to prosecutions, that led to the Charity Commission raising no concerns about the decisions made by the RSPCA.RSPCA Heythrop Hunt

===Advertising standards violation===

An advertisement published by the RSPCA in the Metro newspaper said: "The UK Government wants to shoot England's badgers. We want to vaccinate them – and save their lives."
But more than 100 people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), saying the use of the term "exterminate" was misleading. The advertising standards watchdog judged that the advert was likely to mislead the general public who had not taken an active interest in the badger cull saying, "The ad must not appear again in its current form.We told the RSPCA not to use language that implied the whole badger population in the cull areas would be culled in future advertising."RSPCA badger cull 'extermination' advert deemed misleading by ASA | Gloucester Citizen An RSPCA spokesman said it "welcomed" the judgement of the ASA to dismiss three of the areas of complaint about their advert but "respectfully disagreed" with the complaint which had been upheld.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25324517 | work=BBC News | title=RSPCA anti badger cull advert banned | date=11 December 2013[/tpl]

===Small animal shelters===

In November 2013 the RSPCA was accused of instigating police raids on small animal shelters with insufficient evidence that animals were being mistreated. The owners claimed that they were being persecuted because of their “no kill” policy of only putting animals down if they cannot be effectively treated.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/10422641/RSPCA-accused-of-persecuting-owners-of-animal-shelters.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=RSPCA accused of persecuting owners of animal shelters | date=3 November 2013[/tpl] The RSPCA stated that their inspectors will offer advice and guidance to help people improve conditions for their animals, and it only seeks the help of the police where it considers there is no reasonable alternative to safeguard animal welfare.0813_6 - rspca.org.uk The RSPCA also stated that a number of their own branches operate "no kill" policies themselves.

===Archbishop of Canterbury's refusal to accept role of vice-patron===

In August 2013 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, declined an invitation to become vice-patron the RSPCA. While Lambeth Palace stated that "the Archbishop has enormous admiration for the RSPCA and hopes to see its work thrive long into the future", the Archbishop's refusal was seen by some as a snub to the organisation, as the four previous archbishops had assumed the role.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10249027/Archbishop-Justin-Welby-snubs-RSPCA-after-refusing-lead-role.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Alice | last=Philipson | title=Archbishop Justin Welby snubs RSPCA after refusing lead role | date=17 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396078/Archbishop-Canterbury-refuses-patron-RSPCA-charity-faces-accusation-lost-way.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Archbishop of Canterbury refuses to become patron of RSPCA after charity faces accusation it has lost its way – Mail Online[/tpl]

===Countryside Alliance criticism===

In December 2013 the Countryside Alliance stated that the RSPCA had moved away from its role of promoting animal welfare and was now interested only in animal rights. General Sir Barney White-Spunner said that the RSPCA has turned into a "sinister and nasty" organisation and urged members of the Countryside Alliance to stop donating to the RSPCA the "once great institution".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/countryside/10540076/RSPCA-has-become-sinister-and-nasty-warns-head-of-the-Countryside-Alliance.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Matthew | last=Holehouse | title=RSPCA has become 'sinister and nasty', warns head of the Countryside Alliance | date=27 December 2013[/tpl] General Sir Barney White-Spunner also said that RSPCA inspectors have been given intrusive powers with no proper basis in law. In response, the RSPCA accused the Countryside Alliance of being out of touch with public opinion and denied that it had departed from its original remit.1213_1 - rspca.org.uk
