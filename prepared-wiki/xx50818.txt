</ref> It is especially used to frame the figure of [[Christ in Majesty]] in early medieval and [[Romanesque art]], as well as [[Byzantine art]] of the same periods.  The term refers to the [[almond]] like shape:  "mandorla" means [[:it:mandorla|almond nut in Italian]]. In [[icon]]s of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church's use of [[Apophatic theology]], as described by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius the Areopagite]] and others.  As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness, except by darkness.
In a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at Sant Climent de Taüll the inscription "Ego Sum Lux Mundi" Am the Light of the World" is incorporated in the Mandorla design.http://www.xtec.es/~jarrimad/medieval/romanico/taull.htm
The tympanum at Conques has Christ, with a gesture carved in romanesque sculpture, indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the Moon. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the Sun. http://www.handinaute.org/roman.img/Conques02.jpg
In one special case, at Cervon (Nièvre), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers. http://homepage.uvt.nl/~s239062/EDIFICES/cervon/CERVONtim.JPG At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers -the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. Here one is tempted to seek for reference in the symbolism of the nine branched Chanukkiyah candelabrum. In the 12th century a great school of Judaic thought radiated from Narbonne, coinciding with the origins of the Kabbalah.[tpl]cite book |last=Scholem |first=Gershom |authorlink=Gershom Scholem |title=Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher=Princeton Paperback |year=1990 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&printsec=frontcover&q |isbn=0-691-07314-7[/tpl] Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of Book of Revelation (22:16) http://www.romanes.com/Cervon/Saint_Barthelemy_de_Cervon_0011.html (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete Hebrew Bible, the Leningrad Codex, one finds the Star of David imbedded in an octagon.)
In the symbolism of Hildegarde von Bingen the mandorla refers to the Cosmos.[ref]
