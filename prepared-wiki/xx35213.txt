==History==

The history of Roosendaal goes back to the 12th and 13th century.  The name Rosendaele was first mentioned in a document of 1268.  Roosendaal was always a part of North Brabant.  In the Middle Ages, Roosendaal grew as a result of the turf business, but the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) put an end to the growth.  Roosendaal and Wouw were suffering from the itinerant combat troops.  The troops plundered and ravaged everything they came across.  For decades the countryside of Roosendaal was abandoned.
Under King Louis Napoléon of Holland, Roosendaal received city rights in 1809.

==Transport==

The city is an important railway hub: the Zwolle-Roosendaal Intercity service starts and ends here, the international train from The Hague to Brussels calls at Roosendaal, as does the Amsterdam-Vlissingen (Flushing) intercity.  There is also a stopping service to Antwerp.
