==History==

Preston's first involvement in local government was part of the Epping Road District in 1854, which also included Northcote. In 1870, the Epping District was amalgamated with the Merriang, Whittlesea, Morang and Woodstock Road Districts, to form a very large Darebin Shire. These entities mostly ended up in the Cities of Broadmeadows and Whittlesea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/preston.html |title=Australian Places - Preston|author=Monash University|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050620095534/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/preston.html |archivedate = 2005-06-20[/tpl]
