==History==

An original construction permit to build a low power television station was granted on August 23, 1989. The station, to be constructed on channel 21, was given the callsign K21CX. After a major modification and an expired construction permit, the station was licensed on October 29, 1991. K21CX-D has been sold several times since licensing and has had other affiliations, the most recent being America's Store, but was acquired by Ventana Television in June 2001 and became an HSN affiliate in 2006. On August 8, 2011, the station changed its call sign to K21CX-D.
