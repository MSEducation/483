It should not be confused with enriched text (mimetype "text/enriched" of RFC 1896) or its predecessor Rich Text (mimetype "text/richtext" of RFC 1341 and 1521); nor with IBM's RFT-DCA (Revisable Format Text-Document Content Architecture) which are completely different  specifications.

==History==

Richard Brodie, Charles Simonyi, and David Luebbert, members of the Microsoft Word development team, developed the original RTF in the middle to late 1980s. Its syntax was influenced by the TeX typesetting language.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] The first RTF reader and writer shipped in 1987 as part of Microsoft Word 3.0 for Macintosh, which implemented the RTF version 1.0 specification. All subsequent releases of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh and all versions for Windows can read and write files in RTF format.
Microsoft holds the rights to the RTF format [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and maintains the format. [tpl]As of|2008|March[/tpl], the current version is 1.9.1. According to Microsoft's Office 2010 resource kit documentation, Microsoft is discontinuing enhancements to the RTF specification. Further, some new features in Word 2010 and later versions will not save properly to the RTF format.Changes in Word 2010

===Version timeline===

===Version changes===

Microsoft Corporation anticipates no further updates to the RTF Specification 1.9.1, but is willing to consider editorial and other non-substantive modifications of the RTF Specification during an associated ISO/IEC 29500 balloting period; but it would not make changes which altered normative functions in this RTF Specification.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/wg4/archive/sc34-wg4-2011-0184.zip |title=GS26 RS Referencing Explanatory Report (RER) for DR 10-0017, General: missing normative reference, for RTF |author=Microsoft |format=PDF |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-04-02[/tpl]
Rich Text Format (RTF) specifications are changed and published with major Microsoft Word and Office versions.

==Code example==

As an example, the following RTF code:
 {\rtf1\ansi{\fonttbl\f0\fswiss Helvetica;}\f0\pard
 This is some {\b bold} text.\par
 }
is a document which would be rendered like this when read by a program that supports RTF:
 
 This is some bold text.

==Character encoding==

A standard RTF file can consist of only 7-bit ASCII characters, but can encode characters beyond ASCII by escape sequences.[tpl]citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140284(office.10).aspx |title=Microsoft RTF Syntax[/tpl] The character escapes are of two types: code page escapes and, starting with RTF 1.5, Unicode escapes. In a code page escape, two hexadecimal digits following a backslash and typewriter apostrophe are used for denoting a character taken from a Windows code page. For example, if the code page is set to Windows-1256, the sequence \'c8 will encode the Arabic letter bāʼ (ب).
For a Unicode escape the control word \u is used, followed by a 16-bit signed decimal integer giving the Unicode UTF-16 code unit number. For the benefit of programs without Unicode support, this must be followed by the nearest representation of this character in the specified code page. For example, \u1576? would give the Arabic letter bāʼ ب, specifying that older programs which do not have Unicode support should render it as a question mark instead.
The control word \uc0 can be used to indicate that subsequent Unicode escape sequences within the current group do not specify the substitution character.
Until RTF specification version 1.5 release in 1997, RTF has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal (using \'xx). RTF control words (since RTF 1.5) generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers. If a Unicode character is outside BMP, it is encoded with a surrogate pair. Support for Unicode was made due to text handling changes in Microsoft Word – Microsoft Word 97 is a partially Unicode-enabled application and it handles text using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme. Microsoft Word 2000 and later versions are Unicode-enabled applications that handle text using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme.
RTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text. RTF consists of control words, control symbols, and groups. RTF files can be easily transmitted between PC based operating systems because they are encoded as a text file with 7-bit graphic ASCII characters. Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for MS Windows or Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters and binary data can contain any 8-bit values.

==Human readability==

Unlike many word processing formats, concise RTF code can be made human-readable. When an RTF file is viewed as a plain text file, characters within ASCII are legible and the markup language (formatting) elements not too distracting or counter-intuitive. However, the RTF files produced by most programs, such as Microsoft Word (MS Word), will contain such a large number of control codes that most files will easily be an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding plain text and very difficult to read.[tpl]cite web |url=http://interglacial.com/rtf/ |title=Rich Text Format - MSWord generates some scary RTF |date=2008-07-12 |author=Sean M. Burke |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] Formats such as MS Word's .doc are, in contrast, binary formats with only a few scraps of legible text.
Also, for a standard-compliant RTF file, the human-readability of a script which is not Latin-based is not an option for the reason explained above. Where non-ASCII characters, including Latin letters with diacritics, dashes and some quotation mark glyphs, are used in an RTF document, they are difficult to read, as they appear only as escape codes, such as \'f1 for ñ or \u21563 for 吻.
RTF is a data format for expressing text documents. It is not really a markup language, as it was never meant for intuitive and easy typing.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/15490806/RTF-Pocket-Guide-by-OReilly-Media |title=RTF Pocket Guide by O'Reilly Media  |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] RTF also supports Microsoft OLE embedded objects and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects (since RTF 1.0) which are not human-readable.
Human-readable XML-based formats are becoming more common, but during RTF's initial release, its level of readability was rare among document formats.

==Common uses and interoperability==

Most word processing software supports RTF format importing and exporting (following some version of RTF specification), and/or direct editing, often making it a "common" format between otherwise incompatible word processing software and operating systems.  These factors contribute to its interoperability, but it will depend on what version of RTF is being used. There are several consciously designed or accidentally born RTF dialects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/editors/ted/TedDocument-en_US.html |title=Ted, an easy rich text processor |author=Mark de Does |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] Most applications which read RTF files silently ignore unknown RTF control words.
RTF is the internal markup language used by Microsoft Word.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/product-description/0596004753/ref=dp_proddesc_0/277-8520360-9056562?ie=UTF8&n=266239&s=books |title=RTF Pocket Guide |author=Sean M. Burke |date=July 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] Overall, since 1987, RTF files may be transferred back and forth between many old and new computer systems (and now over the Internet) despite differences between operating systems and their versions.  (But there are some compatibility problems, e.g. between RTF 1.0 1987 and later specifications, or between RTF 1.0-1.4 and RTF 1.5+ in use of Unicode characters.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wordtowpdos.html |title=How to Import Microsoft Word Files into WordPerfect for DOS |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abiword.org/help/en-US/info/infoformats.html |title=Abiword Help - File Formats |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?techtalk/v30/30ts79.htm~mainFrame |title=Opening Rich Text Format (RTF) files  |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl]  This makes it a useful format for basic formatted text documents such as instruction manuals, résumés, letters, and modest information documents.  These documents at minimum support bold, italic, and underline text formatting.  Also typically supported are left-, center-, and right-aligned text.  Also, font specification and document margins are supported in RTF documents.
Font and margin defaults, as well as style presets and other functions will vary according to program defaults.  There may also be subtle differences perhaps between different versions of the RTF specification implemented in differing programs and program versions.  Nevertheless, the RTF format is consistent enough from computer to computer to be considered highly portable and acceptable for cross-platform use. The format supports metadata such as title, author, etc. but not all implementations support this.

===Objects===

Use of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects or Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects limits the interoperability, because these objects are not widely supported in programs for viewing or editing RTF files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the RTF, such as tables or charts from spreadsheet application).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/47307 |title=FOSS word processors compared: OOo Writer, AbiWord, and KWord |author=Bruce Byfield |date=2005-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |title=Sharing files between OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/153229 |title=SoftMaker Office 2008 focuses on compatibility with Microsoft Office |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58330 |title=SoftMaker Office 2006 beta: Not a killer app |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]citation |url=http://pacsec.jp/psj06/psj06lagadec-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=OpenOffice / OpenDocument and Microsoft Office 2007 / Open XML security |author=Philippe Lagadec |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl] If a software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |title=OLE object - bitmap representation? |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/COleRichEditCtrl.aspx |title=A Rich Edit Control That Displays Bitmaps and Other OLE Objects |accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl]

===Pictures===

RTF supports inclusion of JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), Windows Metafile (WMF), Apple PICT, Windows Device-dependent bitmap, Windows Device Independent bitmap and OS/2 Metafile picture types in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format in a RTF file. Not all of these picture types are supported in all RTF readers. When a RTF document is opened in software that does not support the picture type of an inserted picture, such picture is not displayed at all.
RTF writers usually convert inserted pictures from an unsupported picture types (e.g. BMP, TIFF, GIF, etc.) to one of supported picture types (PNG, WMF) or they do not include pictures at all.
For better compatibility with Microsoft products, some RTF writers include the same picture in two different picture types in one RTF file:[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663/en-us |title=Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl]
This method increases the RTF file size rapidly. The RTF specification does not require this method and there are various implementations that include pictures without the WMF copy (e.g. Abiword or Ted).
For Microsoft Word it is also possible to set a specific registry value ("ExportPictureWithMetafile=0") in order to prevent Word from saving the WMF copy (see link "Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word" at the beginning).

===Fonts===

RTF supports embedding of fonts used in the document, but this feature is not widely supported in software implementations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/275953 |title=Embedded fonts are not displayed as expected in the documents that are saved as RTF in Word |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-03-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=https://list.unm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0504d&L=rtf-l&T=0&F=&S=&P=60 |title=Embedding fonts in RTF file |date=2005-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20370 |title=OpenOffice.org Issue - MS Interoperability: embedd fonts into the document |accessdate=2010-03-17[/tpl]
RTF also supports generic font family names used for font substitution: roman (serif), swiss (sans-serif), modern (monospace), script, decorative, technical. This feature is not widely supported for font substitution, e.g. in OpenOffice.org or Abiword.

===Annotations===

RTF specification supports annotations (comments in documents) since version 1.0. RTF 1.7 specification defined some new features for annotations: date stamp (there was previously only "time stamp") and parents of annotations.
However, many implementations do not support RTF annotations, e.g. OpenOffice.org (up to version 3.3),[tpl]cite web |url=http://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51469 |title= RTF: Comments not preserved when saved in RTF format |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3594 |title=Saving notes in .rtf |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=22445 |title=Show Notes from MS Word comments in .rtf |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl] LibreOffice (up to version 3.3.2 no import support; only export[tpl]cite web |url=https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36877 |title=Comments are not displayed upon saving and reopening RTF, are lost on re-saving |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl]), Abiword (up to versions 2.6.x; support added in 2.8),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-user/2008/Oct/0008.html |title=Comments in rtf files? |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/release-notes/2.8.1.phtml |title=AbiWord v2.8.0 Released! |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/release-notes/2.7.0.phtml |title=AbiWord v2.7.0 Released! |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl] KWord (up to versions 2.x), Ted or Microsoft Wordpad. When a RTF document with annotations is opened in an application that does not support RTF annotations, they are not displayed at all. Similarly, when a document with annotations is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF annotations, annotations are not preserved in the RTF file. (For example, OpenOffice.org 1.x[tpl]cite web |url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/office-and-productivity-applications/0131407457/creating-and-controlling-different-document-versions/375 |title=OpenOffice.org 1.0 Resource Kit |accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl]-3.3 or KWord support annotations in some file formats (e.g. in ODF, SXW), but do not support RTF annotations.) Some implementations may hide annotations by default or require some user action to display them - e.g. in Abiword since version 2.8 or in IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3).
Microsoft products do not support comments within footers, footnotes or headers. Inserting a comment within headers, footers, or footnotes may result in a corrupted RTF document.
RTF specification also supports footnotes (not to be confused with annotations), which are widely supported in RTF implementations (e.g. in OpenOffice.org, Abiword, KWord, Ted, but not in Wordpad).

===Drawing objects===

RTF 1.2 specification defined use of drawing objects such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, polygons and various other shapes. RTF 1.5 specification introduced many new control words for drawing objects. RTF drawing objects are also called "shapes" since RTF 1.5.
However, RTF drawing objects are not supported in many RTF implementations, such as OpenOffice.org,[tpl]cite web |url=http://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3790 |title=OpenOffice.org Bugzilla – Bug 3790 - RTF: Import Word 97-2000 RTF for Drawing Objects (Shapes) |accessdate=2011-05-19[/tpl] LibreOffice (versions lower than 4.0), KWord, Abiword[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-user/2006/Mar/0048.html |title=Re: Drawing inside Abiword |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2011-05-21[/tpl] or IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3 only some limited support;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/software/lotus/symphony/help.nsf/ReleaseNotes?OpenForm&version=3%20Beta%202 |title=IBM Lotus Symphony Release Notes - Lotus Symphony 3 Beta2 |accessdate=2011-05-21[/tpl] improved in later versions). When an RTF document with drawing objects is opened in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, they are not displayed at all. Some implementations will also not display any text inside drawing objects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=67774 |title=OOoForum.org - Problem opening RTF file in Writer |accessdate=2011-05-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=113308 |title=OpenOffice.org Bugzilla – Bug 113308 - Vertical text in border |accessdate=2011-05-19[/tpl] Similarly, when a document with drawing objects is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, these are not preserved in the RTF file. (For example, OpenOffice.org supports drawing objects in some file formats (e.g. in ODF, SXW, DOC), but does not support RTF drawing objects.)

===Security concerns===

Unlike Microsoft Word's DOC format, as well as the newer Office Open XML and OpenDocument formats, RTF does not support macros. For this reason, RTF is recommended over these formats when the spread of computer viruses is a concern. However, having the .RTF extension does not guarantee that a file is safe, since Microsoft Word will open standard DOC files renamed with an RTF extension and run any contained macros as usual. Manual examination of a file in a plain text editor such as Notepad, or use of the file command in UNIX-like systems, is required to determine whether or not a suspect file is really RTF.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/resources/macro.php|title=Avoiding Macro Viruses|publisher=SANS Institute[/tpl]

==Implementations==

Each RTF implementation usually implements only some versions or subsets of the RTF specification. Many of the available RTF converters cannot understand all new features in the latest RTF specifications.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html |title=Converters from PC Textprocessors to LaTeX - Overview - Converting from RTF |author=Wilfried Hennings |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl]
The WordPad editor in Microsoft Windows creates RTF files by default. It once defaulted to the Microsoft Word 6.0 file format, but write support for Word documents (.doc) was dropped in a security update. Read support was also dropped in Windows 7. WordPad does not support some RTF features, such as headers and footers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/home/faq/faq_fileviewer.asp#Why_does_RTF_not |title=Why does RTF not work properly in WordPad and NotePad? |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] However, WordPad can read and save many RTF features that it cannot create such as: tables, strikeout, superscript, subscript, "extra" colors, text background colors, numbered lists, right or left indent, quasi-hypertext and URL linking, and various line spacings. RTF is also the data format for "rich text controls" in MS Windows APIs.
The default text editor for Mac OS X, TextEdit, can also view, edit and save RTF files as well as RTFD files.  TextEdit currently (as of July 2009) has limited ability to edit RTF document margins.  Much older Mac word processing application programs such as MacWrite and WriteNow were able to view, edit, and save RTF files as well.
The free and open-source word processors AbiWord, OpenOffice.org, KWord, and Bean can view, edit and save RTF files. (Abiword and OpenOffice.org use RTF 1.6 when a new file is saved.) RTF format is also used in Ted word processor. These implementations might be interesting for those who need to learn how to implement RTF support in their project and link it to other application functionality.
Scrivener uses individual RTF files for all the text files that make up a given "project".
SIL International’s Toolbox freeware application for developing and publishing dictionaries uses RTF as its most common form of document output. RTF files produced by Toolbox are designed to be used in Microsoft Word, but can also be used by other RTF-aware word processors.
RTF can be used on some ebook readers because of its interoperability,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=The interoperability of RTF is questionable according to various references. Some references needed about usage of RTF in ebook readers because of its to interoperability and low CPU processing requirements.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Handbook on Minimum Information Interoperability Standards (MIOS) |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/Text/2004/10/mios_v3_16_april_02.pdf |publisher=Department of Public Service and Administration (South Africa) |accessdate=2010-07-11|date=2002-04-16[/tpl] simplicity, and low CPU processing requirements, and some devices, including BeBook, work best with this format.

===Libraries and convertors===

The open-source script rtf2xml can partially convert RTF to XML.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtf2xml/ |title=rtf2xml: convert MS RTF to XML |accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://rtf2xml.sourceforge.net/docs/man-page.html |title=rtf2xml - The Man Page |accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]
GNU UnRTF is an open-source program to convert RTF into HTML, LaTeX, troff macros and other formats. pyth is a Python library to create and convert documents in RTF, XHTML and PDF format. Ruby RTF is a project to create Rich Text content via Ruby. RaTFink is a library of Tcl routines, free software, to generate RTF output, and a Cost script to convert SGML to RTF. RTF::Writer is a Perl module for generating RTF documents. PHPRtfLite is an API enabling developers to create RTF documents with PHP. RTFGen is a project to create RTF documents via pure PHP.
The Mac OS X command line tool textutil enables you to convert files between rtf, rtfd, text, doc, docx, wordml, odt, and webarchive.[tpl]cite web |url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html |title=textutil man page |accessdate=2013-06-25[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The Rich Text Format was the standard file format for text-based documents in applications developed for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft did not initially make the RTF specification publicly available, making it difficult for competitors to develop document conversion features in their applications. Because Microsoft's developers had access to the specification, Microsoft's applications had better compatibility with the format. Also, every time Microsoft changed the RTF specification, Microsoft's own applications had a lead in time-to-market, because competitors had to redevelop their applications after studying the newer version of the format. Novell alleged that Microsoft's practices were anticompetitive in its antitrust complaint against Microsoft.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2004/11/complaint.pdf |format=PDF |title=Novell Files WordPerfect Antitrust Lawsuit against Microsoft |author=Novell |date=2004-11-12 |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://gl.scofacts.org/gl-20041115214025458.html |title=The Novell Antitrust Complaint (as text) & A Law About Antitrust and Standards Writing |publisher= |date=2004-11-17 |accessdate=2010-03-13[/tpl] The RTF specifications lack some of the semantic definitions necessary to read, write and modify documents.[tpl]cite web |url=http://diaryproducts.net/for/geek/microsoft_rtf_specification_nightmare |title=Microsoft RTF Specification Nightmare |author=Hannes Schmidt |date=2004-08-06 |accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]
