==Airport development programme==

History
The first airport of Lima was the Limatambo Airport, located in San Isidro, which ceased operations in 1960 due to lack of space and capacity to handle the increasing flights. In that same year, the Lima-Callao International Airport began to operate in Callao. In June 1965, the airport was renamed as "Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez" after Peruvian aviator Jorge Chávez Dartnell and in December 1965, the current terminal building was inaugurated.5 In 2001, in order to improve and expand its infrastructure, the airport was concessioned by the Peruvian government to Lima Airport Partners (LAP), now composed of Fraport and two other minor partners, retaining the air traffic control managed by the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (CORPAC).6 The key legal advisors in the transaction were Jaime Malagón, Jerome Jakubik, Paul Slocomb, and Víctor M. Marroquín of Baker & McKenzie, the international law firm retained by the Peruvian Government to advise on all privatization processes.Over time, the airport showed signals of decay, lack of space for passengers and outdated technology in radar and safety.
