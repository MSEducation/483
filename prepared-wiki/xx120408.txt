KXVA (branded on-air as "Fox Abilene") is a full-service television station in Abilene, Texas, broadcasting locally in digital on UHF channel 15 as an affiliate of the Fox network. Founded June 15, 2000, the station is owned by London Broadcasting. Master control operations for KXVA take place at the KIDY facilities.

==History==

On June 15, 2000, the Federal Communications Commission granted an original construction permit to former owner Sage Broadcasting Company to build a full-service station to serve the Abilene/Sweetwater/Brownwood television market. It would be the market's fourth full-service station. The station was built quickly, with a planned launch in September or October 2000, but inclement weather caused delays in constructing the tower.Abilene’s new Fox affiliate, KXVA, expected to broadcast next week, Abilene Reporter-News, January 6, 2001. On January 9, 2001, several months later than expected, KXVA began broadcasting Fox programming under Program Test Authority. The station obtained its initial broadcast license on February 13, 2002, more than one year after applying for the license.
In 2008, KXVA was purchased by Bayou City Broadcasting in a group deal for approximately $3 million. In 2011, a simulcast of KIDZ-CD was added to KXVA as digital subchannel 15.2, providing their sister station in a digital form.
On September 27, 2012, Bayou City Broadcasting announced an agreement to sell KXVA and its seven other television stations to London Broadcasting Company (the sale price initially was not disclosed). The sale marks a temporary exit from the broadcasting industry for the company's owner DuJuan McCoy, who plans on refocusing his company to acquire major network affiliates in mid-sized markets larger than San Angelo and Abilene.Temporary Exit With Fox Duo Sale by McCoy, TVNewsCheck, September 27, 2012.
The FCC granted its approval of the sale on November 14.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/view_auth.pl?Application_id=1517183&File_number=BALCDT-20120927ADA&Callsign=KIDY&Facility=58560 The sale was completed on December 31.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101535867&formid=905&fac_num=58560

===Digital channels===

Sometime in 2011, KIDZ-CD was added to KXVA as digital subchannel 15.2, providing their sister station in a digital form.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===

Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the digital television allotment plan on April 21, 1997,FCC the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, on or before February 17, 2009, which is the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations, KXVA was required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal (called a "flash-cut").

==Programming==

KXVA has been a Fox station since sign-on, taking over the affiliation from former owner Sage Broadcasting's KIDZ-LD and repeaters. Its schedule is a mix of network and syndicated programming. As the Fox affiliate, KXVA is Abilene's television home for the Dallas Cowboys National Football League football team, airing up to 14 of the team's 16 regular season games.

==Newscasts==

KXVA presently broadcasts 2½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with a half-hour on weekdays; the station does not produce newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays). In 2009, KXVA began airing a simulcast of Fox News at Nine, an hour-long evening newscast from San Antonio Fox affiliate KABB (channel 29); the newscast aired every night at 9 p.m., except in the case of Fox programming overruns due to network sports coverage, and was rebroadcast nightly at 10 p.m. on a one-hour tape delay on sister station KIDZ-LD. The following year in October 2010, the station began simulcasting KABB's four-hour morning newscast, Fox News First; the newscast airs weekday mornings from 5 to 9 a.m.
In addition to local news headline updates airing during Fox News at Nine and Fox News First, KXVA provides an hourly local news updates weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with headlines and news information provided by the Abilene Reporter News newspaper.
On January 20, 2014, KXVA debuted a half-hour primetime newscast at 9 p.m. on weeknights from its sister station in San Angelo, Texas KIDY. All simulcasts of KABB newscasts were dropped with the morning news simulcast being replaced by other programming including The Texas Daily and The Broadcast, news and interview programs produced by its Dallas sister station KTXD-TV.
