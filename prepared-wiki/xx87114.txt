The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library of George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States.

==Description==

The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum was dedicated on November 6, 1997 and opened to the public shortly thereafter. It was designed by the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.
The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on a [tpl]convert|90|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] site on the west campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The Bush Library and Museum is situated on a plaza adjoining the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center and the George Bush School of Government and Public Service. It operates under the administration of the NARA under the provisions of the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955.
The mission of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is to preserve and make available for research the official records, personal papers and artifacts of President George H.W. Bush, to support democracy, promote civic education and increase historical understanding of our national experience through the life and times of George Bush.
The textual archives contain more than 44 million pages of personal papers and official documents subject to the Presidential Records Act, as well as personal records from associates connected with President Bush's public career as Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. As in all NARA presidential libraries, records are housed in acid-free storage (Hollinger) boxes in a balanced humidity and temperature atmosphere. The archival storage area houses [tpl]convert|13000|cuft|m3[/tpl] of records and the library has a National Security vault holding [tpl]convert|3500|cuft|m3[/tpl] of Presidential Records. In addition to memoranda, speeches, and reports found in the textual collection, there is an extensive audio-visual and photographic archive that includes approximately 2 million photographs and thousands of hours of audio and video tape.
The museum has just under [tpl]convert|17000|sqft|m2|-2[/tpl] of permanent exhibit space and [tpl]convert|3000|sqft|m2|-2[/tpl] of temporary exhibit space. Permanent exhibits draw on the best of the museum collection to visually convey the essence of George Bush's life and public service career and to illustrate historical events of this period in American history. Changing exhibits explore topics on the Bush Administration, American history, American Presidents, etc.[tpl]Ref|library[/tpl]
Its classroom is the first of its kind in the Presidential Libraries network. The classroom can be used by student groups as a computer learning lab or as a traditional classroom. It is the Bush Library and Museum's educational mission to inform and enrich learning for all ages about American history, the role of the presidency in general with special focus on the administration of George Bush.
In 2011, the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation was given an overall score of 2 out of 4 by Charity Navigator.[ref]

==Renovations==

On April 23, 2007, the permanent exhibit closed for complete renovation (though the temporary exhibit gallery remained open, hosting the popular "Traveling White House in Miniature" exhibit). Since it reopened on November 10, 2007, the permanent exhibit features (like many other presidential libraries), a replica of the Oval Office; unlike those presidential libraries, visitors will be able to fully enter the replica, sit behind the president's desk, and have a souvenir photo taken.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5290301.html|title=A more interactive George Bush library and museum reopens|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=November 10, 2007|date=November 10, 2007|author=Kever, Jeannie[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/national_news/story/298524.html|title=Bush museum is 10 years old but new again|publisher=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|accessdate=November 10, 2007|date=November 10, 2007|author=Tinsley, Anna M.[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gtHnUejnzibxD7_n6TGtxV8vHTDgD8SQDRP00|title=Renovated Bush Museum Reopening|publisher=Google|work=Associated Press|author=GRACZYK, Michael|date=November 9, 2007|date=November 10, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl]

The giving of the award to Kennedy was seen as surprising, and possibly a snub to Bush's son, who was then president.Georgie Anne Geyer, "Bush Sr.'s 'message' to Bush Jr.", Boston Globe October 18, 2003. http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/10/18/bush_srs_message_to_bush_jr/ Accessed February 16, 2012
