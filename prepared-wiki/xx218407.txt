Biedronka (Polish for ladybug) is the biggest chain of no frills supermarkets in Poland (nearly 2,400 shops and 37,000 employees), owned by the Portuguese company Jer√≥nimo Martins. Literally, the name translates as ladybug which is the logo of the company.
Biedronka sells mainly local (Polish) products, much of which are manufactured specially under the company's own label. It is one of the best recognized companies in Poland (98% of the population) and is targeted at lower-income customers. It also sells a variety of Portuguese-made products. In 2013 90% of the product range were Polish-made.http://www.biedronka.pl/str/4/i/1347.php
