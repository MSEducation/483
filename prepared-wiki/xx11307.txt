The Sami people, also spelled Sámi or Saami, are the indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of  Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Kola Peninsula of Russia, and the border area between south and middle Sweden and Norway.  The Sámi are the only indigenous people of  Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe.[tpl]cite web|title=World Heritage and the Arctic |last=F.

Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.
Traditionally, the Sami have pursued a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping, and sheep herding. Their best-known means of livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. Currently about 10% of the Sami are connected to reindeer herding and 2,800 are actively involved in herding on a full-time basis.http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_reindeer.pdf For traditional, environmental, cultural and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved only for Sami people in certain regions of the Nordic countries.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3760/is_200001/ai_n8885279

==Etymologies==

The Sámi are often known in other languages by the exonyms Lap, Lapp, or Laplanders, but many Sami regard these as pejorative terms.[tpl]Cite book|title=Ethnologue |author1=Barbara F.

Variants of the name Lapp were originally used in Sweden and Finland and, through Swedish, adopted by all major European languages: [tpl]lang-en|Lapps[/tpl]; German, [tpl]lang-nl|Lappen[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-ru|лопари́[/tpl] (lopari); [tpl]Lang-uk|лопарі́[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Lapons[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Λάπωνες[/tpl] (Lápōnes); [tpl]lang-it|Lapponi[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pl|Lapończycy[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pt|Lapões[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-es|Lapones[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ro|laponi[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-tr|Lâpon[/tpl].
The first known historical mention of the Sami, naming them Fenni, was by Tacitus, about 98 CE.[tpl]Cite book|title= Tacitus. Germania. Translated with introduction and commentary by J.B. Rives |last= Rives |first= Archibald Black |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location= Oxford |pages=96, 322, 326, 327|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9xLVEPR-ax8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Germania:+by+Cornelius+Tacitus+rives#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn= 978-0-19-815050-3[/tpl] Variants of Finn or Fenni were in wide use in ancient times, judging from the names Fenni and Phinnoi in classical Roman and Greek works. Finn (or variants, such as skridfinn, "striding Finn") was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the Sami, as attested in the Icelandic Eddas and Norse sagas (11th to 14th centuries). The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to Old Norse finna, from proto-Germanic *finthanan ("to find"),[tpl]cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |last= |first= |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=find&allowed_in_frame=0[/tpl] the logic being that the Sami, as hunter-gatherers "found" their food, rather than grew it. It has been suggested, however, that it may originally have been a more general term for "northern hunter gatherers", rather than referring exclusively to the Sami, which may explain why two Swedish runestones from the 11th century apparently refer to what is now southwestern Finland as Finland. Note that in Finnish, Finns (inhabitants of Finland) do not refer to themselves as Finns. As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using Finn exclusively to refer to inhabitants of Finland, while Sami came to be called Lapps. In Norway, however, Sami were still called Finns at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like Finnmark, Finnsnes, Finnfjord and Finnøy) and some Northern Norwegians will still occasionally use Finn to refer to Sami people, although the Sami themselves now consider this to be a pejorative term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as "Kvens" to distinguish them from the Sami "Finns". Ethnic Finns are a distinct group from Sami.
The exact meaning of the term Lapp, and the reasons it came into common usage, are unknown; in modern Scandinavian languages, lapp means "a patch of cloth for mending", which may be a description[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] of the clothing, called a gakti, that the Sámi wore. Another possible source is the Finnish word lape, which in this case means "periphery". It is unknown how the word Lapp came into the Norse language, but one of the first written mentions of the term is in the Gesta Danorum by 12th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, who referred to the two Lappias, although he still referred to the Sami as (Skrid-)Finns.[tpl]cite web|title=The Early Period of Sámi History, from the Beginnings to the 16th Century |last=Simms |first=Doug |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/dieda/hist/early.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Gesta Danorum, Book V |last=Grammaticus |first=Saxo |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |url=http://omacl.org/DanishHistory/book5II.html[/tpl] In fact, Saxo never explicitly connects the Sami with the "two Laplands". The term "Lapp" was popularized and became the standard terminology by the work of Johannes Schefferus, Acta Lapponica (1673), but was also used earlier by Olaus Magnus in his Description of the Northern peoples (1555). There is another suggestion that it originally meant "wilds".[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
In Sweden and Finland, Lapp is common in place names, such as Lappi (Länsi-Suomen lääni) and Lapinlahti (Itä-Suomen lääni) in Finland; and Lapp (Stockholm County), Lappe (Södermanland) and Lappabo (Småland) in Sweden. As already mentioned, Finn is a common element in Norwegian (particularly Northern Norwegian) place names, whereas Lapp is exceedingly rare.
In the North Sámi language, láhppon olmmoš means a person who is lost (from the verb láhppot, to get lost).
Sámi refer to themselves as Sámit (the Sámis) or Sápmelaš (of Sámi kin), the word Sámi being inflected into various grammatical forms. It has been proposed that Sámi (presumably borrowed from the Proto-Finnic word), Häme (Finnish for Tavastia) ( ← Proto-Finnic *šämä, the second ä still being found in the archaic derivation Häm'äläinen''), and perhaps ''Suomi'' (Finnish for Finland) ( ← *''sōme-''/''sōma-'', compare ''suoma'lainen, supposedly borrowed from a Proto-Germanic source *sōma- from Proto-Baltic *sāma-, in turn borrowed from Proto-Finnic *šämä) are of the same origin and ultimately borrowed from the Baltic word *žēmē, meaning "land".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sgr.fi/ct/ct51.html |title=Article on the subject by the Finno-Ugrian Society |publisher=Sgr.fi |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl] The Baltic word is cognate with Slavic земля (zemlja), which also means "land".[tpl]cite book|last=Derksen|first=Rick|title=Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon|year=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=542[/tpl]
The Sámi institutions — notably the parliaments, radio and TV stations, theatres, etc. — all use the term Sámi, including when addressing outsiders in Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or English. In Norwegian, the Sámi are today referred to by the Norwegianized form same, whereas the word lapp would be considered archaic and pejorative.
Terminological issues in Finnish are somewhat different. Finns living in Finnish Lapland generally call themselves lapp'ilainen'', whereas the similar word for the Sámi people is ''lappa'lainen. This can be confusing for foreign visitors because of the similar lives Finns and Sámi people live today in Lapland. Lappalainen is also a common family name in Finland. As in the Scandinavian languages, lappalainen is often considered archaic or pejorative, and saamelainen is used instead, at least in official contexts.

Petroglyphs and archeological findings such as settlements dating from about 10,000 B.C. can be found in the traditional lands of the Sami.[tpl]cite web|title=The ski-going people - Early history|publisher=Galdu:Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  |url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?artihkkal=320&giella1=eng[/tpl] The now-obsolete term for the archaeological culture of these hunters and gatherers of the late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic is Komsa. A cultural continuity between these stone-age people and the Sami can be assumed due to evidence such as the similarities in the decoration patterns of archeological bone objects and Sami decoration patterns, and there is no archeological evidence of this population being replaced by another.
Recent archaeological discoveries in Finnish Lapland were originally seen as the continental version of the Komsa culture about the same age as the earliest finds on the coast of Norway.[tpl]cite web|title=The Earliest Postglacial Inland Settlement of Lapland |author1=Tuija Rankama |author2=Jarmo Kankaanpää |year=2007 |publisher=Kamennyi Vek Evropeiskogo Severa[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Survey and excavation at Lake Vetsijärvi, Lapland in: People, material culture and environment in the North |author1=Tuija Rankama |author2=Jarmo Kankaanpää |year=2004 |publisher=Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu|url=[/tpl] It is hypothesized that the Komsa followed receding glaciers inland from the Arctic coast at the end of the last ice age (between 11,000 and 8000 years B.C.) as new land opened up for settlement (e.g., modern Finnmark area in the northeast, to the coast of the Kola Peninsula).[tpl]cite web|title=Подобная точка зрения была всё ещё распространена в 1980-е годы: The Paleohistory of Circumpolar Arctic Colonization |author1=Janusz Kozlowski |author2= H.G.

===Southern limits of Sami settlement in the past===

How far south the Sami extended in the past has been debated among historians and archeologists for many years. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen, commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question to settle contemporary questions of Sami land rights, concluded that the Sami had lived no farther south than Lierne in Nord-Trøndelag county until around 1500, when they started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femunden in the 18th century.[tpl]Cite journal|author= Yngvar Nielsen|authorlink= Yngvar Nielsen|year=1891 |title= Lappernes fremrykning mot syd i Trondhjems stift og Hedemarkens amt |trans_title=The incursion of Lapps southwards in the see of Trondhjem and county of Hedemarken |journal=Det norske geografiske selskabs årbog |volume=1 |issue=1889–1890 |pages=18–52 |location=Kristiania |language=Norwegian [/tpl] This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In recent years, several archaeological finds indicate a Sami presence in southern Norway in the Middle Ages, and southern Sweden, including finds in Lesja, in Vang in Valdres and in Hol and Ål in Hallingdal.[tpl]Cite journal|author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans_title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197–210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian [/tpl] Proponents of the Sami interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and Sami people in the mountainous areas of southern Norway in the Middle Ages.[tpl]rp|208[/tpl]

===Origins of the Norwegian Sea Sami===

====The bubonic plague====

Until the arrival of bubonic plague to northern Norway in 1349, the Sami and the Norwegians occupied very separate economic niches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lavvu.com/geno/SamiArtical.html |title=Pursuing Sami Genealogy|first= Christopher|last= Pesklo|publisher=Lavvu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]  The Sami hunted reindeer and fished for their livelihood.  The Norwegians, who were concentrated on the outer islands and near the mouths of the fjords, had access to the major European trade routes so that, in addition to marginal farming in the Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark counties, they were able to establish commerce, supplying fish in trade for products from the south.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 255 ISBN 83-900213-0-7 The two groups co-existed using two different food resources. According to old Nordic texts, the Sea Sami and the Mountain Sami are two classes of the same people and not two different ethnic groups as had been erroneously believed.[tpl]Cite book|title= In Northern Mists: Dagligt Liv i Norden i det sekstende Aarhundrede|last= Troels-Lund |first= Fredrik|year=1914 |publisher=Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag|location=København, Kristiania |pages=129–130|url=http://runeberg.org/dagligt/1/0182.html[/tpl]
This social economic balance greatly changed with the introduction of the bubonic plague in northern Norway in December 1349.  The Norwegians were closely connected to the greater European trade routes, along which the plague traveled; consequently, they were infected and died at a far higher rate than Sami in the interior. Of all the states in the region, Norway suffered the most from this plague.Sandnes J. Settlement development in the Late Middle Ages (approx. 1300–1540), in: S. Gissel et al. (eds.) “Land colonization in the Nordic countries c. 1300–1600, Stockholm: 81. Depending on the parish, sixty to seventy-six percent of the northern Norwegian farms were abandoned following the plague,Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 242-244 ISBN 83-900213-0-7 while land-rents, another possible measure of the population numbers, dropped down to between 9-28% of pre-plague rents.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 250 ISBN 83-900213-0-7  Although the population of northern Norway is sparse compared to southern Europe, the spread of the disease was just as rapid.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 240 ISBN 83-900213-0-7 The method of movement of the plague-infested flea (Xenopsylla cheopsis) from the south was in wooden barrels holding wheat, rye, or wool – where the fleas could live, and even reproduce, for several months at a time.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 256 ISBN 83-900213-0-7 The Sami, having a non-wheat or -rye diet, eating fish and reindeer meat, living in communities detached from the Norwegians, and being only weakly connected to the European trade routes, fared far better than the Norwegians.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 245 ISBN 83-900213-0-7

====Fishing industry====

Fishing has always been the main livelihood for the many Sami living permanently in seaside areas.[tpl]Cite report|title=Report on indigenous fishing rights in the seas with case studies from Australia and Norway |year=19–30 April 2010 |publisher=United Nations, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues |location=New York |isbn= |page=15 |pages=|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.2EN.pdf[/tpl] Archeological research shows that the Sami have lived along the coast and once lived much farther south in the past, and they were also involved in work other than just reindeer herding (e.g., fishing, agriculture, iron work). The fishing along the north Norwegian coast, especially in the Lofoten and Vesterålen islands, is quite productive with a variety of fish, and during medieval times, it was a major source of income for both the fisherman and the Norwegian monarchy.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 29-34 ISBN 83-900213-0-7 With such massive population drops caused by the Black Death, the tax revenues from this industry greatly diminished.  Because of the huge economic profits that could be had from these fisheries, the local authorities offered incentives to the Sami – faced with their own population pressures – to settle on the newly vacant farms.Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 255-256 ISBN 83-900213-0-7  This started the economic division between the Sea Sami (sjøsamene), who fished extensively off the coast, and the Mountain Sami (fjellsamene, innlandssamene), who continued to hunt (among other, small-game animals), and later herd, reindeer.  Even as late as the early 18th century, there were many Sami who were still settling on these farms left abandoned from the 1350s.Kirkebøker, Kvæfjord Parish, Godfjord Botten, 1758. (church record); b.1-2 (1751–1822).Folketelling av Kvæfjord, 1769; census.  After many years of continuous migration, these Sea Sami became far more numerous than the reindeer mountain Sami, who today only make up 10% of all Sami. In contemporary times, there are also ongoing consultations between the Government of Norway and the Sami Parliament regarding the right of the coastal Sami to fish in the seas on the basis of historical use and international law.[tpl]Cite report|title=Report of UNPFII - Ninth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues|year=2010 |publisher=UNESCO |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/session_ninth.html[/tpl] State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sami districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Kasta på land (Forced Ashore) |author1=Harry Johansen |author2=Torill Olsen |year=2010 |publisher=SIL International |location=Norway |isbn= |page= [/tpl]

====Mountain Sami====

As the Sea Sami settled along Norway's fjords and inland waterways pursuing a combination of farming, cattle raising, trapping and fishing, the smaller minority of the Mountain Sami continued to hunt wild reindeer. Around 1500, they started to tame these animals into herding groups, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypal Sami lifestyle.  The Mountain Sami faced the fact that they had to pay taxes to three nation-states, Norway, Sweden and Russia, as they crossed the borders of each of the respective countries following the annual reindeer migrations, which caused much resentment over the years.[tpl]Cite news|title= Christianity and the Emerging Nation States|last= Kuiper |first= Andrea (Elle)|year=1990s? |publisher=University of Texas|location=Texas |page= |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/nationstate.htm[/tpl] Sweden made the Sami work in a slavemine at Nasafjäll, causing many Samis to flee from the area, so a large part of the provinces previously used by Pite and Lule Samis is depopulated. Government troops were ordered to prevent the Sami from fleeing.

====Post-1800s====

For long periods of time, the Sami lifestyle thrived because of its adaptation to the Arctic environment. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.
However, during the 19th century, Norwegian authorities pressured the Sami to make Norwegian language and culture universal. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status. On the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sami language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sami. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.[tpl]Cite news|title= The Sami vs. Outsiders|last= Woodard |first= Káre (Kimmi)|year=1990s? |publisher=University of Texas|location=Texas |page= |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm#immigration[/tpl]
The strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in Finnmark had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This caused the dislocation of Sami people in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on "native act land" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the scorched earth policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944–45, destroying all existing houses, or kota, and visible traces of Sami culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sami people were allowed to build. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The controversy around the construction of the hydro-electric power station in Alta in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem ("Sámi soga lávlla") and flag (Sami flag) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the Finnmark Act was passed in the Norwegian parliament giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.

====Contemporary====

The indigenous Sami population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic. The Sami are still coping with the cultural consequences of language and culture loss related to generations of Sami children taken to missionary and/or state-run boarding schools and the legacy of laws that were created to deny the Sami rights (e.g., to their beliefs, language, land and to the practice of traditional livelihoods). The Sami are experiencing cultural and environmental threats,  including oil exploration, mining, dam building, logging, climate change, military bombing ranges, tourism and commercial development.
Sapmi is rich in precious metals, oil, and natural gas. Mining activities in Arctic Sapmi cause controversy when they are in grazing and calving areas. Mining projects are rejected by the Sami Parliament in the Finnmark area. The Sami Parliament demands that resources and mineral exploration should benefit mainly the local Sami communities and population, as the proposed mines are in Sami lands and will affect their ability to maintain their traditional livelihood.[tpl]cite web|title=Mining prospects in arctic Norway also causing controversy |year=2010 |publisher=NRK |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/04/23/prospects-bright-for-arctic-mining/[/tpl] Mining locations even include ancient Sami spaces that are designated as ecologically protected areas, such as the [tpl]ill-WD|Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve|Q1777304[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Blackstone to Mine Reindeer Pastures, Sweden |year=2010 |publisher=EALAT |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://icr.arcticportal.org/index.php?option=com_hwdvideoshare&task=viewvideo&Itemid=34&video_id=73&lang=en[/tpl] In Russia's Kola Peninsula, vast areas have already been destroyed by mining and smelting activities, and further development is imminent.

In northern Finland, there has been a longstanding dispute over the destruction of forests, which prevents reindeer from migrating between seasonal feeding grounds and destroys supplies of lichen that grow on the upper branches of older trees.

The Swedish government has allowed the world's largest onshore wind farm to be built in Piteå, in the Arctic region where the Eastern Kikkejaure village has its winter reindeer pastures. The wind farm will consist of more than 1,000 wind turbines, one 80 mil and an extensive road infrastructure, which means that the feasibility of using the area for winter grazing in practice is impossible. Sweden has received strong international criticism, including by the UN Racial Discrimination Committee and the Human Rights Committee, that Sweden violates Sami landrättigheter (land rights), including by not regulating industry. In Norway some Lappish politicians (for example - Aili Keskitalo) suggest giving the Sami Parliament a special veto right on planned mining projects.Sami parliament wants veto mineral issues.

State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sami districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.
The Sami recently stopped a water-prospecting venture that threatened to turn an ancient sacred site and natural spring called Suttesaja into a large-scale water-bottling plant for the world market—without notification or consultation with the local Sami people, who make up 70 percent of the population. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities has registered the area as a heritage site of cultural and historical significance, and the stream itself is part of the Deatnu/Tana watershed, which is home to Europe's largest salmon river, an important source of Sami livelihood.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Suttesaja: from a sacred Sami site and natural spring to a water bottling plant?

In Norway, the government plans for the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Alta river in Finnmark, northern Norway led to a political controversy, rallying of the Sami popular movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a result, the opposistion in the Alta controversy brought attention not only to environmental issues but also to the issue of Sami rights.
Reindeer have major cultural and economic significance for indigenous peoples of the North. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and ecosystem and the characteristic ways of life of indigenous Arctic peoples.[tpl]cite web|title=Reindeer Herders Vulnerability Network Study |author=EALÁT |year=2010 |publisher=EALÁT |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url= http://icr.arcticportal.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=245&Itemid=86&lang=en[/tpl]
The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster caused nuclear fallout in the sensitive Arctic ecosystems and poisoned fish, meat and berries. Lichens and mosses are two of the main forms of vegetation in the Arctic and are highly susceptible to airborne pollutants and heavy metals. Since many do not have roots, they absorb nutrients, and toxic compounds, through their leaves. The lichens accumulated airborne radiation, and 73,000 reindeer had to be destroyed as "unfit" for human consumption in Sweden alone. The government promised Sami indemnification, which was not acted upon by government.
Radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel have been stored in the waters off the Kola Peninsula, including locations that are only "two kilometers" from places where Sami live. There are a minimum of five "dumps" where spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste are being deposited in the Kola Peninsula, often with little concern for the surrounding environment or population.[tpl]Cite book|title=Мы живем на ядерной помойке: Почему вымирают коренные народы Севера |last=Rykov |first=Sergey|year=2010 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.stoletie.ru/obschestvo/my_zhivem_na_jadernoj_pomojke_2010-04-21.htm[/tpl]
The tourism industry in Finland has been criticized for turning Sami culture into a marketing tool by promoting opportunities to experience "authentic" Sami ceremonies and lifestyle. At many tourist locales, non-Samis dress in inaccurate replicas of Sami traditional clothing, and gift shops sell crude reproductions of Sami handicraft. One popular "ceremony", crossing the Arctic Circle, actually has no significance in Sami spirituality.

One committee recommendation was that no language be allowed to be a basis for discrimination in the Norwegian anti-discrimination laws, and it recommended wording of Racial Discrimination Convention Article 1 contained in the Act.  Further points of recommendation concerning the Sami population in Norway included the incorporation of the racial Convention through the Human Rights Act, improving the availability and quality of interpreter services, and equality of the civil Ombudsman's recommendations for action.

In Sweden the Sami often feel that the schools do not contribute to strengthening the Sami children’s identity and that children who are subjected to harassment and discrimination are not given the protection they need and are entitled to.  Sami children, young people, and parents have also said that harassment connected to their ethnic background is part of their day-to-day life. It is manifested through taunts and other types of abuse. The Sami feel that the local authorities do not take the Sami right to mother tongue teaching seriously, even to the point of openly opposing it. It is evident that a child’s possibilities for receiving mother tongue teaching are in many cases dependent on the parents’ involvement and knowledge of Sami linguistic rights.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Even in Finland, where Sami children, like all Finnish children, are entitled to day care and language instruction in their own language, the Finnish government has denied funding for these rights in most of the country, including even in Rovaniemi, the largest municipality in Finnish Lapland.

As in the other countries claiming sovereignty over Sami lands, Sami activists' efforts in Finland in the 20th century achieved limited government recognition of the Samis' rights as a recognized minority, but the Finnish government has clung unyieldingly to its legally enforced premise that the Sami must "prove" their land ownership, an idea incompatible with and antithetical to the traditional reindeer-herding Sami way of life.

===Official Sami policy===

====Norway====

The Sami have been recognized as an indigenous people in Norway (1990 according to ILO convention 169 as described below), and hence, according to international law, the Sami people in Norway are entitled special protection and rights. The legal foundation of the Sami policy is:http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_foundation.pdf
The constitutional amendment states: "It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions enabling the Sami people to preserve and develop its language, culture and way of life." This provides a legal and political protection of the Sami language, culture and society. In addition the "amendment implies a legal, political and moral obligation for Norwegian authorities to create an environment conducive to the Samis themselves influencing on the development of the Sami community" (ibid.).
The Sami Act provides special rights for the Sami people (ibid.):
In addition, the Sami have special rights to reindeer husbandry.
The Norwegian Sami Parliament also elects 50% of the members to the board of the Finnmark Estate, which controls 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark.
Norway has also accepted international conventions, declarations and agreements applicable to the Sami as a minority and indigenous people including:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_norways.pdf |title=Norway’s international obligations|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]
In 2007, the Norwegian Parliament passed the new Reindeer Herding Act acknowledging siida as the basic institution regarding land rights, organization, and daily herding management.

====Sweden====

The Sametingslag was established as the Swedish Sami Parliament as of 1 January 1993. Sweden recognised the existence of the "Sami nation" in 1989, but the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169 has not been adopted. All indigenous rights are currently banned.
The Compulsory School Ordinance states that Sami pupils are entitled to be taught in their native language; however, a municipality is only obliged to arrange mother-tongue teaching in Sami if a suitable teacher is available and the pupil has a basic knowledge of Sami.
In 2010, after 14 years of negotiation, Laponiatjuottjudus, an association with Sami majority control, will govern the UNESCO World Heritage Site Laponia. The reindeer-herding law will apply in the area as well.[tpl]cite web|title=Swedish Sami National Association (SSR)|url=http://www.nsd.se//nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=5408663[/tpl]
In 1998, Sweden formally apologized for the wrongs committed against the Sami.

====Finland====

The act establishing the Finnish Sami Parliament (Finnish: Saamelaiskäräjät) was passed on November 9, 1973.
Finland recognized the Sami as a "people" in 1995, but they have yet to ratify ILO Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.
Finland ratified the 1966 U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights though several cases brought before the U.N. Human Rights Committee. Of those, 36 cases involved a determination of the rights of individual Sami in Finland and Sweden. The committee decisions clarify that Sami are members of a minority within the meaning of Article 27 and that deprivation or erosion of their rights to practice traditional activities that are an essential element of their culture do come within the scope of Article 27.[tpl]Cite book|title=Jouni E.

Finland Sami have had access to Sami language instruction in some schools since the 1970s, and language rights were established in 1992.

The Russian Federation lists distinct indigenous peoples as having special rights and protections under the Constitution and federal laws and decrees.[tpl]Cite book|title=Northern peoples of Russia on the path to the new millennium |author=PV.

In April 1999, the Russian Duma passed a law that guarantees socio-economic and cultural development to all indigenous minorities, protecting traditional living places and acknowledging some form of limited ownership of territories that have traditionally been used for hunting, herding, fishing, and gathering activities. The law, however, does not anticipate the transfer of title in fee simply to indigenous minorities. The law does not recognize development rights, some proprietary rights including compensation for damage to the property, and limited exclusionary rights. It is not clear, however, whether protection of nature in the traditional places of inhabitation implies a right to exclude conflicting uses that are destructive to nature or whether they have the right to veto development.
The Russian Federation's Land Code reinforces the rights of numerically small peoples ("indigenous minorities") to use places they inhabit and to continue traditional economic activities without being charged rent.[tpl]Cite book|title=Northern peoples of Russia on the path to the new millennium |authorlink= |author=PV.

Furthermore, indigenous minorities and ethnic groups are allowed to use environmentally protected lands and lands set aside as nature preserves to engage in their traditional modes of land use.
Regional law, Code of the Murmansk Oblast, calls on the organs of state power of the oblast to facilitate the native peoples of the Kola North, specifically naming the Sami, "in realization of their rights for preservation and development of their native language, national culture, traditions and customs." The third section of Article 21 states: "In historically established areas of habitation, Sami enjoy the rights for traditional use of nature and traditional activities."
Throughout the Russian North, indigenous and local people are being denied rights to fish, hunt, use pastureland, or exercise control over resources upon which they and their ancestors have depended for centuries. The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Unfortunately, violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy prevail over the rule of law.
The life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps. These groups depend upon different types of environment at differing times of the year, rather than upon exploiting a single commodity to exhaustion.[tpl]Cite book|title=Aboriginal peoples and the law: Indian, Metis and Inuit rights in Canada |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Bradford W.

In the Sami homeland on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, regional authorities closed a fifty-mile (eighty-kilometer) stretch of the Ponoi River (and other rivers) to local fishing and granted exclusive fishing rights to a commercial company offering catch-and-release fishing to sport fishers largely from abroad.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Ponoi River Report: Sport Fishing in the Kola Peninsula |year=1985  |publisher= Circumpolar Conservation Union |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/-arctic/articles/ ponoi-eng.htm[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] This deprived the local Sami (see Article 21 of the Code of the Murmansk Oblast) of food for their families and community and of their traditional economic livelihood. Thus, closing the fishery to locals may have violated the test articulated by the U.N. Human Rights Committee and disregarded the Land Code, other legislative acts, and the 1992 Presidential decree. Sami are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to "criminalization" of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without "poaching" resources that should be accessible to them legally.
Although indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.

====Nordic====

On 16 November 2005 in Helsinki, a group of experts, led by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway Professor Carsten Smith, submitted a proposal for a Nordic Sami Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for Sami affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three Sami Parliaments from the respective countries. This convention recognizes the Sami as one indigenous people residing across national borders in all three countries.  A set of minimum standards is proposed for the rights of developing the Sami language and culture and rights to land and water, livelihoods and society.[tpl]Cite report|title=Report on indigenous fishing rights in the seas with case studies from Australia and Norway |year=19–30 April 2010 |publisher=United Nations, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues |location=New York |isbn= |page=19 |pages=|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.2EN.pdf[/tpl] The convention has not yet been ratified in the Nordic countries.http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_nordic_sami_conv.pdf

==Sami culture==

To make up for past suppression, the authorities of Norway, Sweden and Finland now make an effort to build up Sami cultural institutions and promote Sami culture and language.

===Duodji (craft)===

Duodji, the Sami handicraft, originates from the time when the Samis were self-supporting nomads, believing therefore that an object should first and foremost serve a purpose rather than being primarily decorative. Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled scrimshawed sami knives, drums, and guksi (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as gákti (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.

===Clothing===

Gakti are the traditional clothing worn by the Sámi people. The gákti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.
Traditionally, the gákti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's gákti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1-3 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern Sami boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different gákti for women and men; men's gákti have a shorter "jacket-skirt" than a women's long dress. Traditional gákti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.
The colours, patterns and the jewellery of the gákti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqués in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern Sami have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by gender, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.
The gákti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern Sami also have a hooded jumper (малиц) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.

===Media and literature===

===Music===

A characteristic feature of Sami musical tradition is the singing of yoik/joik. Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung a cappella, usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional Sami instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the "fadno" flute (made from reed-like Angelica archangelica stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).

===Education===

===Festivals and markets===

===Visual Arts===

In addition to Duodji (Sami handicraft), there is a developing area of contemporary Sami visual art. Galleries such as Sámi Dáiddaguovddáš (Sami Center for Contemporary Art)http://www.samiskkunstnersenter.no are being established.

===Dance===

===Reindeer husbandry===

Reindeer husbandry has been and still is an important aspect of Sami culture. During the years of forced assimilation, the areas in which reindeer herding was an important livelihood were among the few where the Sami culture and language survived.
Today in Norway and Sweden, reindeer husbandry is legally protected as an exclusive Sami livelihood, such that only persons of Sami descent with a linkage to a reindeer herding family can own, and hence make a living off, reindeer. Presently, about 2,800 people are engaged in reindeer herding in Norway. In Finland, reindeer husbandry is not exclusive and is practiced to a limited degree also by ethnic Finns.

==Sápmi==

Sápmi is the name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Sami people.  Non-Sami and many regional maps have often called this same region Lapland as there is considerable regional overlap between the two terms.  Lapland can be either misleading or offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.  Among the Sami people, Sápmi is strictly used and acceptable.
Sápmi is located in Northern Europe, includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia and spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia.
