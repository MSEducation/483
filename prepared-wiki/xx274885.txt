==How it all began==

In June 1966 the North East Cheshire Society for Mentally Handicapped Children opened their day care centre at 'Glengarth' in Station Road, Marple, Stockport.  As a number of the children who attended lived in Bramhall, a Bramhall sub-committee of the society was formed with one of its main objectives being fundraising.  It was thought best to organise events which would be annual to raise regular income.  At the time, a member of the Bramhall sub-Committee, Michael Hodgson, was Captain of Davenport Rugby Club.
The club was approached through, then President Norman Harris, by George Jackson and Michael Hodgson with the properstioion of organising an annual seven a side rugby competition.  George had a ready made carrot to dangle in that he said he could get David Watkins, then of Newport RFC and the 'Prince of all Sevens Players' to bring a side for the first tournament.  It was decided to form a joint committee to organise the event and so the 'Glengarth Sevens' was born.
England Rugby International, Eric Evans was invited to become President and remained throughout providing continuous encouragement, inspiration and leadership.  The England players of his era rated Eric as the finest Captain they had played under and the team went on to win the Grand Slam in 1957 and Triple Crown in 1958.
The tournament was very fortunate to have a number of dedicated sponsors but the most valuable contribution was made by Davenport Rugby Club and its members who worked so hard to make the Glengarth Sevens a national success and a very highly respected seven a side rugby tournament.  The 21 years of the Glengarth Sevens raised more than Â£60,000.
Many famous teams and players entered the Glengarth Sevens.  Players like David Watkins, Andy Irvine, Les Cusworth, Phil Bennett, Peter Winterbottom, Steve Smith, Fran Cotton and many others; teams like Orrell, who won the competition 8 times and guest sides such as the Public School Wanderers, who won it 4 times.  Famous memories include legendary British and Irish Lions Captain, Willie John McBride running onto the Davenport 1st XV pitch with a lion cub from Longleat.
