San Marino participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2008, marking its debut in the long-running international contest. The Sammarinese national broadcaster Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV) officially confirmed San Marino's participation in the contest in November 2007 after deliberation amongst the broadcaster's shareholders.
The pop-rock band Miodio represented San Marino at the contest in Belgrade with the Italian language song "Complice". However, San Marino's debut entry in the contest was not very successful, with the song placing last in the first semi-final of the contest with just five points.
After participating for the first time, San Marino withdrew from the 2009 contest due to financial difficulties at SMRTV, having originally submitted its application for participation. It returned again in 2011.

==At Eurovision==

As only the "Big Four" and the winner of the previous contest were guaranteed a place at the final, San Marino had to qualify through a semi-final. The 2008 contest featured a new system for semi-final allocation in order to reduce the problems of neighborly and diaspora voting that occurred in years past. Following a draw held on 28 January 2008, San Marino was allocated a place in the first semi-final, held on 20 May 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10310|title=The Eurovision Song Contest semi final draw|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-01-28|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] Though only participating in the first semi-final, SMRTV announced that it would air both semi-finals in San Marino, which in turn allowed parts of Italy in its broadcasting area to watch the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in several years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=2602|title=San Marino TV to air both semifinals|date=2008-02-17|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2008-10-11[/tpl]

===Semi-final===

Miodio performed in the first semi-final on 20 May 2008, appearing fifth out of the nineteen countries. The performance featured the band wearing black suits, but with each member wearing it in a different style.Eurovision Song Contest Semi-final 1, May 20, 2008, San Marino RTV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/11743|title=Eurovision 2008: The first Eurovision dress rehearsal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-05-19|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-10-03[/tpl] Aniko Pusztai, set designer and dancer at La Scala in Milan, joined the group on stage. SMRTV said that they believed that choreography was as important part of the group's performance as the song itself, deciding to use "emotional impact" for the performance. The broadcaster said that Pusztai would "move on the words of the text, merging the music with dance, a sort of angel, a white that will contrast with the dark soul of the group".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinortv.sm/default.asp?id=578&id_n=25864&anno=0&sez=0|title=Eurofestival a Belgrado: i Miodio sul palco con una ballerina della Scala|date=2008-05-13|publisher=San Marino RTV|language=Italian|accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] The background on the large television screens on stage was a wavy light blue colour.
Miodio's performance did not manage to inspire the crowd, and San Marino only managed to receive five points with its debut entry: two points from Andorra and three points from Greece, placing it last of the 19 entries. Each country is allowed to give a maximum of twelve points to a song, and only the top ten countries went on to the final. Placing last in the semi-final, San Marino did not qualify for the final and became the eighth country to debut in the contest with a last place finish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/11998|title=Voting analysis (1): the first semi final|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2008-05-25|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-10-03[/tpl]
