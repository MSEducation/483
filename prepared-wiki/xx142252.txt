===Campaign mailing controversy===

Nguyen's campaign was linked to a Spanish-language mailing of 14,000 letters allegedly warning immigrants not to vote, threatening them with prison or deportation. The letter was received by registered Hispanic voters the weekend of October 15, 2006 and sent to then-California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who launched an investigation into the source of the letter on Monday, October 17, 2006.[tpl]cite news|title=Candidate who sent immigration flier urged to quit | work= Daily Breeze |location=Torrance, Calif|date=20 Oct 2006|page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Local GOP pulls support for party's candidate / He's linked to letter saying immigrants can't legally vote|author=Gledhill, Lynda| url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-10-20/bay-area/17317863_1_jail-time-orange-county-party-democratic-party|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 20, 2006|page=1[/tpl] As translated in the press at the time, it read in part:Spanish-language mailing linked to Tan Nguyen campaign
The letter was issued on the letterhead of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform; however, its chairwoman denied any involvement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-me-scare17oct17,1,5513175.story?coll=la-headlines-politics&ctrack=1&cset=true|title=State Investigating Intimidating Letter Sent to O.C.

The coalition drafted and signed a joint letter calling for an investigation into the letter. On Friday, October 20, California Department of Justice agents raided Nguyen's campaign headquarters in Garden Grove and his home in Santa Ana.[tpl]cite news|first=Jennifer; Goffard, Christopher and Tran, Mai |last=Delson |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-me-letter21oct21,0,7524703.story?track=mostviewed-homepage |title=Raids Widen 'Immigrant' Letter Probe |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=October 21, 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-23[/tpl]
On May 16, 2007, the California Department of Justice investigation determined there was no evidence that Nguyen's campaign had an intent to intimidate those legally entitled to vote. The investigation had found that the original draft of the letter (in English) had warned illegals and those with green cards against voting, but elsewhere had encouraged those with U.S. citizenship to vote.  The phrase "those with green cards" had then been translated into "emigrado" for the Spanish-language letter that was mailed; this had later been translated back into English as "immigrant" when the letter was brought to light in the media.  Senior Assistant Attorney General Gary Schons stated the investigation found that Nguyen did, in fact, know about the letter before it was mailed, in contradiction to Nguyen's repeated assertions that he was not aware of it.  Nguyen, who continued to deny involvement with the letter, in other respects, stated satisfaction with the investigation results and considered himself exonerated.Tan Nguyen cleared by State Attorney General from the OC Register
