The Minister of Defense is the only album by rapper Mac Minister. It was released on September 26, 2006 for SMC Recordings and was produced by Seanie T. The Minister of Defense may very well be the only album released by Mac Minister as he is currently serving a life sentence for murders that he was convicted of committing in 2005. The album was released a few months after Mac Minister was apprehended by the FBI.
