Arturo Bonfanti (Bergamo, 1905–1978) was an Italian painter.

==Biography==

Having studied at the Andrea Fantoni art school, Bergamo, since 1924, Bonfanti moved to Milan in 1926 and devoted his energies to graphic art and interior decoration. It was in the 1930s that he developed relations with the group of abstract artists gravitating around the Galleria del Milione in Milan. He was also influenced by the Metaphysical art of Carlo Carrà and L’Esprit nouveau of Amédée Ozenfant and Le Corbusier. His return to Bergamo during World War II was followed in the post-war period by various trips to Paris, Zurich and Munich. In 1947 he started to produce abstract paintings, aiming for the geometric simplification of forms. Unlike many artists of that period, he took part in no movements. International recognition came with the decision of the Venice Biennale to devote a room exclusively to his works at the 34th Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte di Venezia in 1968.
