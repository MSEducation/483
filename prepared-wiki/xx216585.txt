The Georgian government and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia a part of Georgia's territory, though Georgia is not in control of it. Under Georgia's official designation it is an autonomous republic, called the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, whose government sits in exile in Tbilisi.
The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict. The wider region formed part of the Soviet Union until 1991. As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate towards the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence. This led to the 1992–1993 War in Abkhazia that resulted in a Georgian military defeat, de facto independence of Abkhazia and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population from Abkhazia. In spite of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations, the status dispute has not been resolved, and despite the long-term presence of a United Nations monitoring force and a Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping operation, the conflict has flared up on several occasions. In August 2008, the sides again fought during the South Ossetia War, which was followed by the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia, the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and the termination of the UN and OSCE missions.[tpl]cite news|title=Russia recognises Georgia's breakaway republics -2|location=Moscow|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=26 August 2008|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080826/116291407.html|accessdate=2008-09-09[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav063009.shtml|title=Georgia: OSCE Terminates Its 17-Year Georgian Mission|publisher=Eurasianet|author=Jean-Christophe Peuch|date=June 29, 2009[/tpl] On 28 August 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a Russian-occupied territory.Resolution of the Parliament of Georgia declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia occupied territories, 28 August 2008.Abkhazia, S.Ossetia Formally Declared Occupied Territory.

==History==

===Early history===

Between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, the territory of modern Abkhazia was part of the ancient Georgian kingdom of Colchis ("Kolkha").[tpl]Citation | title = Georgia in Antiquity: A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia, 550 BC – AD 562 | first = David | last = Braund | place = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon | year = 1994 | page = 359[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | title = The Making of the Georgian Nation | first = Ronald | last = Grigor | publisher = SUNY | page = 13[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | title = Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War | first = Stuart J | last = Kaufman | page = 91[/tpl].[tpl]cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3261059.stm |title=BBC News – Regions and territories: Abkhazia |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2011 | publisher =BBC |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2012[/tpl] This kingdom was subsequently absorbed in 63 BC into the Kingdom of Egrisi, known to Byzantine Roman sources as "Lazica".[tpl]Citation | first = David | last = Braund | title = Georgia in Antiquity: A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia, 550 BC – AD 562 | publisher = Oxford University Press | place = USA | date = 8 September 1994 | page = 27[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Gregory | first = Timothy E | title = A History of Byzantium | year = 2005 | page = 78 | ISBN = 978-0-631-23512-5[/tpl].
Between 1000 and 550 BC, Greeks established trade colonies along the coast of the Black Sea, in particular at Pitiunt and Dioscurias, which was to become the capital of modern day Abkhazia. They encountered local warlike tribes who they called Heniochi.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Classical authors described various peoples living in the region and the great multitude of languages they spoke.Graham Smith, Edward A Allworth, Vivien A Law et al., pages 56-58; Abkhaz by W.

The Roman Empire conquered Egrisi in the 1st century AD and ruled it until the 4th century, following which it regained a measure of independence, but remained within the Byzantine Empire's sphere of influence. Although the exact time when the population of the region of Abkhazia was converted to Christianity has not been determined, it is known that the Metropolitan of Pitius participated in the First Ecumenical Council in 325 in Nicaea.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Abkhazia, or Abasgia in classic sources, formerly part of Colchis and later of Egrisi (Lazica) until the late 690s, was a princedom under Byzantine authority. Anacopia was the princedom's capital. The country was mostly Christian with the archbishop's seat in Pityus.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 975 An Arab incursion into Abkhazia was repelled by Leon I jointly with his Egrisian and Kartlian allies in 736.

During this period the Georgian language replaced Greek as the language of literacy and culture.Alexei Zverev, Ethnic Conflicts in the Caucasus; Graham Smith, Edward A Allworth, Vivien A Law et al., pages 56–58; Abkhaz by W. Barthold Minorsky in the Encyclopaedia of Islam; The Georgian-Abkhaz State (summary), by George Anchabadze, in: Paul Garb, Arda Inal-Ipa, Paata Zakareishvili, editors, Aspects of the Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict: Cultural Continuity in the Context of Statebuilding, Volume 5, 26–28 August 2000. The western Georgian kingdom flourished between 850 and 950 when it annexed significant parts of Eastern Georgia including Tbilisi. A period of unrest ensued, which ended as Abkhazia and eastern Georgian states were unified under a single Georgian monarchy, ruled by King Bagrat III (who was buried in the Monastery of Bedia in the Tkvarcheli district of Abkhazia) at the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th century.
In the 16th century, after the break-up of the Georgian Kingdom into small kingdoms and principalities, Principality of Abkhazia (a vassal of the Kingdom of Imereti) emerged, ruled by the Shervashidze dynasty (also known as Sharvashidze, or Chachba). Since the 1570s, when the Ottoman navy occupied the fort of Tskhumi, Abkhazia came under the influence of the Ottoman Empire and Islam. Under Ottoman rule, the majority of Abkhazians were converted to Islam. The principality retained a degree of autonomy under Ottoman and then Russian rule, but it was eventually absorbed into the Russian Empire in 1864.

===Abkhazia within the Russian Empire===

In the beginning of the 19th century, while the Russians and Ottomans were vying for control of the region, the rulers of Abkhazia shifted back and forth across the religious divide.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The first attempt to enter into relations with Russia was made by Keilash Bey in 1803, shortly after the incorporation of eastern Georgia into the expanding Tsarist empire (1801). However, the pro-Ottoman orientation prevailed for a short time after his assassination by his son Aslan-Bey on 2 May 1808.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] On 2 July 1810, the Russian Marines stormed Sukhum-Kale and had Aslan-Bey replaced with his rival brother, Sefer-Bey (1810–1821), who had converted to Christianity and assumed the name of George. Abkhazia joined the Russian Empire as an autonomous principality, in 1810. However, George’s rule, as well as that of his successors, was limited to the neighbourhood of Sukhum-Kale and the Bzyb area.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The next Russo-Turkish war strongly enhanced the Russian positions, leading to a further split in the Abkhaz elite, mainly along religious divisions. During the Crimean War (1853–1856), Russian forces had to evacuate Abkhazia and Prince Michael (1822–1864) seemingly switched to the Ottomans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Later on, the Russian presence strengthened and the highlanders of Western Caucasia were finally subjugated by Russia in 1864.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The autonomy of Abkhazia, which had functioned as a pro-Russian "buffer zone" in this troublesome region, was no longer needed by the Tsarist government and the rule of the Shervashidze came to an end; in November 1864, Prince Michael was forced to renounce his rights and resettle in Voronezh.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Later that same year, Abkhazia was incorporated into the Russian Empire as a special military province of Sukhum-Kale which was transformed, in 1883, into an okrug as part of the Kutais Guberniya. Large numbers of Muslim Abkhazians, said to have constituted as much as 40% of the Abkhazian population, emigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1864 and 1878 with other Muslim population of Caucasus, a process known as Muhajirism.
Large areas of the region were left uninhabited and many Armenians, Georgians, Russians and others subsequently migrated to Abkhazia, resettling much of the vacated territory.[tpl]cite book |title= E.J.

By official decision of the Russian authorities the residents of Abkhazia and Samurzakano had to study and pray in Russian. After the mass deportation of 1878, Abkhazians who were left in minority and were officially branded as "guilty people", had no leaders in order to carry out serious opposition against Russification politics of the empire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eng.expertclub.ge/portal/cnidExpertclub/lang2546/default.aspx |title=Some of the issues of Russian imperial language policy in Abkhazia and its results (part II) | publisher=Experts' Club | date=2010-06-28[/tpl] 
On March 17, 1898 when sinodal department of Georgia-Imereti of Russian Orthodox Church by order 2771 again prohibited teaching and conduction of religious services in church schools and churches of the Sukhumi district in Georgian language, it was followed by mass protests of Georgian population of Abkhazia and Samurzakano that reached the Russian emperor. On September 3, 1898 the Holy Synod issued order 4880 which determined: Those parishes where congregation were Mingrelians i.e. Georgians, both church services and church education should have been conducted in Georgian language, while in Abkhazian parishes in old Slavic language. This order was carried out only in three parishes out of 42 in the Sukhumi district.  Tedo Sakhokia demanded from Russian authorities to introduce Abkhazian and Georgian languages in church services and education. In response, authorities instituted a criminal case against Tedo Sakhokia and leaders of the "Georgian party" that was active in Abkhazia, headed by Sakhokia.

===Abkhazia within the Soviet Union===

The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the creation of an independent Georgia which included Abkhazia, in 1918. German support enabled the Georgians to repel the Bolshevik threat from Abkhazia in 1918.  The 1921 constitution granted Abkhazia autonomy.
In 1921, the Bolshevik Red Army invaded Georgia and ended its short-lived independence. Abkhazia was made a Socialist Soviet Republic (SSR Abkhazia) with the ambiguous status of a treaty republic associated with the Georgian SSR.[tpl]Citation | url = http://abkhazia.narod.ru/constitution1.htm | year = 1925 | title = Constitution of SSR Abkhazia | contribution = Definition of status | at = Article 3 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5PubnkAEm | archivedate=27 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = Neproshin | first = A.Ju. | language = Russian | trans_title = Abkhazia.

In 1931, Joseph Stalin made it an autonomous republic (Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or in short Abkhaz ASSR) within the Georgian SSR. Despite its nominal autonomy, it was subjected to strong direct rule from central Soviet authorities.  Under the rule of Stalin and Beria Abkhaz schools were closed, requiring Abkhaz children to study in the Georgian language.[tpl]cite book |title = Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States|year= 1999|publisher= Europa Publications Limited|location= London|isbn = 978-1-85743-058-5 |page= 363[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= The Abkhazians: a handbook|last= Hewitt|first= George | year = 1999|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 978-0-312-21975-8|page= 96[/tpl] The publishing of materials in Abkhazians dwindled and was eventually stopped altogether; Abkhazian schools were closed on 1945/46.[tpl]Citation | first = George | last = Hewitt | title = Abkhaz – A Comprehensive Self-Tutor | page = 17[/tpl].
The policy of repression was eased after Stalin's death and Beria's execution, and the Abkhaz were given a greater role in the governance of the republic. As in most of the smaller autonomous republics, the Soviet government encouraged the development of culture and particularly of literature.

===Abkhazia in post-Soviet Georgia===

As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate at the end of the 1980s, ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia's moves towards independence. Many Abkhaz opposed this, fearing that an independent Georgia would lead to the elimination of their autonomy, and argued instead for the establishment of Abkhazia as a separate Soviet republic in its own right. The dispute turned violent on 16 July 1989 in Sukhumi. Sixteen Georgians are said to have been killed and another 137 injured when they tried to enroll in a Georgian University instead of an Abkhaz one. After several days of violence, Soviet troops restored order in the city and blamed rival nationalist paramilitaries for provoking confrontations. In June 1988, the so-called Abkhaz Letter was sent to Gorbachev.
In March 1990, Georgia declared sovereignty, unilaterally nullifying treaties concluded by the Soviet government since 1921 and thereby moving closer to independence. The Republic of Georgia boycotted the 17 March 1991 all-Union referendum on the renewal of the Soviet Union called by Mikhail Gorbachev; however, 52.3% of Abkhazia's population (almost all of the ethnic non-Georgian population) took part in the referendum and voted by an overwhelming majority (98.6%) to preserve the Union.Conciliation Resources. Georgia-Abkhazia, Chronology[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]Парламентская газета (Parlamentskaya Gazeta). Референдум о сохранении СССР. Грузия строит демократию на беззаконии. Георгий Николаев, 17 March 2006 [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Most ethnic non-Georgians in Abkhazia later boycotted a 31 March referendum on Georgia’s independence, which was supported by a huge majority of Georgia's population. Within weeks, Georgia declared independence on 9 April 1991, under former Soviet dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Under Gamsakhurdia, the situation was relatively calm in Abkhazia and a power-sharing agreement was soon reached between the Abkhaz and Georgian factions, granting to the Abkhaz a certain over-representation in the local legislature.Coppieters, Bruno et al.(2005), Statehood and security: Georgia after the Rose Revolution, p. 384. American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ISBN 978-0-262-03343-5
Gamsakhurdia's rule was soon challenged by armed opposition groups, under the command of Tengiz Kitovani, that forced him to flee the country in a military coup in January 1992. Former Soviet foreign minister and architect of the disintegration of the USSR Eduard Shevardnadze became the country's head of state, inheriting a government dominated by hard-line Georgian nationalists. He was not an ethnic nationalist but did little to avoid being seen as supporting his administration's dominant figures and the leaders of the coup that swept him to power.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
On 21 February 1992, Georgia's ruling Military Council announced that it was abolishing the Soviet-era constitution and restoring the 1921 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Many Abkhaz interpreted this as an abolition of their autonomous status, although the 1921 constitution contained a provision for the region's autonomy.1921 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia: Chapter XI, Articles 107–108 (adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Georgia 21 February 1921): "Abkhasie (district of Soukhoum), ..., which are integral parts of the Georgian Republic, enjoy autonomy in the administration of their affairs. The statute concerning the autonomy of these districts ... will be the object of special legislation". Regional Research Centre. Retrieved on 25 November 2008. On 23 July 1992, the Abkhaz faction in the republic's Supreme Council declared effective independence from Georgia, although the session was boycotted by ethnic Georgian deputies and the gesture went unrecognised by any other country. The Abkhaz leadership launched a campaign of ousting Georgian officials from their offices, a process which was accompanied by violence. In the meantime, the Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba intensified his ties with hardline Russian politicians and military elite and declared he was ready for a war with Georgia.Svante E. Cornell (2001), Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus, pp. 345–9. Routledge, ISBN 978-0-7007-1162-8.

===Abkhazian War===

In August 1992, the Georgian government accused Gamsakhurdia's supporters of kidnapping Georgia's Interior Minister and holding him captive in Abkhazia. The Georgian government dispatched 3,000 soldiers to the region, ostensibly to restore order. The Abkhaz were relatively unarmed at this time and the Georgian troops were able to march into Sukhumi with relatively little resistance and subsequently engaged in ethnically based pillage, looting, assault, and murder.Full Report by Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch. Georgia/Abkhazia. Violations of the laws of war and Russia's role in the conflict Helsinki, March 1995. p. 22 The Abkhaz units were forced to retreat to Gudauta and Tkvarcheli.
The Abkhaz military defeat was met with a hostile response by the self-styled Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, an umbrella group uniting a number of movements in the North Caucasus, including elements of Circassians, Abazins, Chechens, Cossacks, Ossetians and hundreds of volunteer paramilitaries and mercenaries from Russia, including the then little-known Shamil Basayev, later a leader of the anti-Moscow Chechen secessionists.  They sided with the Abkhaz separatists to fight against the Georgian government. In the case of Basayev, it has been suggested that when he and the members of his battalion came to Abkhazia, they received training by the Russian Army (though others dispute this), presenting another possible motive.[tpl]cite news |title=The Chechen's Story: From Unrivaled Guerrilla Leader to the Terror of Russia |date=15 September 2004 |accessdate=6 April 2011 |publisher=New York Times |author=C.J.Shivers |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/international/europe/15chechen.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times[/tpl] In September, the Abkhaz and Russian paramilitaries mounted a major offensive against Gagra after breaking a cease-fire, which drove the Georgian forces out of large swathes of the republic. Shevardnadze's government accused Russia of giving covert military support to the rebels with the aim of "detaching from Georgia its native territory and the Georgia-Russian frontier land". 1992 ended with the rebels in control of much of Abkhazia northwest of Sukhumi.
The conflict was in stalemate until July 1993, when Abkhaz separatist militias launched an abortive attack on Georgian-held Sukhumi. They surrounded and heavily shelled the capital, where Shevardnadze was trapped. The warring sides agreed to a Russian-brokered truce in Sochi at the end of July. But the ceasefire broke down again on 16 September 1993. Abkhaz forces, with armed support from outside Abkhazia, launched attacks on Sukhumi and Ochamchira. Notwithstanding UN Security Council's call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and its condemnation of the violation of the ceasefire by the Abkhaz side, fighting continued.Georgia - UNOMIG - Background After ten days of heavy fighting, Sukhumi was taken by Abkhazian forces on 27 September 1993. Shevardnadze narrowly escaped death, after vowing to stay in the city no matter what. He was forced to flee when separatist snipers fired on the hotel where he was staying. Abkhaz, North Caucasian militants, and their allies committed numerous atrocities against the city's remaining ethnic Georgians, in what has been dubbed the Sukhumi Massacre. The mass killings and destruction continued for two weeks, leaving thousands dead and missing.
The Abkhaz forces quickly overran the rest of Abkhazia as the Georgian government faced a second threat: an uprising by the supporters of the deposed Zviad Gamsakhurdia in the region of Mingrelia (Samegrelo). Only a small region of eastern Abkhazia, the upper Kodori gorge, remained under Georgian control (until 2008).
During the war, gross human rights violations were reported on both sides (see Human Rights Watch report). Georgian troops have been accused of having committed lootingOn Ruins of Empire: Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Former Soviet Union, pg 72, by Georgiy I.

Prior to the 1992 War, Georgians made up nearly half of Abkhazia's population, while less than one-fifth of the population was Abkhaz.Population censuses in Abkhazia: 1886, 1926, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989, 2003 [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] As the war progressed, confronted with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians who were unwilling to leave their homes, the Abkhaz separatists implemented the process of ethnic cleansing in order to expel and eliminate the Georgian ethnic population in Abkhazia.The Guns of August 2008, Russia's War in Georgia, Svante Cornell & Frederick Starr, p 27US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994, pp. 120 The exact number of those killed during the ethnic cleansing is disputed, however, it ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 people, not including the civilians who were killed in 1998 during the separatist onslaught on Gali region.Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna. Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow., p 10 Roughly up to 250,000 ethnic Georgians were expelled from their homes. Slightly over 200,000 Georgians remain displaced in Georgia proper.Abkhazia Today.
The campaign ethnic cleansing also included Russians, Armenians, Greeks, moderate Abkhaz and other minor ethnic groups living in Abkhazia.  More than 20,000 houses owned by ethnic Georgians were destroyed. Hundreds of Schools, kindergartens, churches, hospitals, historical monuments were pillaged and destroyed.Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow by S. A. Chervonnaia and Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaia, pp 12–13
Following a process of ethnic cleansing and mass expulsion, population of Abkhazia has been reduced to 216,000, from 525,000 in 1989.Washington shames Moscow over 'occupied' Abkhazia
Of about 250,000 Georgian refugees, some 60,000 Georgian refugees subsequently returned to Abkhazia's Gali district between 1994 and 1998, but tens of thousands were displaced again when fighting resumed in the Gali district in 1998. Nevertheless, between 40,000 and 60,000 refugees have returned to the Gali district since 1998, including persons commuting daily across the ceasefire line and those migrating seasonally in accordance with agricultural cycles.UN High Commissioner for refugees.

The United Nations and other international organisations have been fruitlessly urging the Abkhaz de facto authorities "to refrain from adopting measures incompatible with the right to return and with international human rights standards, such as discriminatory legislation... and to cooperate in the establishment of a permanent international human rights office in Gali and to admit United Nations civilian police without further delay."Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons – Mission to Georgia.

===Post-war Abkhazia===

Presidential elections were held in Abkhazia on 3 October 2004. Russia evidently supported Raul Khadjimba, the prime minister backed by the ailing outgoing separatist President Vladislav Ardzinba. Posters of Russia's President Vladimir Putin together with Khadjimba, who, like Putin, had worked as a KGB official, were everywhere in Sukhumi.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Deputies of Russia's parliament and Russian singers, led by Joseph Cobsohn, a State Duma deputy and a popular singer, came to Abkhazia, campaigning for Khadjimba.
However Raul Khadjimba lost the elections to Sergei Bagapsh. The tense situation in the republic led to the cancellation of the election results by the Supreme Court. After that, a deal was struck between former rivals to run jointly, with Bagapsh as a presidential candidate and Khadjimba as a vice presidential candidate. They received more than 90% of the votes in the new election.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
In July 2006, Georgian forces launched a successful police operation against the rebelled administrator of the Georgian populated Kodori Gorge, Emzar Kvitsiani. Kvitsiani had been appointed by the previous president of Georgia Edvard Shevardnadze and refused to recognise the authority of president Mikheil Saakashvili, who succeeded Shevardnadze after the Rose Revolution. Although Kvitsiani escaped capture by Georgian police, the Kodori Gorge was brought back under the control of the central government in Tbilisi.
Sporadic acts of violence continued throughout the postwar years. Despite the peacekeeping status of the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia, Georgian officials routinely claimed that Russian peacekeepers were inciting violence by supplying Abkhaz rebels with arms and financial support. Russian support of Abkhazia became pronounced when the Russian ruble became the de facto currency and Russia began issuing passports to the population of Abkhazia.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3261059.stm |work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Abkhazia | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420194315/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3261059.stm| archivedate= 20 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Georgia has also accused Russia of violating its airspace by sending helicopters to attack Georgian-controlled towns in the Kodori Gorge.

===Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia===

In late October 2008 President Saakashvili signed into law legislation on the occupied territories passed by the Georgian Parliament. The law covers the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali (territories of former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19868&search= |title=Bill on Occupied Territories Signed into Law |publisher=Civil.ge |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.smr.gov.ge/docs/doc216.pdf | title=THE LAW OF GEORGIA ON OCCUPIED TERRITORIES | format=PDF | date=2008-10-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2009/CDL(2009)004-e.asp |title=Law on occupied territories of Georgia (en.) |publisher=Venice.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl] The law spells out restrictions on free movement and economic activity in the territories. In particular, according to the law, foreign citizens should enter the two breakaway regions only through Georgia proper. Entry into Abkhazia should be carried out from the Zugdidi District and into South Ossetia from the Gori District. The major road leading to South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia passes through the Gori District.
The legislation, however, also lists "special" cases in which entry into the breakaway regions will not be regarded as illegal. It stipulates that a special permit on entry into the breakaway regions can be issued if the trip there "serves Georgia’s state interests; peaceful resolution of the conflict; de-occupation or humanitarian purposes." The law also bans any type of economic activity – entrepreneurial or non- entrepreneurial, if such activities require permits, licenses or registration in accordance with Georgian legislation. It also bans air, sea and railway communications and international transit via the regions, mineral exploration and money transfers. The provision covering economic activities is retroactive, going back to 1990.
The law says that the Russian Federation – the state which has carried out military occupation – is fully responsible for the violation of human rights in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian Federation, according to the document, is also responsible for compensation of material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens, stateless persons and foreign citizens, who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits. The law also says that de facto state agencies and officials operating in the occupied territories are regarded by Georgia as illegal. The law will remain in force until "the full restoration of Georgian jurisdiction" over the breakaway regions is realised.

===Status-neutral passports===

Currently Georgia considers all residents of Abkhazia its citizens, while they see themselves as Abkhaz citizens.
In the summer of 2011 the Parliament of Georgia adopted a package of legislative amendments providing for the issuance of neutral identification and travel documents to residents of Abkhazia and the former South Ossetian autonomous province of Georgia. The document allows travelling abroad, as well as enjoying social benefits existing in Georgia. The new neutral identification and travel documents were called "neutral passports".[tpl]cite news| url=http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2146299.html | work=Trend.AZ | title=Romania recognized neutral Georgian passports for Abkhazian and South Ossetian residents | date=2013-05-02[/tpl]
According to Georgian officials, the “neutral passports” lacked any symbols of Georgia and only bore a registration number and an individual number. Moscow argued it was Georgia’s "cunning ploy" because the passports contained Georgia’s code and the Georgian Interior Ministry as the issuing body.
Abkhazia’s Foreign Ministry expressed concerns about some countries recognizing the “neutral passports.” The ministry also said an increasing number of Abkhazian residents with Russian passports were being denied Schengen visas.[tpl]cite news| url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120607/173900221.html | work=RIA Novosti | title=Moscow Blasts U.S.-Georgia 'Neutral Passports' | date=2012-06-07[/tpl]
As of May 2013, Neutral documents has been recognized by Japan, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, USA, Bulgaria, Poland, Israel, Estonia and Romania.
According to Russian media, President of Republic of Abkhazia, Alexander Ankvab threatened to international organizations, saying during a meeting with the leadership of the foreign ministry that “international organizations that suggest the so-called neutral passports, will leave Abkhazia.”[tpl]cite web|publisher=DFWATCH STAFF |url=http://dfwatch.net/abkhazian-leader-opposed-to-neutral-passports-25286 |title=Abkhazian leader opposed to neutral passports | date=2012-01-19[/tpl]

===Russian involvement===

During the Georgian–Abkhaz conflict, the Russian authorities and military supplied logistical and military aid to the separatist side. Today, Russia still maintains a strong political and military influence over separatist rule in Abkhazia. Russia has also issued passports for the citizens of Abkhazia since 2000 (as Abkhazian passports cannot be used for international travel) and subsequently paid retirement pensions and other monetary benefits. More than 80% of the Abkhazian population received Russian passports by 2006. As Russian citizens living abroad, Abkhazians do not pay Russian taxes or serve in the Russian Army.Abkhazia Today.

===International involvement===

The UN has played various roles during the conflict and peace process: a military role through its observer mission (UNOMIG); dual diplomatic roles through the Security Council and the appointment of a Special Envoy, succeeded by a Special Representative to the Secretary-General; a humanitarian role (UNHCR and UNOCHA); a development role (UNDP); a human rights role (UNHCHR); and a low-key capacity and confidence-building role (UNV). The UN’s position has been that there will be no forcible change in international borders. Any settlement must be freely negotiated and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multi-ethnic population has returned.Resolutions 849, 854, 858, 876, 881 and 892 adopted by the UN Security Council According to Western interpretations the intervention did not contravene international law since Georgia, as a sovereign state, had the right to secure order on its territory and protect its territorial integrity.
The OSCE has increasingly engaged in dialogue with officials and civil society representatives in Abkhazia, especially from NGOs and the media, regarding human dimension standards and is considering a presence in Gali. OSCE expressed concern and condemnation over ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia during the 1994 Budapest Summit DecisionFrom the Resolution of the OSCE Budapest Summit, 6 December 1994 Lisbon OSCE Summit Declaration and later at the Lisbon Summit Declaration in 1996.Lisbon Summit Declaration of the OSCE, 2–3 December 1996
The USA rejects the unilateral secession of Abkhazia and urges its integration into Georgia as an autonomous unit. In 1998 the USA announced its readiness to allocate up to $15 million for rehabilitation of infrastructure in the Gali region if substantial progress is made in the peace process. USAID has already funded some humanitarian initiatives for Abkhazia. The USA has in recent years significantly increased its military support to the Georgian armed forces but has stated that it would not condone any moves towards peace enforcement in Abkhazia.
On 22 August 2006, Senator Richard Lugar, then visiting Georgia's capital Tbilisi, joined the Georgian politicians in criticism of the Russian peacekeeping mission, stating that "the U.S. administration supports the Georgian government’s insistence on the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from the conflict zones in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali district."U.S. Senator Urges Russian Peacekeepers’ Withdrawal From Georgian Breakaway Republics. (MosNews).
On 5 October 2006, Javier Solana, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, ruled out the possibility of replacing the Russian peacekeepers with the EU force.Solana fears Kosovo 'precedent' for Abkhazia, South Ossetia. (International Relations and Security Network).  On 10 October 2006, EU South Caucasus envoy Peter Semneby noted that "Russia's actions in the Georgia spy row have damaged its credibility as a neutral peacekeeper in the EU's Black Sea neighbourhood."Russia 'not neutral' in Black Sea conflict, EU says, EUobserver, 10 October 2006.
On 13 October 2006, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution, based on a Group of Friends of the Secretary-General draft, extending the UNOMIG mission until 15 April 2007. Acknowledging that the "new and tense situation" resulted, at least in part, from the Georgian special forces operation in the upper Kodori Valley, the resolution urged the country to ensure that no troops unauthorised by the Moscow ceasefire agreement were present in that area. It urged the leadership of the Abkhaz side to address seriously the need for a dignified, secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons and to reassure the local population in the Gali district that their residency rights and identity will be respected. The Georgian side is "once again urged to address seriously legitimate Abkhaz security concerns, to avoid steps that could be seen as threatening and to refrain from militant rhetoric and provocative actions, especially in upper Kodori Valley."
Calling on both parties to follow up on dialogue initiatives, it further urged them to comply fully with all previous agreements regarding non-violence and confidence-building, in particular those concerning the separation of forces. Regarding the disputed role of the peacekeepers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Council stressed the importance of close, effective cooperation between UNOMIG and that force and looked to all sides to continue to extend the necessary cooperation to them. At the same time, the document reaffirmed the "commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders."Security Council extends Georgia Mission until 15 April 2007, The UN Department of Public Information, 13 October 2006.

===International recognition===

Abkhazia was an unrecognised state for most of its history. The following is a list of political entities that formally recognise Abkhazia.
UN member states
Partially recognised and unrecognised territories

==Geography and climate==

Abkhazia covers an area of about [tpl]convert|8660|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at the western end of Georgia.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE61G15O.htm | title = FACTBOX-Key facts on Georgian rebel region Abkhazia | accessdate =7 November 2010 | date = 17 February 2010 | publisher = AlertNet | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203163944/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE61G15O.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1358/Abkhazia | title = Abkhazia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate =7 November 2010[/tpl] The Caucasus Mountains to the north and the northeast divide Abkhazia and the Russian Federation. To the east and southeast, Abkhazia is bounded by the Georgian region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti; and on the south and southwest by the Black Sea.
Abkhazia is diverse geographically with lowlands stretching to the extremely mountainous north. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range runs along the region's northern border, with its spurs[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]the Gagra, Bzyb and Kodori ranges[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]dividing the area into a number of deep, well-watered valleys. The highest peaks of Abkhazia are in the northeast and east and several exceed [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level. Abkhazia's landscape ranges from coastal forests and citrus plantations to permanent snows and glaciers in the north of the region. Although Abkhazia's complex topographic setting has spared most of the territory from significant human development, its cultivated fertile lands produce tea, tobacco, wine and fruits, a mainstay of the local agricultural sector.
Abkhazia is richly irrigated by small rivers originating in the Caucasus Mountains. Chief of these are: Kodori, Bzyb, Ghalidzga, and Gumista. The Psou River separates the region from Russia, and the Inguri serves as a boundary between Abkhazia and Georgia proper. There are several periglacial and crater lakes in mountainous Abkhazia. Lake Ritsa is the most important of them.
The world's deepest known cave, Krubera (Voronja) Cave ("The Crows' Cave"), is located in Abkhazia's western Caucasus mountains. The latest survey (as of September 2006) has measured the vertical extent of this cave system as [tpl]convert|2158|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] between its highest and lowest explored points.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm |title=World’s Deepest Caves List from The National Speleological Society |publisher=Caverbob.com |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528153216/http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm |archivedate=28 May 2010 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
Because of Abkhazia's proximity to the Black Sea and the shield of the Caucasus Mountains, the region's climate is very mild. The coastal areas of the republic have a subtropical climate, where the average annual temperature in most regions is around [tpl]convert|15|°C[/tpl], and the average January temperature remains above freezing. The climate at higher elevations varies from maritime mountainous to cold and summerless. Also, due to its position on the windward slopes of the Caucasus, Abkhazia receives high amounts of precipitation, though humidity decreases further inland. The annual precipitation vacillates from [tpl]convert|1200|-|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] along the coast [tpl]convert|1700|-|3500|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in the higher mountainous areas. The mountains of Abkhazia receive significant amounts of snow.
The lowland regions used to be covered by swaths of oak, beech, and hornbeam, which have since been cleared.
There are two border crossings into Abkhazia. The southern border crossing is at the Inguri bridge, a short distance from the Georgian city of Zugdidi. The northern crossing ("Psou") is in the town of Gyachrypsh. Owing to the ongoing security situation, many foreign governments advise their citizens against travelling to Abkhazia.Travel advice by country: Georgia.

==Government and administration==

===Government of the Republic of Abkhazia===

Abkhazia is a presidential republic, and the second elected President of Abkhazia was Sergei Bagapsh. Bagapsh came to power following the deeply divisive October 2004 presidential election. The next election was held on 12 December 2009. Bagapsh was re-elected as President with 59.4% of the total vote.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/world/europe/14abkhazia.html |title=President of Abkhazia Re-elected by Wide Margin |last=Barry |first=Ellen |date=13 December 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] Alexander Ankvab, his vice president, was appointed acting president after the former president's death on 29 May 2011[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13587660 |title=Abkhazia President Sergei Bagapsh dies at 62 |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529112008/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13587660 |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] until winning election in his own right later on 26 August 2011.
Legislative powers are vested in the People's Assembly, which consists of 35 elected members. The last parliamentary elections were held on 10/24 March 2012. Ethnicities other than Abkhaz (Armenians, Russians and Georgians) are claimed to be under-represented in the Assembly.
Most refugees from the 1992–1993 war (mainly ethnic Georgians) have not been able to return and have thus been excluded from the political process.[tpl]cite book |first=Milica |last=Zarkovic Bookman |year=1997 |title=The Demographic Struggle for Power: The Political Economy of Demographic Engineering in the Modern World |isbn=978-0-7146-4732-6[/tpl]

===Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia (in exile)===

The Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia is the government in exile that Georgia recognises as the legal government of Abkhazia. This pro-Georgian government maintained a foothold on Abkhazian territory, in the upper Kodori Valley from July 2006 until it was forced out by fighting in August 2008. This government is also partly responsible for the affairs of some 250,000 IDPs, forced to leave Abkhazia following the War in Abkhazia and ethnic cleansing that followed.Birgitte Refslund Sørensen, Marc Vincent (2001), Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced, pp. 234–5. Pluto Press, ISBN 978-0-7453-1818-9.On Ruins of Empire: Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Former Soviet Union Georgiy I. Mirsky, p. 72. The current Head of the Government is Giorgi Baramia.
During the War in Abkhazia, the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia (at the time the Georgian faction of the "Council of Ministers of Abkhazia") left Abkhazia after the Abkhaz separatist forces took control of the region’s capital Sukhumi and relocated to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi where it operated as the Government of Abkhazia in exile for almost 13 years. During this period, the Government of Abkhazia in exile, led by Tamaz Nadareishvili, was known for a hard-line stance towards the Abkhaz problem and frequently voiced their opinion that the solution to the conflict can be attained only through Georgia's military response to secessionism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Later, Nadareishvili's administration was implicated in some internal controversies and had not taken an active part in the politics of Abkhazia[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] until a new chairman, Irakli Alasania, was appointed by President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, his envoy in the peace talks over Abkhazia.

===Administrative divisions of Abkhazia===

The Republic of Abkhazia is divided into seven raions named after their centres: Gagra, Gudauta, Sukhumi, Ochamchira, Gulripsh, Tkvarcheli and Gali. These districts are the same as under the Soviet Union, except that the Tkvarcheli district was created only in 1995 from parts of the Ochamchira and Gali districts.
The President of the Republic appoints districts' heads from those elected to the districts' assemblies. There are elected village assemblies whose heads are appointed by the districts' heads.
The Administrative subdivision of Abkhazia used by Georgia is identical to the one outlined above, except for the new Tkvarcheli district.

==Military==

The Abkhazian Armed Forces are the military of the Republic of Abkhazia. The basis of the Abkhazian armed forces was formed by the ethnically Abkhaz National Guard formed early in 1992. Most of the weapons come from the former Russian airborne division base in Gudauta.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] The Abkhazian military is primarily a ground force but includes small sea and air units. Russia has at present around 1,600 troops stationed in Abkhazia.[tpl]cite web |author=13:56 |url=http://de.rian.ru/postsowjetischen/20081030/118035800.html |title=Russland legitimiert Beziehungen zu Abchasien und Südossetien |publisher=De.rian.ru |accessdate=22 June 2010[/tpl]
The Abkhazian Armed Forces are composed of:

==Economy==

The economy of Abkhazia is heavily integrated with Russia and uses the Russian ruble as its currency. Abkhazia has experienced a modest economic upswing since the 2008 South Ossetia war and Russia's subsequent recognition of Abkhazia's independence. About half of Abkhazia's state budget is financed with aid money from Russia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/no-clear-frontrunner-as-abkhazia-goes-to-poll/442702.html |title=No Clear Frontrunner as Abkhazia Goes to Poll |author=Nikolaus von Twickel |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=26 Aug 2011[/tpl]
Tourism is a key industry and, according to Abkhazia's authorities, almost a million tourists (mainly from Russia) came to Abkhazia in 2007.Kommersant-Dengi, Тяжелая экономическая независимость (Hard Economical Independence), 08.09.2008 [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Abkhazia also enjoys fertile lands and an abundance of agricultural products, including tea, tobacco, wine and fruits (especially tangerines and hazelnuts). Electricity is largely supplied by the Inguri hydroelectric power station located on the Inguri River between Abkhazia and Georgia (proper) and operated jointly by both parties.
In the first half of 2012, the principal trading partners of Abkhazia were Russia (64%) and Turkey (18%).[tpl]cite news|title=Основными торговыми партнерами Абхазии продолжают оставаться Россия и Турция|url=http://apsnypress.info/news/6859.html|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=Apsnypress|date=27 July 2012[/tpl] The CIS economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia in 1996 are still formally in force, but Russia announced on 6 March 2008 that it would no longer participate in them, declaring them "outdated, impeding the socio-economic development of the region, and causing unjustified hardship for the people of Abkhazia".

==Demographics==

According to the last census in 2011 Abkhazia has 240,705 inhabitants.Population census in Abkhazia 2011
The exact size of Abkhazia's population was unclear. According to the census carried out in 2003 it measured 215,972 people,Population censuses in Abkhazia: 1886, 1926, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989, 2003 [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Georgian and Mingrelian figures have been conflated, as most of the "Georgians" were ethnically Mingrelian. but this is contested by Georgian authorities. The Department of Statistics of Georgia estimated Abkhazia's population to be approximately 179,000 in 2003, and 178,000 in 2005 (the last year when such estimates were published in Georgia).Statistical Yearbook of Georgia 2005: Population, Table 2.1, p. 33, Department for Statistics, Tbilisi (2005) Encyclopædia Britannica estimates the population in 2007 at 180,000 and the International Crisis Group estimates Abkhazia's total population in 2006 to be between 157,000 and 190,000 (or between 180,000 and 220,000 as estimated by UNDP in 1998).Abkhazia Today.

===Ethnicity===

The ethnic composition of Abkhazia has played a central role in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and is equally contested. The demographics of Abkhazia were very strongly affected by the 1992–1993 War with Georgia, which saw the expulsion and flight of over half of the republic's population, measuring 525,061 in the 1989 census.
The population of Abkhazia remains ethnically very diverse, even after the 1992–1993 War. At present the population of Abkhazia is mainly made up of ethnic Abkhaz, Georgians (mostly Mingrelians), Hemshin Armenians, and Russians. Other nationalities include Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greeks, Ossetians, Tatars, Turks, and Roma.[tpl]Cite book |last=Human Rights Watch |year=2011 |title=Living in Limbo: The Rights of Ethnic Georgian Returnees to the Gali District of Abkhazia |place= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=1-56432-790-6 |page=9 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Prior to the war, ethnic Georgians made up 45.7% of Abkhazia's population, however, by 1993, most Georgians and some Russians and Armenians had fled Abkhazia or had been ethnically cleansed."Abkhazia." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online 9 September 2008.
During the Soviet Union, the Russian, Armenian and Georgian population grew faster than the Abkhaz, due to the large-scale migration enforced especially under the rule of Joseph Stalin and Lavrenty Beria.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/8226.cfm |title=JRL Research & Analytical Supplement ~ JRL 8226, Issue No. 24 • May 2004.

Later, in the 1950s and 1960s, Vazgen I and the Armenian church encouraged and funded the migration of Armenians to Abkhazia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
Currently, Armenians are the second largest minority group in Abkhazia (closely matching the Georgians), although their numbers decreased dramatically from 77,000 in the 1989 census to 45,000 in the 2003 census.

===Diaspora===

Thousands of Abkhaz, known as muhajirun, fled Abkhazia for the Ottoman Empire in the mid-19th century after resisting the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. Today, Turkey is home to the world's largest Abkhaz diaspora community. Size estimates vary – Diaspora leaders say 1 million people; Abkhaz estimates range from 150,000 to 500,000.Abkhazia's Diaspora: Dreaming of Home. Eurasianet.org (2009-03-08).

===Nationality issues===

====Adoption of Russian nationality====

After the break-up of Soviet Union, Abkhazians continued to be the citizens of Soviet Union and kept Soviet passports even after a decade.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Institute for War & Peace Reporting |author=Inal Khashig |url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/abkhaz-rush-russian-passports |title=Abkhaz Rush For Russian Passports | date=2002-06-27[/tpl]
Before 2002, Russian law allowed residents of former Soviet Union to apply for citizenship if they had not become citizens of their newly independent states. The procedure was extremely complex. The new Citizenship Law of Russia adopted on 31 May 2002 introduced a simplified procedure of citizenship acquisition for former citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia the application process was simplified even further, and people could apply even without leaving their homes. Russian nationalist non-governmental organizations 
with close ties to Russian officialdom simply took their papers to a nearby Russian city for processing.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/russian-georgia-war.php |title= Russian Federation: Legal Aspects of War in Georgia | date=[/tpl]
Abkhazians began mass acquisition of Russian passports in 2002. It is reported that the public organisation, the Congress of Russian Communities of Abkhazia, had been collecting Abkhazians’ Soviet-era travel documents. It then was sending them to consular department specially set up by Russian Foreign Ministry officials in the city of Sochi. After they were checked, Abkhazian applicants had been granted Russian citizenship. By June 25 of 2002, an estimated 150,000 people in Abkhazia had acquired the new passports, joining 50,000 who already possessed Russian citizenship. The Sukhum authorities, although officially not involved in the registration for Russian nationality process, had been openly encouraging it. Government officials said privately that the passport acquisition was agreed with President Putin’s administration during Abkhazia’s prime minister Djergenia’s visit to Moscow in May 2002.
The passportization had caused outrage in Tbilisi, worsening its already shaky relations with Russia. Georgian Foreign Ministry issued a statement, insisting that Abkhazians were citizens of Georgia and calling the passport allocation an 
“unprecedented illegal campaign”. President Eduard Shevardnadze said that he would be asking his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for an explanation. The speaker of parliament, Nino Burjanadze, said that she would raise the matter at the forthcoming OSCE parliamentary assembly.
February 1, 2011 was the last day in post-Soviet space when passport of USSR was valid for crossing Russian-Abkhaz border. According to the staff of Abkhazia's passport and visa service, there are about 2-3 thousand people, mostly elderly people left with Soviet passports who had no chance of acquiring new documents. These people aren't able to get Russian citizenship. But they can first get an internal Abkhaz passport and then a travelling passport to visit Russia.[tpl]cite web|publisher=GeorgiaTimes |author=Anton Krivenuk |url=http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/analysis/50360.html |title=Abkhaz Rush For Russian Passports | date=2011-02-01[/tpl]

====Issue of ethnic Georgians====

In 2005, citing the need to integrate ethnic Georgian residents of eastern districts of Abkhazia, then leadership of Abkhazia showed signs of softening stance towards granting of citizenship to the residents of Gali, Ochamchire and Tkvarcheli districts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26487 |title=Abkhaz Decision on Passports Leaves Many Georgians in Gali Worried |publisher=Civil.ge |author=Olesya Vartanyan |date=2013-09-24[/tpl]
According to the Abkhazian law on citizenship, ethnic Abkhazians, regardless of place of residence, can become Abkhaz citizen. Those, who are not ethnic Abkhazians, are eligible to the citizenship if they lived in Abkhazia for at least five years prior to adoption of act of independence in October, 1999. This provision aims at creating legal hurdle in obtaining Abkhaz passports to those ethnic Georgians, who fled Abkhazia as a result of 1992-1993 armed conflict, and who then returned to Gali district. Abkhazian legislation forbids citizens of Abkhazia from holding dual citizenship with any other state, apart from Russia.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26053 |title=Sokhumi Suspends Issuing Abkhaz Passports to Ethnic Georgians | publisher=Civil.ge |date=2013-05-14[/tpl]
Ethnic Georgians, who have returned to the Gali district, and want to obtain Abkhaz passports, according to Abkhazian law, should undergo lengthy procedures, which also include a requirement to submit a documented proof that they renounced their Georgian citizenship. President Bagapsh was inclined to regard Georgians in Gali as "Georgianized Abkhazians." According to Bagapsh, these were actually ethnic Abkhaz people who were "Georgianized" during the long process of the Georgianization of Abkhazia that culminated during the rule of Joseph Stalin and Lavrenti Beria. So in his official speeches, Bagapsh often added the Gali Georgians to population estimates of the Abkhaz, disregarding the fact that they still thought of themselves as ethnic Georgians, rather than Abkhaz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/524e99f14.html |title=Authorities in Abkhazia Plan to Strip Georgians of Citizenship |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |author=Giorgi Menabde |date=2013-10-03[/tpl]
In early 2013 the process of passportization of Ethnic Georgians came under scrutiny of the Abkhaz opposition groups, who turned this issue into one of the central topics of the breakaway region’s internal politics and issuing of passports was suspended in May. Opposition claimed that “massive” passportization, involving granting citizenship to 
ethnic Georgians in eastern districts, was fraught with risk of “losing sovereignty and territorial integrity.” According to Apsnipress, Stanislav Lakoba, secretary of Abkhaz security council, said that “We are facing the process of oily and total Georgianization of Abkhazia.”
According to some reports emerged in mid-2013, the directors of Georgian schools in Gali were ordered by Sukhumi authorities to transfer their schools to Russian-language education.Сухуми требует от директоров грузинских школ перехода на русскоязычное обучение
On September 18 of 2013 Parliament of Republic of Abkhazia adopted a resolution instructing the prosecutor’s office to carry out a “sweeping” probe into passport offices of the interior ministry and, in case of revealing wrongdoings in distribution of passports, to refer these violations to the ministry of internal affairs for the purpose of “annulment of illegally issued passports.” Abkhaz officials announced that significant number of residents of Gali, Ochamchire and Tkvarcheli districts received Abkhaz passports while at the same time retaining their Georgian citizenship, which constituted "violation of law on Abkhaz citizenship". According to the Abkhaz officials, more than 26,000 passports were distributed in Gali, Tkvarcheli and Ochamchire districts, including about 23,000 of them were given out since Russian recognition of Abkhazia's independence in August, 2008. These political debates has caused concerns in ethnic Georgian population of Abkhazia who reside mainly in Gali district that they would be stripped of Abkhazian citizenship and thus be forced to leave Abkhazia again.
In October 2013 Alexander Ankvab signed a document about firing Stanislav Lakoba. The document about firing Lakoba did not state any reasons for the decision, but Lakoba saw it as related to his political position towards granting citizenship to Georgians living in Gali. Lakoba claimed that according to data from Abkhaz Security Council, 129 local 
people in Gali fought against Abkhazia. Local political parties and the coordination council of civil organizations expressed concern about Lakoba’s dismissal. They claimed that by dismissing him, the president "made an illegal process legal" – giving Abkhazian passports to Georgian citizens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/top-abkhazian-security-official-dismissed-25881 | title=Top Abkhazian security official dismissed | publisher=DFWATCH STAFF |date=2013-10-30[/tpl]

==Culture==

The written Abkhaz literature appeared relatively recently, in the beginning of the 20th century. However, Abkhaz share the Nart sagas, series of tales about mythical heroes, with other Caucasian peoples. The Abkhaz alphabet was created in the 19th century. The first newspaper in Abkhaz, called Abkhazia and edited by Dmitry Gulia, appeared in 1917.
Arguably the most famous Abkhaz writers are Fazil Iskander, who wrote mostly in Russian and Bagrat Shinkuba a poet.
Football remains the most popular sport in Abkhazia. Other popular sports include basketball, boxing and wrestling.
Abkhazia has its own amateur Abkhazian football league since 1994. The league is not a part of any international football union.
