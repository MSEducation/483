==Technology==

The cameras used by the Slow Mo Guys are all produced by Vision Research Phantom. The first few videos were produced using a Phantom HD Gold high speed camera. The majority of the Slow Mo Guys videos were produced using a Phantom Flex camera, capable of filming 2500 frames per second (fps) at 1080p video resolution, 5000 fps at 720p and 10000 fps at 480p. Finally, a Phantom V1610 was used to produce the fastest videos in the series, filming 18000 fps at 720p and even higher speeds at lower resolutions. The 'slow motion' effect arises when events filmed at such high frame-rates are played back at conventional playback speeds (usually 25 or 30 fps). For example, a video filmed at 2500 fps and played back at 25 fps lasts 100 times longer than the original event, and is hence perceived as 100 times slower.
