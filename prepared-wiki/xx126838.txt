Kevin Cuthbert (born 8 September 1982 in Perth) is a Scottish goalkeeper who currently plays for Hamilton Academical.
Cuthbert started his career at St. Johnstone, where he played from 1998 until his release a decade later.

==Career==

Cuthbert made his St. Johnstone debut in September 2001 after an injury to Alan Main. He remained in goal for the following two games, after which Main returned only to break his leg. Instead of turning to Cuthbert again, then-manager Sandy Clark brought in Alan Miller on loan from Blackburn Rovers as cover. Later that same season, in which St. Johnstone lost their Scottish Premier League status, Cuthbert was given a seven-game run of starts and impressed many along the way.
Cuthbert started the 2002–03 season between the goalposts but lost it for a three-month spell after Main had recovered from his broken limb. Main however, was sold to Livingston and the manangement at St. Johnstone then brought in Craig Nelson during the 2003–04 season to replace the gap left by Main. However Cuthbert's performances kept him in favour for all but seven games.
When John Connolly brought in Rangers' young goalkeeper Allan McGregor on loan in 2004–05, Cuthbert had to settle for a place on the bench for the majority of the season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/st_johnstone/3916999.stm|title=Loan blow for McGregor|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 August 2004|accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl]
For the first part of the 2006–07 season, Owen Coyle opted to go with new signing Bryn Halliwell. Cuthbert's hopes of challenging the Englishman for the starting jersey were set back after the former broke his finger in training, an injury that required surgery. He returned to action in the new year, making his first start in a 2–1 win over Clyde on Boxing Day.
On 31 March 2007, Cuthbert was given a straight red card in a 2–1 loss to Livingston at McDiarmid Park, resulting in his missing two out of St. Johnstone's four remaining league games.
In May 2008, after ten years at McDiarmid Park, Cuthbert did not renew his contract with the club. Cuthbert went on trial at Queens[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/queen_of_the_south/7504264.stm|title=Halliwell makes Palmerston move|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 July 2008|accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl] before he joined Greenock Morton[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gmfc.net/Squad/&player=33|title=Kevin Cuthbert's profile|publisher=gmfc.net|accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl] in August 2008.
On 27 December 2008, Cuthbert received the second straight red card of his career when against Airdrie United following a poor back pass by Chris Smith he brought down the attacker (Simon Lynch), to conceded a penalty in a game Morton lost 1–0 at Almondvale Stadium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7798877.stm|title=Airdrie United 1–0 Morton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 December 2008|accessdate=28 December 2008[/tpl]
Cuthbert despite playing almost every game in the 2008–2009 season, found that Morton's first contract offer to be of an unacceptable nature.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/articles/2/38998|title=Deal to keep Kevin stalls|publisher=Greenock Telegraph|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=9 May 2009|first=David|last=Christie[/tpl]
Towards the end of May, Cuthbert was tied down to a new two-year contract.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gmfc.net/News/&action=fullnews&id=183|title=Keeper signs up|publisher=gmfc.net|date=25 May 2009|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl] He was released in May 2011, after the club had secured their First Division status for the next season.
After his release, Cuthbert signed for newly promoted Ayr United, whom he had been linked with in January.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/sport/morton/articles/2011/06/14/414224--paul-we-can-compete-in-league/|title=Paul: We can compete in league|publisher=Greenock Telegraph|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=14 June 2011|first=Chris|last=Tait[/tpl]
On 1 July 2012, Cuthbert signed for Hamilton Academical on a one-year deal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonadvertiser.co.uk/hamilton-lanarkshire-sport/hamiltonaccies/2012/06/14/derby-delight-in-ramsdens-cup-51525-31177267/|title=Derby delight in Ramsdens Cup|publisher=Hamilton Advertiser|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=15 June 2012[/tpl]
