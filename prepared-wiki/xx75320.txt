Columbia Center (formerly Bank of America Tower and Columbia Seafirst Center) is the tallest skyscraper in the downtown Seattle skyline, as well as (according to real structure and number of habitable floors) the tallest building in the State of Washington. It occupies most of the block bounded by Fourth and Fifth Avenues and Cherry and Columbia Streets. At [tpl]convert|284.2|m|abbr=on[/tpl] it is currently the second tallest structure on the West Coast (after Los Angeles' 72 stories U.S. Bank Tower), when the antenna is counted as structure. It contains 76 stories of class-A office space above ground and seven stories of various use below ground, making it the building with the most stories west of the Mississippi. Construction of this building began in 1982 and finished in 1985. It was designed by Chester L. Lindsey Architects who also designed the Fourth and Blanchard Building in the Belltown neighborhood, and was built by Howard S. Wright Construction.

==Design==

Columbia Center was designed by Washington architect Chester L. Lindsey.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Chester-Lindsey-dead-at-76-Architect-changed-1122076.php |title=Chester Lindsey dead at 76: Architect changed look of Seattle's skyline |author=Susan Phinney |date=August 18, 2003 |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer[/tpl] The base of the building is clad in Rosa Purino Carnelian granite.  The building's structure is composed of three geometric concave facades with two setbacks, causing the building to appear like three towers standing side by side.
Ground level elevation on the Fifth Avenue side of the building is higher than on the Fourth Avenue side; the part of Cherry Street it faces was identified as one of the steepest streets in the Central Business District with a slope of 17.1%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/steepest.htm |title=Steep Streets in Seattle |work=Seattle Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 11, 2012[/tpl]  The tower was originally designed to be about [tpl]convert|306.5|m|abbr=on[/tpl], but federal regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would not allow it to be that tall so close to the nearby Sea-Tac Airport.  Although city land use regulations at the time were intended to limit skyscrapers to about 50 stories, the developer, Martin Selig, obtained the necessary permits for a 76-story skyscraper due to a part of the law that allowed bonus height for providing retail space with street access.  Because three separate stories could access the street on the sloped site, the developers were allowed a bonus for each of the three stories they set aside for retail, which was reportedly an unintended loophole in the law.[tpl]cite news |title=Building towers over Seattle |date=May 3, 1984 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |agency=UPI |author=Terry Finn |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8B8fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=facEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1536,1141837&dq=columbia-center+land-use+loophole&hl=en[/tpl]  There is an observation deck on the 73rd floor which offers views of Seattle and environs.  The top two floors of the building (75th and 76th) are occupied by the private Columbia Tower Club, which houses a restaurant, bar, library, and meeting rooms. An underground concourse connects the building to the nearby Seattle Municipal Tower and Bank of America Fifth Avenue Plaza.
The tower, originally proposed as Columbia Center, opened under the name Columbia Seafirst Center after its largest tenant and financier, Seafirst Bank, and then changed to the Bank of America Tower, when Seafirst, which had been owned by Bank of America since 1983, was fully integrated into Bank of America.  That name gave it the nickname "BOAT" (Bank of America Tower). In November 2005, the building's name was changed back to Columbia Center after the bank reduced its presence in the building. Bank of America still maintains office space within the building, including a bank branch.[tpl]cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002638565_columbiatower22.html |title=Region's loftiest building renamed |date=November 22, 2005 |author=Tom Boyer |newspaper=Seattle Times[/tpl]
Columbia Center plays host to the largest firefighter competition in the world.  About 1,500 firefighters from around the world yearly make the trek up 69 floors and 1,311 steps wearing their full firefighter gear.  This event benefits the local chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma society.

==History==

Martin Selig, a prominent Seattle developer, borrowed $205 million in 1981 to develop the property.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/realestate/focus-seattle-creating-an-office-empire.html?pagewanted=all |title=Creating An Office Empire |date=June 29, 1986 |author=Timothy Egan |work=The New York Times[/tpl] The Columbia Seafirst Center, as it came to be known, was constructed by Howard S.

Selig continued to own and manage the building until 1989, when financial problems forced him to sell it to Seafirst Corporation for $354 million.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-20/business/fi-194_1_martin-selig |title=Selig Undaunted After Selling His Seattle Skyscraper |date=November 20, 1989 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |author=Bill Dietrich[/tpl] Management was taken over by the Tishman West Company of Los Angeles.[tpl]cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900202&slug=1053906 |title=Tishman West To Manage Columbia Seafirst Center |date=February 2, 1990 |newspaper=Seattle Times[/tpl]
Controversy regarding the skyscraper's size contributed to the passage of a 1989 law called the Citizen's Alternative Plan (CAP) that enforced more stringent restrictions on the size of buildings in Downtown Seattle.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/realestate/national-notebook-seattle-project-tailored-to-space-limits.html |title=Project Tailored To Space Limits |date=November 26, 1989 |author=Harriet King |newspaper=The New York Times[/tpl] In 1990, after rejecting earlier plans for [tpl]convert|300|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] antennas,[tpl]cite news |title=Height plan reduced on Seattle towers |date=August 7, 1984 |agency=UPI |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oUAeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mMAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6962,3986417&dq=columbia-seafirst-center&hl=en[/tpl] Seattle and the FAA granted permission to erect two [tpl]convert|192|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] antennas on top of Columbia Center, which were expected to be used for broadcasting radio and television throughout the region.[tpl]cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900105&slug=1049301 |title=Tallest Building To Reach Higher -- City Issues Permit For Seafirst Antennas |date=January 5, 1990 |author=Robert T.

The antennas were not built before the permits expired in 1994, however.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1999/08/02/daily18.html |title=Taller antennas sought for Columbia Center |date=August 6, 1999 |newspaper=Puget Sound Business Journal[/tpl]

On July 1, 2013, the Columbia Center's observation deck, known as the Sky View, was remodeled from 270 degrees to a 360 degree viewing area. It is anticipated that the Sky View will rival the observation deck of the Space Needle.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2013/06/06/columbia-center-renovates-observatory.html?page=all | title=Columbia Center renovates observatory, views will span 360 degrees[/tpl]

===September 11th attacks===

On June 16, 2004, the 9/11 Commission reported that the original plan for the September 11, 2001, attacks called for the hijacking of ten planes, to be crashed into targets including the "tallest buildings in California and Washington State," which would have been the Columbia Center and the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles.[tpl]cite paper | author= | title=Outline of the 9-11 Plot, Staff Statement No. 16, | page=13 | format= | publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks | url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf | date=16 June 2004 | accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl]
