"Greasy Geezers" are a dance production unit based in East London whose production portfolio covers commercial urban/pop, electro dance, hip-hop and go-go (DC) remakes.  The group is composed of producers and songwriters whose backgrounds include working with Sanctuary Music Management, Trinity Records and Sacred Records.
Greasy Geezers the name originates from the actual title of a record label established in 2002 by Najero Okenabirhie (previously working for Sanctuary Music Management on accountancy projects for Iron Maiden and Bruce Dickinson). This imprint label focused predominately on garage releases. Most notable were releases presented by DJ Iron ‘Some Good Garage EP’.[tpl]cite web|title=Greasy Geezers Label Archive at HTFR |url=http://www.htfr.com/music/lt/GREASY%20GEEZERS|date=April 2003| publisher=HTFR[/tpl] As the garage scene waned the label diversified and changed their roster becoming a nu-jazz down tempo entity. Greasy Geezers adapted to the new market with releases by neo-soul and Latin house acts such as the Wah Wah Collective and Gafanhoto Lingo. The soulful diversification proved successful and the Wah Wah Collective gained notoriety in leading UK soul magazines with releases on playlists at Kiss FM (Patrick Forge), BBC Radio 1 (Giles Peterson), Smooth FM (Rosie Kendrick) and in the US with Rafe Gomez, dj/host of the nationally syndicated jazz mix show "The Groove Boutique".

==The Mid 00s==

Greasy Geezers "The Label" was disbanded in 2008 coinciding with the liquidation of Goya and Pinnacle distribution who held all stock titles by the label.  The label catalogue and copyrights were then transferred and held by new indie label I-innovate (UK) who prior to the event were a video production group.

==2009 onwards==

I-innovate (UK) in 2009 created the dance production unit called Greasy Geezers "The Dance Group" now composed of several dance producers including a team called Videoface previously from Trinity Records who gained notoriety in the soulful dance scene with the Norman Jay "Half is Mine" single (2005). In September 2010 The Wah Wah branch of the Greasy Geezers produced the single "Conceptual Love" by I-innovate artist Bada Badoo[tpl]cite web|title=The Music Critic: Bada Badoo: Conceptual Love (Single)|url=http://www.themusiccritic.co.uk/2010/09/bada-badoo-conceptual-love-single.html|date=29 September 2010| publisher=The Music Critic[/tpl] from X-factor (Season 7, ITV/SYCO UK).[tpl]cite web|title=Bada Badoo stuns 'X Factor' judges — X Factor News — TV — Digital Spy|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a276379/bada-badoo-stuns-x-factor-judges.html|date=13 September 2010| publisher=Alex Fletcher[/tpl]
