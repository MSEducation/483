[[Aegea]]

CATEGORIES: Amazons (Greek mythology)

Aegea is a back-formation from "Aegean", the sea that was named for an eponymous Aegeus in early levels of Greek mythology. The Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) mentioned an Aegea, queen of the Amazons, as an alternative eponym of the Aegean Sea. Aegea was also the name of the wife of the Roman proconsul of Achaia, whom the apostle Andrew converted and baptised, according to Jacob de Voragine's Golden Legend, De Sancto Andrea Apostolo.  "Aegea" is found in modern baby-name books and carried by some contemporary women. Aegeas name derived from the Aegean sea.
Modern Italian has the adjective Egea ("Aegean"), but Classical Latin had none. Modern botanical Latin sometimes uses the specific epithet aegea to mean "of the Aegean".
