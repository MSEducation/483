[[M45 motorway]]

CATEGORIES: Motorways in England, Transport in Warwickshire

The M45 is a motorway in Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, England and is [tpl]convert|7.9|mi|km[/tpl] long. It runs from junction 17 of the M1 motorway south east of Rugby and ends with a junction with the A45 road southwest of Rugby.  It has one of the lowest traffic volumes of the United Kingdom motorway system.

==History==

Built in 1959 when the M1 (as part of a link from London to Birmingham) went as far as Junction 18, the M45 was designed to dissipate some of the motorway traffic before the M1 terminated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/m1m10m45.htm |title=The Motorway Archive Scheme Page |publisher=Iht.org |date= |accessdate=1 January 2012[/tpl] Its equivalent at the southern end of the M1 is the former M10, which was downgraded on 1 May 2009 to become part of the A414.
As the signposted route to Birmingham, accompanied by a boom on private motor ownership in the 1960s, the M45 (and its effective continuation, the final [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] or so along the predominantly dual carriageway A45), formed a key leg of one of the busiest roads in Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m45/ |title=M45 at the motorway database |publisher=Cbrd.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 January 2012[/tpl]
In 1972, the opening of the M6 parallel to the north provided a much faster route through to the West Midlands from London. Most traffic diverted to this route, and since January 1991http://motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/en/motorways/motorway-listing/m40/m40-waterstock-j8a-to-umberslade-m42--j3a/index.cfm additional West Midlands traffic, whether to the south of that region, or from the south side of London has often used the M40 motorway parallel to the south, leaving the route with only a fraction of its previous traffic.
A limited-access junction (Eastbound exit and Westbound entry) was added in September 1991[tpl]cite web|author=Steven Jukes |url=http://www.pathetic.org.uk/current/m45/ |title=Pathetic Motorways – M45 |publisher=Pathetic.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 January 2012[/tpl] around two-thirds of the way along from the M1, south of Dunchurch, the main southern suburban village (to Rugby) nearby. Apart from this, the motorway is very much in its 'as-built' condition and unlike its feeder motorway, the M1 its land use has not expanded, in a county that has three motorways running east-west almost wholly across it, Warwickshire.  The choice of routes means that logistics operations are an important part of the economy of Coventry and Rugby.
