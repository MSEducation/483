==Biography==

===Early life===

She lived on a farm outside Carlisle as a child,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.seva.net/~smithsch/Rachel_Wall.html |title=Biography of Rachel Wall - Seva.net |publisher=www.seva.net |accessdate=2008-05-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090212204704/http://www.seva.net/~smithsch/Rachel_Wall.html |archivedate=February 12, 2009[/tpl] but was not happy there. Having become a young woman she preferred the waterfront [tpl]clarify|date=November 2010[/tpl] but she was attacked by a group of girls on the docks, and a man named George Wall came and rescued her. The two fell in love and, despite her mother's concerns, they married.

===Career as a pirate===

When George went to the sea on a fishing schooner after the newlyweds moved to Boston, Rachel took up a job as a servant. When George came back, he brought with him five sailors and their lovers, and persuaded Rachel to join them. In one week, the party had spent all their money and the schooner set sail again, upon which George suggested they all become pirates. He borrowed another schooner from a friend, and the party set sail.
Rachel and her crew worked in the Isle of Shoals, just off the New Hampshire coast. After storms Rachel would stand on the deck and scream for help. When passers-by came to give aid, they were killed and all their goods stolen. The crew was successful in capturing twelve boats, stealing $6,000 cash, an indeterminate amount of valuables, and killing twenty-four sailors, all between 1781 and 1782.

===Arrest and execution===

Eventually, after her husband and the crew washed out to sea by accident, Rachel returned to Boston and resumed her role as a servant. However, she still enjoyed going to the docks and sneaking into harboured boats, stealing things from inside. Her final robbery occurred when she saw a young woman named Margaret Bender, wearing a bonnet which Rachel coveted. She attempted to steal the bonnet and rip Margaret's tongue out, but was caught and arrested. She was tried for robbery on September 10, 1789 but requested that she be tried as a pirate, while maintaining that she had never killed anyone. However, she was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to be hanged on October 8, 1789.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.katyberry.com/Dorianne/pirates.html |title=Historical Female Pirates |publisher=Katy Berry |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] She is said to have quoted "...into the hands of the Almighty God I commit my soul, relying on his mercy...and die an unworthy member of the Presbyterian Church, in the 29th year of my age", as her final words.Piracy, Mutiny, and Murder, pages 68-76. by Edward Rowe Snow.
