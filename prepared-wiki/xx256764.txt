[[Protocol Builder]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming tools

Protocol Builder is a tool in some programming languages like C++ and C# to generate code to build protocols in a fast and reliable way. Network programming for all kinds of protocols (like TCP, UDP, SNMP ... ) includes converting data to be transferred to a raw bytes in the sending side and parsing these bytes in the receiving side. Protocol builders facilitate this stage usually by generating the code automatically.
Protocol Programming has many components to be developed, these are: server listener, server connection, client connection, packets, and loggers, most protocol builders implement these components automatically so developers save time and money.
Currently, there are two Protocol Builders in the market, one for C++ from UpRedSun which is for TCP and UDP protocols. The Second one is for .Net languages which generates the code in C# for TCP Protocols, this tool is called .Net Protocol Builder.
