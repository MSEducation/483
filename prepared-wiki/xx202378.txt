[[Flagfox]]

CATEGORIES: Mozilla add-ons

Flagfox is a Firefox extension that displays a flag icon depicting the location of the current server. It also allows users to perform geolocationing, tracerouting, translation, validation, URL shortening, and custom lookups, among other tasks. Flagfox is developed and maintained by David Garrett. The default action, Geotool, is developed and maintained by Richard van der Leeden. The IP address location database is provided by Maxmind. Flagfox can be used as a warning as to when a server is not in the country where the domain name indicates it to be.
