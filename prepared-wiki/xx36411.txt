==Structure==

The regions described as amygdala nuclei encompass several structures with distinct connectional and functional characteristics in humans and other animals.Bzdok D, Laird A, Zilles K, Fox PT, Eickhoff S.: An investigation of the structural, connectional and functional sub-specialization in the human amygdala. Human Brain Mapping, 2012. Among these nuclei are the basolateral complex, the cortical nucleus, the medial nucleus, the central nucleus, and the intercalated cell clusters (ITCs). The basolateral complex can be further subdivided into the lateral, the basal, and the accessory basal nuclei.[tpl]cite web|author=Ben Best|year=2004|title=The Amygdala and the Emotions|accessdate=15 March 2007|url=http://www.benbest.com/science/anatmind/anatmd9.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070309132748/http://www.benbest.com/science/anatmind/anatmd9.html| archivedate= 9 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Anatomically, the amygdalaSee Amygdala in the BrainInfo database and more particularly, its central and medial nuclei,
have sometimes been classified as a part of the basal ganglia.

===Hemispheric specializations===

There are functional differences between the right and left amygdala. In one study, electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions, especially fear and sadness. In contrast, stimulation of the left amygdala was able to induce either pleasant (happiness) or unpleasant (fear, anxiety, sadness) emotions.[tpl]cite journal | title=Emotion induction after direct intracerebral stimulations of human amygdala | author=Lanteaume, L. et al. | journal=Cerebral Cortex |date=Jun 2007 | volume=17 | issue=6 | pages=1307–13 | pmid=16880223 | doi=10.1093/cercor/bhl041 | first2=S. | first3=J. | first4=P. | first5=P. | first6=F.[/tpl] Other evidence suggests that the left amygdala plays a role in the brain's reward system.[tpl]cite book | title=The Human Amygdala | publisher=Guilford Press | author=Murray, Elizabeth A., et al. | chapter=Amygdala function in positive reinforcement | year=2009[/tpl]

===Sex differences===

The amygdala is one of the most well understood brain regions with regard to differences between the sexes. Larger male than female amygdalae have been demonstrated in children ages 7–11,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/6.5.726 |title=The Human Brain Age 7–11 Years: A Volumetric Analysis Based on Magnetic Resonance Images |year=1996 |last1=Caviness |first1=V.

In addition to size, other differences between men and women exist with regards to the amygdala. Subjects' amygdala activation was observed when watching a horror film. The results of the study showed a different lateralization of the amygdala in men and women. Enhanced memory for the film was related to enhanced activity of the left, but not the right, amygdala in women, whereas it was related to enhanced activity of the right, but not the left, amygdala in men.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1006/nlme.2000.3999 |title=Sex-Related Difference in Amygdala Activity during Emotionally Influenced Memory Storage |year=2001 |last1=Cahill |first1=L |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=75 |pages=1–9 |pmid=11124043 |last2=Haier |first2=RJ |last3=White |first3=NS |last4=Fallon |first4=J |last5=Kilpatrick |first5=L |last6=Lawrence |first6=C |last7=Potkin |first7=SG |last8=Alkire |first8=MT |issue=1[/tpl]
The right amygdala is also linked with taking action as well as being linked to negative emotions,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhl041 |title=Emotion Induction After Direct Intracerebral Stimulations of Human Amygdala |year=2006 |last1=Lanteaume |first1=L. |last2=Khalfa |first2=S. |last3=Régis |first3=J. |last4=Marquis |first4=P. |last5=Chauvel |first5=P. |last6=Bartolomei |first6=F. |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=1307–13 |pmid=16880223[/tpl] which may help explain why males tend to respond to emotionally stressful stimuli physically. The left amygdala allows for the recall of details, but it also results in more thought rather than action in response to emotionally stressful stimuli, which may explain the lack of physical response in women.

==Function==

===Connections===

The amygdala sends projections to the hypothalamus, the dorsomedial thalamus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and the  facial nerve, the ventral tegmental area, the locus coeruleus, and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus.
The cortical nucleus is involved in the sense of smell and pheromone-processing. It receives input from the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. The lateral amygdalae, which send impulses to the rest of the basolateral complexes and to the centromedial nuclei, receive input from the sensory systems. The centromedial nuclei are the main outputs for the basolateral complexes, and are involved in emotional arousal in rats and cats.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.119.1.202 |title=Amygdala Central Nucleus Function is Necessary for Learning, but Not Expression, of Conditioned Auditory Orienting |year=2005 |last1=Groshek |first1=Frank |last2=Kerfoot |first2=Erin |last3=McKenna |first3=Vanessa |last4=Polackwich |first4=Alan S. |last5=Gallagher |first5=Michela |last6=Holland |first6=Peter C. |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=119 |pages=202–12 |pmid=15727525 |issue=1 |pmc=1255918[/tpl]

===Emotional learning===

In complex vertebrates, including humans, the amygdalae perform primary roles in the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events. Research indicates that, during fear conditioning, sensory stimuli reach the basolateral complexes of the amygdalae, particularly the lateral nuclei, where they form associations with memories of the stimuli. The association between stimuli and the aversive events they predict may be mediated by long-term potentiation, a sustained enhancement of signaling between affected neurons.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.CHI.0000046835.90931.32 |title=Genetics of Childhood Disorders: L. Learning and Memory, Part 3: Fear Conditioning |year=2003 |last1=Ressler |first1=Kerry |last2=Davis |first2=Michael |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=612–5 |pmid=12707566[/tpl]
Memories of emotional experiences imprinted in reactions of synapses in the lateral nuclei elicit fear behavior through connections with the central nucleus of the amygdalae and the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST). The central nuclei are involved in the genesis of many fear responses such as defensive behavior (freezing or escape responses), autonomic nervous system responses (changes in blood pressure and heart rate/tachycardia), neuroendocrine responses (stress-hormone release), etc. Damage to the amygdalae impairs both the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning, a form of classical conditioning of emotional responses.
The amygdalae are also involved in appetitive (positive) conditioning. It seems that distinct neurons respond to positive and negative stimuli, but there is no clustering of these distinct neurons into clear anatomical nuclei.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04490 |title=The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning |year=2006 |last1=Paton |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Belova |first2=Marina A. |last3=Morrison |first3=Sara E. |last4=Salzman |first4=C. Daniel |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7078 |pages=865–70 |pmid=16482160 |pmc=2396495[/tpl] However, lesions of the central nucleus in the amygdala have been shown to reduce appetitive learning in rats. Lesions of the basolateral regions do not exhibit the same effect.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00960.x |title=Dissociable roles of the central and basolateral amygdala in appetitive emotional learning |year=2000 |last1=Parkinson |first1=John A. |last2=Robbins |first2=Trevor W. |last3=Everitt |first3=Barry J. |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=12 |pages=405–13 |pmid=10651899 |issue=1[/tpl] Research like this indicates that different nuclei within the amygdala have different functions in appetitive conditioning.See recent TINS article by Balleine and Killcross (2006)[tpl]vs|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Memory modulation===

The amygdala is also involved in the modulation of memory consolidation. Following any learning event, the long-term memory for the event is not formed instantaneously. Rather, information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long-term (potentially lifelong) storage over time, possibly via long-term potentiation. Recent studies suggest that, while the amygdala is not itself a long-term memory storage site, and learning can occur without it, one of its roles is to regulate memory consolidation in other brain regions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Maren  |date=Dec 1999 | title = Long-term potentiation in the amygdala: a mechanism for emotional learning and memory | url = | journal = Trends Neurosci | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 561–7 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01465-4 | pmid = 10542437 [/tpl] Also, fear conditioning, a type of memory that is impaired following amygdala damage, is mediated in part by long-term potentiation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Killcross S, Robbins T, Everitt B |title=Different types of fear-conditioned behaviour mediated by separate nuclei within amygdala |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6640 |pages=377–80 |year=1997 |pmid=9237754 |doi=10.1038/41097[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1101/lm.30901 |title=Synaptic Plasticity in the Lateral Amygdala: A Cellular Hypothesis of Fear Conditioning |year=2001 |last1=Blair |first1=H. T. |journal=Learning & Memory |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=229[/tpl]
During the consolidation period, the memory can be modulated. In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person's retention of that event. Experiments have shown that administration of stress hormones to mice immediately after they learn something enhances their retention when they are tested two days later."Researchers Prove A Single Memory Is Processed In Three Separate Parts Of The Brain" http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060202182107.htm
The amygdala, especially the basolateral nuclei, are involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event, as shown by many laboratories including that of James McGaugh. These laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning tasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animals' subsequent retention of the task. These tasks include basic classical conditioning tasks such as inhibitory avoidance, where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze, where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water. If a drug that activates the amygdalae is injected into the amygdalae, the animals had better memory for the training in the task.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ferry B, Roozendaal B, McGaugh J |title=Role of norepinephrine in mediating stress hormone regulation of long-term memory storage: a critical involvement of the amygdala |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1140–52 |year=1999 |pmid=10560021 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(99)00157-2[/tpl] If a drug that inactivates the amygdalae is injected, the animals had impaired memory for the task.
Buddhist monks who do compassion meditation have been shown to modulate their amygdala, along with their temporoparietal junction and insula, during their practice."Cultivating compassion: Neuroscientific and behavioral approaches" a talk given by Richard J. Davidson found online at http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/25 In an fMRI study, more intensive insula activity was found in expert meditators than in novices.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001897 |title=Regulation of the Neural Circuitry of Emotion by Compassion Meditation: Effects of Meditative Expertise |year=2008 |editor1-last=Baune |editor1-first=Bernhard |last1=Lutz |first1=Antoine |last2=Brefczynski-Lewis |first2=Julie |last3=Johnstone |first3=Tom |last4=Davidson |first4=Richard J. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e1897 |pmid=18365029 |pmc=2267490[/tpl] Increased activity in the amygdala following compassion-oriented meditation may contribute to social connectedness.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0013237 |title=Loving-kindness meditation increases social connectedness |year=2008 |last1=Hutcherson |first1=Cendri A. |last2=Seppala |first2=Emma M. |last3=Gross |first3=James J. |journal=Emotion |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=720–4 |pmid=18837623[/tpl]
Amygdala activity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information. However, this correlation depends on the relative "emotionalness" of the information. More emotionally-arousing information increases amygdalar activity, and that activity correlates with retention. Amygdala neurons show various types of oscillation during emotional arousal, such as theta activity. These synchronized neuronal events could promote synaptic plasticity (which is involved in memory retention) by increasing interactions between neocortical storage sites and temporal lobe structures involved in declarative memory.[tpl]cite journal | author = Paré D., Collins D.R., Pelletier J.G. | year = 2002 | title = Amygdala oscillations and the consolidation of emotional memories | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 7| pages = 306–314 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01924-1 | pmid = 12110364 [/tpl]
Research using Rorschach test blot 03 finds that the number of unique responses to this random figure links to larger sized amygdalae. The researchers note, "Since previous reports have indicated that unique responses were observed at higher frequency in the artistic population than in the nonartistic normal population, this positive correlation suggests that amygdalar enlargement in the normal population might be related to creative mental activity."[tpl]cite journal | author = Asari T, Konishi S, Jimura K, Chikazoe J, Nakamura N, Miyashita Y | year = 2010 | title = Amygdalar enlargement associated with unique perception | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 94–99 | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.08.001 | pmid = 18922517 [/tpl]

==Neuropsychological correlates of amygdala activity==

Early  research on primates provided explanations as to the functions of the amygdala, as well as a basis for further research. As early as 1888, rhesus monkeys with a lesioned temporal cortex (including the amygdala) were observed to have significant social and emotional deficits.[tpl]cite journal| author =Brown, S. & Shafer, E.| year =1888| title = An investigation into the functions of the occipital and temporal lobes of the monkey's brain| journal =Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume =179 | pages =303–327| doi = 10.1098/rstb.1888.0011[/tpl] Heinrich Klüver and Paul Bucy later expanded upon this same observation by showing that large lesions to the anterior temporal lobe produced noticeable changes, including overreaction to all objects, hypoemotionality, loss of fear, hypersexuality, and hyperorality, a condition in which inappropriate objects are placed in the mouth. Some monkeys also displayed an inability to recognize familiar objects and would approach animate and inanimate objects indiscriminately, exhibiting a loss of fear towards the experimenters. This behavioral disorder was later named Klüver-Bucy syndrome accordingly,[tpl]cite journal| author =Kluver, H. & Bucy, P.| year =1939| title = Preliminary analysis of function of the temporal lobe in monkeys| journal =Archives of Neurology | volume =42 | pages =979–1000| doi =10.1001/archneurpsyc.1939.02270240017001| issue =6[/tpl] and later research proved it was specifically due to amygdala lesions. Monkey mothers who had amygdala damage showed a reduction in maternal behaviors towards their infants, often physically abusing or neglecting them.[tpl]cite journal| author =Bucher, K., Myersn, R., Southwick, C.| year =1970| title = Anterior temporal cortex and maternal behaviour in monkey| journal =Neurology | volume =20| issue =4 | pages =415 | pmid = 4998075 [/tpl] In 1981, researchers found that selective radio frequency lesions of the whole amygdala caused Klüver-Bucy Syndrome.[tpl]cite journal| author =Aggleton, JP. & Passingham, RE.| year =1981| title = Syndrome produced by lesions of the amygdala in monkeys (Macaca mulatta)| journal =Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume =95 | pages =961–977| doi =10.1037/h0077848| pmid =7320283| issue =6[/tpl]
With advances in neuroimaging technology such as MRI, neuroscientists have made significant findings concerning the amygdala in the human brain. A variety of data shows the amygdala has a substantial role in mental states, and is related to many psychological disorders. Some studies have shown children with anxiety disorders tend to have a smaller left amygdala. In the majority of the cases, there was an association between an increase in the size of the left amygdala with the use of SSRI's (antidepressant medication) or psychotherapy. The left amygdala has been linked to social anxiety, obsessive and compulsive disorders, and post traumatic stress, as well as more broadly to separation and general anxiety.http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/40/9/37.full[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]full|date=September 2013[/tpl] In a 2003 study, subjects with borderline personality disorder showed significantly greater left amygdala activity than normal control subjects. Some borderline patients even had difficulties classifying neutral faces or saw them as threatening.[tpl]cite journal| author =Donegan et al.| year =2003| title = Amygdala hyperreactivity in borderline personality disorder: implications for emotional dysregulation| journal =Biological Psychiatry | volume =54 | issue=11 | pages =1284–1293| doi =10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00636-X| pmid =14643096| last2 =Sanislow| first2 =CA| last3 =Blumberg| first3 =HP| last4 =Fulbright| first4 =RK| last5 =Lacadie| first5 =C| last6 =Skudlarski| first6 =P| last7 =Gore| first7 =JC| last8 =Olson| first8 =IR| last9 =McGlashan| first9 =TH |displayauthors=9| first10 =Bruce E[/tpl] Individuals with psychopathy show reduced autonomic responses, relative to comparison individuals, to instructed fear cues.[tpl]Cite journal|author=R.

Patients with more severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased response in the amygdala.Studying Brain Activity Could Aid Diagnosis Of Social Phobia. Monash University. 19 January 2006. Similarly, depressed patients showed exaggerated left amygdala activity when interpreting emotions for all faces, and especially for fearful faces. Interestingly, this hyperactivity was normalized when patients were administered antidepressant medication.[tpl]cite journal| author =Sheline et al.| year =2001| title = Increased amygdala response to masked emotional faces in depressed subjects resolves with antidepressant treatment: an fMRI study| journal =Biological Psychiatry | volume =50 | issue=9 | pages =651–658| doi =10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01263-X| pmid =11704071| last2 =Barch| first2 =DM| last3 =Donnelly| first3 =JM| last4 =Ollinger| first4 =JM| last5 =Snyder| first5 =AZ| last6 =Mintun| first6 =MA[/tpl] By contrast, the amygdala has been observed to respond differently in people with bipolar disorder.

Studies in 2004 and 2006 showed that normal subjects exposed to images of frightened faces or faces of people from another race will show increased activity of the amygdala, even if that exposure is subliminal.Brain Activity Reflects Complexity Of Responses To Other-race Faces, Science Daily, 14 December 2004 However, the amygdala is not necessary for the processing of fear-related stimuli, since persons in whom it is bilaterally damaged show rapid reactions to fearful faces, even in the absence of a functional amygdala.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tsuchiya N, Moradi F, Felsen C, Yamazaki M, Adolphs R | year = 2009 | title = Intact rapid detection of fearful faces in the absence of the amygdala | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 10| pages = 1224–12225 | pmid = 19718036 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2380 | pmc = 2756300 [/tpl]
Recent research suggests that parasites, in particular toxoplasma, form cysts in the brain of rats, often taking up residence in the amygdala. This may provide clues as to how specific parasites may contribute to the development of disorders, including paranoia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vyas et al. |title=Behavioral changes induced by Toxoplasma infection of rodents are highly specific to aversion of cat odors |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104 |issue=15 |pages=6442–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17404235 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608310104 |last2=Kim |first2=SK |last3=Giacomini |first3=N |last4=Boothroyd |first4=JC |last5=Sapolsky |first5=RM |pmc=1851063[/tpl]

===Sexual orientation===

Recent studies have suggested possible correlations between brain structure, including differences in hemispheric ratios and connection patterns in the amygdala, and sexual orientation. Homosexual men tend to exhibit more female-like patterns in the amygdala than  heterosexual males do, just as homosexual females tend to show more male-like patterns in the amygdala than heterosexual women do. It was observed that amygdala connections were more widespread from the left amygdala in homosexual males, as is also found in heterosexual females. Amygdala connections were more widespread from the right amygdala in homosexual females, as in heterosexual males. Current evidence suggests that formation of an individual's sexual orientation occurs during fetal and neonatal development.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0805542105 |title=Sexual orientation and its basis in brain structure and function |year=2008 |last1=Swaab |first1=D.

===Social interaction===

Amygdala volume correlates positively with both the size (the number of contacts a person has) and the complexity (the number of different groups to which a person belongs) of social networks.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2724 |title=Amygdala volume and social network size in humans |year=2010 |last1=Bickart |first1=Kevin C |last2=Wright |first2=Christopher I |last3=Dautoff |first3=Rebecca J |last4=Dickerson |first4=Bradford C |last5=Barrett |first5=Lisa Feldman |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=163–4 |pmid=21186358 |pmc=3079404[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/28/how-to-win-friends-have-a-big-amygdala/?xid=rss-topstories|title=How to Win Friends: Have a Big Amygdala?|work=Time|first=Maia|last=Szalavitz|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl] Individuals with larger amygdalae had larger and more complex social networks. They were also better able to make accurate social judgments about other persons' faces.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0287-4 |title=ALE meta-analysis on facial judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness |year=2010 |last1=Bzdok |first1=D. |last2=Langner |first2=R. |last3=Caspers |first3=S. |last4=Kurth |first4=F. |last5=Habel |first5=U. |last6=Zilles |first6=K. |last7=Laird |first7=A. |last8=Eickhoff |first8=Simon B. |journal=Brain Structure and Function |volume=215 |issue=3–4 |pages=209–23 |pmid=20978908[/tpl] It is hypothesized that larger amygdalae allow for greater emotional intelligence, enabling greater societal integration and cooperation with others.Buchanan, T.W., Tranel, D. & Adolphs, R. in The Human Amygdala (eds. Whalen, P.J. & Phelps, E.A.) 289–318 (Guilford, New York, 2009).
The amygdala processes reactions to violations concerning personal space. These reactions are absent in persons in whom the amygdala is damaged bilaterally.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kennedy DP, Gläscher J, Tyszka JM, Adolphs R | year = 2009 | title = Personal space regulation by the human amygdala | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 10| pages = 1226–1227 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2381 | pmid = 19718035 | pmc = 2753689 [/tpl] Furthermore, the amygdala is found to be activated in fMRI when people observe that others are physically close to them, such as when a person being scanned knows that an experimenter is standing immediately next to the scanner, versus standing at a distance.

===Aggression===

Animal studies have shown that stimulating the amygdala appears to increase both sexual and aggressive behavior. Likewise, studies using brain lesions have shown that harm to the amygdala may produce the opposite effect. Thus, it appears that this part of the brain may play a role in the display and modulation of aggression.T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 4: The Nervous System." pp 61 http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH04.pdf

===Fear===

There are cases of human patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesions, due to the rare genetic condition Urbach-Wiethe disease.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.042 |title=The Human Amygdala and the Induction and Experience of Fear |year=2011 |last1=Feinstein |first1=Justin S. |last2=Adolphs |first2=Ralph |last3=Damasio |first3=Antonio |last4=Tranel |first4=Daniel |journal=Current Biology |volume=21 |pages=34–8 |pmid=21167712 |issue=1 |pmc=3030206[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1159/000028653[/tpl] Such patients fail to exhibit fear-related behaviors, leading one to be dubbed the "woman with no fear". This finding reinforces the conclusion that the amygdala "plays a pivotal role in triggering a state of fear".http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2013/02/extreme-fear-experienced-without.html[tpl]full|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Alcoholism and binge drinking===

The amygdala appears to play a role in binge drinking, being damaged by repeated episodes of intoxication and withdrawal.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0097 |title=Cognitive and emotional consequences of binge drinking: Role of amygdala and prefrontal cortex |year=2008 |last1=Stephens |first1=D. N |last2=Duka |first2=T. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=363 |issue=1507 |pages=3169–79 |pmid=18640918 |pmc=2607328[/tpl] Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing, including the amygdala.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01026.x |title=Alcoholism and Dampened Temporal Limbic Activation to Emotional Faces |year=2009 |last1=Marinkovic |first1=Ksenija |last2=Oscar-Berman |first2=Marlene |last3=Urban |first3=Trinity |last4=o’Reilly |first4=Cara E. |last5=Howard |first5=Julie A. |last6=Sawyer |first6=Kayle |last7=Harris |first7=Gordon J. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1880–92 |pmid=19673745 |pmc=3543694[/tpl] Protein kinase C-epsilon in the amygdala is important for regulating behavioral responses to morphine, ethanol, and controlling anxiety-like behavior. The protein is involved in controlling the function of other proteins and plays a role in development of the ability to consume a large amount of ethanol.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.phrs.2007.04.008 |title=Protein kinase C and alcohol addiction |year=2007 |last1=Newton |first1=P |last2=Ron |first2=D |journal=Pharmacological Research |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=570–7 |pmid=17566760[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183X.2009.00485.x |title=Amygdala protein kinase C epsilon controls alcohol consumption |year=2009 |last1=Lesscher |first1=H.

M. |journal=Genes, Brain and Behavior |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=493–9 |pmid=19243450 |pmc=2714877[/tpl]

===Anxiety===

There may also be a link between the amygdala and anxiety.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Irina |last1=Ziabreva |first2=Gerd |last2=Poeggel |first3=Reinhild |last3=Schnabel |first4=Katharina |last4=Braun |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=12832558 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12832558 |year=2003 |title=Separation-induced receptor changes in the hippocampus and amygdala of Octodon degus: Influence of maternal vocalizations |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=5329–36[/tpl] In particular, there is a higher prevalence of females that are affected by anxiety disorders. In an experiment, degu pups were removed from their mother but allowed to hear her call. In response, the males produced increased serotonin receptors in the amygdala but females lost them. This led to the males being less affected by the stressful situation.
