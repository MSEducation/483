[[Space Marines (wargame)]]

CATEGORIES: Miniatures games, Fantasy Games Unlimited games

Space Marines is a science fiction miniatures wargame created by A. Mark Ratner. There were two editions. The first was published by FanTac Games (1977) and the second by Fantasy Games Unlimited (1980). Both versions include artwork by David C. Sutherland III.
The FanTac version of the game included conversion rules for the original Dungeons & Dragons and Metamorphosis Alpha. These were later removed in the FGU edition.
Stan Johansen created a line of 25mm figures for Space Marines, some of which are still in production as of 2011.
The Space Marines universe became the background to FGU's Space Opera role-playing game.
