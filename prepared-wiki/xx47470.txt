The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series spin-off of The Flintstones produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, which ran for 16 half-hour episodes from September 11, 1971, to September 2, 1972, and four 8-minute episodes (as part of The Flintstone Comedy Hour) from September 9, 1972, to September 1, 1973, on CBS.

==Synopsis==

The show followed neighbors Pebbles Flintstone (voiced by Sally Struthers and in Season 2 by Mickey Stevens) and Bamm-Bamm Rubble (voiced by Jay North) as teen sweethearts.[tpl]cite news|title= The Flintstones turns 50: The five dumbest moments|work= Christian Monitor |date=|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2010/0930/The-Flintstones-turns-50-The-five-dumbest-moments/The-Pebbles-and-Bamm-Bamm-Show|accessdate=2010-10-01[/tpl] The episodes were set mainly in the duo's activities at Bedrock High School in the prehistoric town of Bedrock with their friends Moonrock (the school genius and resident inventor), Penny (a slightly overweight girl obsessed with being thin) and Wiggy (who planned her day according to what it said in the daily horoscope). Also featured were Cindy (Pebbles's rival) and Cindy's boyfriend, Fabian, Bad Luck Schleprock (whose favorite catchphrase was, "Oh wowsie wowsie woo woo.  Miserable day, isn't it?"), and a motorcycle gang called the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub, and Zonk). Bronto's favorite catchphrase was, "Wait for your leader, you dummies!" (said whenever his gang took off without him), and their favorite hangout was a diner called Brontoburgers. Pebbles' parents, Fred and Wilma Flintstone, and Bamm-Bamm's parents, Barney and Betty Rubble, were all supporting characters rather than main characters, since the show focused on their children.
A running gag that occurred throughout the run of the series was whenever Pebbles came up with an idea (good or not-so-good), she would say, "Yabba Dabba Dooozie!" (a play on her father's, "Yabba Dabba Doo!" from the earlier series) and Bamm Bamm would become exasperated with Pebbles' "crazy hare-brained schemes".  Among Bamm Bamm's favorite catchphrases was, "Oh no!  She's got that look in her eye!" or "Oh brother." (said whenever Pebbles came up with one of her nutty ideas). The series was produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, animation directed by Charles A. Nichols, and written by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears (the show's story editors), Neal Barbera, Walter Black, Larz Bourne, Tom Dagenais, Bob Ogle, Larry Rhine, Richard Robbins. The music was composed by Hoyt Curtin. A second season of four new 8-minute episodes aired as part of The Flintstone Comedy Hour in 1972; episodes from both seasons were later featured as segments on the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends in 1977.
In the late 1980s, repeats were shown on USA Cartoon Express and later resurfaced on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.
