==History==

The station was originally an adult contemporary station aimed at Hammond with the name "Star 107.1" . The station changed format sometime during its former ownership by Guaranty Broadcasting to its current country music format. It assumed the slogan of former Hammond country station WKJN which was flipped by its owners to ultimately another format under the current callsign of WRQQ
