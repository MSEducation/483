The Ştefan Gheorghiu Academy  (Romanian: Academia Ştefan Gheorghiu, in full: Academia de învăţămînt social-politic Ştefan Gheorghiu de pe lîngă CC al PCR - approx.

It was established as Universitatea Muncitorească a PCR (PCR Workers' University) and began functioning on March 21, 1945 in Bucharest, apparently on Ana Pauker's initiative. Its first leaders were rector Barbu Lăzăreanu, a literature professor, and secretary Constantin Ionescu-Gulian, a Stalinist philosopher. The name Ştefan Gheorghiu was added on February 10, 1946, in memory of an early 20th-century Romanian social-democrat.
Another school with much the same purpose, Şcoala Superioară de Ştiinţe Sociale  A. A. Jdanov (A. A. Jdanov Upper School of Social Sciences), was created separately; the two eventually merged.
The Ştefan Gheorghiu Academy was dissolved after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.
