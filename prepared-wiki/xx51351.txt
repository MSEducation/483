The shortwings are colourful medium-sized mostly insectivorous birds in the genus Brachypteryx of the thrush family Turdidae, although some taxonomists place them in the Old World Flycatcher family Muscicapidae. They show strong sexual plumage dimorphism. All are southeast Asian species.
Most shortwings are place in the genus Brachypteryx.
Two other species, formerly placed in Brachypteryx, are now in two other genera.
