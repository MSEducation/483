In 2004, New York's then-PaceWildenstein gallery suggested that his "place in the history of French painting has still not been properly assessed".[tpl]cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/index.html|publisher=Wildenstein|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl]

==Family and early years==

Vollon was born the son of an ornamental craftsman in Lyon, France.  He taught himself to paint. He began an apprenticeship to an engraver, and studied under Jehan Georges Vibert at the École des Beaux-Arts in Lyon to become a printmaker. He then worked at decorating enamelled pans and stoves. In 1860 he and Marie-Fanny Boucher married and later had two children, Alexis and Marguerite.[tpl]cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/index.html|publisher=Wildenstein|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl]

==Paris and becoming a painter==

In 1859 he moved to Paris, with the intention of becoming a painter. There he became a student of Théodule Ribot and was influenced by Dutch still life painters of the 17th century. He became friends with Alexandre Dumas, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Honoré Daumier and Charles-François Daubigny. Vollon once described himself as a young artist "madly in love with painting".

==Figures and still lifes==

He aspired to paint figures and not only still lifes which were the lowest acceptable genre for the Salon. Along the way, Vollon submitted a figure painting of a woman carrying a large basket on her back, Femme du Pollet à Dieppe (Seine-Inferieure), to the 1876 Salon, where it won first prize[tpl]cite web|title=Treasure Trove Gems from the collection|url=http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/index.php?id=031695&langId=en|publisher=Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|accessdate=January 4, 2010[/tpl] and received universally great reviews. Except Édouard Manet unleashed a few words, in [tpl]lang-en|Bah! What is Vollon's Femme? A basket that walks[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-fr|Bah! . . . qu'est-ce que la Femme de Vollon? un panier qui marche[/tpl]) which stigmatized it. According to Carol Forman Tabler, curator and professor of art who wrote her dissertation on Vollon,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/autumn_02/articles/tabl_bio.html|title=Carol Forman Tabler|publisher=Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide|date=Autumn 2002|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl] writing for Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide:

==Later years and awards==

Carol Forman Tabler wrote:
Tabler describes his ambition and the decades-long strategies Vollon used to secure a place in history. After one year in the Salon des Refusés in 1863, beginning in 1864 he exhibited his work at the Paris Salon. Vollon won a third-class medal in 1865, a second-class in 1868, and first-class in 1869. Vollon was a member of the Salon's jury for at least ten years starting in 1870.[tpl]cite journal|author=Tabler, Carol Forman|title=Antoine Vollon and His Smashing Pumpkin: On Media Hype and the Meanings of Still Life|url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/index.php/autumn02/255-antoine-vollon-and-his-smashing-pumpkin-on-media-hype-and-the-meanings-of-still-life|date=Autumn 2002|issue=2|volume=1|journal=Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide|accessdate=January 1, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101213081842/http://19thc-artworldwide.org/index.php/autumn02/255-antoine-vollon-and-his-smashing-pumpkin-on-media-hype-and-the-meanings-of-still-life| archivedate= 13 December 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1870 and eight years later, received the Officer's cross.[tpl]cite book|title=Illustrated catalogue of the notable paintings|author=Griscom, Clement A.|year=1914|publisher=American Art Association via Google Books|page=37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VGAoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT37[/tpl] He was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1897. In 1900 he was awarded the Grand Prix at the Paris World's Fair.
In July 1900 he had a stroke while painting at Versailles and later caught a fever. He died in August and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Wildenstein showed more than 70 works by Vollon in Manhattan in 2004. For The New York Times, a reviewer wrote, "Vollon smacks too much of other artists to be Truly Important, but his sensuous wallows in paint are well worth wider notice". But an earlier reviewer for the same newspaper quotes a critic writing in 1883, "He is, perhaps, the greatest painter living...."[tpl]cite news|author=Russell, John|title=Art: 'Liberty' Echoes 1883 Show|date=July 11, 1986|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/arts/art-liberty-echoes-1883-show.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl]
