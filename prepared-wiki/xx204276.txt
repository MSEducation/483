At the age of twenty two, Stuart played the Berkeley Folk Festival in 1964. She was then invited back by creator/producer Barry Olivier to perform in 1966, and 1970. It was there that she formed a friendship with Mississippi John Hurt, which led to the two touring together.  
Billboard magazine reviewed her debut release in 1964 with: "A beautiful new female voice is now on the folk horizon. Its owner's name is Alice Stuart. She sings with a clean freshness that is exciting in its simplicity. A folk find!"
In 1964, she met with musician Frank Zappa at a coffeehouse in Santa Monica, California, by chance as they both were waiting to meet the same person, guitarist Steve Mann. She became a member of Zappa's band, The Mothers of Invention, which at the time was blues band. Zappa wanted to incorporate Stuarts acoustic delta style with his electric leads.      However she left before they made their debut album Freak Out! and did not make any recordings with the group.[tpl]cite web|title=Alice Stuart Interview|url=http://www.guitarhoo.com/interviews/alice-stuart-70|work=Guitarhoo!|publisher=Guitarhoo.com|accessdate=March 7, 2013|date=May 14, 2004[/tpl] Zappa reportedly fired her from the band because she could not play "Louie Louie".
