The South Russian Government ([tpl]lang-ru|Южнорусское Правительство[/tpl][tpl]ru icon[/tpl] «Южнорусское правительство» Xронос: Историческая Энциклопедия. ("South Russian Government". Chronos: Historical Encyclopedia.) Retrieved 20 April 2011.) was a Russian White movement government established by Armed Forces of South Russia commander Anton Denikin in Novorossiysk, Kuban, in March 1920 during the Russian Civil War.
On 27 March 1920, Denikin was forced to evacuate Novorossiysk for Crimea, which the Whites had controlled since June 1919.  However, the slipshod retreat discredited Denikin and he stepped down, succeeded by General Pyotr Wrangel, who was elected new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army by military council.  The South Russian Government was dissolved on 30 March in Feodosiya. Wrangel set up a new Government of South Russia in Sevastopol in April.
This attempted establishment of civil government by the White authorities was a recognition that previous neglect of civil administration by the General Command of the Armed Forces of South Russia had cost the Whites civilian support.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
