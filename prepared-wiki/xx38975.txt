[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]]

CATEGORIES: Grammarians of Latin, Virgil, Aeneid, Late Antique Latin-language writers, 4th-century writers

Maurus Servius Honoratus was a late fourth-century and early fifth-century grammarian, with the contemporary reputation of being the most learned man of his generation in Italy; he was the author of a set of commentaries on the works of Virgil.  These works, In tria Virgilii Opera Expositio, constituted the first incunable to be printed at Florence, by Bernardo Cennini, 1471.
In the Saturnalia of Macrobius, Servius appears as one of the interlocutors; allusions in that work and a letter from Symmachus to Servius indicate that he was not a convert to Christianity.

==Commentary on Virgil==

The commentary on Virgil has survived in two distinct manuscript traditions.[ref]The manuscript tradition is examined by Charles E. Murgia, Prolegomena to Servius 5: the manuscripts (University of California  Classical Studies 11)
