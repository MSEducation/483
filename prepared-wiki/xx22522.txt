===Surface anatomy of the thorax===

Knowledge of the surface anatomy of the thorax (chest) is particularly important because it is one of the areas most frequently subjected to physical examination, like auscultation and percussion.Drake (2009) Ch.3 Thorax - Thorax surface anatomy, pp.Â 224-6 and Fig. 3.96 A Human female breasts are located on the anterior chest wall, most frequently between the second and sixth rib.
