==Knockout stage==

The first four teams in each Preliminary Round pool advanced to the quarterfinals, eight teams in total. The format was as follows: 
A1 vs. B4 (first place in pool A vs. fourth place in pool B) 
B1 vs. A4 
A drawing of lots determined the pairings among A2/A3 and B2/B3. The purpose of this drawing was to prevent a second-place team in a pool from deliberately losing the last game in pool play in order to select an "easier" opponent (in the sense of matchups) in the quarterfinals.
Based on a drawing of lots after the group stage, the United States faced and defeated Italy, while China drew and won against Russia in their quarterfinal matches.http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/volleyball/n214557321.shtml The other quarterfinal match-ups were determined by the pool standings.
