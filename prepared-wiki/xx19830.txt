In computer science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a hierarchy of concepts within a domain, using a shared vocabulary to denote the types, properties and interrelationships of those concepts.[tpl]cite journal |first=Thomas R. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |date=June 1993 |url=http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf |format=PDF |title=A translation approach to portable ontology specifications |journal=Knowledge Acquisition |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1006/knac.1993.1008[/tpl]
Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in artificial intelligence, the Semantic Web, systems engineering, software engineering, biomedical informatics, library science, enterprise bookmarking, and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an enterprise architecture framework.

==Overview==

The term ontology has its origin in philosophy and has been applied in many different ways. The word element onto- comes from the Greek ὤν, ὄντος, ("being", "that which is"), present participle of the verb εἰμί ("be"). The core meaning within computer science is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. There is also generally an expectation that the features of the model in an ontology should closely resemble the real world (related to the object).[tpl]cite web |first=L.

What many ontologies have in common in both computer science and in philosophy is the representation of entities, ideas, and events, along with their properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontological relativity (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning whether a normative ontology is viable (e.g., debates over foundationalism in philosophy, and over the Cyc project in AI). Differences between the two are largely matters of focus. Computer scientists are more concerned with establishing fixed, controlled vocabularies, while philosophers are more concerned in first principles, such as whether there are such things as fixed essences or whether entities must be ontologically more primary than processes.
Other fields make ontological assumptions that are sometimes explicitly elaborated and explored.  For instance, the definition and ontology of economics (also sometimes called the political economy) is hotly debated especially in Marxist economics[tpl]cite web|author=Giulio Palermo* |url=http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/539.short |title=The ontology of economic power in capitalism: mainstream economics and Marx |publisher=Cje.oxfordjournals.org |date=2007-01-10 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] where it is a primary concern, but also in other subfields.[tpl]cite web|author=Zuniga, Gloria L. |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/5566.html |title=An Ontology Of Economic Objects |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date=1999-02-02 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl]  Such concerns intersect with those of information science when a simulation or model is intended to enable decisions in the economic realm; for example, to determine what capital assets are at risk and if so by how much (see risk management).  Some claim all social sciences have explicit ontology issues because they do not have hard falsifiability criteria like most models in physical sciences and that indeed the lack of such widely accepted hard falsification criteria is what defines a social or soft science.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

==History==

Historically, ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, which deals with the nature of reality – of what exists. This fundamental branch is concerned with analyzing various types or modes of existence, often with special attention to the relations between particulars and universals, between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, and between essence and existence. The traditional goal of ontological inquiry in particular is to divide the world "at its joints" to discover those fundamental categories or kinds into which the world’s objects naturally fall.[tpl]cite web |first1=Perakath C. |last1=Benjamin |first2=Christopher P. |last2=Menzel |first3=Richard J. |last3=Mayer |first4=Florence |last4=Fillion |first5=Michael T. |last5=Futrell |first6=Paula S. |last6=deWitte |first7=Madhavi |last7=Lingineni |date=September 21, 1994 |url=http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf |format=PDF |title=IDEF5 Method Report |publisher=Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.[/tpl]
During the second half of the 20th century, philosophers extensively debated the possible methods or approaches to building ontologies without actually building any very elaborate ontologies themselves. By contrast, computer scientists were building some large and robust ontologies, such as WordNet and Cyc, with comparatively little debate over how they were built.
Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have recognized that capturing knowledge is the key to building large and powerful AI systems.  AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.[tpl]cite book |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |year=2008 |url=http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontology-definition-2007.htm  |title=Ontology |work=Encyclopedia of Database Systems |editor1-first=Ling |editor1-last=Liu |editor2-first=M. Tamer |editor2-last=Özsu |publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-49616-0[/tpl]
In the early 1990s, the widely cited Web page and paper "Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing" by Tom Gruber[tpl]cite journal |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |title=Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |volume=43 |issue=5-6 |pages=907–928 |year=1995 |doi=10.1006/ijhc.1995.1081[/tpl] is credited with a deliberate definition of ontology as a technical term in computer science. Gruber introduced the term to mean a specification of a conceptualization:  An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy.[tpl]cite web |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |year=2001 |url=http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html |title=What is an Ontology? |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2009-11-09[/tpl] 
According to Gruber (1993):  Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions — that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world. To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.

==Components==

Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed.  As mentioned above, most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes, and relations.  In this section each of these components is discussed in turn.
Common components of ontologies include:
Ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages.

==Types==

===Domain ontology===

A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to part of the world. Particular meanings of terms applied to that domain are provided by domain ontology. For example the word card has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the "playing card" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the "punched card" and "video card" meanings.
Since domain ontologies represent concepts in very specific and often eclectic ways, they are often incompatible. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies into a more general representation.  This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.).
At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common foundation ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same foundation ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology elements can be merged automatically. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies,[tpl]cite web |url=http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/dor/ |title=Project: Dynamic Ontology Repair |publisher= University of Edinburgh Department of Informatics|accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl] but this area of research is still largely theoretical.

===Upper ontology===

An upper ontology (or foundation ontology) is a model of the common objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It usually employs a core glossary that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain sets.
There are several standardized upper ontologies available for use, including BFO, Dublin Core, GFO, OpenCyc/ResearchCyc, SUMO, the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO),[tpl]cite web|last=Giancarlo Guizzardi & Gerd Wagner|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-125/paper2.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2014|title=A Unified Foundational Ontology and some Applications of it in Business Modeling[/tpl] and DOLCE.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.loa-cnr.it/DOLCE.html |title=Laboratory for Applied Ontology - DOLCE |publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|accessdate=10 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl |title=OWL version of DOLCE+DnS  |publisher=Semantic Technology Lab|accessdate=21 February 2013[/tpl] WordNet, while considered an upper ontology by some, is not strictly an ontology. However, it has been employed as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Roberto |last1=Navigli |authorlink1=Roberto Navigli |first2=Paola |last2=Velardi |authorlink2=Paola Velardi |year=2004 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120104323093276 |format=PDF |title=Learning Domain Ontologies from Document Warehouses and Dedicated Web Sites |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=MIT Press |pages=151–179 |doi=10.1162/089120104323093276[/tpl]

===Hybrid ontology===

The Gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology.

==Engineering==

Ontology engineering (or ontology building) is a subfield of knowledge engineering. It studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them.[tpl]cite book |first1=Ascunion |last1=Gómez-Pérez |authorlink1=Ascunion Gómez-Pérez |first2=Mariano |last2=Fernández-López |authorlink2=Mariano Fernández-López |first3=Oscar |last3=Corcho |authorlink3=Oscar Corcho |year=2004 |title=Ontological Engineering: With Examples from the Areas of Knowledge Management, E-commerce and the Semantic Web |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-85233-551-9 |page=403 |edition=1 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first1=Antonio |last1=De Nicola |authorlink1=Antonio De Nicola |first2=Michele |last2=Missikoff |authorlink2=Michele Missikoff |first3=Roberto |last3=Navigli |authorlink3=Roberto Navigli |year=2009 |url=http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/De_Nicola_Missikoff_Navigli_2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Software Engineering Approach to Ontology Building |journal=Information Systems |volume=34 |issue=2 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=258–275 | doi = 10.1016/j.is.2008.07.002 [/tpl]
Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained within software applications, and within enterprises and business procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction towards solving the interoperability problems brought about by semantic obstacles, such as the obstacles related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Ontology engineering is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Line  |last1=Pouchard |authorlink1=Line Pouchard |first2=Nenad |last2=Ivezic |authorlink2=Nenad Ivezic |first3=Craig |last3=Schlenoff |authorlink3=Craig Schlenoff |year=2000 |url=http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AISfinal2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ontology Engineering for Distributed Collaboration in Manufacturing |work=Proceedings of the AIS2000 conference |month=March[/tpl]

===Learning===

Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.

==Languages==

An ontology language is a formal language used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:

==Published examples==

|publisher=Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science (IFOMIS) |accessdate=}}[/ref] a formal upper ontology designed to support scientific research
|work=Sourceforge |accessdate=10 February 2011}}[/ref] designed to facilitate the mapping of diseases and associated conditions to particular medical codes
|title=Foundational, Core and Linguistic Ontologies |accessdate=10 February 2011}}[/ref]
The W3C Linking Open Data Community Project coordinates attempts to converge different ontologies into worldwide Data Web.

==Libraries==

The development of ontologies for the Web has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies with search facility. Such directories have been called ontology libraries.
The following are libraries of human-selected ontologies.
|url=http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Protege_Ontology_Library |title=Protege Ontology Library |accessdate=10 February 2011}}[/ref] contains a set of OWL, Frame-based and other format ontologies.
The following are both directories and search engines. They include crawlers searching the Web for well-formed ontologies.

==Examples of applications==

DOI 10.3233/SW-130114 http://iospress.metapress.com/content/k16n012507037044/[/ref] A more concrete example is SAPPHIRE (Health care) or Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines which is a semantics-based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health.

==Criticisms==

Werner Ceusters has noted the confusion caused by the significant differences in the meaning of word ontology when used by philosophy compared with the use of the word ontology in computer science, and advocates for greater precision in use of the word ontology so that members of the various disciplines using various definitions of the word ontology can communicate. He writes 'before one is able to answer the question 'what is an ontology?', one must provide first an answer to the question 'what does the word ontology mean?'.http://www.referent-tracking.com/RTU/sendfile/?file=CeustersCommentaryOnMaojoLongVersion.pdf
