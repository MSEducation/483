The over-achieving 1989 Cardinal team almost made the playoffs. Pedro Guerrero finished third in the National League MVP voting while leading the league with 42 doubles and finishing second in RBIs (117).  Joe Magrane won 18 games while José DeLeón won 16 games.  Milt Thompson played in 155 games and hit .290, mostly substituting for the injured Willie McGee.  Vince Coleman lead the league in stolen bases for the fifth straight year. However, it would be the arch-rival Cubs who would claim the division and move on to the playoffs.
