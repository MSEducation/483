 - The ranges denoted By biological stage may be used in closely monitored menstrual cycles in regard to other markers of its biological progression, with the time scale being compressed or stretched to how much faster or slower, respectively, the cycle progresses compared to an average cycle.
 - The ranges denoted Inter-cycle variability are more appropriate to use in non-monitored cycles with only the beginning of menstruation known, but where the woman accurately knows her average cycle lengths and time of ovulation, and that they are somewhat averagely regular, with the time scale being compressed or stretched to how much a woman's average cycle length is shorter or longer, respectively, than the average of the population.
 - The ranges denoted Inter-woman variability are more appropriate to use when the average cycle lengths and time of ovulation are unknown, but only the beginning of menstruation is given.]]

==Effects==

Progesterone exerts its primary action through the intracellular progesterone receptor although a distinct, membrane bound progesterone receptor has also been postulated.[tpl]cite journal | author = Luconi M, Bonaccorsi L, Maggi M, Pecchioli P, Krausz C, Forti G, Baldi E | title = Identification and characterization of functional nongenomic progesterone receptors on human sperm membrane | journal = J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 877–85 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9506743 | doi = 10.1210/jc.83.3.877 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Jang S, Yi LS | title = Identification of a 71 kDa protein as a putative non-genomic membrane progesterone receptor in boar spermatozoa | journal = J.

It prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and other corticosteroids such as cortisol and corticosterone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rupprecht R, Reul JM, van Steensel B, Spengler D, Söder M, Berning B, Holsboer F, Damm K | title = Pharmacological and functional characterization of human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor ligands | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 247 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–54 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8282004 | doi = 10.1016/0922-4106(93)90072-H [/tpl]
Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of estrogen.  Estrogen through estrogen receptors upregulates the expression of progesterone receptors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kastner P, Krust A, Turcotte B, Stropp U, Tora L, Gronemeyer H, Chambon P | title = Two distinct estrogen-regulated promoters generate transcripts encoding the two functionally different human progesterone receptor forms A and B | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 1603–14 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2328727 | doi = | pmc = 551856 [/tpl]  Also, elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-10-1194 | author = Landau RL, Bergenstal DM, Lugibihl K, Kascht ME. | title = The metabolic effects of progesterone in man | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1194–215 | year = 1955 | pmid = 13263410 [/tpl]

===Effects of Progesterone on Nicotine and Cocaine Addiction===

Progesterone inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) which is responsible for breaking down serotonin, the “feel good” neurotransmitter. In addition, progesterone enhances the serotonin receptor function in the brain, so too much or too little progesterone can cause significant problems in brain chemistry. This explains why people resort to substances that enhance serotonin activity such as nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels.1=Exp Clin Psychopharmacol. 2010 December; 18(6): 451–461

===Reproductive system===

Progesterone has key effects via non-genomic signalling on human sperm as they migrate through the female tract before fertilization occurs, though the receptor(s) as yet remain unidentified.[tpl]cite journal | author = Correia JN, Conner SJ, Kirkman-Brown JC | title = Non-genomic steroid actions in human spermatozoa.

Progesterone modulates the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).  Hence substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception.[tpl]cite journal | author = Strünker T, Goodwin N, Brenker C, Kashikar ND, Weyand I, Seifert R, Kaupp UB | title = The CatSper channel mediates progesterone-induced Ca2+ influx in human sperm | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7338 | pages = 382–6 |date=March 2011 | pmid = 21412338 | doi = 10.1038/nature09769 | laysummary = http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110316/full/news.2011.163.html | laysource = Nature News [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lishko PV, Botchkina IL, Kirichok Y | title = Progesterone activates the principal Ca2+ channel of human sperm | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7338 | pages = 387–91 |date=March 2011 | pmid = 21412339 | doi = 10.1038/nature09767 [/tpl]
Progesterone is sometimes called the "hormone of pregnancy",[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/placenta/endocrine.html | title = Placental Hormones | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | author = Bowen R | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2000-08-06 | work = | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = [/tpl] and it has many roles relating to the development of the fetus:
The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal steroids.

===Nervous system===

Progesterone, like pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, belongs to the group of neurosteroids. It can be synthesized within the central nervous system and also serves as a precursor to another major neurosteroid, allopregnanolone.
Neurosteroids affect synaptic functioning, are neuroprotective, and affect myelination.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schumacher M, Guennoun R, Robert F, et al. | title = Local synthesis and dual actions of progesterone in the nervous system: neuroprotection and myelination | journal = Growth Horm. IGF Res. | volume = 14 Suppl A | issue = | pages = S18–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15135772 | doi = 10.1016/j.ghir.2004.03.007| accessdate = [/tpl]  They are investigated for their potential to improve memory and cognitive ability. Progesterone affects regulation of apoptotic genes.
Its effect as a neurosteroid works predominantly through the GSK-3 beta pathway, as an inhibitor.  (Other GSK-3 beta inhibitors include bipolar mood stabilizers, lithium and valproic acid.)

==Medical applications==

The use of progesterone and its analogues have many medical applications, both to address acute situations and to address the long-term decline of natural progesterone levels. Because of the poor bioavailability of progesterone when taken orally, many synthetic progestins have been designed with improved oral bioavailability and have been used long before progesterone formulations became available.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schindler AE, Campagnoli C, Druckmann R, Huber J, Pasqualini JR, Schweppe KW, Thijssen JH | title = Classification and pharmacology of progestins | journal = Maturitas | volume = 61 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 171–80 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19434889 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.09.014 | url = http://www1.elsevier.com/homepage/sab/womenshealth/doc/journals/maturitas_si/2.pdf | issn = [/tpl]  Progesterone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as vaginal gel on July 31, 1997,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=020701&TABLE1=OB_Rx | title = Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations: 020701 | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | date = 2010-07-02 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration [/tpl] an oral capsule on May 14, 1998[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=019781&TABLE1=OB_Rx | title = Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations: 019781 | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | date = 2010-07-02 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration [/tpl] in an injection form on April 25, 2001[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=075906&TABLE1=OB_Rx | title = Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations: 075906 | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | date = 2010-07-02 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration [/tpl] and as a vaginal insert on June 21, 2007.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=022057&TABLE1=OB_Rx | title = Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations: 022057 | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | date = 2010-07-02 | publisher = Food and Drug Administration [/tpl] In Italy and Spain, Progesterone is sold under the trademark Progeffik.

===Bioavailability===

The route of administration impacts the effect of the drug. Given orally, progesterone has a wide person-to-person variability in absorption and bioavailability while synthetic progestins are rapidly absorbed with a longer half-life than progesterone and maintain stable levels in the blood.[tpl]cite pmid | 14670641 [/tpl]
Progesterone does not dissolve in water and is poorly absorbed when taken orally unless micronized in oil. Products are often sold as capsules containing micronised progesterone in oil. Progesterone can also be administered through vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, transdermally through a gel or cream,[tpl]cite book |title=Making the Estrogen Decision |last=Lark |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Lark |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |isbn=9780879836962 |page=22 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=d3IP-dmpoNsC&pg=PA22&dq=progesterone+%22skin+cream%22+liver&cd=3#v=onepage&q=progesterone%20%22skin%20cream%22%20liver [/tpl] or via injection (though the latter has a short half-life requiring daily administration).
Transdermal "natural progesterone" products made with Progesterone USP do not require a prescription. Some of these products also contain "wild yam extract" derived from Dioscorea villosa, but there is no evidence that the human body can convert its active ingredient (diosgenin, the plant steroid that is chemically converted to produce progesterone industrially[tpl]cite journal | author = Marker RE, Krueger J | title = Sterols.

===Prevention of preterm birth===

Vaginally dosed progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth.

==Role in aging==

Since most progesterone in males is created during testicular production of testosterone, and most in females by the ovaries, the shutting down (whether by natural or chemical means), or removal, of those inevitably causes a considerable reduction in progesterone levels. Previous concentration upon the role of progestogens (progesterone and molecules with similar effects) in female reproduction, when progesterone was simply considered a "female hormone", obscured the significance of progesterone elsewhere in both sexes.
The tendency for progesterone to have a regulatory effect, the presence of progesterone receptors in many types of body tissue, and the pattern of deterioration (or tumor formation) in many of those increasing in later years when progesterone levels have dropped, is prompting widespread research into the potential value of maintaining progesterone levels in both males and females.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Role in brain damage==

Studies as far back as 1987 show that female sex hormones have an effect on the recovery of traumatic brain injury.[tpl]cite journal |author=Espinoza TR, Wright DW |title=The role of progesterone in traumatic brain injury |journal=J Head Trauma Rehabil |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=497–9 |year=2011 |pmid=22088981 |doi=10.1097/HTR.0b013e31823088fa |url=[/tpl] In these studies, it was first observed that pseudopregnant female rats had reduced edema after traumatic brain injury. Recent clinical trials have shown that among patients that have suffered moderate traumatic brain injury, those that have been treated with progesterone are more likely to have a better outcome than those who have not.
Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to traumatic brain injury and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in females.[tpl]cite journal | author = Roof RL, Hall ED | title = Gender differences in acute CNS trauma and stroke: neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone | journal = J. Neurotrauma | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–88 |date=May 2000 | pmid = 10833057 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2000.17.367| url =  [/tpl]  A number of additional animal studies have confirmed that progesterone has neuroprotective effects when administered shortly after traumatic brain injury.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gibson CL, Gray LJ, Bath PM, Murphy SP | title = Progesterone for the treatment of experimental brain injury; a systematic review | journal = Brain | volume = 131 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 318–28 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 17715141 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm183 | url =  [/tpl]  Encouraging results have also been reported in human clinical trials.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wright DW, Kellermann AL, Hertzberg VS, Clark PL, Frankel M, Goldstein FC, Salomone JP, Dent LL, Harris OA, Ander DS, Lowery DW, Patel MM, Denson DD, Gordon AB, Wald MM, Gupta S, Hoffman SW, Stein DG | title = ProTECT: a randomized clinical trial of progesterone for acute traumatic brain injury | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–402, 402.e1–2 |date=April 2007 | pmid = 17011666 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.07.932 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Xiao G, Wei J, Yan W, Wang W, Lu Z | title = Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Crit Care | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = R61 |date=April 2008 | pmid = 18447940 | doi = 10.1186/cc6887  | pmc = 2447617  [/tpl]

===Proposed mechanism===

The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pan DS, Liu WG, Yang XF, Cao F | title = Inhibitory effect of progesterone on inflammatory factors after experimental traumatic brain injury | journal = Biomed. Environ. Sci. | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 432–8 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 18188998 | doi =  [/tpl]
Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass depolarization leading to excitotoxicity. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the voltage-dependent calcium channels that trigger neurotransmitter release.[tpl]cite journal | author = Luoma JI, Stern CM, Mermelstein PG | title = Progesterone inhibition of neuronal calcium signaling underlies aspects of progesterone-mediated neuroprotection | journal = J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. | volume = 131 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 30–6 |date=August 2012 | pmid = 22101209 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.11.002 | url = | pmc=3303940[/tpl]  It does so by manipulating the signaling pathways of transcription factors involved in this release. Another method for reducing the excitotoxicity is by up-regulating the inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, GABAA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stein DG |title=Progesterone exerts neuroprotective effects after brain injury |journal=Brain Res Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=386–97 |date=March 2008 |pmid=17826842 |pmc=2699575 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.06.012 |url=[/tpl]
Progesterone has also been shown to prevent apoptosis in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury. It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated caspase 3 and cytochrome c.
Not only does progesterone help prevent further damage, it has also been shown to aid in neuroregeneration. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema. Animal studies show that progesterone treatment leads to a decrease in edema levels by increasing the concentration of macrophages and microglia sent to the injured tissue.[tpl]cite journal | author = Herson PS, Koerner IP, Hurn PD | title = Sex, sex steroids, and brain injury | journal = Semin. Reprod. Med. | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–39 |date=May 2009 | pmid = 19401954 | pmc = 2675922 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1216276 [/tpl] This was observed in the form of reduced leakage from the blood brain barrier in secondary recovery in progesterone treated rats. In addition, progesterone was observed to have antioxidant properties, reducing the concentration of oxygen free radicals faster than without. There is also evidence that the addition of progesterone can also help remyelinate damaged axons due to trauma, restoring some lost neural signal conduction. Another way progesterone aids in regeneration includes increasing the circulation of endothelial progenitor cells in the brain.[tpl]cite journal | author = Li Z, Wang B, Kan Z, Zhang B, Yang Z, Chen J, Wang D, Wei H, Zhang JN, Jiang R | title = Progesterone increases circulating endothelial progenitor cells and induces neural regeneration after traumatic brain injury in aged rats | journal = J. Neurotrauma | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 343–53 |date=January 2012 | pmid = 21534727 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2011.1807 | url = [/tpl] This helps new vasculature to grow around scar tissue which helps repair the area of insult.

===Combination treatments===

Vitamin D and progesterone separately have neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury, but when combined their effects are synergistic.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cekic M, Sayeed I, Stein DG |title=Combination treatment with progesterone and vitamin D hormone may be more effective than monotherapy for nervous system injury and disease |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=158–72 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19394357 |pmc=3025702 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.04.002 |url=[/tpl]  When used at their optimal respective concentrations, the two combined have been shown to reduce cell death more than when alone.  
One study looks at a combination of progesterone with estrogen.  Both progesterone and estrogen are known to have antioxidant-like qualities and are shown to reduce edema without injuring the blood-brain barrier. In this study, when the two hormones are administered alone it does reduce edema, but the combination of the two increases the water content, thereby increasing edema.[tpl]cite journal | author = Khaksari M, Soltani Z, Shahrokhi N, Moshtaghi G, Asadikaram G | title = The role of estrogen and progesterone, administered alone and in combination, in modulating cytokine concentration following traumatic brain injury | journal = Can.

===Clinical trials===

The clinical trials for progesterone as a treatment for traumatic brain injury have only recently begun. ProTECT, a phase II trial conducted in Atlanta at Grady Memorial Hospital in 2007, the first to show that progesterone reduces edema in humans. Since then, trials have moved on to phase III. The National Institute of Health began conducting a nationwide phase III trial in 2011 led by Emory University.[tpl]cite journal|author=Stein DG|title=Progesterone in the treatment of acute traumatic brain injury: a clinical perspective and update|journal=Neuroscience|volume=191|issue=| pages=101–6|date=September 2011|pmid=21497181|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.04.013 [/tpl] A global phase III initiative called SyNAPSe®, initiated in June 2010, is run by a U.S.-based private pharmaceutical company, BHR Pharma, and is being conducted in the United States, Argentina, Europe, Israel and Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01143064?term=syNAPSe&rank=1|title=Efficacy and Safety Study of Intravenous Progesterone in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (SyNAPSe)|work=ClinicalTrials.gov|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health| accessdate=2012-07-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=SyNAPse: The Global phase 3 study of progesterone in severe traumatic brain injury|url=http://www.synapse-trial.com/|publisher=BHR Pharma, LLC [/tpl] Approximately 1,200 patients with severe (Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3-8), closed-head TBI will be enrolled in the study at nearly 150 medical centers.
