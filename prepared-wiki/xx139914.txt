==Overview==

High points in this woreda include Mount Gum (1506 meters), which R E Cheesman described as a prominent landmark near the Zakas ford on the Abay.Cheesman, "The Upper Waters of the Blue Nile", Geographical Journal, 71 (1928), p. 369 MIDROC Gold reported in 2009 that it was exploring the area around Menta Wuha for gold deposits.Minassie Teshome, "Ethiopia: Midroc Signs Up for Second Gold Mine", Addis Fortune 29 November 2009 (accessed 29 April 2010)
Originally the two adjacent woredas in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region, Dibate and Mandura, were subunits of Guangua but in the 1960s were split off to form separate woredas in order to strengthen government control over the local Gumuz people. These two woredas were transferred to Benishangul-Gumuz when that region was organized in the 1992.Asnake Kefale Adegehe, Federalism and ethnic conflict in Ethiopia: a comparative study of the Somali and Benishangul-Gumuz regions Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Leiden University, Doctoral thesis (2009), p. 220
