The 2003 Boumerdès earthquake was a magnitude 6.8 Mw earthquake that occurred on May 21, 2003 in northern Algeria.[tpl]Harvnb|Oliveira|Roca|Xavier|2006|Ref=CITEREFOliveiraRocaXavier2006|p=444[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Keeping Schools Safe in Earthquakes|2004|Ref=CITEREF2004|p=36[/tpl] The epicentre of the earthquake was located in the town of ThéniaAlgeria hit by earthquake BBC News[tpl]Harvnb|Dean|Ref=CITEREFDean|p=177[/tpl] in Boumerdès Province, approximately 60 km east of the capital Algiers.

==Tectonics==

Northern Algeria is situated at the boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, thus creating a zone of compression. This zone of compression manifests itself by several thrust and faults.Building performance in the Boumerdes, Algeria, Earthquake of May 21, 2003 Canadian Association for Earthquake Engineering Due to this location between two tectonic plates, many earthquakes occurred in the region.Quake rescuers race against time CNN The mechanism of the earthquake on May 21 corresponds to a northeast-striking thrust fault named Zemmouri fault which was identified for the first time after this earthquake. According to the United States Geological Survey,

==Damages and casualties==

Approximately 2,266 people were killed, 10,261 injured, and 200,000 left homeless as a result of the earthquake.[tpl]cite book|title=Zemmouri, Algeria, Mw6.8 Earthquake of May 21, 2003|year=2004|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784407462|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&productid=5369|editor=Curtis L. Edwards[/tpl]  Reports indicate more than 1,243 buildings were completely or partially destroyed. Infrastructure was predictably damaged in Algiers, Boumerdès, Réghaïa and Thénia; roads in Algeria are generally of high quality, but many city streets and local roads were difficult to traverse because of debris from collapsed buildings. Bridges are constructed similarly to those in the US, with precast steel girders supporting a concrete deck. A few days after the earthquake, three major highway bridges were still closed. The last highway bridge to open was the Hussein Dey Bridge on July 5. 
The quake generated a localized tsunami, which damaged boats off the coast of the Balearic Islands.Magnitude 6.8 Northern Algeria United States Geological Survey The eastern side of Algiers was affected most; overall, the Boumerdès Province was the hardest-hit region. According to officials, roughly 400 people were killed in Algiers only. In the Boumerdès Province, several cities were heavily damaged, with Thénia, Zemmouri, and Boumerdès, being the worst affected.[tpl]Harvnb|Keeping Schools Safe in Earthquakes|2004|Ref=CITEREF2004|p=37[/tpl] Many buildings built in the early twentieth century during the colonial rule suffered heavy damage in the Belcourt, Bab-El-Oued and El-Casbah areas in Algiers Province. 
According to the Algerian Ministry of Housing, in the Algiers Province only approximately 554 schools suffered light damage, while nearly 330 schools received moderate damage and 11 were heavily damaged or completely destroyed.[tpl]Harvnb|Keeping Schools Safe in Earthquakes|2004|Ref=CITEREF2004|p=38[/tpl] The University of Boumerdès was severely damaged, and many buildings in the area collapsed. Damage was also reported to the University of Science and Technology  in Bab Ezzouar, which has the largest university campus in Algeria.
A water treatment plant in Boudouaou, which provides more than 12% of the treated water to the Boumerdès and Algiers, suffered light damage to the clarifiers and clear water storage tanks. The water pipeline from the Keddara Dam to the water treatment plant was broken at a concrete junction structure at the dam, as well as at the treatment plant. The main power plant in Cap Djenet suffered minor to moderate damage. A high voltage switch yard located near Réghaïa had heavy damage.[tpl]Harvnb|Edwards|2004|Ref=CITEREFEdwards2004|p=2[/tpl]
Societé Nationale des Transports Ferrovaires, Algeria's state-owned railway company, suffered track damage near the town of Thénia. Some tracks were also blocked by debris of destroyed buildings. Eighteen bridges in the affected region had minor to moderate damage. Cracks developed in some roads and highways. The port of Algiers, which at that time handled approximately 40% of the national cargo traffic, suffered light to moderate damage due to soil liquefaction and settlement caused by the earthquake. Port operations was reportedly reduced by 30% immediately after the quake. The minor ports in Zemmouri and Dellys received little damage. The airport control tower and terminal were moderately damaged.[tpl]Harvnb|Edwards|2004|Ref=CITEREFEdwards2004|p=3[/tpl]
The earthquake had significant effect on local communication. An 8,000 switch central office in the El Harrach area of Algiers completely destroyed and another 20,000 switch office was heavily damaged. Central offices in Boumerdes, Zemmouri and Tidjelabine were damaged.[tpl]Harvnb|Edwards|2004|Ref=CITEREFEdwards2004|pp=2–3[/tpl] Submarine telecommunication cables also suffered damage. Two underwater fiber optic cables between Algeria and Spain received heavy damage due to undersea landslide caused by the quake.

==Relief efforts==

Many nations sent rescue teams to help in the search for earthquake survivors. International teams of relief workers went to the spot and became involved in rescuing people still trapped under rubble. International relief agencies engaged in supplies like shelter, food and water to the people who became homeless due to the quake. Sniffer dogs sent to Algeria to find survivors trapped under rubble.Sniffer dogs sent to Algeria BBC News The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement co-ordinated the relief efforts. Medical and rescue teams were dispatched from European countries. The Red Cross of the People's Republic of China donated $50,000.Aid en route to Algeria BBC News Trucks were called into service to remove dead bodies from Algiers and surrounding towns and villages. Army units were deployed to assist the relief effort. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia announced an aid of $7,000 for each victim. The government dispatched several ambulances, police personnel and electrical workers into the affected area. Tents, ambulances and engineering equipment were brought by the army. Water trucks were dispatched to the quake affected villages.Algeria earthquake death tolls reaches nearly 1,600 USA Today

===Response from other countries===

===Public anger===

There was anger among the survivors over the fact that the local authorities did not provide them with temporary shelters. Government officials virtually did not take part in the relief efforts, but Islamic charities tried to provide quick assistance. The inability of the state to effectively respond to the disaster led to widespread criticism.[tpl]Harvnb|Freedom House|2004|Ref=CITEREFFreedom House2004|p=15[/tpl] The effects of the earthquake became worse because the construction industry in Algeria did not apply rigorous safety standards of earthquake engineering to build earthquake-proof buildings[tpl]Harvnb|Oxford Business Group|Ref=CITEREFOxford Business Group|p=92[/tpl] and several buildings lacked the architecture to withstand earthquakes. New housing blocks constructed by the government and by individual builders were destroyed by the quake,[tpl]Harvnb|Evans|Phillips|2008|Ref=CITEREFEvansPhillips2008|p=273[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Elsheshtawy|2004|Ref=CITEREFElsheshtawy2004|p=54[/tpl] but private building from the French period withstood the earthquake. This was another cause of public anger. Some people claimed that officials saved money by using below-standard material in construction projects. Many angry protesters threw debris when President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Minister of State for the Interior and Local Authorities, Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni, tried to visit some affected regions. A crowd kicked and stoned the car of Bouteflika when he visited Boumerdès shouting "pouvoir assassin". Prime Minister Ouyahia expressed the view of possibility of corruption in the construction sector. A commission of inquiry was set up by the government to investigate the faulty construction of several buildings which collapsed in the quake.
