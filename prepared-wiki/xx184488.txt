B.U.G. Mafia released the track Pana cand moartea ne va desparti ('Till Death Do Us Part), a collaboration with young and upcoming rapper Puya as an unofficial single. A soulful ode, the song still remains one of the best known in Romanian hip hop, being remade for the Viaţa noastră (Vol.1) (Our Life Vol.1) anniversary album with the vocals being recorded by Tataee. It depicted the story of two brothers, Alex and Tony, who grew up in the projects having to face everyday life in the ghetto and starting to live on the streets when their parents died. The twist at the end of the song is when the two brothers face each other in a shoot out, one being a top policeman and the other a head of organized crime. They both died in the shoot out, the story being one of the most emotional in the group's work. 
The album featured a larger number of featured guests such as Puya, July, Freakadadisk, Tragaci, Don Baxter and Eddy Schneider (credited as C.R.Bel, not to be confused with another Romanian artist, member of breakdance group Simplu who used this stage name). It was one of the first Romanian hip hop albums to use real-live instrumentation and scratching. It sold over 30,000 copies and it was the group's last album with Emil "Coco" Coroianu as a sound engineer. It also contained a "rest in peace" skit dedicated to Eric "Eazy E" Wright and Tupac Amaru Shakur called "Ceva Pentru Care Merita Sa Mori" (Something That's Worth Dying For).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bugmafiaoficial.ro/discografie|title=B.U.G.
