Napoléon François Charles Joseph Bonaparte (20 March 1811[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]22 July 1832), Prince Imperial, King of Rome, Prince of Parma, known as Franz, Duke of Reichstadt from 1818 onward, was the son of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, and his second wife, Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria.
By Title III, article 9 of the French Constitution of the time, he was Prince Imperial, but he was also known from birth as the King of Rome, which Napoleon I declared was the courtesy title of the heir apparent. His nickname of L'Aiglon ("the Eaglet") was awarded posthumously and was popularized by the Edmond Rostand play, L'Aiglon.
When Napoleon I abdicated on 4 April 1814, he named his son as Emperor. However, the coalition partners that had defeated him refused to acknowledge his son as successor, thus Napoleon I was forced to abdicate unconditionally a number of days later. Although Napoleon François Bonaparte never actually ruled France, he was briefly the titular Emperor of the French and is still generally referred to by historians as Napoleon II.

==Biography==

===Birth===

Between 8 and 9 o'clock at night on 19 March 1811, Empress Marie Louise began to experience the first pains of labour. The princes and princesses of the family, as well as the grand dignitaries, ministers, grand officers of the crown, grand officers of the Empire and the ladies and officers of the household, informed of this by the lady-in-waiting, assembled at the Tuileries Palace.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/478809.asp | title=The King of Rome's birth | work=Le Moniteur Universel | date=21 March 1811 | accessdate=8 March 2012 | location=Paris[/tpl] On 20 March, at 9:20 in the morning, a baby boy weighing [tpl]convert|9|lb|kg[/tpl], with a height of [tpl]convert|20|in|cm[/tpl], was born at the Tuileries Palace. He was ondoyed (a traditional French ceremony which can relate to a concise baptism) by Joseph Fesch with his full name of Napoleon François Charles Joseph.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/biographies/files/478853.asp | title=Napoleon II: King of Rome, French Emperor, Prince of Parma, Duke of Reichstadt | publisher=napoleon.org | work=The Napoleon Foundation | date=March 2011 | accessdate=8 March 2012[/tpl]
The baptism, inspired by the baptismal ceremony of Louis, Grand Dauphin of France, was held on 9 June 1811 in the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral. Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, Austrian ambassador to France, wrote of the baptism:
He was put in the care of Louise Charlotte Françoise Le Tellier de Montesquiou, a descendant of François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, who was named Governess of the Children of France. Affectionate and intelligent, the governess assembled a considerable collection of books intended to give the infant a strong grounding in religion, philosophy and military matters.

===Succession rights===

As the eldest legitimate son of Napoleon I, he was already constitutionally the Prince Imperial and heir apparent, but the Emperor also gave his son the style of His Majesty the King of Rome. Three years later, the First French Empire, to which he was the heir, collapsed.
Napoleon saw his second wife and their son for the last time on 24 January 1814.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/The-First-Empire?lang=en |title=Château de Fontainebleau |publisher=Musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28[/tpl] On 4 April 1814, Napoleon abdicated in favour of his toddler son after the Six Days' Campaign and the Battle of Paris. The three-year-old became Emperor of the French under the regnal name of Napoleon II. However, on 6 April 1814, Napoleon I fully abdicated and renounced not only his rights to the French throne, but his descendants' rights also. The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814 gave the child the right to use the title of Prince of Parma, of Placentia, and of Guastalla, and his mother was styled the Duchess of Parma, of Placentia, and of Guastalla.

===Reign===

On 29 March 1814, accompanied by her suite, Marie Louise left the Tuileries Palace with her son. Their first stop was the Château de Rambouillet; then, fearing the advancing enemy troops, they continued on to the Château de Blois. On 13 April, with her suite much diminished, Marie Louise and her three-year-old son were back in Rambouillet, where they met her father, the Emperor Francis I of Austria, and the Emperor Alexander I of Russia. On 23 April, escorted by an Austrian regiment, mother and son left Rambouillet and France forever, for their exile in Austria.G. Lenotre, le Château de Rambouillet, six siècles d'histoire, ch. L'empereur, Éditions Denoël, Paris, 1984 (1930 reedition), pp. 126–133, ISBN 2-207-23023-6.
In 1815, after his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon I abdicated in favour of his four-year-old son, whom he had not seen since his exile to Elba, for a second time.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2013[/tpl] The day after Napoleon's abdication, a Commission of Government of five members took the rule of France,[tpl]cite web |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k486114j.pleinepage.f281.langFR |title=(N.275.)

Proclamation du Roi |work=Bulletin des lois de la République française |page=1 |date=25 June 1815[/tpl] [tpl]fr icon[/tpl] The Commission held power for two weeks, but never formally summoned Napoleon II as Emperor or appointed a regent. The entrance of the Allies into Paris on 7 July brought a rapid end to his supporters' wishes. Napoleon II was residing in Austria with his mother and was probably never aware at the time that he had been proclaimed Emperor on his father's abdication.
The next Bonaparte to come to the throne of France was Louis-Napoleon, the son of Napoleon's brother Louis I, King of Holland. He took the regnal name of Napoleon III in deference to his cousin's brief titular reign.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2013[/tpl]

===Life in Austria===

From the spring of 1814 onwards, Napoleon II lived in Austria and was known as "Franz" (after his maternal grandfather, Emperor Franz of Austria). In 1818, he was awarded the title of Duke of Reichstadt by his maternal grandfather.
Upon the death of his stepfather, Adam Albert von Neipperg, and the revelation that his mother had borne two illegitimate children to him prior to their marriage, Franz said to his friend, Anton von Prokesch-Osten, "'If Josephine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried at Saint Helena, and I should not be at Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved".Markham, Felix, Napoleon, p. 249
He died of tuberculosis at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna on 22 July 1832.Altman, Gail S. Fatal Links: The Curious Deaths of Beethoven and the Two Napoleons (Paperback). Anubian Press (September 1999). ISBN 1-888071-02-8 He left no issue, thus the Napoleonic claim to the throne of France was taken over by his cousin, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who later successfully restored the empire as Napoleon III.

==Disposition of his remains==

On 15 December 1940, the remains of Napoleon II were transferred from Vienna to the dome of Les Invalides in Paris. This was done as a gift to France by Adolf Hitler.Poisson, Georges, (Robert L. Miller, translator), Hitler's Gift to France: The Return of the Ashes of Napoleon II, Enigma Books, ISBN 978-1-929631-67-4 (Synopsis & Review by Maria C. Bagshaw).Poisson, Georges, Le retour des cendres de l'Aiglon, Édition Nouveau Monde, Paris, 2006, ISBN 2847361847 French wags at the time countered Hitler's propaganda by saying "Hitler stole France's coal, but returned to them the ashes." (French) The remains of Napoleon I had been returned to France in December 1840, at the time of the July Monarchy.Driskel, Paul (1993). As Befits a Legend. Kent State University Press. p. 168 ISBN 0-87338-484-9 For some time, the remains of the young prince who had briefly been an emperor rested beside those of his father. Later, the prince's remains were moved to the lower church.
While most of his remains were transferred to Paris, his heart and intestines remained in Vienna, which is traditional for members of the Hapsburg house. They are in Urn 42 in the "Heart Crypt" (Herzgruft) and his viscera are in Urn 76 of the Ducal Crypt.
