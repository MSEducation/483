The United States Postal Service (USPS), also known as the Post Office and U.S. Mail, is an independent agency of the United States federal government responsible for providing postal service in the United States. It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general. The cabinet-level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin's operation and transformed into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act.
The USPS employed 626,764 workers (as of January 2014) and operated 211,654 vehicles in 2013. The USPS is the operator of the largest civilian vehicle fleet in the world.  The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at uniform price and quality. The USPS has exclusive access to letter boxes marked "U.S. Mail" and personal letterboxes in the United States, but still competes against private package delivery services, such as UPS and FedEx.[tpl]cite web|title=Universal Service and the Postal Monopoly: A Brief History|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/universal-service-postal-monopoly-history.pdf|publisher=The United States Postal Service|accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Foundations===

In the early years of the North American colonies, many attempts were made to initiate a postal service. These early attempts were of small scale and usually involved a colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony for example, setting up a location in Boston where one could post a letter back home to England. Other attempts focused on a dedicated postal service between two of the larger colonies, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, but the available services remained limited in scope and disjointed for many years. For example, informal independently-run postal routes operated in Boston as early as 1639, with a Boston to New York City service starting in 1672.
A central postal organization came to the colonies in 1691, when Thomas Neale received a 21-year grant from the British Crown for a North American Postal Service. On February 17, 1691, a grant of letters patent from the joint sovereigns, William and Mary, empowered him:
 
 "to erect, settle, and establish within the chief parts of their majesties' colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for receiving and dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send, and deliver the same under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years."Our Postal System Francis C. Huebner. Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, DC Vol. 9 (1906), pp. 126–74. Historical Society of Washington, DC.

The patent included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on official documents of all kinds. The tax was repealed a year later. Neale appointed Andrew Hamilton, Governor of New Jersey, as his deputy postmaster. The first postal service in America commenced in February 1692. Rates of postage were fixed and authorized, and measures were taken to establish a post office in each town in Virginia. Massachusetts and the other colonies soon passed postal laws, and a very imperfect post office system was established. Neale's patent expired in 1710, when Parliament extended the English postal system to the colonies. The chief office was established in New York City, where letters were conveyed by regular packets across the Atlantic.
Before the Revolution, there was only a trickle of business or governmental correspondence between the  colonies. Most of the mail went back and forth to counting houses and government offices in London. The Revolution made Philadelphia, the seat of the Continental Congress, the information hub of the new nation. News, new laws, political  intelligence, and military orders circulated with a new urgency, and a postal system was necessary. Journalists took the lead, securing post office legislation that allowed them to reach their subscribers at very low cost, and to exchange news from newspapers between the 13 states. Overthrowing the London-oriented imperial postal service in 1774-75, printers enlisted merchants and the new political leadership, and created new postal system.Joseph M.  Adelman, "'A Constitutional Conveyance of Intelligence, Public and Private': The Post Office, the Business of Printing, and the American Revolution," Enterprise & Society (2010) 11#4 pp 709-752. in Project MUSE The United States Post Office (USPO) was created on July 26, 1775, by decree of the Second Continental Congress. Benjamin Franklin headed it briefly.
Before the Revolution, individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post. The official post office was created in 1792 as the Post Office Department (USPOD). It was based on the Constitutional authority empowering Congress "To establish post offices and post roads". The 1792 law provided for a greatly expanded postal network, and served editors by charging newspapers an extremely low rate. The law guaranteed the sanctity of personal correspondence, and provided the entire country with low-cost access to information on public affairs, while establishing a right to personal privacy.Richard John, "How the Post Office Made America," New York Times Feb 8, 2013
Rufus Easton was appointed by Thomas Jefferson first postmaster of St. Louis under the recommendation of Postmaster General Gideon Granger. Rufus Easton was the first postmaster and built the first post office west of the Mississippi. At the same time Easton was appointed by Thomas Jefferson, judge of Louisiana Territory, the largest territory in North America. Bruce Adamson wrote that: "Next to Benjamin Franklin, Rufus Easton was one of the most colorful people in United States Postal History." It was Easton who educated Abraham Lincoln's Attorney General, Edward Bates. In 1815 Edward Bates moved into the Easton home and lived there for years at Third and Elm. Today this is the site of the Jefferson Memorial Park. In 1806 Postmaster General Gideon Granger wrote a three-page letter to Easton, begging him not to partake in a duel with vice-president Aaron Burr.  Two years earlier it was Burr who had shot and killed Alexander Hamilton. Many years later in 1852, Easton's son, Major-General Langdon Cheves Easton, was commissioned by William T. Sherman, at Fort Union to delivery a letter to Independence, Missouri.  Sherman wrote: “In the Spring of 1852, General Sherman mentioned that the quartermaster, Major L.C. Easton, at Fort Union, New Mexico, had occasion to send some message east by a certain date, and contracted with Aubrey to carry it to the nearest post office (then Independence, Missouri), making his compensation conditional on the time consumed.  He was supplied with a good horse, and an order on the outgoing trains for exchange.  Though the whole route was infested with hostile Indians, and not a house on it, Aubrey started alone with his rifle.  He was fortunate in meeting several outward-bound trains, and thereby made frequent changes of horses, some four or five, and reached Independence in six days, having hardly rested or slept the whole way."   "For Which Stand; The Life and Papers of Rufus Easton," by Bruce Campbell Adamson and Professor William Foley; See William T. Sherman's Memoirs
To cover long distances, the Post Office used a hub-and-spoke system, with Washington as the hub and chief sorting center. By 1869, with 27,000 local post offices to deal with, it had changed to sorting mail en route in specialized railroad mail cars, called Railway Post Offices, or RPOs. The system of postal money orders began in 1864. Free mail delivery began in the larger cities in 1863.Leonard D. White, The Republican Era: A study in administrative history: 1869-1901 (1963), p 259

===19th century===

The postal system played a crucial role in national expansion. It facilitated expansion into the West by creating an inexpensive, fast, convenient communication system. Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide neutral help, assisted  entrepreneurs to find business opportunities, and made possible regular commercial relationships  between merchants and the West and wholesalers and factories back east.  The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories.   The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the New York Weekly Tribune, facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped integrate established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.William H. Bergmann, "Delivering a Nation through the Mail," Ohio Valley History (2008) 8#3 pp 1-18.
The Post Office in the 19th century was a major source of federal patronage. Local postmasterships were rewards for local politicians—often the editors of party newspapers. About 3/4 of all federal civilian employees worked for the Post Office. In 1816 it employed 3341 men, and in 1841, 14,290. The volume of mail expanded much faster than the population, as it carried annually 100 letters and 200 newspapers per 1000 white population in 1790, and 2900 letters and 2700 newspapers per thousand in 1840.Richard John, Spreading the News (1995) pp 3-4
The Post Office Department was enlarged during the tenure of President Andrew Jackson. As the Post Office expanded, difficulties were experienced due to a lack of employees and transportation. The Post Office's employees at that time were still subject to the so-called "spoils" system, where faithful political supporters of the executive branch were appointed to positions in the post office and other government corporations as a reward for their patronage. These appointees rarely had prior experience in postal service and mail delivery. This system of political patronage was replaced in 1883, after passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.classbrain.com/artteenst/publish/article_130.shtml | title = Classbrain | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
Ten years before waterways were declared post roads in 1823, the Post Office used steamboats to carry mail between post towns where no roads existed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]  Once it became clear that the postal system in the United States needed to expand across the entire country, the use of the railroad to transport the mail was instituted in 1832, on one line in Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2c1_railwaymail.html |title=National Postal Museum |publisher=SI |accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl] All railroads in the United States were designated as post routes, after passage of the Act of July 7, 1838. Mail service by railroad increased rapidly thereafter.History of the United States Postal Service 1775–1993, p. 1
An Act of Congress provided for the issuance of stamps on March 3, 1847, and the Postmaster General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson. The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in NYC, with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. The 5-cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than [tpl]convert|1|oz|abbr=on[/tpl] and travelling less than 300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles, or twice the weight deliverable for the 5-cent stamp.
In 1847, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company acquired the contract which allowed it to carry the U.S. mails from New York, with stops in New Orleans and Havana, to the Isthmus of Panama for delivery in California. The same year, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had acquired the right to transport mail under contract from the United States Government from the Isthmus of Panama to California. In 1855, William Henry Aspinwall completed the Panama Railway, providing rail service across the Isthmus and cutting to three weeks the transport time for the mails, passengers and goods to California. This remained an important route until the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. Railroad companies greatly expanded mail transport service after 1862, and the Railway Mail Service was inaugurated in 1869.
Rail cars designed to sort and distribute mail while rolling were soon introduced.  RMS employees sorted mail 'on the fly' during the journey, and became some of the most skilled workers in the postal service. An RMS sorter had to be able to separate the mail quickly into compartments based on its final destination, before the first destination arrived, and work at the rate of 600 pieces of mail an hour. They were tested regularly for speed and accuracy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2c1a_insiderms.html |title=National Postal Museum |publisher=Postalmuseum.si.edu |accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl]
Parcel Post service began with the introduction of International Parcel Post between the USA and foreign countries in 1887.The New York Times. "The Parcel Post System". 24 April 1887  That same year, the U.S. Post Office (predecessor of the USPS) and the Postmaster General of Canada established parcel-post service between the two nations.  A bilateral parcel-post treaty between the independent (at the time) Kingdom of Hawaii and the USA was signed on 19 December 1888 and put into effect early in 1889.[tpl]cite web |title=Post Office In Paradise, Mail Rates During the UPU Period|publisher =Post Office in Paradise |date=10 July 2000|url=http://www.hawaiianstamps.com/ratesupu.html |accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl] Parcel-post service between the USA and other countries grew with the signing of successive postal conventions and treaties.  While the Post Office agreed to deliver parcels sent into the country under the UPU treaty, it did not institute a domestic parcel-post service for another twenty-five years.[tpl]cite web |title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams: Introduction |work= |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries |year=2004 | url =http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/intro.htm |accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl]

===20th century===

The advent of rural free delivery in the U.S. in 1896, and the inauguration of a domestic parcel post service by Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock in 1913, greatly increased the volume of mail shipped nationwide, and motivated the development of more efficient postal transportation systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/cf/view.cfm |title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams |publisher=Sil.si.edu |accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl] Many rural customers took advantage of inexpensive Parcel Post rates to order goods and products from businesses located hundreds of miles away in distant cities for delivery by mail.[tpl]r|pierstorff[/tpl] From the 1910s to the 1960s, many college students and others used parcel post to mail home dirty laundry, as doing so was less expensive than washing the clothes themselves.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Laundry_Box.html | title=Laundry Box | publisher=National Postal Museum, The Smithsonian | date=September 2007 | accessdate=21 January 2013|author=Heidelbaugh, Lynn[/tpl]
After four-year-old Charlotte May Pierstorff was mailed from her parents to her grandparents in Idaho in 1914, mailing of people was prohibited.[tpl]cite web |title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams: Introduction |work= |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries |year=2004 |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/cf/view.cfm |accessdate=18 December 2012[/tpl] In 1917, the Post Office imposed a maximum daily mailable limit of two hundred pounds per customer per day after a business entrepreneur, W.H. Coltharp, used inexpensive parcel-post rates to ship more than eighty thousand masonry bricks some four hundred seven miles via horse-drawn wagon and train for the construction of a bank building in Vernal, Utah.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b2f_parcel.html |title=Precious Packages—America's Parcel Post Service |publisher=National Postal Museum |year=2012 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.stampsofdistinction.com/2008/07/bank-that-was-sent-through-post-office.html |title=The Bank That Was Sent Through the Post Office |first=Tony |last=Servies |publisher=stampsofdistinction.com |date=11 July 2008|accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]
The advent of parcel post also led to the growth of Mail order businesses that substantially increased rural access to modern goods over what was typically stocked in local general stores.
In 1912, carrier service was announced for establishment in towns of second and third class with $100,000 appropriated by Congress.[tpl]Cite news |month=September 2012 |title=One hundred years ago this month: September 20 |newspaper=Emmitsburg News-Journal [/tpl]  From January 1, 1911, until July 1, 1967, the United States Postal Service operated the United States Postal Savings System. An Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, established the Postal Savings System in designated Post Offices, effective January 1, 1911. The legislation aimed to get money out of hiding, attract the savings of immigrants accustomed to the postal savings system in their native countries, provide safe depositories for people who had lost confidence in banks, and furnish more convenient depositories for working people. The law establishing the system directed the Post Office Department to redeposit most of the money in the system in local banks, where it earned 2.5 percent interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-savings-system.pdf |title=Postal Savings System by HISTORIAN, UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, JULY 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl] In 1912, Operation Santa Claus was started at the James Farley Post Office.[tpl]cite web|author=Tuesday, November 15, 2011 No Comments |url=http://operationsanta.com/operation-santa-claus-at-james-farley-post-office-2012/ |title=Operation Santa Claus At James Farley Post Office 2012 | Operation Santa Claus - Santa's Blog |date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2011-12-10[/tpl]
The system paid 2-percent interest per year on deposits. The half percent difference in interest was intended to pay for the operation of the system. Certificates were issued to depositors as proof of their deposit. Depositors in the system were initially limited to hold a balance of $500, but this was raised to $1,000 in 1916 and to $2,500 in 1918. The initial minimum deposit was $1. In order to save smaller amounts for deposit, customers could purchase a 10-cent postal savings card and 10-cent postal savings stamps to fill it. The card could be used to open or add to an account when its value, together with any attached stamps, amounted to one or more dollars, or it could be redeemed for cash. At its peak in 1947, the system held almost $3.4 billion in deposits, with more than four million depositors using 8,141 postal units.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-savings-system.pdf |title="Postal Savings System" by HISTORIAN, UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, JULY 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl]
On August 12, 1918, the Post Office Department took over air mail service from the U.S. Army Air Service (USAAS). Assistant Postmaster General, Otto Praeger, appointed Benjamin B. Lipsner to head the civilian-operated Air Mail Service. One of Lipsner's first acts was to hire four pilots, each with at least 1,000 hours flying experience, paying them an average of $4,000 per year ($[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|4000|1918|r=2[/tpl][/tpl] today). The Post Office Department used mostly World War I military surplus de Havilland DH-4 aircraft.[tpl]cite web |title=The Post Office Flies The Mail |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Government_Role/1918-1924/POL3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106112000/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Government_Role/1918-1924/POL3.htm |accessdate=2014-04-18 |archivedate=2014-04-18 [/tpl]
During 1918, the Post Office hired an additional 36 pilots. In its first year of operation, the Post Office completed 1,208 airmail flights with 90 forced landings. Of those, 53 were due to weather and 37 to engine failure. By 1920, the Air Mail service had delivered 49 million letters. Domestic air mail became obsolete in 1975, and international air mail in 1995, when the USPS began transporting First-Class mail by air on a routine basis.
The Post Office was one of the first government departments to regulate obscene materials on a national basis. When the U.S. Congress passed the Comstock laws of 1873, it became illegal to send through the U.S. mail any material considered obscene or indecent, or which promoted abortion issues, contraception, or alcohol consumption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/5508/Comstock-Law-1873.html |title=Comstock Law of (1873) |publisher=Law.jrank.org |accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl]
On March 18, 1970, postal workers in New York City—upset over low wages and poor working conditions, and emboldened by the Civil Rights movement—organized a strike against the US Government. The strike initially involved postal workers in only New York City, but it eventually gained support of over 210,000 United States Post Office Department workers across the nation. While the strike ended without any concessions from the Federal government, it did ultimately allow for postal worker unions and the government to negotiate a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, as well as the signing of the Postal Reorganization Act by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970. The Act replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service, and took effect on July 1, 1971.

==Current operations==

The United States Postal Service employs some 574,000 workers, making it the third-largest civilian employer in the United States behind the federal government and Wal-Mart.[tpl]cite web| url=http://walmartstores.com/download/2230.pdf| format=PDF| title=Corporate Fact Sheet| publisher=Wal-Mart| date=July 17, 2008| accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl] In a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Court noted: "Each day, according to the Government's submissions here, the United States Postal Service delivers some 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery points."Dolan v. United States Postal Service, [tpl]ussc|546|481|2006[/tpl]. Update: In February 2011, the figure for number of delivery points was stated as "more than 150 million nationally" (See citation name=DelOn20110220).  As of 2011, the USPS operates 31,000 post offices and locations in the U.S., and delivers 177 billion pieces of mail annually.
The USPS operates the largest civilian vehicle fleet in the world, with an estimated 218,684 vehicles, the majority of which are the easily identified Chevrolet/Grumman LLV (Long-Life Vehicle), and the newer Ford/Utilimaster FFV (Flex-Fuel Vehicle), originally also referred to as the "CRV" (Carrier Route Vehicle). For every penny increase in the national average price of gasoline, the USPS spends an extra $8 million per year to fuel its fleet.[tpl]Cite news |first=Erica |last=Johnson |url=http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/gas-prices-affecting-mail/?id=70992 |title=Gas Prices Affecting Mail |date=June 20, 2008 |publisher=Keloland Television |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl]
The number of gallons of fuel used in 2009 was 444 million, at a cost of [tpl]USD|1.1[/tpl] billion. The fleet is notable in that many of its vehicles are right-hand drive, an arrangement intended to give drivers the easiest access to roadside mailboxes. Some Rural Letter Carriers use personal vehicles. Standard postal-owned vehicles do not have license plates. These vehicles are identified by a seven digit number displayed on the front and rear.
The Department of Defense and the USPS jointly operate a postal system to deliver mail for the military; this is known as the Army Post Office (for Army and Air Force postal facilities) and the Fleet Post Office (for Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard postal facilities).
In February 2013, the Postal Service announced that on Saturdays it would only deliver packages, mail-order medicines, Priority Mail, and Express Mail, effective August 10, 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Postal Service Announces New Delivery Schedule|url=http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2013/pr13_019.htm|publisher=United States Postal Service|accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=U.S. Postal Service: Saturday letter delivery to end in August|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57567900/u.s-postal-service-saturday-letter-delivery-to-end-in-august|newspaper=CBS News|date=February 6, 2013[/tpl] However, this change was reversed by federal law in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2013/pr13_0410bogstatement.htm|title=Statement from the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors|date=2013-04-10|accessdate=2014-04-09[/tpl]

===Five-year plans===

==Budget==

===Revenue decline and planned cuts===

First Class mail volume peaked in 2001[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-1926-2010.pdf |title=First Class Mail Volume, 1926-2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl] and has declined 29% from 1998 to 2008, due to the increasing use of email and the World Wide Web for correspondence and business transactions.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.usps.com/all/amp.htm| title=USPS – Area Mail Processing| publisher=USPS| year=2009| accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl]
FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) directly compete with USPS express mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages.
Lower volume means lower revenues to support the fixed commitment to deliver to every address once a day, six days a week. In response, the USPS has increased productivity each year from 2000 to 2007,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.usps.com/strategicplanning/cs08/chpt1_pg5.htm| title=Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations 2008| publisher=USPS| year=2008| accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] through increased automation, route re-optimization, and facility consolidation.

On December 5, 2011 the USPS announced it would close more than half of its mail processing centers, eliminate 28,000 jobs and reduce overnight delivery of first-class mail. This will close down 252 of its 461 processing centers.Postal Service to Delay Cutbacks Until Mid-May, Staving Off Bankruptcy, Fox News. Accessed: 13 December 2011.

In May 2012, the service announced it had modified its July 2011 plan to close about 3,700 small post offices.  Instead, rural post offices would remain open with reduced retail hours (some as little as two hours per day) unless there was a community preference for a different option.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/electronic-press-kits/our-future-network/assets/pdf/postplan-fact-sheet-120509.pdf|title=FACT SHEET / New Strategy Preserves Post Offices in Rural America|accessdate=2012-09-27|author=USPS[/tpl]  In a survey of rural customers, 20% preferred the "Village Post Office" replacement (where a nearby private retail store would provide basic mail services with expanded hours), 15% preferred merger with another Post Office, and 11% preferred expanded rural delivery services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2012/pr12_054.htm|title=New Strategy to Preserve the Nation’s Smallest Post Offices|accessdate=2012-09-27|author=USPS[/tpl]  Approximately 40% of postal revenue already comes from online purchases or private retail partners including Walmart, Staples, Office Depot, Walgreens, Sam's Club, Costco, and grocery stores.

===Congressional role===

Of related significance is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), which obligates the USPS to fund the present value of earned retirement obligations within a ten-year time span – a requirement that raises the US Postal Service to the same level that US corporations operate. In 2012, the USPS had its third straight year of operational losses, which amounted to $4.8 billion.[tpl]cite news|last=USPS Annual Report 2012|first= |title=USPS 2012 Annual Report|url=http://about.usps.com/publications/annual-report-comprehensive-statement-2012/annual-report-comprehensive-statement-2012.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2013[/tpl]
Congress also has the ability to affect the USPS budget by changing rates for postage.[tpl]cite news|last=Pence|first=Herbert|title=Congress didn’t do US Postal Service any favors|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/opinionperspectives/939126-263/congress-didnt-do-us-postal-service-any.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph|date=6 November 2011[/tpl]

===Retirement funding===

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the main bureaucratic organization responsible for the human resources aspect of many federal agencies and their employees. The PAEA created the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund (PSRHB) after Congress removed the Postal Service contribution to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Most other employees that contribute to the CSRS have 7% deducted from their wages. The PAEA enabled the US Postal Service to properly fund the earned obligations of employees, which is a requirement on US companies offering similar benefits.[tpl]cite web|title=Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ18/pdf/PLAW-108publ18.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=2003-04-23[/tpl] The payment for earned obligations for retirement was scheduled to be made was 5.6 billion due by September 30, 2012; however, the S. 1789 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2011 would end the payments altogether, while making cuts across the board like reducing USPS delivery days from six to five.[tpl]cite web|title=S. 1789  21st Century Postal Service Act of 2011|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s1789a.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl]

==Governance and organization==

The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service sets policy, procedure, and postal rates for services rendered, and has a similar role to a corporate board of directors. Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate (see [tpl]usc|39|202[/tpl]). The nine appointed members then select the United States Postmaster General, who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day to day activities of the service as Chief Executive Officer (see [tpl]usc|39|202|203[/tpl]). The ten-member board then nominates a Deputy Postmaster General, who acts as Chief Operating Officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat.
The independent Postal Regulatory Commission (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the President confirmed by the Senate.  It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals.
The USPS is often mistaken for a government-owned corporation (e.g., Amtrak) because it operates much like a business, but as noted above, it is legally defined as an "independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States", ([tpl]usc|39|201[/tpl]) as it is controlled by Presidential appointees and the Postmaster General. As a quasi-governmental agency, it has many special privileges, including sovereign immunity, eminent domain powers, powers to negotiate postal treaties with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail. Indeed, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the USPS was not a government-owned corporation, and therefore could not be sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act.United States Postal Serv. v. Flamingo Indus. (USA) Ltd., [tpl]ussc|540|736|2004[/tpl].
The U.S. Supreme Court has also upheld the USPS's statutory monopoly on access to letter boxes against a First Amendment freedom of speech challenge; it thus remains illegal in the U.S. for anyone, other than the employees and agents of the USPS, to deliver mailpieces to letter boxes marked "U.S. Mail."United States Postal Serv. v. Greenburgh Civic Ass'ns, [tpl]ussc|453|114|1981[/tpl].
The Postal Service also has a Mailers' Technical Advisory Committee and local Postal Customer Councils, which are advisory and primarily involve business customers.USPS.com[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. USPS.com (September 17, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.

==Universal service obligation and monopoly status==

[tpl]Refimprove section|[tpl]November 2011[/tpl]|date=November 2011|talk=y[/tpl]
Article I, section 8, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads, which has been interpreted as a de facto Congressional monopoly over the delivery of first class residential mail - which has been defined as non-urgent residential letters (not packages). Accordingly, no other system for delivering first class residential mail – public or private – has been tolerated, absent Congress's consent.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The mission of the Postal Service is to provide the American public with trusted universal postal service at affordable prices. While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's universal service obligation (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a legal obligation to provide all the various aspects of universal service at affordable rates.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the Private Express Statutes (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Proponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would have an impact on the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service. If, for example, the PES and the mailbox rule were to be eliminated, and the USO maintained, then either billions of dollars in tax revenues or some other source of funding would have to be found.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Some proponents[tpl]by whom|date=April 2012[/tpl] of universal service principles suggest that private communications that are protected by the veil of government promote the exchange of free ideas and communications. This separates private communications from the ability of a private for-profit or non-profit organization to corrupt. Security for the individual is in this way protected by the United States Post Office, maintaining confidentiality and anonymity, as well as government employees being much less likely to be instructed by superiors to engage in nefarious spying.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  It is seen by some[tpl]by whom|date=April 2012[/tpl] as a dangerous step to extract the universal service principle from the post office, as the untainted nature of private communications is preserved as assurance of the protection of individual freedom of privacy.
Critics of universal service principles include several professional economists advocating for the privatization of the mail delivery system, or at least a relaxation of the universal service model that currently exists.[ref]Geddes, Rick. "Do Vital Economists Reach a Policy Conclusion on Postal Reform?" (April 2004).

However, as the recent notice of a termination of mail service to residents of the Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness indicates, mail service has been contracted to private firms such as Arnold Aviation for many decades. KTVB-TV reported:Postal Service to renew Idaho back country mail route Alyson Outen, KTVB-TV, April 10, 2009

The Postal Act of 2006 required the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to submit a report to the President and Congress on universal postal service and the postal monopoly in December 2008. The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.
On October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a reportUSPS.com[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011. to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.
Obligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly "would have a devastating impact on the ability...to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly." Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:
Most of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the Chicago metropolitan area and many other major metros one must get a background check from police and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post commercial messages on private property.
Regarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the “base rate” or “base tariff”) or the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.
The Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. "A more rigidly defined USO would ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses," according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.

===Competitors===

FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) directly compete with USPS express mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages. Due to the postal monopoly, they are not allowed to deliver non-urgent letters and may not directly ship to U.S. Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations. However both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost® Shipping & Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | accessdate=April 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations - Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | accessdate=April 11, 2012[/tpl] These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept. DHL Express was the third major competitor until February 2009, when it ceased domestic delivery operations in the United States.
A variety of other transportation companies in the United States move cargo around the country, but either have limited geographic scope for delivery points, or specialize in items too large to be mailed. Many of the thousands of courier companies focus on same-day delivery, for example, by bicycle messenger.

===Alternative transmission methods===

The Post Office Department owned and operated the first public telegraph lines in the United States, starting in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore, and eventually extending to New York, Boston, Buffalo, and Philadelphia. In 1847 the telegraph system was privatized, except for a period during World War I, when it was used to accelerate the delivery of letters arriving at night.[tpl]cite web |title=Telegraph: Early Postal Role |work=Postal History |publisher=USPS |date=July 2008 |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf |accessdate=2014-04-18 [/tpl]

==Law enforcement agencies==

===Postal Inspection Service===

The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Founded by Benjamin Franklin, its mission is to protect the Postal Service, its employees, and its customers from crime and protect the nation's mail system from criminal misuse.
Postal Inspectors enforce over 200 federal laws providing for the protection of mail in investigations of crimes that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the postal system or postal employees.
The USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and seizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non-urgent mail through overnight delivery competitors. According to the American Enterprise Institute, a private conservative think tank, the USPIS raided Equifax offices in 1993 to ascertain if the mail they were sending through Federal Express was truly "extremely urgent." It was found that the mail was not, and Equifax was fined $30,000.
Lastly, the PIS oversees the activities of the Postal Police Force who patrol in and around selected high-risk postal facilities in major metropolitan areas in the United States and its territories.

===Office of Inspector General===

The United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) was authorized by law in 1996. Prior to the 1996 legislation, the Postal Inspection Service performed the duties of the OIG. The Inspector General, who is independent of postal management, is appointed by and reports directly to the nine presidentially appointed, Senate–confirmed members of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.
The primary purpose of the OIG is to prevent, detect and report fraud, waste and program abuse, and promote efficiency in the operations of the Postal Service. The OIG has "oversight" responsibility for all activities of the Postal Inspection Service.

===Elements of addressing and preparing domestic mail===

All mailable articles (e.g., letters, flats, machinable parcels, irregular parcels, etc.) shipped within the United States must comply with an array of standards published in the USPS Domestic Mail Manual (DMM).Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) – § 600: Basic Standards For All Mailing Services.

The USPS specifies the following key elements when preparing the face of a mailpiece:
Domestic first-class mail costs 49¢ for envelopes (34¢ for post cards) and upwards, depending on the weight and dimensions of the letter and the class.
Mail going to naval vessels is known as the Fleet Post Office (FPO) and to Army or Air Force installations use the city abbreviation APO (Army Post Office or Air Force Post Office).
Undeliverable mail that cannot be readily returned, including mail without return addresses, is treated as dead mail at a Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia or Saint Paul, Minnesota.

The formatting of a return address is identical. Though some style manuals recommend using a comma between the city and state name when typesetting addresses in other contexts, for optimal automatic character recognition, the Post Office does not recommend this when addressing mail. The official recommendation is to use all upper case block letters with appropriate formats and abbreviations, and leave out all punctuation except for the hyphen in the ZIP+4 code. If the address is unusually formatted or illegible enough, it will require hand-processing, delaying that particular item.

All unused U.S. postage stamps issued since 1861 are still valid as postage at their indicated value. Stamps with no value shown or denominated by a letter are also still valid, although the value depends upon the particular stamp. For some stamps issued without a printed value, the current value is the original value. But some stamps beginning in 1988 or earlier, including "Forever Stamps" that were issued beginning in April 2007, and all 1st class mail 1st ounce stamps beginning 2011-01-21, the value is the current value of a 1st class mail 1st ounce stamps. (The USPS calls these "Forever Stamps". The generic name is non-denominated postage.)
Forever stamps are sold at the first-class mail postage rate at the time of purchase, but will always be valid for first-class mail (1 oz and under), no matter how rates rise in the future.Postal Rates Set to Go Up on May 14.

====Postage meters====

A postage meter is a mechanical device used to create and apply physical evidence of postage (or franking) to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps.

====PC postage====

In addition to using standard stamps, postage can now be printed in the form of an electronic stamp, or e-stamp, from a personal computer using a system called Information Based Indicia. This online PC Postage method relies upon application software on the customer's computer contacting a postal security device at the office of the postal service.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | first=Henk C.

===Sorting and delivery process===

Processing of standard sized envelopes and cards is highly automated, including reading of handwritten addresses. Mail from individual customers and public postboxes is collected by mail carriers into plastic tubs, which are taken to one of approximately 251 Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DC) across the United States.  Each P&DC sort mails for a given region (typically with a radius of around [tpl]convert|200|mi[/tpl]) and connects with the national network for interregional mail.Author unknown (date unknown). Direct Marketing Direct Mail. Allbusiness.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-08 from http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing/direct-marketing-direct-mail/316648-1.html[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl].
At the P&DC, mail is emptied into hampers which are then automatically dumped into a Dual Pass Rough Cull System (DPRCS). As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines.
In contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates indicia (stamp or metered postage mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a postmark. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.
Mail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a bar code and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent Optical Character Recognition (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes.
Mail with typed addresses goes to a Multiline Optical Character Reader (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the Remote Bar Coding System. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.
When it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called Remote Encoding Centers, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a fluorescent barcode printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.
Processed mail is imaged by the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days.[tpl]cite news |first=Andrew |last=Miga |url=http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-postal-takes-photos-mail-keeps-images-074323981.html |publisher=Yahoo!

If a customer has filed a change of address card and his or her mail is detected in the mailstream with the old address, the mailpiece is sent to a machine that automatically connects to a Computerized Forwarding System database to determine the new address. If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.
Mail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (first-class mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as Dead Letter Offices, originated by Benjamin Franklin in the 1770s)[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] where it receives more intense scrutiny, including being opened to determine if any of the contents are a clue. If no valid address can be determined, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; and if they are not claimed then they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service.
Once the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a Delivery Bar Code System that reads the bar code and determines the destination of the mailpiece to postal stations.
Regional mail is trucked to the appropriate local post office or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts the items into their local destinations, including grouping them by individual mail carrier.
At the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted; the remaining mail must be sorted by hand. The Post Office is working to increase the percentage of automatically sorted mail, including a pilot program to sort "flats".USPS.com.

Over a period of years, these facilities are expected to replace Processing & Distribution Centers, Customer Service Facilities, Bulk Mail Centers, Logistic and Distribution Centers, annexes, the Hub and Spoke Program, Air Mail Centers, and International Service Centers.
The changes are a result of the declining volumes of single-piece first-class mail, population shifts, the increase in drop shipments by advertising mailers at destinating postal facilities, advancements in equipment and technology, redundancies in the existing network, and the need for operational flexibility.

====Airline and rail division====

The United States Postal Service does not directly own or operate any aircraft or trains. The mail and packages are flown on airlines with which the Postal Service has a contractual agreement. The contracts change periodically. Depending on the contract, aircraft may be painted with the USPS paint scheme.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]  Contract airlines have included: UPS, Emery Worldwide, Ryan International Airlines, FedEx Express, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Express One International.

A team of postal service headquarters executives and staff has been given a time frame of sixty days to complete the study. The current concept examines the impact of five-day delivery with no business or collections on Saturday, with Post Offices with current Saturday hours remaining open.
Chairman José Serrano (D–NY), of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, which oversees language mandating six day service, said "While I understand the seriousness of the Postal Service's fiscal issues, I remain supportive of a six day delivery schedule.

====Direct delivery vs. customer pickup====

Originally, mail was not delivered to homes and businesses, but to post offices. In 1863, "city delivery" began in urban areas with enough customers to make this economical. This required streets to be named, houses to be numbered, with sidewalks and lighting provided, and these street addresses to be added to envelopes.City Delivery[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. (PDF) . Retrieved on July 8, 2011.  The number of routes served expanded over time. In 1891, the first experiments with Rural Free Delivery began in less densely populated areas. There is currently an effort to reduce direct delivery in favor of mailbox clusters.
To compensate for high mail volume and slow long-distance transportation which saw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day, deliveries were made multiple times a day. This ranged from twice for residential areas to up to seven times for the central business district of Brooklyn, New York.Deliveries per Day[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. (PDF) . Retrieved on July 8, 2011.  In the late 19th century, mail boxes were encouraged, saving carriers the time it took to deliver directly to the addressee in person; in the 1910s and 1920s, they were phased in as a requirement for service.  In the 1940s, multiple daily deliveries began to be reduced, especially on Saturdays. By 1990, the last twice-daily deliveries in New York City were eliminated.
Today, mail is delivered once a day on-site to most private homes and businesses. The USPS still distinguishes between city delivery (where carriers generally walk and deliver to mailboxes hung on exterior walls or porches, or to commercial reception areas) and rural delivery (where carriers generally drive).Home Delivery[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. USPS (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.  With "curbside delivery", mailboxes are at the ends of driveways, on the nearest convenient road.  "Central point delivery" is used in some locations, where several nearby residences share a "cluster" of individual mailboxes in a single housing.
Some customers choose to use post office boxes for an additional fee, for privacy or convenience. This provides a locked box at the post office to which mail is addressed and delivered (usually earlier in the day than home delivery). Customers in less densely populated areas where there is no city delivery and who do not qualify for rural delivery may receive mail only through post office boxes. High-volume business customers can also arrange for special pick-up.USPS FAQ – Caller Service[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl], multiple pickups for a feeUSPS FAQ – Firm Holdout Service[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl], free pickup once a day
Another option is the old-style general delivery, for people who have neither post office boxes nor street addresses. Mail is held at the post office until they present identification and pick it up.
Some customers receive free post office boxes if the USPS declines to provide door-to-door delivery to their location or a nearby box.USPS FAQ – Do I qualify for free box service?[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl].

====Special delivery====

From 1885 to 1997, a service called special delivery was available, which caused a separate delivery to the final location earlier in the day than the usual daily rounds.

====Same-day trial====

In December 2012, the USPS began a limited one-year trial of same-day deliveries directly from retailers or distribution hubs to residential addresses in the same local area, a service it dubbed "Metro Post".[tpl]cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Post office tests same-day delivery|date=2012-11-23|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2012/11/23/cash-strapped-post-office-tests-same-day-delivery/EeG60PN9dhT9N7cdfMyj7J/story.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Target |url=https://www.usps.com/metropost/ |title=USPS.com® - Metro Post |publisher=Usps.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2013-03-24[/tpl]  The trial was initially limited to San Francisco and the only retailer to participate in the first few weeks was 1-800-FLOWERS.[tpl]cite news|agency=EcommerceBytes.com|date=2013-01-14|author=Kenneth Corbin|title=USPS Adding Retailers to Same Day Delivery Trial|http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y13/m01/i14/s04[/tpl]

====Forwarding and holds====

Residential customers can fill out a form to forward mail to a new address, and can also send pre-printed forms to any of their frequent correspondents. They can also put their mail on "hold", for example, while on vacation. The Post Office will store mail during the hold, instead of letting it overflow in the mailbox. These services are not available to large buildings and customers of a commercial mail receiving agency,USPS FAQ – Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA)[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. Faq.usps.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011. where mail is subsorted by non-Post Office employees into individual mailboxes.

==Postal money orders==

Postal money orders provide a safe alternative to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a bank check money orders are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds.Domestic Money Orders[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. USPS (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.  Money orders are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.
From 1911 to 1967, the Postal Service also operated the United States Postal Savings System, not unlike a savings and loan association with the amount of the deposit limited.

==Employment in the USPS==

The Postal Service is the nation's second-largest civilian employer.[tpl]cite web |title=2011 Postal Facts |publisher=U.S. Postal Service |year=2011 |url=http://about.usps.com/future-postal-service/postalfacts-2011.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=November 17, 2011 [/tpl] – There is also a web version of the content. [tpl]As of|2011[/tpl], it employed 574,000 personnel, divided into offices, processing centers, and actual post offices. The United States Postal Service would rank 29th on the 2010 Fortune 500 list, if considered a private company.
Labor unions representing USPS employees include: The American Postal Workers Union (APWU), which represents postal clerks and maintenance, motor vehicle, mail equipment shops, material distribution centers, and operating services and facilities services employees, postal nurses, and IT and accounting;Collective Bargaining Agreement between APWU and USPS  the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), which represents city letter carriers; the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association (NRLCA), which represents rural letter carriers; and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union (NPMHU).
USPS employees are divided into three major crafts according to the work they engage in:
Other non-managerial positions in the USPS include:
Though the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement. A major round of job cuts, early retirements, and a construction freeze were announced on March 20, 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/20/post.office.cuts/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=Postal service to slash more than 3,000 jobs, offer early retirements | date=March 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010[/tpl]

===Workplace violence===

In the early 1990s, widely publicized workplace shootings by disgruntled employees at USPS facilities led to a Human Resource effort to provide care for stressed workers and resources for coworker conflicts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22341/html/info_003.htm#ep1440011 |title=Human Resources |publisher=About.usps.com |accessdate=2013-03-24[/tpl] Due to media coverage, postal employees gained a reputation among the general public as more likely to be mentally ill. The USPS Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace found that "Postal workers are only a third as likely as those in the national workforce to be victims of homicide at work."USPS Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace, January 31, 2006[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. Retrieved October 10, 2007. In the documentary Murder by Proxy: How America Went Postal, it was argued that this number failed to factor out workers killed by external subjects rather than by fellow employees.
These series of events in turn has influenced American culture, as seen in the slang term "going postal"Vick, Karl, "Violence at work tied to loss of esteem", St. Petersburg Times, Dec 17, 1993"The Year in Review 1993", Los Angeles Times, December 31, 1993 (see Patrick Sherrill for information on his August 20, 1986, rampage) and the computer game Postal. Also, in the opening sequence of Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, a yell of "Disgruntled postal workers" is heard, followed by the arrival of postal workers with machine guns. In an episode of Seinfeld, the character Newman, who is a mailman, explained in a dramatic monologue that postal workers "go crazy and kill everyone" because the mail never stops. In The Simpsons episode "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday," Nelson Muntz asks Postmaster Bill if he has "ever gone on a killing spree"; Bill replies, "The day of the disgruntled postman went out with the Macarena".[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The series of massacres led the US Postal Service to issue a rule prohibiting the possession of any type of firearms (except for those issued to Postal Inspectors) in all designated USPS facilities.
