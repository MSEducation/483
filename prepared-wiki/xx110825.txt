On December 16, 2006 several internet animation fan sites, including AnimatedNews.com, reported that Sanders had been removed as the director of the upcoming Disney animated film American Dog by John Lasseter.  A New York Times interview with John Lasseter later revealed that Chris Sanders was negotiating his exit from Disney.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/movies/04hols.html?pagewanted=all | work=New York Times | title= He Runs That Mickey Mouse Outift | author=Laura Holson | date=March 4, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2012[/tpl] After the departure of Sanders from Disney, directing duties were handed to Chris Williams and Byron Howard, and the film was retitled Bolt.

===DreamWorks Animation===

In March 2007, Variety reported that Chris Sanders had moved to DreamWorks Animation and had then taken over as director on Crood Awakening (later renamed to The Croods), a project previously in co-production with Aardman Animations before their departure from DreamWorks.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961927.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Sanders joins DreamWorks | first=Ben | last=Fritz | date=March 27, 2007[/tpl] At the time, Chris had this to say about the move: "I've been so anxious to start working on things, and so I talked to a lot of people... I like the way DreamWorks looks at animation. Animation still has a lot of different places to go, and I don't want to miss out on a chance to try some new things with it."
On September 24, 2008, it was reported that Sanders and Lilo & Stitch co-director and co-writer Dean DeBlois would be screenwriting and directing How to Train Your Dragon for DreamWorks Animation.[tpl]cite news|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=UPDATE: Chris Sanders Still Crood and Directing Dragon|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/sanders-off-crood-film-onto-dragon.html|accessdate=March 5, 2012|newspaper=Cartoon Brew|date=September 25, 2008[/tpl]  The film was released on March 26, 2010 and was well received by critics. It grossed nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards. The movie also won ten Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature.
After completing How to Train Your Dragon, Chris returned to The Croods, which was released on March 22, 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=DreamWorks Animationâ€™s Release Schedule|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/09/dreamworks-animations-release-schedule/|accessdate=April 30, 2013|newspaper=Deadline|date=September 9, 2012[/tpl] Sanders shared directing and writing credits with Kirk DeMicco, who had joined in the middle of production. The film proved to be a success, grossing over $500 million, and earning itself a sequel, with Sanders and DeMicco returning in their original roles.
Sanders also draws the popular webcomic Kiskaloo, but, since a post from Chris on September 30, 2008 stating "I'll be drawing and posting the new comic in a just a couple of days!", hasn't been drawn since.
