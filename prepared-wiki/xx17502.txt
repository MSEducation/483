==Early years==

Jane Goodall was born in London, England, in 1934 to Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall, a businessman, and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph, a novelist who wrote under the name Vanne Morris-Goodall. As a child, she was given a lifelike chimpanzee toy named Jubilee by her father; her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals. Today, the toy still sits on her dresser in London. As she writes in her book, Reason for Hope: "My mother's friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares."[tpl]cite book |last=Goodall |first=Jane |coauthors=Phillip Berman |title=Reason for Hope: a spiritual journey |publisher=Warner Books |year=2000 |location=New York |page=4 |isbn=978-0-446-67613-7[/tpl] Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday, though the two were born four years apart.

==Africa==

Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, a Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids,[tpl]cite video |date = June 2007|title=Jane Goodall helps humans and animals live together |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07.html |publisher=TED |location=Arusha, Tanzania |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl] was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.
In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier.[tpl]cite book | last = Morell |first=Virginia|year=1995|title=Ancestral Passions: the Leakey family and the quest for humankind's beginnings|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80192-2|page=242[/tpl] Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates.[tpl]cite book|last1=Goodall|first1=Jane|last2=Peterson|first2=Dale|title=Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters: The Later Years|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kdr0TP7ou0wC&pg=PA1|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=2002-09-25|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-25734-8|page=1[/tpl] She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was "Tanganyika" at that time and a British protectorate.[tpl]cite web |title=Early Days |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/janes-story |accessdate=2010-07-28 |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |year=2010[/tpl]
Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University where she obtained a Ph.D degree in Ethology. She became only the eighth person to be allowed to study for a Ph.D there without first obtaining a BA or B.Sc. Her thesis was completed in 1965 under the tutorship of Robert Hinde, former master of St. John's College, Cambridge, titled "Behaviour of the Free-Ranging Chimpanzee," detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.[tpl]cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae, Jane Goodall, Ph.D., DBE |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |url=http://www.janegoodall.org.hk/downloads/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Goodall has been married twice. On 28 March 1964, she married a Dutch nobleman, wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick, at Chelsea Old Church, London, and she became known during their marriage as Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall. The couple had a son, Hugo Eric Louis (born 1967); they divorced in 1974. The following year, she married Derek Bryceson (a member of Tanzania's parliament and the director of that country's national parks); he died of cancer in October 1980.[tpl]cite book|title=Walking With the Great Apes |last=Montgomery|first=Sy|year=1991|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-395-51597-1|pages=125–126[/tpl] With his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson was able to protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe while he was alive.
Goodall has on different occasions expressed belief of, or at least fascination with Sasquatch, Yeti, or Bigfoot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/jane-goodall-fascinated-bigfoot-article-1.1172959 |title=Chimp expert Jane Goodall says she is ‘fascinated’ by Bigfoot |publisher=NY Daily News |accessdate=26 June 2013[/tpl]
When asked if she believed in God, Goodall said in September 2010: "I don't have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I’m out in nature. It’s just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me."Jane Goodall's Questions & Answers, Readers Digest, p. 128, September 2010
