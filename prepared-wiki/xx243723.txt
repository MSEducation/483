==Development==

The FP-505 was designed by Fisher Aircraft in the United States in 1984 and was intended to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, with the category's maximum [tpl]convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl] empty weight. The 505's standard empty weight is [tpl]convert|245|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl] when equipped with a two-stroke [tpl]convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 277 engine. The design goal was to provide a nostalgic 1930's style parasol similar in configuration to the Pietenpol Air Camper or Heath Parasol that would be easy to fly, with a high wing and an open cockpit.
The construction of the FP-505 is of wood, with the fuselage built from wood strips arranged in a geodesic form, resulting in a very strong and light aircraft with redundant load paths. The wings, tail and fuselage are covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings are strut-braced with both jury struts and cabane struts. The aircraft has no flaps. The conventional-configuration landing gear is bungee suspended. The company claims it takes an amateur builder 500 hours to build the FP-505.
Early versions of the FP-505 were equipped with the [tpl]convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 277 and the aircraft reportedly flies well on that minimum power. Since the Rotax 277 is no longer in production the [tpl]convert|25|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Hirth F-33 is specified along with the [tpl]convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 447 and [tpl]convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 503 engines.
By late 2011 over 45 FP-505s were flying.
