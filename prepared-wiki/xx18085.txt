According to Russian System of Differentional Correction and Monitoring's data, [tpl]as of|2010|lc=on[/tpl], precisions of GLONASS navigation definitions (for p=0.95) for latitude and longitude were 4.46—7.38 m with mean number of navigation space vehicles (NSV) equals 7—8 (depending on station). In comparison, the same time precisions of GPS navigation definitions were 2.00—8.76 m with mean number of NSV equals 6—11 (depending on station).[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Civilian GLONASS used alone is therefore very slightly less accurate than GPS. On high latitudes (north or south), GLONASS' accuracy is better than that of GPS due to the orbital position of the satellites.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/first-foreign-firm-embraces-glonass/434850.html|title=First Foreign Firm Embraces Glonass|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=2011-04-11[/tpl]
Some modern receivers are able to use both GLONASS and GPS satellites together, providing greatly improved coverage in urban canyons and giving a very fast time to fix due to over 50 satellites being available. In indoor, urban canyon or mountainous areas, accuracy can be greatly improved over using GPS alone. For using both navigation systems simultaneously, precisions of GLONASS/GPS navigation definitions were 2.37—4.65 m with mean number of NSV equals 14—19 (depends on station).
In May 2009, Anatoly Perminov the then director of the Russian Federal Space Agency stated that actions were undertaken to expand GLONASS's constellation and to improve the ground segment in order to increase the  navigation definition of GLONASS to an accuracy of 2.8 m  by 2011.Роскосмос обещает повысить точность работы ГЛОНАСС с 10 до 5,5 метров РИА «Новости» In particular, the latest satellite design, GLONASS-K has the ability to double the system's accuracy once introduced. The system's ground segment is also to undergo improvements. As of early 2012, sixteen positioning ground stations are under construction in Russia and in the Antarctic at the Bellingshausen and Novolazarevskaya bases. New stations will be built around the southern hemisphere from Brazil to Indonesia. Together, these improvements are expected to bring GLONASS' accuracy to 0.6 m or better by 2020.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/02/16/glonass_benefits_worth_the_extra_expense_14862.html|title=GLONASS benefits worth the extra expense|last1=Kramnik|first1=Ilya|publisher=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=2012-02-16[/tpl]
