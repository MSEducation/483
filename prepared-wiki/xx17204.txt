Amman ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɑː|n[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|عمّان[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|ʿAmmān [/tpl]; Biblical Hebrew: [tpl]Hebrew|רבת עמון[/tpl] Rabat Ammon) is the capital and most populous city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. It is the country's political, cultural and commercial centre and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The Greater Amman area has a population of 2,842,629 as of 2010. The recent economic growth experienced in Amman is unmatched by any other Arab city except those located in the Persian Gulf area. Amman is also the administrative seat of the homonymous governorate. Amman is also ranked a Beta− global city on the World city index.
Amman was named one of the MENA's best cities according to economic, labour, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. Amman is among the most popular locations for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai.  Furthermore, it is expected that in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://duniafrontier.com/research/doha-amman |title=Dunia Frontier Consultants » Doha, Amman Favored by MNCs as New Regional Hubs |publisher=Duniafrontier.com |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] It is a major tourist destination in the region and the capital is especially popular among Gulf tourists.[tpl]cite news|title=Abu Dhab duke City' in MENA region|author=IANS/WAM|newspaper=sify news|date=2010-11-26|url=http://sify.com/news/abu-dhabi-voted-best-city-in-mena-region-news-international-kl0wuhjcbdc.html[/tpl]

==History==

In the 13th century BC Amman was called Rabbath Ammon or Rabat Amon by the Ammonites.  In the Hebrew Bible, it is referred to as Rabbat ʿAmmon (Tiberian Hebrew Rabbaṯ ʿAmmôn). It was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Persians, and then the Greek Macedonians. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, renamed it Philadelphia (Ancient Greek Φιλαδέλφεια). The city became part of the Nabataean kingdom until 106 AD when Philadelphia came under Roman control and joined the Decapolis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.magicjordan.net/en/sites/details/17/Amman |title=Amman |publisher=Magicjordan.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]
It was then destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters and remained a small village and a pile of ruins until the Circassian settlement in 1878.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ammancity100.gov.jo/en/content/story-amman/end-ummayad-era-till-1878 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212032543/http://ammancity100.gov.jo/en/content/story-amman/end-ummayad-era-till-1878 |archivedate=2010-02-12 |title=Amman Centennial | From the end of the Ummayad era till 1878 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-03-25[/tpl] The tide changed when the Ottoman Sultan decided to build the Hejaz railway, linking Damascus and Medina, facilitating both the annual hajj pilgrimage and permanent trade, putting Amman, a major station, back on the commercial map. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In 1921, Abdullah I chose Amman instead of As-Salt as seat of government for his newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, and later as the capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. As there was no palatial building, he started his reign from the station, with his office in a train car. Amman remained a small city until 1948, when the population expanded considerably due to an influx of Palestinian refugees from  Palestine.
In 1970, Amman was the site of major clashes between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian army. Everything around the Royal Palace sustained heavy damage from shelling. The city's population continues to expand at a rapid pace (fueled by refugees escaping the wartime events in the West Bank and Iraq). The city received refugees from these countries on a number of occasions. The first wave of Palestinian refugees arrived from Palestine in 1948. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. A third wave of Palestinian and Jordanian and Southeast Asians, working as domestic workers, refugees arrived in Amman from Kuwait after the Gulf War of 1991. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the first Gulf War, with a second wave also arriving after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the last 10 years the number of new buildings within the city has increased dramatically with new districts of the city being founded at a very rapid pace (particularly so in West Amman), straining the very scarce water supplies of Jordan as a whole, and exposing Amman to the hazards of rapid expansion in the absence of careful municipal planning. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
On November 9, 2005, coordinated explosions rocked three hotels in Amman, resulting in the death of 60 people and the injury of 115 others. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the act, which was carried out despite the fact that the birthplace of since-killed Al Qaeda terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is the town of Zarqa, less than [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Amman. The sheer brutality of the attacks, which targeted, among other things, a wedding party being held at one of the hotels, caused widespread revulsion across the widest range of Jordanians. Large protests and vigils followed in the wake of the attacks.

==Geography==

Amman is situated in a hilly area of north-western Jordan. The city was originally built on seven hills, but it now spans over an area of nineteen hills (each known as a Jabal, Tál, Mount or Mountain). The main areas of Amman gain their names from the hills and mountains on whose slopes they lie. The city's elevation changes from mountain to mountain. They range from 700 to 1100 m (2300–3600 feet).

===Climate===

Amman's position on the mountains near the Mediterranean places it under the cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk) The city has warm to hot and usually dry summers, whereas the winters are quite wet and range from mild to cool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://weatherspark.com/averages/32846/10/Amman-Jordan |title=Average Weather In October For Amman, Jordan |publisher=WeatherSpark |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2013-03-25[/tpl] Spring is brief, mild and lasts a little less than a month, from April to May, with rain during the morning and the afternoons. High temperatures are around [tpl]convert|15|°C|0}abrr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and lows are less than [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and several times even going near [tpl]convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] causing several freezes.
Amman has moderate summers starting from mid June to mid September. Summer's high temperatures range from [tpl]convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], usually with low to moderate humidity and frequent cool breezes. Most summers are rain-free with cloudless skies during the noon period and a brief shower or fog during the night-time.
Winter usually starts in late November or early December and continues to late April. Temperatures are usually near or below [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], with snow usually falling a few times each year. Due to its high altitude above sea level, winter in Amman is one of the coldest in any major city in the MENA and the Mediterranean Basin;[tpl]cite web|url=http://cityscape.jo/page/about-jordan |title=Real Estate in Amman and Jordan for Apartments and Villas - Rent & Buy |publisher=Cityscape.jo |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] winters are usually foggy with at least 120 days of heavy fog per year. Snowy winter storms occur several times around the city. Due to the difference in elevation, snow may accumulate in the northern and western parts of Amman (an average altitude of [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level) while at the same time it could be raining at the city center (elevation of [tpl]convert|776|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]). It can snow anywhere between November and until the end of March- more frequently in vast parts of the city which occupy  higher elevations ([tpl]convert|900|to|1100|m|ft[/tpl]).
It should be noted that Amman has extreme examples of microclimate, and almost every neighborhood exhibits its own weather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arlt-lectures.com/jordan-amman.pdf |title="Ever-growing Amman", Jordan: Urban expansion, social polarisation ands contemporary urban planning issues |publisher=Arlt-lectures.com |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl] It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu Nsér are among the coldest in the city, and can be experiencing frost while other warmer districts such as Marka can be providing much warmer temperatures to its inhabitants at the same time.
Note: The temperatures listed below are taken from the weather station at the center of the city which is at an elevation of [tpl]convert|767|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. At higher elevations, the temperatures will be lower. For example, in areas such as Al-Jubaiha, Sweileh, Khalda, Abu Nser which are at/higher than [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level have average temperatures of [tpl]convert|7|to|9|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] in the day and [tpl]convert|1|to|3|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] at night in January. In August, the average high temperatures in these areas are [tpl]convert|26|to|28|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] in the day and [tpl]convert|14|to|16|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] at night.

==Districts==

The city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) and covers 27 districts which include:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/interactive/districts.asp |title=Greater Amman Muncipality - GAM Interactive |publisher=Ammancity.gov.jo |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]

==Transportation==

The city's largest airport, Queen Alia International Airport, situated about [tpl]convert|30|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Amman, is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier.  The airport expanding was recently done and modified, including the decommissiong of the old terminals and the commission a new terminal costing $700M, to handle over 12 million passengers. Amman Civil Airport is a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the military.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/accelerating-passenger-growth-jordan%E2%80%99s-qaia-suggests-confidence-returning-386395 |title=Accelerating passenger growth at Jordan’s QAIA suggests confidence returning |publisher=Al Bawaba |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]
The Abdoun Bridge spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks. It is the first curved suspended bridge to be built.
Currently under construction are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate as part of the new urban rapid transit network (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman’s busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities, and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus.[tpl]cite web|author=Name * |url=http://english.business.jo/brt-project-on-track-gam/ |title=BRT project on track – GAM | Jordan Business News | Amman Social Business Events | Press Release & opinions |publisher=English.business.jo |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first corridor connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City with major service to the University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with downtown at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830223758/http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archivedate=2010-08-30 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]
There are also plans to construct a three-line metro system in Amman. The first phase consists of two lines, the red and green lines, connecting East, Central, and West Amman with an interchange station (linking the two lines) at Amman Plaza with connections to the Northern and Southern suburbs.  The second phase consists of the yellow line, connecting North and South Amman with an interchange to the red and green lines at the Abdali and City Hall stations.
There are eight circles, or roundabouts, that span and connect West Amman. However, the city lacks an operable rail or metro system which causes severe congestion, especially in old Amman. To add to the congestion, all the Kingdom's highways pass through Amman, further increasing traffic in the capital.
By land, the city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the newly built Rağadan Central Bus Station (near the Roman Amphitheatre in downtown). The city can suffer from considerable traffic congestion at peak hours, especially during the summer months when affluent holidaymakers from the Persian Gulf region spend the summer in Amman to take advantage of its comparatively mild weather.

==Economy==

Amman is positioning itself as a hub for business, and new projects are continually transforming the city's skyline. Following the 2003 Iraq War, a significant portion of business dealings with Iraq flow through Amman in some way. Its airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is the hub of the national carrier, Royal Jordanian, which is a major airline in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/member-airlines/royal-jordanian |title=Royal Jordanian |publisher=oneworld |accessdate=2010-07-04[/tpl] The airline is headquartered in central Amman.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Amman, and Jordan as a whole for that matter, is the Middle East's hub for medical tourism as the kingdom receives the most medical tourists in the region and the 5th highest in the world.  Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and receives over $1 billion annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/jordan-remains-medical-tourism-hub-despite-regional-unrest |title=‘Jordan remains medical tourism hub despite regional unrest’ |publisher=The Jordan Times |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]

The Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in its infrastructure, such as the expansion of Queen Alia International Airport, the construction of a state of the art public transportation system, a national railway, and expansion of road works, will ease the arrival of millions of new visitors and tonnes of cargo through this soon to be regional hub.

===New developments===

New projects and proposals in and around the city include:
East Amman is the historic city centre.  Eastern Amman is more traditional and older than the newer West. Small shops and single-family houses are dominant in East Amman's landscape.  East Amman is the hub for the capital's historic sites and cultural activities.
West Amman is the current economic city centre, and is the modern, stylish extension of Amman.  Malls, shopping centres, expensive hotels, bars and international restaurants are part of West Amman's development.

==Education==

In 2010, there were as many as 14 universities in Amman. University of Jordan is the largest university in Amman,[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] Applied Science University was ranked as the largest private university.

==Archaeology==

During its long history, Amman has been inhabited by several civilizations. The first culture on record is during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, around 7250 BC, when archaeological discoveries in 'Ain Ghazal, located in eastern Amman, showed evidence of not only a settled life but also the growth of artistic work, which suggests that a well-developed culture inhabited the area at that time.[tpl]cite book|author=Carlos E.

==Culture==

===Cuisine===

The New York Times praised the cuisine of Amman. "You’ll find the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan’s neighbor, Iraq. It’s known as the food of the Levant — an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn’t just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/travel/13choicetables.html| last= Pergament | first= Danielle | title= All the Foods of the Mideast at Its Stable Center |publisher= The New York Times| date= 13 January 2008[/tpl]

Most Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman.  Most Jordanian daily newspapers are published in Amman such as Alghad,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alrai.com |title=الرأي الأردنية | أخبار الأردن والشرق الأوسط والعالم|صحيفة يومية تصدر في عمان الأردن |publisher=Alrai.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] Ad-Dustour,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.addustour.com |title=:: جريدة الدستور :: |publisher=Addustour.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl] and the The Jordan Times.

==Main sights==

Much of Amman's tourism is focused in the older downtown area, which is centred around the old souk (a colourful traditional market) and the King Hussein Mosque. The main touristic sites in the city are:
The Jordan Archaeological Museum is home to ancient findings from the whole country.
The newest of mosques is the enormous King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a magnificent blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The most unusual mosque in Amman is the Abu Darweesh Mosque atop Jabal Ashrafieh (the highest point in the city). It is covered with black and white checkered pattern and is unique to Jordan. It is visible from quite some distance. In contrast, the interior is totally free of the black and white scheme. Instead, there are light coloured walls and Persian carpets. This religious building was erected by one of Amman's Circassian minority.

==Tourism and lifestyle==

Amman is considered one of the most "westernized" and liberal cities in the Arab World.  Amman has become one of the most popular destinations for "Western" expats and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab World in general.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/media-jordan-breaking-taboos/ |title=Westernized media in Jordan breaking old taboos — RT |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] The city's culinary scene has expanded from its shwarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular American restaurants and fast-food outlets like McDonald's and T.G.I.
