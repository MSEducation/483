[[Branch and bound]]

CATEGORIES: Optimization algorithms and methods, Combinatorial optimization

Branch and bound (BB or B&B) is a general algorithm for finding optimal solutions of various optimization problems, especially in discrete and combinatorial optimization. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of all candidate solutions, where large subsets of fruitless candidates are discarded en masse, by using upper and lower estimated bounds of the quantity being optimized.
The method was first proposed by A. H. Land and A. G. Doig[tpl]cite article |author = A. H. Land and A. G.

order to provide guaranteed enclosures of the global minimum.

==Applications==

This approach is used for a number of NP-hard problems
Branch-and-bound may also be a base of various heuristics. For example, one may wish to stop branching when the gap between the upper and lower bounds becomes smaller than a certain threshold. This is used when the solution is "good enough for practical purposes" and can greatly reduce the computations required. This type of solution is particularly applicable when the cost function used is noisy or is the result of statistical estimates and so is not known precisely but rather only known to lie within a range of values with a specific probability. An example of its application here is in biology when performing cladistic analysis to evaluate evolutionary relationships between organisms, where the data sets are often impractically large without heuristics[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl].
