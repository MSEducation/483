==History==

Kiwifruit is native to northern China. Other species of Actinidia are native to India, Japan, and southeastern Siberia. 
Cultivation of the fuzzy kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand. The first commercial planting of occurred in New Zealand. The fruit proved popular with American servicemen in New Zealand during World War II. Because of this the fruit was exported to California using the names "Chinese gooseberry" and "melonette". Because the California based importer rejected these names the fruit was re-branded "kiwifruit" after the kiwi bird as the bird and the fruit share a similar appearance and both are associated with New Zealand[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/kiwifruit_ars.html|title=Kiwifruit: Actinidia deliciosa In: Fruits of Warm Climates, 1987|publisher=Center for New Crops & Plant Products at Purdue University|author=Morton J|date=2011|accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl].
Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown fruit from the family Actinidia. in favor of the name Chinese gooseberry.

==Cultivars==

The genus Actinidia contains around 60 species. Though most kiwifruit are easily recognized as kiwifruit (due to basic shape) their fruit is quite variable. The skin of the fruit can vary in size, shape, hairiness, and color. The flesh can vary in color, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable while others taste considerably better than the majority of the commercial varieties.
The most common kiwifruit is the Fuzzy Kiwifruit and comes from the species A. deliciosa. Other species have fruits that are commonly eaten; some examples are Golden Kiwifruit (A. chinensis), Chinese Egg Gooseberry (A. coriacea), Baby Kiwifruit (A. arguta), Arctic Kiwifruit (A. kolomikta), Red Kiwifruit (A. melanandra), Silver Vine (A. polygama), Purple Kiwifruit (A. purpurea).

===Fuzzy kiwifruit===

Almost all kiwifruit in commerce belong to a few cultivars of fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa): 'Hayward', 'Blake', and 'Saanichton 12'. They have a fuzzy, dull-brown skin, and bright-green flesh. The familiar cultivar 'Hayward' was developed by Hayward Wright in Avondale, New Zealand, around 1924.[tpl]cite book|last=Ferguson|first=A. R.|title=Perspectives on new crops and new uses|year=1999|publisher=ASHS Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia|pages=342–347|editor=Janick, Jules|accessdate=January 4, 2012|chapter=New Temperate Fruits: Actinidia chinensis and Actinidia deliciosa|chapterurl=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/pdf/v4-342.pdf[/tpl] It was initially grown in domestic gardens, but commercial planting began in the 1940s.
'Hayward' is the most commonly available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavor. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. 'Blake' can self-pollinate, but it has a smaller, more oval fruit and the flavor is considered inferior. The most common male pollenizer for these varietals is 'Chico'.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

===Golden kiwifruit===

The golden kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Flesh color varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is sweeter and more aromatic in flavor; the flavor is reminiscent of some subtropical fruit. Its short storage life currently limits its commercial potential. One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around the center of the fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit fetches a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwi, is more palatable for consumption without peeling.
A commercially viable variety of this red-ringed kiwi, patented as the EnzaRed™, is a cultivar of the Chinese hong yang variety.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yang|first=Hong-Li|coauthors=Wang, Yan-Chang; Jiang, Zheng-Wang; Huang, Hong-Wen|title=of cDNA library of 'Hongyang' kiwifruit and analysis of F3H expression|journal=Yi Chuan|year=2009|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1265–1272|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1005.2009.01265|pmid=20042395|language=Chinese[/tpl]

===Kiwi berries===

Kiwi berries are composed of three species of kiwifruit, hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta),  Arctic beauty (A. kolomikta), and silver vine (A. polygama). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their growing season. The fruits are edible berry- or grape-sized fruits similar to the fuzzy kiwi in taste and appearance, with thin, smooth skin.  They are referred to as kiwi berry, baby kiwi, dessert kiwi, grape kiwi, or cocktail kiwi.[tpl]cite web|title=Hardy Kiwi|url=http://extension.psu.edu/gardening/fphg/hardy-kiwi|publisher=Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences|accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl]
The cultivar 'Issai' is a hybrid of hardy kiwi and silver vine which can self-pollinate.  Grown commercially because of its relatively large fruit, Issai is less hardy than most hardy kiwi.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Production==

===Cultivation===

Kiwifruit can be grown in most temperate climates with adequate summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwi (A. deliciosa) is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes. 
Kiwifruit is commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring. Kiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year.

===Pollination===

Most of the plants require a male plant to pollinate a female plant for the female plant to produce fruit (dioecious). For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is required. Other varieties can self pollinate, but they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit vines.
Kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate, because the flowers are not very attractive to bees. Some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers. Generally, the most successful approach, though, is saturation pollination, where the bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.

===Storage===

Firm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.[tpl]cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl] Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.

===Pests and diseases===

Pseudomonas syringae actinidiae (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s. This bacterial strain has been controlled and managed successfully in orchards in Asia. In 1992, it was found in northern Italy. In 2007/2008, economic losses were observed, as a more virulent strain became more dominant (PSA V).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/pests/kiwifruit-vine-disease |title= Kiwifruit vine disease by MAF Biosecurity NZ[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/features/primary-focus/4577177/More-virulent-PSA-strain-a-new-worry-for-kiwifruit-growers |title= More virulent PSA strain a new worry for kiwifruit growers |newspaper=The Dominion Post |first = Peter |last= Watson|date= 2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-09-04 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10747234 |title= Relief for kiwifruit industry |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |first = Owen |last= Hembry |date= 2011-08-25 |accessdate=2011-09-04 [/tpl] In 2010 it was found in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty kiwifruit orchards in the North Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/media/8-11-10/suspected-bacterial-vine-infection|title=Suspected Bacterial Vine Infection|date=8 November 2010|publisher=MAF Biosecurity New Zealand|accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl]

===Worldwide production===

Kiwifruit exports rapidly increased from the late 1960s to early 1970s in New Zealand. By 1976, exports exceeded the amount consumed domestically.[tpl]cite web|url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/5794/Economics_wp_1108.pdf?sequence=1 |title=New Zealand Kiwifruit Export Performance: Market Analysis and Revealed Comparative Advantage |publisher=University of Waikato |author=Sayeeda Bano and Frank Scrimgeour |date= June 2011|accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] Outside of Australasia, all New Zealand kiwifruits are now marketed under the brand-name label Zespri.[tpl]cite web|title=Zespri History|url=http://www.zespri.com/about-zespri/history.html|publisher=Zespri Kiwifriut|accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl]
Over 70% of kiwi production is in Italy, New Zealand, and Chile. Italy produces roughly 10% more kiwifruit than New Zealand, and Chile produces 40% less. With these three main production centers, kiwifruit is produced for worldwide consumption roughly all year long.
In the 1980s, countries outside New Zealand began to export kiwifruit.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Skallerud |first1= Kare |last2= Olsen |first2= Svein |year= 2011 |title= Export Market Arrangements in Four New Zealand Agriculture Industrues: An Institutional Perspective |journal= Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 310–329|url= http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxy2.library.usyd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/08974438.2011.621841|accessdate=29 November 2012 |doi=10.1080/08974438.2011.621841[/tpl] In Italy, the infrastructure and techniques required to support grape production have been adapted to the kiwifruit. This, coupled with being very close to the European kiwifruit market, led to Italians becoming the leading producer of kiwifruit. The growing season of Italian kiwifruit does not overlap much with the New Zealand or the Chilean growing seasons, therefore direct competition between New Zealand or Chile was not much of a factor.
Although kiwifruit is a national fruit of China, until recently, China was not a major producing country of kiwifruit, as it was traditionally collected from the wild.[tpl]cite journal|last=Huang|first=H.|coauthors=Ferguson, A.

==Human consumption==

Raw kiwifruit is rich in the protein-dissolving enzyme actinidain (in the same family of thiol proteases as papain), which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products which are not going to be served within hours, because the enzyme soon begins to digest milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts, as well, as the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin very quickly, either liquifying the dessert, or preventing it from solidifying.
To overcome this effect, the United States Department of Agriculture suggests cooking the fruit for a few minutes before adding it to gelatin.[ref]

Sliced kiwifruit has long been regularly used as a garnish atop whipped cream on the common New Zealand and Australian dessert, the pavlova. It can also be used in a variety of other savoury and sweet dishes.

===Animal consumption===

Whitetail deer eat vine-ripened kiwifruit that falls to the ground in August through September, making it a soft mast food source. Kiwis are being used more in food plots for wildlife because of the early ripening period,  providing wildlife with an abundance of sweet fruit during a time when ripened fruit is scarce.[tpl]cite web|title=Wildlife Arctic Beauty Kiwi Plants|url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Buy-Arctic-Beauty-Kiwi-p/fru-kiwi.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl]

===Allergies===

The actinidain found in kiwifruit can be an allergen for some individuals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alemán A et al. |year=2004 |title=Allergy to kiwi: a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge study in patients from a birch-free area |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=543–550 |publisher= |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2003.11.043|pmid=15007359 |pmc= |url= |accessdate=December 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Le TM et al.|title=Kiwifruit allergy across Europe: clinical manifestation and IgE recognition patterns to kiwifruit allergens |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |year=2013|volume=131|issue=1|pages=164–171|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2012.09.009[/tpl] Specifically, people allergic to latex, bananas, papayas, or pineapples are likely to also be allergic to kiwifruit. The fruit also contains calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides. Reactions to these chemicals include sweating, tingling, and sore mouth or throat; swelling of the lips, tongue and face; rash; vomiting and abdominal pain, heartburn; and, in the most severe cases, breathing difficulties, wheezing, and collapse. The most common symptoms are unpleasant itching and soreness of the mouth, with the most common severe symptom being wheezing. Severe symptoms are most likely to occur in young children.

===Nutrition===

Kiwifruit is a rich source of vitamin C (1.5 times the United States DRI per 100 grams) and vitamin K, and a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin E.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/?page_id=180 |title=Kiwifruit: Nutrition . Selection . Storage |publisher=Fruits & Veggies More Matters |accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl] The fruit and skin contain flavonoids, actinidain, and adhered pollen, which may produce irritation in the mouth and throat of some allergic individuals.
