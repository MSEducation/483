==History==

The company was co-founded in 1988 by Susan and Donald Sutherland, who sought ice cream that was neither hard-packed nor soft-serve. Publicity materials describe it as "smooth and creamy super-premium ice cream." Cold Stone Creamery opened its first store that year in Tempe, Arizona.[tpl]cite book|title=International Directory of Company Histories |editor=Pederson, Jay P. |publisher=St. James Press |date=2005-04-29 |volume=69 |isbn=1-55862-544-5| url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cold-Stone-Creamery-Company-History.html |location=Detroit, Michigan |accessdate=2009-10-30[/tpl] The original Cold Stone Creamery, store #0001, is still in operation today at the original location in Tempe.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/google/stores/store_locator.aspx?q=85283 | title=The Cold Stone Creamery Location finder | publisher= ColdStoneCreamery.com | accessdate=2009-04-14[/tpl]
The company's business model is the same as the one originally created by Steve's Ice Cream's founder Steve Herrell. The company uses in-store made ice cream that is combined with mix-ins, candy or other items that is folded into the ice cream to make a new flavor. Cold Stone's name comes from the frozen granite stone, used to mix "mix-ins": candy, nuts, or other edibles into various flavors of ice cream. 
In 1995, Cold Stone Creamery opened its first franchise store in Tucson, soon followed by a store in Camarillo, California, its first out of state. Almost 1,400 franchises are in operation.  Cold Stone Creamery is now the sixth bestselling brand of ice cream in the US and operates stores in Japan,    Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand,[tpl]cite web|work= Phoenix Business Journal |url= http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2010/01/04/daily56.html |title=Cold Stone Creamery gets the scoop on Thailand |publisher= Bizjournals.com |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2012-11-06[/tpl] Brazil Puerto Rico, Indonesia, Guam, China, Mexico, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Nigeria, Kuwait, and Philippines. Cold Stone opened their first franchise in Europe in 2008 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Three more shops were later opened in other parts of the country. The company was also named the 11th fastest-growing franchise by Entrepreneur magazine in January 2006. In June 2009 the company opened its first location in Canada, in Mississauga, Ontario. Two stores opened in Singapore in 2011 and a third one is opening in 2012.
In May 2007, Cold Stone Creamery merged with Kahala Corp to form the company Kahala-Cold Stone, which collectively owns 13 brands. Doug Ducey, former president and CEO of Cold Stone Creamery, was named CEO of the new company.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/assets/pdf/news/Kahala_ColdStone_05_11_07.pdf | title=Kahala and Cold Stone Creamery merge creating new category of franchising company | date= May 11, 2007 | accessdate=2007-10-10[/tpl] Kevin Blackwell, the former CEO of Kahala, became chairman of the board and chief strategist.

===Co-branding===

The parent company of Cold Stone Creamery, Kahala, announced in February 2009 that it had reached an agreement with Canadian coffee shop chain Tim Hortons to open up to 100 co-branded stores in the United States after successfully testing two locations in Rhode Island.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/article/583399 |title=Tim Hortons, Cold Stone to create new stores |date=2009-02-06 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=2009-10-30[/tpl] The strategic alliance will allow Tim Hortons to operate in more US locations while allowing Cold Stone Creamery to expand into Canada. The most notable co-branded store opened in August 2009 when Tim Hortons moved into three Cold Stone Creamery locations in New York City, including its flagship Times Square location.
In June 2009, Cold Stone Creamery started testing the Canadian market by opening seven co-branded locations with Tim Hortons located in Toronto, Oakville, Mississauga, Hamilton, Pickering, Sudbury, and Halifax, Nova Scotia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amherstdaily.com/index.cfm?sid=260024&sc=498 |title=Tim Hortons to co-brand six stores in Ontario with Cold Stone Creamery |date=2009-06-11 |work=Amherst Daily News |location=Amherst, Nova Scotia |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=2009-10-30[/tpl]  They now have locations in every Canadian province except for Newfoundland and Labrador.[tpl]cite web|author=Tim Hortons |url=http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/about/coldstonecreamery.html |title=Cold Stone Creamery Menu |publisher=Tim Hortons |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06[/tpl]
The Tim Hortons venture follows on the footsteps of a similar co-branding efforts in 2007 and 2008. Cold Stone franchisees in New York City began partnering with Soup Kitchen International to sell soup in their stores beginning in late-2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=5853 |title=SoupMan and Cold Stone Team Up |date=2007-11-19 |work=QSR Magazine |accessdate=2009-10-30[/tpl] In 2008, the company signed an agreement with the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory to open seven locations in the Western US. The venture is designed to bring in customers on a year round basis as opposed to the seasonal draws that each company experiences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nrn.com/article.aspx?id=360128 |title=Cold Stone Creamery, chocolatier to co-brand stores |date=2009-11-13 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |accessdate=2009-10-26[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The mingling of Cold Stone and Rocky Mountain led to more than 10% increase in weekly sales in Rocky Mountain stores after co-branding.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docKey=600-200910060830PR_NEWS_USPR_LA87610-4PODQ1S9U59KL6E3NOOLJFUPBP&provider=PR%20Newswire&docDate=October%206%2C%202009&press_symbol=243127&scp=10&sq=Cold%20STone%20Creamery&st=cse |title=Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc.

===Licensing===

Cold Stone has entered into partnerships with other companies to promote brand name products inside its stores. The first major partnership the company entered into was with Kraft Foods for its Jell-O brand in 2009. Cold Stone introduced a series of flavors of ice cream based on popular Jell-O pudding flavors; Chocolate, Butterscotch, Banana, and Vanilla. Because the pudding additives cause the ice cream to gel, it was recently noted that these flavors do not melt.[tpl]cite news |author=Burton, Susan |title=Chemistry in a Cone |url= http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/58059/ |work=New York Magazine |date=2009-07-14[/tpl]
Externally, a 2008 licensing agreement with Jelly Belly had a line of jelly beans flavored like some of Cold Stone's most popular ice cream flavors.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/business/smallbusiness/26sbiz.html?scp=20&sq=Cold%20STone%20Creamery&st=cse |title=Not Just Another Jelly Bean |last=Murphy |first=Kate |date=2008-06-26 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-11-03[/tpl]

==Entertainment==

In the spirit of joviality and to encourage customers to give tips, Cold Stone instructs employees to sing a special song related to the company, usually to the tune of recognizable melodies such as "Take Me Out to the Ball Game", "I've Been Working on the Railroad", or "Bingo", when a customer places money in the tip jar. Lyrics include short, catchy phrases such as, "This is our Cold Stone song, it is not very long."

==Legal issues==

There have been allegations by independent franchises that Cold Stone's business practices have put them at a competitive disadvantage. These former franchises claim that the parent company opens locations too close to each other, requires expensive remodeling and overstates potential revenues and income.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.gazette.com/articles/business_35936___article_pluck.html/cooling_.html |title= Cooling Business:3 of 5 local Cold Stone Creamery stores have shut down in just over a year |last=Cassutt |first=Melissa |date=2008-05-03 |work=The Gazette |language=Colorado Springs, Colorado|accessdate=2009-11-03[/tpl] Other franchises have contended that is not the case and that they are experiencing growth amid financial uncertainties and higher costs associated with fuel and energy prices.[tpl]cite web| title=Cold Stone Creamery in Trouble?| url= http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2008/06/gourmet_ice_cream_shop_in_trou.html|last= Fink| first= Jason| date= 2008-06-18| work=Hoboken Now|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=2009-11-03[/tpl]
In June 2008, the Wall Street Journal examined the issue. The article stated that a large number of locations, approximately 16–20%, of Cold Stone Creamery franchises have closed or were put up for sale by their owners, many of whom had suffered significant financial losses due to their investment. The article included claims by franchisees that the company had misrepresented the average revenues of Cold Stone stores and acted in ways that reduced stores' profit margins. A company spokeswoman said that the number of stores for sale was "at par with industry expectations" in light of "the economically challenging times."[tpl]cite news |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121321718319265569.html |title=The Inside Scoop |first=Richard |last=Gibson |work=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2009[/tpl]
