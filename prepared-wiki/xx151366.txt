==Parametrization of primitive quadruples==

where m, n, p, q are non-negative integers and gcd(m, n, p, q) = 1 and m + n + p + q â‰¡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, all primitive Pythagorean quadruples are characterized by the Lebesgue Identity

==Alternate parametrization==

All Pythagorean quadruples (including non-primitives, and with repetition, though a, b and c do not appear in all possible orders) can be generated from two positive integers a and b as follows:

==Properties==

The biggest number that always divides the product abcd is 12.MacHale, Des, and van den Bosch, Christian, "Generalising a result about Pythagorean triples", Mathematical Gazette 96, March 2012, pp. 91-96. The quadruple with the minimal product is (1, 2, 2, 3).
