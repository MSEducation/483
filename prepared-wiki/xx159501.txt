==Conflict with Assyria==

Nazi-Maruttaš faced a growing threat from the ascendancy of Assyria under Arik-den-ili and his successor Adad-Nīrāri I. The containment of Assyria was conducted through a strategy of flank-attacks supported by his agents, eastern hillmen such as the Gutians, in a protracted war, avoiding a full frontal assault.[tpl] cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380-1000 BC | editor = I. E. S. Edwards | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1975 | pages = 32, 274–275 [/tpl] Under Arik-den-ili, he seems to have had the upper hand, because Adad-Nīrāri, who styles himself “King of the Universe”, later recountsIn the Epic of Adad-Nārāri, tablet VAT 9820 line 12: hi-ib-lat um-ma-ni MAN KUR ka.-.i-i a-bi ul ul-te-.èr. that “my father could not rectify the calamities inflicted by the army of the king of the Kassite land” in a contemporary Assyrian epic.
He is mentioned in the Synchronistic ChronicleSynchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21) tablet C, column 1, lines 24 to 31. as having fought a battle with Adad-Nīrāri's forces at "Kār-Ištar of Ugarsallu". However, the Assyrians won a complete victory over the Babylonians in this battle, plundering their camp and seizing the royal standards, thereby acquiring territory from them and causing the Assyro-Babylonian boundary to be adjusted southward. The conflict is fondly remembered in the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic,Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, extant in fragments BM 98496, BM 98730, BM 98731, BM 121033. in its recounting of past Assyro-Babylonian conflicts,[tpl] cite book | title = Materials for the Study of Kassite History, Vol. I | author = J.
