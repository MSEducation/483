Alfred Burges (1796-1886) was a British civil engineer.  He was apprenticed to the civil engineer James Walker, and in turn trained several other engineers such as Sir Joseph Bazalgette.
Walker and Burges were responsible for railways, bridges and many marine works, including lighthouses, Surrey Commercial Docks, the Junction Dock at Hull, and the Bedford Levels. Their firm is noted in many documents as Messrs. Walker & Burgess, engineers of Limehouse, with his last name being almost always spelt in this way.
He died at Worthing on 12 March 1886 and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery. 
His son, William, became an influential architect.
