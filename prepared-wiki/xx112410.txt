==Pro career==

Andriuškevičius was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the 44th pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. He was then traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers before being traded to the Bulls.
At 2.18 m (7 ft 2 in) and 109 kg (240 lb), he is an intriguing prospect because of his height. He developed through the youth academies at Žalgiris Kaunas, where he was tabbed as one of the top young players in the game. He played in 15 Euroleague games for the club during the 2004–05 season and was originally projected as one of the top picks in the draft, but a disappointing season in Europe and an apparent lack of improvement sent his draft stock spiraling down. That season, he averaged 1.5 points per game and 1.1 rebounds per game in 8 minutes per game in the Euroleague.
Andriuškevičius has noted perimeter skill for a player of his size, and has trained with former NBA center Arvydas Sabonis.
On August 18, 2006, Andriuškevičius was traded by the Cavaliers to the Chicago Bulls for swingman Eddie Basden. On December 21, as a member of the NBA Development League's Dakota Wizards, Andriuškevičius sustained a serious head injury when he was punched by teammate Awvee Storey in an attack during practice in Bismarck, North Dakota. The center suffered a fractured skull, severe concussion, and a two-centimeter hematoma (bruise) on the left side of his brain. Doctors initially thought it would be months before he could speak, but he was able to within a month, and stated his desire to play basketball within a year.http://www.dailyherald.com/sports/story.asp?id=265275 Storey was suspended indefinitely.One player suspended, another hospitalized after fightAndriuskevicius recovering slowly after fight Days later he had his contract terminated and he was dismissed from the league.NBDL player Storey dismissed for punching teammate Andriuškevičius did not wish to pursue charges.
On March 12, 2007, Chicago Bulls doctors cleared Andriuškevičius to participate in contact practices. The Chicago Tribune said it was "a remarkable recovery from the serious brain injury".http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/cs-070312bullsbits,1,2713730.story?coll=cs-bulls-headlines On April 6, head coach Scott Skiles considered moving the player to the active roster, as he soon started practicing.http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/cs-070406bullsbits,1,5400710.story?coll=cs-bulls-headlines However, Andriuškevičius never logged a regular season appearance for the Bulls.
On August 11, 2007 his agent announced that he would play in Joventut Badalona, and he signed for the team five days later, but his contract with the team was cancelled shortly after.Joventut rescinds Baxter contract, cuts Andriuskevicius – News – Welcome to ULEB Cup
