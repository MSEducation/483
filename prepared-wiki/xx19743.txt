[tpl]nihongo|Junichiro Koizumi|小泉 純一郎|Koizumi Jun'ichirō|extra=born January 8, 1942[/tpl] is a Japanese politician who was the 87th Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006. He retired from politics when his term in parliament ended in 2009, and was the fifth longest serving prime minister in the history of Japan.
Widely seen as a maverick leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he became known as an economic reformer, focusing on Japan's government debt and the privatization of its postal service. In 2005, Koizumi led the LDP to win one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern Japanese history. Koizumi also attracted international attention through his deployment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, and his visits to Yasukuni Shrine led to diplomatic tensions with neighboring China and South Korea.
Although Koizumi maintained a low profile for several years after leaving office, he returned to national attention in 2013 as an advocate for abandoning nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which contrasted with the pro-nuclear views espoused by the LDP governments both during and after Koizumi's term in office.[tpl]cite news|last=Nishiyama|first=George|title=Fukushima Watch: Popular Ex-PM Koizumi Comes Out Against Nukes|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/10/02/popular-ex-pm-koizumi-comes-out-against-nuclear-power/|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal Japan Real Time|date=2 October 2013[/tpl] 

==Early life==

Koizumi is a third-generation politician. His father, Jun'ya Koizumi, was director general of the Japan Defense Agency and a member of the Diet. His grandfather, Koizumi Matajirō,called "Tattoo Minister" because of his big tattoo on his body, and the leader of Koizumi Gumi in Kanagawa (a big group of "yakuza") was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications under Prime Ministers Hamaguchi and Wakatsuki and an early advocate of postal privatization. See Koizumi family.
Born in Yokosuka, Kanagawa prefecture on January 8, 1942, Koizumi was educated at Yokosuka High School and Keio University, where he studied economics. He attended University College London before returning to Japan in August 1969 upon the death of his father.
He stood for election to the lower house in December; however, he did not earn enough votes to win election as a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) representative. In 1970, he was hired as a secretary to Takeo Fukuda, who was Minister of Finance at the time and was elected as Prime Minister in 1976.
In the general elections of December 1972, Koizumi was elected as a member of the Lower House for the Kanagawa 11th district. He joined Fukuda's faction within the LDP. Since then, he has been re-elected ten times.

==Member of House of Representatives==

Koizumi gained his first senior post in 1979 as Parliamentary Vice Minister of Finance, and his first ministerial post in 1988 as Minister of Health and Welfare under Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. He held cabinet posts again in 1992 (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the Miyazawa cabinet) and 1996–1998 (Minister of Health and Welfare in the Uno and Hashimoto cabinets).
In 1994, with the LDP in opposition, Koizumi became part of a new LDP faction, Shinseiki, made up of younger and more motivated parliamentarians led by Taku Yamasaki, Koichi Kato and Koizumi, a group popularly dubbed "YKK" (after the YKK Group well known for manufacturing zippers).[tpl]cite news|title=Ohashi's anti-Koizumi campaign goes on without policies|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ohashi's+anti-Koizumi+campaign+goes+on+without+policies.-a077236555|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=Kyodo News|date=17 July 2001[/tpl] 
After Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned in 1994 and the LDP returned to power in a coalition government, Koizumi and Hosokawa teamed up with Shusei Tanaka of New Party Sakigake in a strategic dialogue across party lines regarding Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Although this idea was not popular within the LDP and never came to fruition, Koizumi and Hosokawa maintained a close working relationship across party lines, with Hosokawa tacitly serving as Koizumi's personal envoy to China during times of strained Sino-Japanese relations.[tpl]cite news|title=「細川・小泉」あるか２度目の連携|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASFK09013_Z00C14A1000000/?dg=1|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=日本経済新聞|date=9 January 2014[/tpl] 
Koizumi competed for the presidency of the LDP in September 1995 and July 1998, but he gained little support losing decisively to Ryutaro Hashimoto and then Keizō Obuchi, both of whom had broader bases of support within the party. However, after Yamasaki and Kato were humiliated in a disastrous attempt to force a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori in 2000, Koizumi became the last remaining credible member of the YKK trio, which gave him leverage over the reform-minded wing of the party.
On April 24, 2001, Koizumi was elected president of the LDP. He was initially considered an outside candidate against Hashimoto, who was running for his second term as Prime Minister. However, in the first poll of prefectural party organizations, Koizumi won 87 to 11 percent; in the second vote of Diet members, Koizumi won 51 to 40 percent. He defeated Hashimoto by a final tally of 298 to 155 votes.Anderson, Gregory E., "Lionheart or Paper Tiger? A First-term Koizumi Retrospective" (Archive), Asian Perspective 28:149–182, March 2004. He was made Prime Minister of Japan on April 26, and his coalition secured 78 of 121 seats in the Upper House elections in July.

==Prime minister==

===Domestic policy===

Within Japan, Koizumi pushed for new ways to revitalise the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganize the factional structure of the LDP. He spoke of the need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future.
In the fall of 2002, Koizumi appointed Keio University economist and frequent television commentator Heizō Takenaka as Minister of State for Financial Services and head of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to fix the country's banking crisis. Bad debts of banks were dramatically cut with the NPL ratio of major banks approaching half the level of 2001.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] The Japanese economy has been through a slow but steady recovery,[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] and the stock market has dramatically rebounded. The GDP growth for 2004 was one of the highest among G7 nations, according to the International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] Takenaka was appointed as a Postal Reform Minister in 2004 for the privatization of Japan Post, operator of the country's Postal Savings system.
Koizumi moved the LDP away from its traditional rural agrarian base toward a more urban, neoliberal core,[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] as Japan's population grew in major cities and declined in less populated areas, although under current purely geographical districting, rural votes in Japan are still many times more powerful than urban ones. In addition to the privatization of Japan Post (which many rural residents fear will reduce their access to basic services such as banking), Koizumi also slowed down the LDP's heavy subsidies for infrastructure and industrial development in rural areas. These tensions made Koizumi a controversial but popular figure within his own party and among the Japanese electorate.

===Foreign policy===

Although Koizumi's foreign policy was focused on closer relations with the United States and UN-centered diplomacy, which were adopted by all of his predecessors, he went further to pursue supporting the US policies in the War on Terrorism. He decided to deploy the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, which was the first military mission in active foreign war zones since the end of the World War II. Many Japanese commentators indicated that the favorable US-Japan relation was based on the Koizumi's personal friendship with the US President George W. Bush. In the North Korean abductions and nuclear development issues, he took more assertive attitudes than his predecessors.'「自衛隊のイラク人道復興支援活動に関する特別世論調査」の概要', Cabinet Office of Japan

====Self-Defense Forces policy====

Although Koizumi did not initially campaign on the issue of defense reform, he approved the expansion of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and in October 2001 they were given greater scope to operate outside of the country. Some of these troops were dispatched to Iraq. Koizumi's government also introduced a bill to upgrade the Japan Defense Agency to ministry status; finally, the Defense Agency became the Japanese Ministry of Defense on January 9, 2007."Diet closes for summer, puts lid on Koizumi legacy[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]," Japan Times (registration required), June 17, 2006.

====Visits to Yasukuni Shrine====

Koizumi has often been noted for his controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, starting on August 13, 2001. He visited the shrine six times as prime minister. Because the shrine honors Japan's war dead, which also include many convicted Japanese war criminals and 14 executed Class A war criminals, these visits drew strong condemnation and protests from both Japan's neighbours, mainly China and South Korea, and many Japanese citizens. China and South Korea's people hold bitter memories of Japanese invasion and occupation during the first half of the 20th century. China and South Korea refused to have their representatives meet Koizumi in Japan and their countries. There were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders from October 2001, and between South Korean and Japanese leaders from June 2005. The standstill ended when the next prime minister Abe visited China and South Korea in October 2006.
In China, the visits led to massive anti-Japanese riots. The president, ruling and opposition parties, and much of the media of South Korea openly condemned Koizumi's pilgrimages.[ref]
"Lawmakers visit Japanese Embassy to protest Koizumi's planned Seoul trip[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]," The Korea Herald, October 12, 2001.[/ref] Many Koreans applauded the president's speeches criticizing Japan, despite the South Korean President's low popularity. When asked about the reaction, Koizumi said the speeches were "for the domestic (audience)".
Although Koizumi signed the shrine's visitor book as "Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan", he claimed that his visits were as a private citizen and not an endorsement of any political stance."Koizumi not backing down on Yasukuni," The Japan Times (registration required), January 26, 2006. China and Korea found the claims weak as excuses. Several journals and news reports in Japan, such as one published by Kyodo News Agency on August 15, 2006, questioned Koizumi's statement of private purpose, as he recorded his position on the shrine's guestbook as prime minister. He visited the shrine annually in fulfillment of a campaign pledge. Koizumi's last visit as prime minister was on August 15, 2006, fulfilling a campaign pledge to visit on the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4789905.stm|work=BBC News|title=Koizumi shrine visit stokes anger|date=August 15, 2006|accessdate=April 3, 2010[/tpl]
Eleven months after his resignation as prime minister, Koizumi revisited the shrine on August 15, 2007, to mark the 62nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. His 2007 visit attracted less attention from the media than his prior visits while he was in office.Yahoo news[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]Former Japanese PM Koizumi Visits War Shrine in Tokyo (Update4)

====Statements on World War II====

On August 15, 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II, Koizumi publicly stated that Japan was deeply saddened by the suffering it caused during World War II and vowed Japan would never again take "the path to war".[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/pacific.victoryday/|work=CNN[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] However, Koizumi was criticized for actions which allegedly ran contrary to this expression of remorse (e.g. the Yasukuni visits), which resulted in worsening relations with China and South Korea.

===Popularity===

Koizumi was at certain points in his tenure an extremely popular leader. Most people know him very well due to his trademark wavy grey hair. His outspoken nature and colourful past contributed to that; his nicknames included "Lionheart", due to his hair style and fierce spirit, and "Maverick". During his tenure in office, the Japanese public referred to him as Jun-chan (the suffix "chan" in the Japanese language is used as a term of familiarity, typically between children, "Jun" is a contraction of Junichiro). In June 2001, he enjoyed an approval rating of 85 percent.Koizumi's popularity hits fresh peak[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl], CNN, June 12, 2001.
In January 2002, Koizumi sacked his popular[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka, replacing her with Yoriko Kawaguchi. Following an economic slump and a series of LDP scandals that claimed the career of YKK member Koichi Kato, by April Koizumi's popularity rating had fallen 40 percentage points since his nomination as prime minister."Koizumi ally quits politics over scandal," BBC News, April 8, 2002.
Koizumi was re-elected in 2003 and his popularity surged as the economy recovered. His proposal to cut pension benefits as a move to fiscal reform turned out to be highly unpopular. Two visits to North Korea to solve the issue of abducted Japanese nationals only somewhat raised his popularity, as he could not secure several abductee's returns to Japan. In the House of Councilors elections in 2004, the LDP performed only marginally better than the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
In 2005, the House of Councilors rejected the contentious postal privatization bills. Koizumi previously made it clear that he would dissolve the lower house if the bill failed to pass. The Democratic Party, while expressing support for the privatization, made a tactical vote against the bill. Fifty-one LDP members also either voted against the bills or abstained.
On August 8, 2005, Koizumi, as promised, dissolved the House of Representatives and called for snap elections. He expelled rebel LDP members for not supporting the bill. The LDP's chances for success were initially uncertain; the secretary general of New Komeito (a junior coalition partner with Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party) said that his party would entertain forming a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Japan if the DPJ took a majority in the House of Representatives."New Komeito exec signals willingness to jump LDP ship," The Japan Times(registration required), July 28, 2005.
Koizumi's popularity rose almost twenty points after he dissolved the House and expelled rebel LDP members. Opinion polls ranked the government's approval ratings between 51 and 59 percent. The electorate saw the election in terms of a vote for or against reform of the postal service, which the Democratic Party and rebel LDP members were seen as being against.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The September 2005 elections were the LDP's largest victory since 1986, giving the party a large majority in the House of Representatives and nullifying opposing voices in the House of Councilors. In the following Diet session, the last to be held under Koizumi's government, the LDP passed 82 of its 91 proposed bills, including postal privatization. A number of Koizumi-supported candidates known as "Koizumi Children" joined the Diet in this election and supported successive LDP governments until the 2009 elections, when most were defeated.

==Retirement==

Koizumi announced that he would step down from office in 2006, per LDP rules, and would not personally choose a successor as many LDP prime ministers have in the past. On September 20, 2006, Shinzo Abe was elected to succeed Koizumi as president of the LDP. Abe succeeded Koizumi as prime minister on September 26, 2006.
Koizumi remained in the Diet through the administrations of Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, but announced his retirement from politics on September 25, 2008, shortly following the election of Taro Aso as Prime Minister. He retained his Diet seat until the next general election, when his son Shinjiro was elected into the same seat representing the Kanagawa 11th district in 2009."Koizumi to exit political stage", The Japan Times, September 26, 2008.

Since leaving office as prime minister, Koizumi has not granted a single request for an interview or television appearance, although he has given speeches and had private interactions with journalists.[tpl]cite news|last=Okubo|first=Maki|title='We've been lied to,' said ex-Prime Minister Koizumi|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/views/column/AJ201401120009|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun|date=12 January 2014[/tpl] 

==Anti-nuclear advocacy==

Koizumi returned to the national spotlight in October 2013, after seven years of largely avoiding attention, when he gave a speech to business executives in Nagoya in which he stated: "We should aim to be nuclear-free... If the Liberal Democratic Party were to adopt a zero-nuclear policy, then we'd see a groundswell of support for getting rid of nuclear energy." He recalled Japan's reconstruction in the wake of World War II and called for the country to "unite toward a dream of achieving a society based on renewable energy."
Koizumi had been a proponent of nuclear power throughout his term as prime minister, and was one of the first pro-nuclear politicians to change his stance on the issue in the wake of the Fukushima disaster of 2011. His dramatic remarks were widely covered in the Japanese media, with some tabloids speculating that he may break away from the LDP to form a new party with his son Shinjiro. Economy Minister Akira Amari characterized Koizumi's stance as pure but simplistic, while other LDP administration officials downplayed the potential impact of Koizumi's views. Former prime minister Naoto Kan, however, expressed hope that Koizumi's status as then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "boss" would help put pressure on the government to minimize or eliminate nuclear power in Japan.[tpl]cite news|last=Nishiyama|first=George|title=Fukushima Watch: Former PM Koizumi Picks Up Anti-Nuclear Torch|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/10/16/fukushima-watch-former-pm-koizumi-picks-up-anti-nuclear-torch/|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal Japan Real Time|date=16 October 2013[/tpl] 
Koizumi defended his change of stance, stating in November that "it is overly optimistic and much more irresponsible to think nuclear power plants can be maintained just with the completion of disposal facilities... We had failed to secure sites for final disposal even before an accident occurred," concluding that "it's better to spend money on developing natural energy resources--citizens are more likely to agree with that idea--than using such large amounts of expenses and energy to advance such a feckless project nuclear power."[tpl]cite news|title=Koizumi hits back at criticism of sudden no-nuclear stance|url=https://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201311040051|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun|date=4 November 2013[/tpl] He explained that in August, he had visited a nuclear waste disposal facility in Finland, where he learned that nuclear waste would have to be sealed up for 100,000 years. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun in November 2013 found that 54% of the public supported Koizumi's anti-nuclear statements.[tpl]cite news|title=Ex-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi urges zero nuclear power|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2013/11/13/Ex-Japanese-Prime-Minister-Junichiro-Koizumi-urges-zero-nuclear-power/UPI-57011384370937/|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=UPI|date=13 November 2013[/tpl] Koizumi told one reporter that he felt lied to by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, which characterized nuclear power as a safe alternative to fossil fuels, stating that "we certainly had no idea how difficult it is to control nuclear energy."
Koizumi reportedly approached Morihiro Hosokawa, who served as Prime Minister in an anti-LDP coalition cabinet in the 1990s, to run for Governor of Tokyo in the February 2014 gubernatorial election on the platform of opposing the Abe government's pro-nuclear policy.[tpl]cite news|title=細川元首相が出馬か？　東京都知事選　見えてきた戦いの構図|url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20140105-00010000-noborder-pol|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Noborder|date=5 January 2014|quote=1月4日、『週刊ポスト』と『日刊ゲンダイ』がビッグネームの出馬の可能性を伝えたのだ。それは、元首相の細川護煕氏を、元首相の小泉純一郎氏が推すという驚愕の構図だ。[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=細川元首相、都知事選候補に浮上　「脱原発」争点に|url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASG187HX7G18UTFK00W.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=朝日新聞|date=9 January 2014|quote=立候補した際には「脱原発」を最大の争点にする意向だ。このため、同じく「脱原発」を掲げる小泉氏との連携を重視。小泉氏からの支援を受けられるかどうか慎重に見極めている。[/tpl]

===Family===

Koizumi married 21-year-old university student Kayoko Miyamoto in 1978. The couple had been formally introduced to each other as potential spouses, a common practice known as omiai. The wedding ceremony at the Tokyo Prince Hotel was attended by about 2,500 people, including Takeo Fukuda (then Prime Minister), and featured a wedding cake shaped like the National Diet Building. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982, as Kayoko was reportedly unhappy with her married life for several reasons."Japan's Destroyer," TIME, September 10, 2001. After this divorce, Koizumi never married again, saying that divorce consumed ten times more energy than marriage."ex-wife ready to lend a hand, has 'nothing to lose'," Kyodo News, May 9, 2001.
Koizumi had custody of two of his three sons: Kōtarō Koizumi and Shinjirō Koizumi, who were reared by one of his sisters. Shinjiro is the representative for Kanagawa's 11th district, a position his father has also filled. The youngest son, Yoshinaga Miyamoto, now a graduate of Keio University, was born following the divorce"Japanese, a Typical Tale of Divorce," The Washington Post, May 19, 2001. and has never met Koizumi.
