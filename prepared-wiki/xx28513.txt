==Advantages and disadvantages==

Tubal ligation is an abdominal surgery. One study found that postoperative complications from tubal ligation are more likely than with vasectomy and more costly.  In industrialized nations, mortality is 4 per 100,000 tubal ligations, versus 0.1 per 100,000 vasectomies.[tpl]cite journal| title = Complications of vasectomy. | author = Ninaad S.

Tubal ligation has a larger initial cost than other contraceptive methods. It may take more than a decade of use for tubal ligation to become as cost-effective as other highly effective, long term methods like IUD or implant.  Continued method costs or costs from unintended pregnancies make many other methods as or more costly than tubal ligation if used for several years.[tpl]cite journal|journal = American Journal of Public Health|title=Economic value of contraception|author = James Trusell, et al.|date=April 1995|volume = 85|issue = 4|pages= 494–503|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/85/4/494.pdf|format=PDF|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.85.4.494|pmid = 7702112|pmc = 1615115[/tpl]  The cost of tubal ligation is reduced if it is performed during a cesarean section, since the tubes are already exposed during the laparotomy.
Tubal ligation may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, with some studies estimating the relative risk at 0.66 for epithelial types, 0.40 for endometrioid types and 0.73 for serous types.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq030[/tpl]

==Tourism==

Medical tourism is likely to be used for expensive and more complicated surgeries; however tubal ligation is on the list of available procedures.[tpl]clarify|reason=Which list does this refer to, specifically?|date=April 2013[/tpl] Women opting for tubal ligation would likely combine their convalesce in/with a vacation-type setting.  There are a large number of overseas hospitals whose websites list tubal ligation as one of their qualified surgical procedures. Medical tourism is gaining popularity (especially with higher-cost surgeries) as the overall cost of care in developing countries can provide a combination of high-tech medical care at a cost that allows for more enjoyable recovery in a vacation-type setting.  Medical tourism is somewhat controversial, and has come under the scrutiny of some governments the concerns of which include quality of care, follow-up and post-operative care.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.01.017 |title=Medical tourism: Assessing the evidence on treatment abroad |year=2010 |last1=Lunt |first1=Neil |last2=Carrera |first2=Percivil |journal=Maturitas |volume=66 |pages=27–32 |pmid=20185254 |issue=1[/tpl]
