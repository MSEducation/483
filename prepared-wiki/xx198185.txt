[[Bochicidae]]

CATEGORIES: Pseudoscorpions

Bochicidae is a family of pseudoscorpions distributed throughout the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico with one species found as far north as Texas. Members of the family can be diagnosed mainly by features of the claws, notably the presence of exactly 12 trichobothria on each claw (members of other similar families possess many more) and a long, as opposed to short, venom duct. Some species live in caves while some are surface-dwelling.
Muchmore (1998) includes the genera Paravachonium and Vachonium in this family but many authors place these in a separate family, Vachoniidae.
