Trondheim ([tpl]IPA-no|ˈtrɔnhɛjm[/tpl]), historically  Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. With a population of 181 513 (October 1, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. It is also the third largest city in the country, with a population of 170,242 inhabitants within the city borders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/beftett/tab-2012-09-06-02.html |title=Tabell 2 Folkemengde og areal i tettsteder. Kommune. 1. januar 2012 |publisher=Ssb.no |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl] The city functions as the administrative centre of Sør-Trøndelag county. Trondheim lies on the south shore of the Trondheimsfjord at the mouth of the river Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), SINTEF, St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.
The settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and was the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Archdiocese of Nidaros; since it has remained the seat of the Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.

==History==

Trondheim was named Kaupangen ([tpl]lang-en|market place or trading place[/tpl]) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997. Fairly soon, it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: "hird"-man) of King Olav. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.
People have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at Øretinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the river Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865–933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I – called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th-century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.
Trondheim was the seat of the (Catholic) Archdiocese of Nidaros for Norway from 1152. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.
The city has experienced several major fires. Since it was a city of log buildings, made out of wood, most fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; these were only the worst cases. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the "Horneman Fire") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegaten were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of roughly 8000 inhabitants. After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Trøndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered after 10 months. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.
During World War II, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The home of the most notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, it was also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (DORA 1), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern ("Northern Star"), centred [tpl]convert|15|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of Øysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.Hitlers drøm om Trondheim [tpl]no icon[/tpl]

===Municipal history===

The city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was transferred to Trondheim. Then on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which just about doubled the population of the municipality.[tpl]cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian[/tpl]

===Toponymy===

The city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros ([tpl]lang-en|Mouth of the river Nid[/tpl]), or Niðaróss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr ("city") or, more specifically, kaupangr í Þróndheimi ("the city in the district Þróndheimr", i.e. Trøndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just Þróndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark-Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem. The flag of Trondheim is one of the few Norwegian municipal flags that is not the banner of arms of the municipal coat-of-arms.]]
Following the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had given this result: 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros.[tpl]Cite news|first=Terje T. V.|last=Bratberg|title=Striden om bynavnet|work=Arbeideravisa|location=Trondheim|page=27|date=10 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]no icon[/tpl] Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bispedømme ([tpl]lang-en|Diocese of Nidaros[/tpl]) in 1918.
Shortly during World War II Trondheim has been named Drontheim, as a German exonym.
Historically, Trondheimen indicates the area around the Trondheimsfjord. The spelling Trondhjem was officially rejected, but many still prefer that spelling of the city's name. Today, most natives still refer to the city as Trånnjæmm.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

===Coat-of-arms and seal===

The coat-of-arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolize the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolize justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolize the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by Håkon Thorsen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trondheim.no/content.ap?thisId=519505|title=Trondheim's coat of arms and seal|accessdate=29 October 2008|publisher=Trondheim kommune[/tpl]

==Geography==

Trondheim is situated where the river Nidelva meets Trondheimsfjorden with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.
The municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, [tpl]convert|565|m[/tpl] above sea level. At summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon–there is no darkness(no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/trondheim.html|title=Trondheim, Norway – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year – Gaisma |publisher=Gaisma.com |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl] At winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:00, stays very low above the horizon, and sets at 14:30.

===Climate===

Trondheim city has a predominantly hemiboreal Oceanic climate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/008/c00907.htm |title=World Weather Information Service – Trondheim |publisher=Worldweather.org |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl] but borders on humid continental and subarctic climate. The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters (January mean at Klett 1961-90 is [tpl]convert|-5.5|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]). The part close to the fjord, such as the city center, has milder winters (January mean Trondheim city center 58 m amsl based on the years 1961-90 was [tpl]convert|-2.5|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], but recent years have been warmer.Trøndelag area climate history Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. The warmest temperature ever recorded is [tpl]convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on 22 July 1901, and the coldest is [tpl]convert|-26.1|°C|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in February 1899. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1961-90 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least [tpl]convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] snow cover on the ground and 22 days with daily minimum temperature [tpl]convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or colder. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as Byåsen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. The daily high temperature can exceed [tpl]convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from late April to late September, but not reliably so. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Trøndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost [tpl]convert|2|C-change[/tpl] in the last 25 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://met.no/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2007/11november/speilsalen.html|publisher=met.no|title=Nyhet fra Meteorologisk institutt|date=27 November 2007|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
The weather station at Voll (127 m amsl) in Trondheim started operating in 1923, but was discontinued in 1967 and did not start up again until 1997. The lapse rate is approximately [tpl]convert|0.6|C-change|1[/tpl] per [tpl]convert|100|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl], so the city center will be about [tpl]convert|0.6|C-change|1[/tpl] warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.

===Fauna===

Several wetland habitats can be found within the city limits. The Gaulosen is one of these. Here you will find a newly built observation tower and information on the birdlife which can be found therein.
Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article347991.ece |title = Bymarkbeveren skal holdes i sjakk|accessdate=3 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]no icon[/tpl] Badgers and foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one year olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. Since 2002, a wolverine has stayed in Bymarka.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/dokument/article1077747.ece|title=Jerven som flyktet til byen|accessdate=9 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]no icon[/tpl]

==Cityscape==

Most of the downtown area of Trondheim is scattered with small specialty stores and shops, however a considerable part of the downtown shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianized streets Nordre gate ([tpl]lang-en|Northern street[/tpl]), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city center also is riddled with everything from old, well established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.
In the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn were renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping mall was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.
DORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the World War II occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.
Kristiansten Fortress, built 1681–1684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.
A statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central plaza, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.
The islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a World War II anti-aircraft gun station.
Stiftsgården is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Schøller. At 140 rooms constituting [tpl]convert|4000|m2|0[/tpl], it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.

===Nidaros Cathedral===

The Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trondheim.com/content.ap?thisId=5510350 |title=Pilgrim ways in Norway, background|accessdate =4 August 2007|publisher=Trondheim kommune[/tpl] with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the Jämtland and Värmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.
During the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c27283/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28740|title=The consecration of King Harald and Queen Sonja|accessdate=3 August 2007|publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family[/tpl] On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess Märtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c28617/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28747|title=The wedding of Princess Märtha Louise|accessdate=3 August 2007|publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family[/tpl]
The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately [tpl]convert|640|km[/tpl] long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along the Lake Mjøsa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the  Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims, and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Kulturminner/Kulturmiljoer/Pilegrimsleden/|title=Pilegrimsleden (Miljøstatus i Norge)|language=Norwegian[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Raju|first=Alison|year=2010|title=The Pilgrim Road to Nidaros: St Olav's Way - Oslo to Trondheim|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=978-1-85284-314-4[/tpl]
