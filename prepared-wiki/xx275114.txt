[[1997 Malmö FF season]]

CATEGORIES: Malmö FF seasons, Swedish football clubs 1997 season

Malmö FF were seriously involved in the 1997 chase for the Allsvenskan title, but fell short due to dropped points against bottom teams Degerfors and Öster in the 24th and 25th rounds out of 26. Having been unbeaten at home all season, playing decent possession football, the economic woes of the club forced them to sell Daniel Andersson and Yksel Osmanovski to Bari of Serie A the coming summer.
