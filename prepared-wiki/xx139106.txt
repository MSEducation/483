==Name==

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Øiestad farm (Old Norse: Øyjarsstaðir), since the first church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of the male name Øyjarr and the last element is staðir which means "homestead" or "farm".[tpl]cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nedenes amt|edition=8|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W.
