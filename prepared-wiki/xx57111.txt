Belikin is the leading domestically produced beer brand in Belize.
Belikin is brewed by the Belize Brewing Company, Ltd. which is owned by the Bowen family. The Belize Brewing Company was established in 1969, and began brewing Belikin Beer and Belikin Stout brand name in 1971. Its tagline is "The Beer of Belize".
The name "Belikin" comes from the Maya language and means "Road to the East". This is a term which some have suggested is the origin of the name of "Belize" (although the most accepted derivation says the name comes from the Belize River, meaning "muddy"). The Belikin label features a drawing of a Pre-Columbian Maya temple-pyramid at Altun Ha.
The most common Belikin is a light lager beer. Lighthouse Lager, Belikin Premium and a stout beer are also brewed and sold under the Belikin name.
The brewery is based in Ladyville, Belize District. 
Belikin currently exports its Beer and Premium to a distributor in Los Angeles, California.  The distributor ships to select high end alcohol stores across the United States.
