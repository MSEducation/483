[[Three Men's Morris]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract strategy games

Three Men's Morris is an abstract strategy game played on a three by three board (counting lines) 
that is similar to tic-tac-toe. It is also related to Six Men's Morris and Nine Men's Morris.

==Rules==

Each player has three pieces. The winner is the first player to align their three pieces on a line drawn on the board.
The board is empty to begin the game, and players take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections. Once all pieces are placed (assuming there is no winner by then), play proceeds with each player moving one of their pieces per turn. A piece may move to any vacant point on the board, not just an adjacent one.[tpl]cite book |last=Bell |first=R.

According to A History of Chess page 614, each player moves one of their pieces in turn, following one of two rules according to version; a player wins if thereby they get three pieces in a line:
Harold James Ruthven Murray calls version #1 "nine holes" and version #2 "three men's morris" or "the smaller merels".

==History==

The earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was "cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt" c. 1400 BCE. When played on this board, the game is called Tapatan in the Philippines and Luk Tsut K'i ("six man chess") in China.[tpl]cite journal |last=Culin |first=Stewart |date=October–December 1900 |title=Philippine Games |journal=American Anthropologist, New Series |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=pp. 643–656 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294%28190010%2F12%292%3A2%3A4%3C643%3APG%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-01-09 [/tpl] It is thought that Luk Tsut K'i was played during the time of Confucius c. 500 BCE.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/rowgames/tapatan.html |title=Tapatan |accessdate=2007-01-09 |date=2005-09-12 |work=Row Games |publisher=Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games [/tpl] Centuries later, the game was mentioned in Ovid's Ars Amatoria, according to R. C. Bell. In book III (c. 8 CE), after discussing chess, Ovid wrote:
Boards were carved into the cloister seats at the English cathedrals at Canterbury, Gloucester, Norwich, Salisbury and Westminster Abbey; the game was quite popular in England in the 13th century. These boards used holes, not lines, to represent the nine spaces on the board—hence the name "nine holes"—and forming a diagonal row did not win the game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/rowgames/nineholes.html |title=Nine Holes |accessdate=2007-01-09 |date=2005-09-12 |work=Row Games |publisher=Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games [/tpl]
The name of the game may be related to Morris dances (and hence to Moorish). However, according to Daniel King, "the word 'morris' has nothing to do with the old English dance of the same name. It comes from the Latin word merellus, which means a counter or gaming piece."[tpl]cite book |last=King |first=Daniel |title=Games |year=2003 |publisher=Kingfisher plc |isbn=0-7534-0816-3 |pages=10–11 [/tpl]
