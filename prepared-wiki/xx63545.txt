[[Sea Scout]]

CATEGORIES: Scouting, Water sports

Sea Scouts are members of the international Scouting movement, with a particular emphasis on boating and water-based activities. These activities can be on the sea, rivers or lakes. Sea Scouts can provide a chance to sail, cruise on boats, learn navigation, learn how to work on engines and compete in regattas. Sea Scouts often have distinctive uniforms. In some countries or scout organizations, Sea Scouting is a program just for older Scouts.
