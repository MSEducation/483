</ref> The projected cost of its construction increased from [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]759,000 in 1910 to CDN$2.5 million in 1913; its final cost was CDN$2,480,349.05 ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|CA|2480349.05|1918[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars[tpl]inflation-fn|CA[/tpl]). Upon its completion in 1918, it was named for [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII]].
It was designed to facilitate mass transit; its upper deck accommodated trams, while both the Don Valley phase and the Rosedale Valley phase included a lower deck for rail transport, controversial at the time because of its high additional cost. The bridge's designer and the commissioner of public works R.C. Harris were able to have their way, and the lower deck eventually proved to save millions of dollars when the Toronto Transit Commission's Bloor–Danforth subway, opened in 1966, was able to use the Don Valley phase with no major structural changes to cross the Don River Valley.  The Rosedale Valley phase was not used for the subway, as the curve between each phase - as well as the curve to the west at Parliament Street - was considered too sharp for the subway.  A separate bridge was built over Rosedale Valley west of the Castle Frank Subway Station at the west end of the Bloor–Danforth Viaduct. This covered subway bridge was designed by John B. Parkin and Associates with De Leuw Cather Canada (now Delcan) and completed in 1966.

===Growth of Toronto===

The Prince Edward Viaduct has had two major impacts on the development of Toronto as a city. First, the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct resulted in more rapid development of those portions of Toronto lying on the east side of the Don Valley. Secondly, the construction of the Bloor–Danforth line of the Toronto Transit Commission's subway system in the 1960s was significantly facilitated by the viaduct architect's decision to have a lower deck on the bridge.

==Suicides and accidental falls==

Over time, the Prince Edward Viaduct became a magnet for suicide. This not only posed a risk to the lives of the jumpers, but also to the traffic underneath, which was in danger of being hit by a falling body.  It was also possible for a child to climb onto the railing and fall accidentally while walking along it.
With nearly 500 suicides by 2003, the Viaduct ranked as the second most fatal standing structure in North America, after the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-01-13/news/0301130268_1_viaduct-birney-bridge |title=A barrier to hopeless souls |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=January 13, 2003 |publisher=Tribune Company |location=Baltimore, Maryland |issn=1930-8965 |quote="We look at this bridge and know there are at least 480 souls at the bottom who spent the last moment of their life on the way down.

While awaiting approval of the barrier and during construction, which was subject to numerous delays, 48 to 60 suicides took place at the bridge. The Luminous Veil received a Canadian Architect Award of Excellence in 1999.[tpl]cite journal |date=August 2001 |title=Suicide prevention barrier |url=http://www.cdnarchitect.com/issues/ISarticle.asp?id=70662&story_id=CA99959&issue=08012001&PC=&RType= |deadurl=yes |magazine=Canadian Architect |publisher=Business Information Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022012732/http://www.cdnarchitect.com/issues/ISarticle.asp?id=70662&story_id=CA99959&issue=08012001&PC=&RType= |archivedate=October 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 [/tpl]
