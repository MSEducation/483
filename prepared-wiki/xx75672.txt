===Religion===

Brownback told Rolling Stone that he had moved from mainline Protestantism to evangelicalism before his 2002 conversion to Catholicism.[tpl]cite news|last=Copeland|first=Libby|title=Faith-Based Initiative|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/06/AR2006060601616_pf.html|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=7 June 2006[/tpl]
Raised as a Methodist, Brownback later joined a nondenominational evangelical church, Topeka Bible Church, which he still regularly attends, even though in 2002 he was received into Catholicism through Father C. John McCloskey from the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross  in Washington DC.
Brownback was a cosponsor of the Constitution Restoration Act, which would have limited the power of federal courts to rule on church/state issues. When he was a senator, Brownback told Rolling Stone that he chaired the Senate Values Action Team, an off-the-record weekly meeting of representatives from religious conservative organizations.

==Early career==

Brownback was an attorney in Manhattan, Kansas before becoming the Kansas secretary of agriculture in 1986. In 1990, he was accepted into the White House Fellow program and detailed to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative from 1990 to 1991. Brownback then returned to Kansas to resume his position as secretary of agriculture and remained in that position until 1993. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 and next ran in the 1996 special election to replace Senator Bob Dole, who had resigned his seat during his presidential campaign, beating appointed Republican Sheila Frahm.

==U.S. Senator==

===Elections===

Sheila Frahm was appointed to fill the seat of U.S. Senator Bob Dole when Dole resigned in 1996 to campaign for president. Brownback defeated Frahm in the 1996 Republican primary and went on to win the general election against Democrat Jill Docking. In 1998 Brownback was elected to a full six-year term, defeating Democrat Paul Feleciano. He won reelection in the 2004 Senate election with 69% of the vote, defeating his Democratic challenger, Lee Jones, a former Washington, D.C. lobbyist.

===Tenure===

Brownback was a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee (where he chaired the Subcommittee on District of Columbia when the Republicans were in the majority), the Joint Economic Committee, and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, which he at one time chaired. The Helsinki Commission monitors compliance with international agreements reached in cooperation with Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Brownback did not run for reelection in 2010, in accordance with his support of term limits for members of Congress.http://monroecountyclarion.stltoday.com/articles/2007/03/22/opinions/sj2tn20070320-0321cla_garcia.ii1.txt
In 2000, Brownback and Congressman Chris Smith led the effort to enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.Library of Congress: Thomas. House Resolution 3244. Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 President Clinton signed the legislation in October 2000. According to Christianity Today, the stronger enforcement increased the number of U.S. federal trafficking cases eightfold in the five years after enactment.Alford, Deann. "Free at Last", Christianity Today, February 21, 2007
In 2001 Brownback submitted S.1465107, which authorized Presidential waivers for foreign aid to Pakistan. S.1465107 passed by a unanimous unrecorded vote of Senators present. The Pakistani government used U.S. foreign aid in an attempt to bribe Mujahideen and Taliban militants inside that country. Taliban commanders and Mujahideen commander Nek Mohammed openly admitted that they intended to use the foreign aid money to repay loans which they had received from al Qaeda.
As of August 12, 2007, in the 110th Session of Congress, Brownback had missed 123 votes due to campaigning (39.7 percent) — surpassed only by Tim Johnson (D) of South Dakota who due to a critical illness had missed 100% of the votes of the 110th Session, and John McCain (R) of Arizona with 149 votes missed due to campaigning (48.1 percent).Washington Post."Missed Votes", August 12, 2007

===C Street residence===

On April 1, 2010, news sources reported that Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) had urged an ethics investigation into a possible violation of the Senate's gifts rule by Republican senators lodging in a townhome owned by C Street Center, Inc., in turn owned by Christian-advocacy group The Fellowship.  According to the report, Brownback, three additional senators, and four U.S. representatives were staying in the townhome.  CREW alleged that the property, rented out for $950 a month per person, was being let well under the rate of similar lodging in the neighborhood, which regularly ran from $4,400 to $7,500.
Brownback supporters argued that the rooms rented out at C Street were not the equivalent of individual apartments with private bathrooms, kitchens, and living rooms. The lawmakers share communal space. Senator Tom Coburn's spokesman John Hart told The Hill: "Anyone who has spent 10 minutes on Craigslist would realize that C Street residents pay fair-market value,” Hart said. “Residents at the Street boarding house have one bedroom. Most share a bathroom. All pay for their own meals and share personal space with the other residents and guests. They even share the remote … they fight over their favorite channel.”[tpl]cite web|author=April 2, 2010 4:12 PM |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/bogus-ethics-complaint-targets-coburn-demint-brownback |title=Bogus Ethics Complaint Targets Coburn, DeMint, Brownback |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] In addition, Hart has pointed out that there are several Craigslist ads that demonstrate that $950 is clearly fair market value for a room on Capitol Hill.cjonline.com[tpl]dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl]

===Abortion===

Brownback signed three anti-abortion bills in 2011. In April 2011, he signed a bill banning abortion after 21 weeks based on the contested belief that fetuses can feel pain at that point, and a bill requiring that a doctor get a parent's notarized signature before providing an abortion to a patient younger than 17.Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signs bills restricting abortion In May 2011, Brownback approved a bill prohibiting insurance companies from offering abortion coverage as part of general health plans unless the procedure is necessary to save a woman's life.

===Health care===

In August 2011, Brownback announced he was declining a $31.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to set up an insurance exchange as part of the federal health care reform law. In May 2011, Brownback had directed the state's insurance commissioner to slow the implementation timeline for the exchange development.  Upon announcing the refusal of the budgeted grant money for the state, his office stated, "There is much uncertainty surrounding the ability of the federal government to meet its already budgeted future spending obligations. Every state should be preparing for fewer federal resources, not more. To deal with that reality Kansas needs to maintain maximum flexibility. That requires freeing Kansas from the strings attached to the Early Innovator Grant.”  The move was unanimously supported by the delegates of the state party central committee at its August 2011 meeting, but a The New York Times editorial criticized Brownback for turning down the grant which could have helped ease the state's own budget: "Instead of letting Kansas design its own model program for an online computer exchange to help people choose among health insurance providers, Mr. Brownback’s rebuff increases the likelihood that the state must design one at its own expense or see federal officials create an exchange, as required under the new law."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/gov-brownbacks-selective-budget-worries.html | date=August 14, 2011 | title=Gov.
