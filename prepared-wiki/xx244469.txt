==History==

===Formation===

missFlag's members have known each other years before forming the band. The group first started working together as a one time Tribute act for the British Rock band Coldplay.
In its earlier days the band consisted of five members, including the musician and songwriter Ohad Eilam (Guitar and Vocals). Later on the band continued working as a four piece band.

===First EP===

Shortly after the Coldplay tribute, the group started to perform, write and record their own music, which led to the creation of their first release - a self produced EP of 5 songs which was printed in only 1,000 copies.
The EP caught the ear of music producer and songwriter from Los Angeles, California Guy Erez (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gipsy Kings, Adam Cohen, Sarah Bettens)[tpl]cite web | author=AllMusic | title=Guy Erez| url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p616594/credits|pure_url=yes[/tpl][/tpl] who later produced missFlag's first studio album.

Of course the timing is good: now that Keane's lead singer is in rehab we need a new New Coldplay. But missFlag brings a beautifully shambling sensibility to the epic chord changes and winsome melodies.|30px|30px|Joan Anderman, The Boston Globe September 10, 2006.[tpl]cite news | author=The Boston Globe | title=Fresh starts from Rap to Rock |author=Joan Anderman|publisher= The Boston Globe| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/09/10/fresh_starts_from_rap_to_rock/ | date=September 10, 2006[/tpl][/tpl]

===To Infinity===

In early 2007, the group finished writing a lot of new material, from which 10 songs were chosen for the purpose of recording their debut studio album. "To Infinity" was produced by L.A. based producer Guy Erez and came to light later that year. The Album was a mile stone for the band in the crowded US market. Later that year, the group released a single from the album, called "Hidden Thieves" a rock ballad that caught the ear of the renowned radio D.J. and "taste-maker" Nic Harcourt from KCRW, the California based public radio station. (Credited for discovering Travis, Dido, Coldplay, Norah Jones, Pete Yorn, and David Gray). The Jerusalem Post reviewed the album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1170359791430|title=Infinity album review|publisher=Jerusalem Post[/tpl]
