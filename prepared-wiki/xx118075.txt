[[Area-to-area Lee model]]

CATEGORIES: Radio frequency propagation

The Lee model for area-to-area mode is a radio propagation model that operates around 900 MHz. Built as two different modes, this model includes an adjustment factor that can be adjusted to make the model more flexible to different regions of propagation. 

==Applicable to/under conditions==

This model is suitable for using in data collected . The model predicts the behaviour of all links that has ends in specific areas.

==Coverage==

Frequency: 900 MHz band

==Mathematical formulation==

===The model===

The Lee model is formally expressed as:
where,

===Calculation of reference path loss===

The reference path loss is usually computed along a 1 km or 1 mile link. Any other suitable length of path can be chosen based on the applications.
where,

===Calculation of adjustment factors===

The adjustment factor is calculated as:
where,

===Base-station antenna height correction factor===

where,
or
where,

===Base-station antenna gain correction factor===

where,

===Mobile-station antenna height correction factor===

where,

===Mobile-antenna gain correction factor===
