Hamburgisch is a group of Northern Low Saxon varieties spoken in Hamburg, Germany. Occasionally, the term Hamburgisch is also used for Hamburg Missingsch, a variety of standard German with Low Saxon substrates. These are urban dialects that have absorbed numerous English and Dutch loanwords, for instance Törn ‘trip’ (Hamburg is pronounced [tpl]IPA-de|ˈhambɔrç|[/tpl] in these dialects, with a "ch" similar to that in the standard German word Milch. Typical of the Hamburg dialects and other Lower Elbe dialects is the pronunciation (and spelling) eu (pronounced oi ) for the diphthong [tpl]IPA|/œɪ/[/tpl] (written öö, öh or ö), e.g.
However, as in most other Low Saxon (Low German) dialects, the long monophthong [tpl]IPA|/øː/[/tpl] is pronounced [tpl]IPAblink|øː|ø[/tpl] (as in French peu), for instance Kööm ~ Kœm [tpl]IPA|kʰøːm[/tpl] ‘caraway’.
The Low Saxon language in Hamburg is divided in several subdialects, e.g.
The Hamborger Veermaster is a famous sea shanty sung in the regional dialect.
