[[Soft palate]]

CATEGORIES: Palate

The soft palate (also known as velum or muscular palate) is, in mammals, the soft tissue constituting the back of the roof of the mouth.  The soft palate is distinguished from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone.

==Structure==

===Muscles===

The five muscles of the soft palate, play important roles in swallowing and breathing. The muscles are: 
These muscles are innervated by the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini. The tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.[tpl]cite book|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|title=Gray's anatomy for students|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8089-2306-0|coauthors=Vogl, Wayne; Tibbitts, Adam W.M.

==Function==

The soft palate is moveable, consisting of muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. It is responsible for closing off the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for closing off the airway. During sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.
In humans, the uvula hangs from the end of the soft palate. Research shows that the uvula is not actually involved in snoring processes.  This has been shown through inconsistent results from uvula removal surgery.  Snoring is more closely associated with fat deposition in the pharynx, enlarged tonsils of Waldeyer's ring, or deviated septum problems.  Touching the uvula or the end of the soft palate evokes a strong gag reflex in most people.

===Speech===

A speech sound made with the middle part of the tongue (dorsum) touching the soft palate is known as a velar consonant. 
It is possible for the soft palate to retract and elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity in order to produce the oral speech sounds. If this separation is incomplete, air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as nasal.

===Modelling===

Within the microstructure of the soft palate, lie a variety of complexly oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density distribution. The tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear, and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. Young modulus values range from 585Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409Pa where the soft palate attaches to the maxilla.

Quantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout the course of its development and correction.

Finite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling of soft-palate extension and movement.  It has also been an effective tool for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and cleft lip.

===Disease===

Pathology of the soft palate includes mucosal lesions such as pemphigus vulgaris, herpangina and migratory stomatitis,[tpl]cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Drucker S, Pallmon S |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |date=Aug 2011 |pmid=21763590 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0190-9622/PIIS0190962210004883.pdf| format=PDF[/tpl] and muscular conditions such as the congenital cleft palate and cleft uvula.
