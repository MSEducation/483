Dean Heath Garrett (born November 27, 1966) is a retired American professional basketball player, 6'11" tall, who played the center position.
He attended the San Clemente High School in San Clemente, California, where he earned All-Conference, All-County and All-Southern California honors as a senior (1983/84). Then he played collegiately at the City College of San Francisco (CC) (1984/85-1985/86), where he led his team to the state finals where it was defeated by Sacramento City College.  The winning continued when he accepted a scholarship to Indiana University (1986/87-1987/88), with whom he won the 1987 NCAA National Championship. He was selected with a 38th overall (13th in 2nd round) pick in the 1988 NBA draft by Phoenix Suns, but did not play in the NBA for eight following seasons, playing instead in Europe (in Italy and Greece). Only prior to the 1996/97 season he was recruited, as free agent, by the NBA franchise, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and afterwards played in the NBA for the following five seasons, for Denver Nuggets (1997/98), Timberwolves again (1998/99-2001/02), and Golden State Warriors (2001/02), where he was traded in midseason.
During those six seasons he played in 359 games, and averaged solid numbers of 19.4 minutes played, 4.8 points, 
5.0 rebounds, 1.0 blocks, and 0.480 field goal percentage per game.
After retirement he was living in Las Vegas when friends from Minneapolis contacted him about a business proposition in Minnesota. He moved to Minnesota and became a part owner in three businesses: a restaurant, a nightclub and a wireless phone retailer, according to a "Where Are They Now?" article published by NBA.com.TIMBERWOLVES: Where Are They Now?
