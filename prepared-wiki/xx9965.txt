Robert Carlyle Byrd (born Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr.; November 20, 1917[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]June 28, 2010) was a United States Senator from West Virginia. A member of the Democratic Party, Byrd served as a U.S. Representative from 1953 until 1959 and as a U.S. Senator from 1959 to 2010. He was the longest-serving U.S. Senator and, at the time of his death, the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress.[tpl]cite web|last=Kellman |first=Laurie |url=http://news.aol.com/article/senator-robert-c-byrd-is-longest-serving/771641 |title=Senator Robert C.

Byrd was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s, serving as a recruiter and leader for his chapter, but later left the group and denounced racial intolerance.
Initially elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952, Byrd served there for six years before being elected to the Senate in 1958. He rose to become one of the Senate's most powerful members, serving as secretary of the Senate Democratic Caucus from 1967 to 1971 and—after defeating his longtime colleague, Ted Kennedy—as Senate Majority Whip from 1971 to 1977. Byrd led the Democratic caucus as Senate Majority Leader from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as Senate Minority Leader from 1981 to 1987. From 1989 to 2010 he served as the President pro tempore of the United States Senate when the Democratic Party had a majority, and as President pro tempore emeritus during periods of Republican majority beginning in 2001. As President pro tempore, he was third in the line of presidential succession, behind the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He also served as the Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations from 1989 to 1995, 2001 to 2003, and 2007 to 2009, giving him extraordinary influence over federal spending.
Byrd's seniority and leadership of the Appropriations Committee enabled him to steer a great deal of federal money toward projects in West Virginia.[tpl]cite web|author=Woodward, Calvin |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwN-a1Gd2DPOkyrFlgw1cp4y37gwD9GKHAM80 |title=The Associated Press: Byrd's passions: Poetry, power and home-state pork |publisher=Google |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] Critics derided his efforts as pork spending[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100628/ap_on_re_us/us_byrd_s_legacy |title=Pork or progress?

He filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and supported the Vietnam War, but later backed civil rights measures and criticized the Iraq War.

==Background==

Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr. in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to Cornelius Calvin Sale Sr. and his wife Ada Mae Kirdy.[tpl]cite web|title=BYRD, Robert Carlyle, (1917–2010)|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=b001210|accessdate=January 22, 2009[/tpl] When he was ten months old, his mother died in the 1918 Flu Pandemic.

Byrd was valedictorian at Mark Twain High School in Tams, West Virginia[tpl]cite web|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html|title=Robert C. Byrd: A Lifelong Student|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl] and successively attended Beckley College, Concord College, Morris Harvey College, and Marshall University, all in West Virginia. He joined Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

===Marriage===

On May 29, 1937, Byrd married Erma Ora James (June 12, 1917 – March 25, 2006) who was born to a coal mining family in Floyd County, Virginia.[tpl]cite web|title=Erma Ora James Byrd|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/erma_byrd.html[/tpl] Her family moved to Raleigh County, West Virginia, where she met Byrd when they attended the same school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

====Children====

Robert Byrd had two children, Mona Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore; two sons-in-law, Mohammad Fatemi and Jon Moore; six grandchildren, Erik Byrd Fatemi, Mona Byrd Moore Pearson, Darius Fatemi, Mary Anne Moore Clarkson, Fredrik Fatemi, and Jon Michael Moore (deceased automobile accident in the 1980s); and seven great-grandchildren, Caroline Byrd Fatemi, Emma James Clarkson, Kathryn James Fatemi, Hannah Byrd Clarkson, Michael Yoo Fatemi, Anna Cristina Fatemi, and James Matthew Fatemi.

===Ku Klux Klan===

In the early 1940s, Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to create a new chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in Sophia, West Virginia.
According to Byrd, a Klan official told him, "You have a talent for leadership, Bob ... The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation." Byrd later recalled, "Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, it did." Byrd became a recruiter and leader of his chapter. When it came time to elect the top officer (Exalted Cyclops) in the local Klan unit, Byrd won unanimously.
In 1946, Byrd wrote to segregationist Mississippi Senator Theodore G. Bilbo:[tpl]cite book|last1=Katznelson|first1=Ira|title=When Affirmative Action was White|year=2005|page=81|isbn=0-393-05213-3[/tpl]

Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.|Robert C. Byrd, in a letter to Sen. Theodore Bilbo (D-MS), 1946[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061801105_pf.html |title=A Senator's Shame |work = The Washington Post |date= |accessdate= March 5, 2013 |first=Eric |last=Pianin[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Katznelson |first= Ira |title= When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History Of Racial Inequality In Twentieth-century America |publisher= Norton |year= 2005 |page=81[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1946 or 1947, Byrd wrote a letter to a Grand Wizard stating, "The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation."King, Colbert I.Sen. Byrd: The view from Darrell's barbershop[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl], The Washington Post, March 2, 2002 However, when running for the United States House of Representatives in 1952, he announced "After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan." He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was anti-communist.
In 1997, Byrd told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also: "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena.""The Democrats' Lott".  The Wall Street Journal. December 28, 2002. In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." Byrd also said, in 2005, "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times ... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened."

==Early career==

Byrd worked as a gas-station attendant, a grocery-store clerk, a shipyard welder during World War II, and a butcher, before he won a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1946, representing Raleigh County from 1947 to 1950. In 1950, he was elected to the West Virginia Senate, where he served from 1951 to 1952. After being elected to the United States House of Representatives, he began night classes at American University Washington College of Law in 1953, but did not receive his J.D. degree from the university until a decade later, by which time he was a U.S. Senator. President John F. Kennedy spoke at the commencement ceremony on June 10, 1963 and mentioned Byrd by name, referencing Byrd's achievement. Byrd also studied at The George Washington University Law School but did not receive an undergraduate degree until 1994, when he graduated from Marshall University.
In 1951, then–State Delegate Robert Byrd was among the official witnesses of the execution of Harry Burdette and Fred Painter, which was the first use of the electric chair in West Virginia.[tpl]cite web|title=Time Trail, West Virginia, February 1998 Programs|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|date=1998-02-00|url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/timetrl/ttfeb.html[/tpl] In 1965 the state abolished capital punishment, with the last execution having occurred in 1959.

==Congressional service==

In 1952, Byrd was elected to the United States House of Representatives for West Virginia's 6th congressional district, succeeding E. H. Hedrick, who retired from the House to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination Governor. Byrd was re-elected to the House twice, serving from January 3, 1953 to 1959. Byrd defeated Republican incumbent W. Chapman Revercomb for the United States Senate in 1958. Revercomb's record supporting civil rights had become an issue, playing in Byrd's favor. Byrd was re-elected to the Senate eight times. He was West Virginia's junior senator for his first four terms; his colleague from 1959 to 1985 was Jennings Randolph, who had been elected on the same day as Byrd's first election in a special election to fill the seat of the late Senator Matthew Neely.
While Byrd faced some vigorous Republican opposition in his career, his last serious electoral opposition occurred in 1982 when he was challenged by freshman Congressman Cleve Benedict. Despite his tremendous popularity in the state, Byrd ran unopposed only once, in 1976. On two other occasions – in 1994 and 2000 – he won all 55 of West Virginia's counties. In his re-election bid in 2000, he won all but seven precincts. Shelley Moore Capito, a Congresswoman and the daughter of Byrd's longtime foe, former governor Arch Moore, Jr., briefly considered a challenge to Byrd in 2006 but decided against it.
In the 1960 Democratic presidential election primaries, Byrd – a close Senate ally of Lyndon B. Johnson – endorsed and campaigned for Hubert Humphrey over front-runner John F. Kennedy in the state's crucial primary.[tpl]cite news|last=Lawrence|first=William H.|title=Politics: New Campaign Tactics Emerge; West Virginia's Popularity Contest Now Takes On Deeper Meaning for the National Campaign|work=The New York Times|date=May 1, 1960[/tpl] However, Kennedy won the state's primary and eventually the general election.[tpl]cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Michael|title=John F.

===Public service records===

Byrd was elected to a record ninth consecutive full Senate term on November 7, 2006. He became the longest-serving senator in American history on June 12, 2006, surpassing Strom Thurmond of South Carolina with 17,327 days of service.[tpl]cite news | title=Byrd poised to break Thurmond's record | author=Jonathan Allen | publisher=The Hill | date=May 31, 2006 | url=http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/053106/news2.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060614190120/http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/053106/news2.html| archivedate=June 14, 2006[/tpl] On November 18, 2009, Byrd became the longest-serving member in congressional history, with 56 years, 320 days of combined service in the House and Senate, passing Carl Hayden, an Arizona politician.[tpl]cite news | title=West Virginia's Byrd becomes the longest-serving member of Congress | author=Tom Cohen |publisher=CNN | date=November 18, 2009 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/18/robert.byrd.congress.record/index.html[/tpl] Previously, Byrd had held the record for the longest unbroken tenure in the Senate (Thurmond resigned during his first term and was re-elected seven months later). Including his tenure as a state legislator from 1947 to 1953, Byrd's service on the political front exceeded 60 continuous years. Byrd, who never lost an election, cast his 18,000th vote on June 21, 2007, the most of any senator in history.[tpl]cite news | title=Another milestone for Sen.

Upon the death of former Florida Senator George Smathers on January 20, 2007, Byrd became the last living United States Senator from the 1950s.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Senators Who Have Cast More than 10,000 Votes | publisher=United States Senate Democratic Policy Committee Vote Information Office | date=January 3, 2009 | url=http://senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/10000_or_more_votes.htm U.S. Senate | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
Byrd was the last surviving senator to have voted on a bill granting statehood to a U.S. territory. At the time of Byrd's death, fourteen sitting or former members of the Senate had not been born when Byrd's tenure in the Senate began, President Barack Obama among them.

===Committee assignments===

These are the committee assignments for Sen. Byrd's 9th and final term.

===Filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964===

Byrd joined with Democrat senators to filibuster the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[tpl]Cite journal | title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 | publisher=Find Us Law | url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] personally filibustering the bill for 14 hours, a move he later said he regretted.[tpl]cite news| title = Byrd Says He Regrets Voting For Patriot Act| agency = Associated Press |work=Common Dreams | date = February 28, 2006| url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0228-07.htm| accessdate =October 3, 2006 [/tpl] Despite an 83-day filibuster in the Senate, both parties in Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Act, and President Johnson signed the bill into law.[tpl]Cite journal | title=U.S. Senate, June 10, 1964: Civil Rights Filibuster Ended | publisher=United States Senate | url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Civil_Rights_Filibuster_Ended.htm | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Byrd also opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 2005, Byrd told The Washington Post that his membership in the Baptist church led to a change in his views. In the opinion of one reviewer, Byrd, like other Southern and border-state Democrats, came to realize that he would have to temper "his blatantly segregationist views" and move to the Democratic Party mainstream if he wanted to play a role nationally.
Because of his opposition to desegregation, Byrd was a member of the wing of the Democratic Party that opposed desegregation and civil rights imposed by the federal government. However, despite his early career in the KKK, Byrd was linked to such senators as John C. Stennis, J. William Fulbright and George Smathers, who based their segregationist positions on their view of states' rights in contrast to senators like James Eastland, who held a reputation as a committed racist.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Leadership roles===

Byrd served in the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christ as, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. "I want to do this, and would you help me?" He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." Byrd himself had told Smathers that " I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never
in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim."George A. Smathers. United States Senator from Florida, 1951-1969. "Interview #6: Senate Democratic Leadership." Tuesday, September 19, 1989. Interviewed by Donald A. Ritchie http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Smathers_interview_6.pdf
In 1976, Byrd was the "favorite son" Presidential candidate in West Virginia's primary. His easy victory gave him control of the delegation to the Democratic national convention. Byrd had the inside track as majority whip but focused most of his time running for majority leader, more so than for re-election to the Senate, as he was virtually unopposed for his fourth term. By the time the vote for majority leader came, his lead was so secure that his lone rival, Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, withdrew before the balloting took place. From 1977 to 1989 Byrd was the leader of the Senate Democrats, serving as majority leader from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as minority leader from 1981 to 1987.

====Appropriations Committee====

Byrd was well known for steering federal dollars to West Virginia, one of the country's poorest states. He was called the "King of Pork" by Citizens Against Government Waste.[tpl]Cite journal| title=Citizens Against Government Waste: Byrd Droppings | publisher=Citizens Against Government Waste | url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_byrddroppings| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] After becoming chair of the Appropriations Committee in 1989, Byrd set a goal securing a total of [tpl]Nowrap|$1 billion[/tpl] for public works in the state. He passed that mark in 1991, and funds for highways, dams, educational institutions and federal agency offices flowed unabated over the course of his membership. More than 30 existing or pending federal projects bear his name. He commented on his reputation for attaining funds for projects in West Virginia in August 2006, when he called himself "Big Daddy" at the dedication for the Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center.[ref]
Herald-Dispatch[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2009[/tpl][/ref] Examples of this ability to claim funds and projects for his state include the Federal Bureau of Investigation's repository for computerized fingerprint records as well as several United States Coast Guard computing and office facilities.[tpl]cite news|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|title=Sen.

====Parliamentary expertise====

Byrd also was known for using his knowledge of parliamentary procedure. Byrd frustrated Republicans with his encyclopedic knowledge of the inner workings of the Senate, particularly prior to the Reagan Revolution. From 1977 to 1979 he was described as "performing a procedural tap dance around the minority, outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the Senate's arcane rules."[tpl]cite news | author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg | title=DISPUTE IN THE SENATE: THE PLAYERS; Behind the Scenes, an Army of Senate Aides Takes On the Filibuster Fight | date=May 20, 2005 |work=The New York Times | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13FD3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482[/tpl] In 1988, majority leader Byrd moved a call of the Senate, which was adopted by the majority present, in order to have the Sergeant-at-Arms arrest members not in attendance. One member (Robert Packwood, R-Oregon) was escorted back to the chamber by the Sergeant-at-Arms in order to obtain a quorum."Who is the Sergeant-at-Arms, and what does he/she do? How is the position filled?" (May 3, 2003). CSPAN.

====President pro tempore====

As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd served as President pro tempore four times when his party was in the majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and outgoing Vice President Al Gore broke the tie in favor of the Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, as a result of the 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

===Scholarships and TAH History Grants===

In 1969, Byrd launched a Scholastic Recognition Award; he also began to present a savings bond to valedictorians from high schools—public and private—in West Virginia. In 1985 Congress approved the nation's only merit-based scholarship program funded through the U.S. Department of Education, a program which Congress later named in Byrd's honor. The Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program initially comprised a one-year, $1,500 award to students with "outstanding academic achievement" who had been accepted at a college or university. In 1993, the program began providing four-year scholarships.
In 2002 Byrd secured unanimous approval for a major national initiative to strengthen the teaching of "traditional American history" in K-12 public schools.[tpl]Cite journal | author=Miriam E.

===Senate historian===

Television cameras were first introduced to the House of Representatives on March 19, 1979, by C-SPAN. Unsatisfied that Americans only saw Congress as the House of Representatives, Byrd and others pushed to televise Senate proceedings to prevent the Senate from becoming the "invisible branch" of government, succeeding in June 1986.
To help introduce the public to the inner workings of the legislative process, Byrd launched a series of one hundred speeches based on his examination of the Roman Republic and the intent of the Framers. Byrd published a four-volume series on Senate history: The Senate: 1789–1989: Addresses on the History of the Senate.[ref]
Government Printing Office, 1989–94[/ref] The first volume won the Henry Adams Prize of the Society for History in the Federal Government as "an outstanding contribution to research in the history of the Federal Government." He also published The Senate of the Roman Republic: Addresses on the History of Roman Constitutionalism.[ref]
Government Printing Office, 1995[/ref]
In 2004, Byrd received the American Historical Association's first Theodore Roosevelt-Woodrow Wilson Award for Civil Service; in 2007, Byrd received the Friend of History Award from the Organization of American Historians. Both awards honor individuals outside the academy who have made a significant contribution to the writing and/or presentation of history.

===Final-term Senate highlights===

==Political views==

===Race===

Late in his life, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring racial segregation.[tpl]cite news| title = What About Byrd?| publisher = Slate| date = December 18, 2002| url =http://www.slate.com/id/2075662| accessdate =September 17, 2007 [/tpl]"Sen.

He said joining the KKK was "the greatest mistake I ever made." Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. "The death of my grandson caused me to stop and think," said Byrd, adding he came to realize  that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/capitolhistory/ram/byrd.ram |title=C-SPAN |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Byrd was the only senator to vote against both Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court, the only two African-American nominees. In the former instance, Byrd asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to look into what Byrd believed to be the possibility that Marshall had either connections to communists or had a communist past.[ref]
Johnson, Scott. Saying Goodbye to a Great One, Weekly Standard, June 1, 2005.[/ref] In the latter instance, Byrd stated that he was offended by Thomas' use of the phrase "high-tech lynching of uppity blacks" in his defense and that he was "offended by the injection of racism" into the hearing. He called Thomas' comments a "diversionary tactic" and said "I thought we were past that stage." Regarding Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges against Thomas, Byrd supported Hill.Byrd, Robert.

In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional [tpl]Nowrap|$10 million[/tpl] in federal funding for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently."[tpl]cite web|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/2005_june/06_27_2005.html |title=Robert Byrd Senate Office|publisher=Byrd.senate.gov |date=June 27, 2005 |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl]
In a March 4, 2001 interview with Tony Snow, Byrd said of race relations:

===Clinton impeachment===

Byrd initially said that the impeachment proceedings against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt to make light of the allegations, he made the motion to dismiss the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_106_1.htm |title=U.S. Senate |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl]

===Gay rights===

Byrd strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 efforts to allow gays to serve in the military and supported efforts to limit gay marriage. In 1996, before the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act, he said, "The drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal. ... Let us defend the oldest institution, the institution of marriage between male and female as set forth in the Holy Bible."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/11/us/senators-reject-both-job-bias-ban-and-gay-marriage.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Senators Reject Both Job-Bias Ban And Gay Marriage | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=September 11, 1996 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]
Despite his previous position, he later stated his opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment and argued that it was unnecessary because the states already had the power to ban gay marriages.[ref]

===Abortion===

He was pro-choice and in 1995 voted against a ban on intact dilation and extraction, a late-term abortion procedure typically referred to by its opponents as "partial-birth abortion", but voted for a ban on subsequent occasions. Byrd voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which recognizes a "child in utero" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of a crime of violence.
In 2003, Byrd voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which prohibits intact dilation and extraction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=1&vote=00402 |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 108th Congress – 1st Session |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl]

===George W. Bush era===

Byrd praised the nomination of John G. Roberts to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Likewise, Byrd supported the confirmation of Samuel Alito to replace retiring Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Like most Democrats Byrd opposed Bush's tax cuts and his proposals to change the Social Security program.
Byrd opposed the 2002 Homeland Security Act, which created the Department of Homeland Security, stating that the bill ceded too much authority to the executive branch.
He also led the opposition to Bush's bid to win back the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress cannot amend, but lost overwhelmingly. In the 108th Congress, however, Byrd won his party's top seat on the new Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.
In July 2004, Byrd released the book Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency, which criticized the Bush presidency and the war in Iraq.

====Iraq War====

Byrd led a filibuster against the resolution granting President George W. Bush broad power to wage a "preemptive" war against Iraq, but he could not get even a majority of his own party to vote against cloture."Senate approves Iraq war resolution" (October 11, 2002). CNN.
Byrd was one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Byrd anticipated the difficulty of fighting an insurgency in Iraq, stating on March 13, 2003,
[tpl]quote|If the United States leads the charge to war in the Persian Gulf, we may get lucky and achieve a rapid victory. But then we will face a second war: a war to win the peace in Iraq. This war will last many years and will surely cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In light of this enormous task, it would be a great mistake to expect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much higher in this conflict.[tpl]cite web|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2003march/byrd_speeches_2003march_list/byrd_speeches_2003march_list_2.html |title=Senator Byrd – Senate Speeches |publisher=Byrd.senate.gov |date=March 13, 2003 |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
On March 19, 2003, when Bush ordered the invasion after receiving congressional approval, Byrd said,
Byrd also criticized Bush for his speech declaring the "end of major combat operations" in Iraq, which Bush made on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. Byrd stated on the Senate floor,
On October 17, 2003, Byrd delivered a speech expressing his concerns about the future of the nation and his unequivocal antipathy to Bush's policies. Referencing the Hans Christian Andersen children's tale The Emperor's New Clothes, Byrd said of the president: "the emperor has no clothes." Byrd further lamented the "sheep-like" behavior of the "cowed Members of this Senate" and called on them to oppose the continuation of a "war based on falsehoods."
Byrd accused the Bush administration of stifling dissent:
[tpl]quote|The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack. The drums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of our predicament in stark terms. Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's greatest deliberative body is being snubbed. This huge spending bill—[tpl]Nowrap|$87 billion[/tpl]—has been rushed through this chamber in just one month. There were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee on [tpl]Nowrap|$87 billion[/tpl]—$87 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born—[tpl]Nowrap|$87 billion[/tpl] without a single outside witness called to challenge the administration's line.[/tpl]
Of the more than 18,000 votes he cast as a senator, Byrd said he was proudest of his vote against the Iraq war resolution.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/12/byrd.access/index.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=June 12, 2006 |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl] Byrd also voted to tie a timetable for troop withdrawal to war funding.

====Gang of 14====

On May 23, 2005, Byrd was one of 14 senators (who became known as the "Gang of 14") to forge a compromise on the judicial filibuster, thus securing up and down votes for many judicial nominees and ending the threat of the so-called nuclear option that would have eliminated the filibuster entirely. Under the agreement, the senators retained the power to filibuster a judicial nominee in only an "extraordinary circumstance." It ensured that the appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive votes by the full Senate.

===Other votes===

Byrd opposed the Flag Desecration Amendment, saying that, while he wanted to protect the American flag, he believed that amending the Constitution "is not the most expeditious way to protect this revered symbol of our Republic." As an alternative, Byrd cosponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005 (S. 1370), a bill to prohibit destruction or desecration of the flag by anyone trying to incite violence or causing a breach of the peace, or who steals, damages, or destroys a flag on federal property, whether owned by the federal government or a private group or individual—can be imprisoned, fined or both. The bill did not pass.
In 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to oppose the confirmation of Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00015 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote|publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010[/tpl] After missing nearly two months while in hospital, Byrd returned to the Senate floor on July 21 to vote against the elimination of funding for the F-22 fighter plane.[tpl]cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/07/sen_byrd_back_on_the_senate_fl.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | title=Sen.

==In popular culture==

Byrd had a prominent role in the 2008 Warner Bros. documentary Body of War directed by Phil Donahue. The film chronicles the life of Tomas Young, paralyzed from the chest down after a sniper shot him as he was riding in a vehicle in Iraq. Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing the use of force in Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside the wheelchair-bound Young as they leave the Capitol.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

Byrd was an avid fiddle player for most of his life, starting in his teens when he played in various square dance bands. Once he entered politics, his fiddling skills attracted attention and won votes. In 1978 when Byrd was Majority Leader, he recorded an album called U.S. Senator Robert Byrd: Mountain Fiddler (County, 1978). Byrd was accompanied by Country Gentlemen Doyle Lawson, James Bailey, and Spider Gilliam. Most of the LP consists of bluegrass music. Byrd covers "Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die," a Zeke Manners song, and "Will the Circle Be Unbroken". He has performed at the Kennedy Center, on the Grand Ole Opry and on Hee Haw. He occasionally took a break from Senate business to entertain audiences with his fiddle.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] He stopped playing in 1982 when the symptoms of a benign essential tremor had begun to affect the use of his hands.[ref]
