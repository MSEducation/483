Prunus incisa, the Fuji cherry, gets its scientific name from the deep incisions on the leaves. A dainty slow-growing, early white-flowering cherry, it is a century-old cultigen from Hondo, Japan. It is highly regarded as an ornamental but the wood has no industrial value. It is hardy to -20Â° C, and crossed with Prunus speciosa, has yielded the cultivar Prunus 'Umineko'.More, D. & J. White.
