CATEGORIES: Districts of the Australian Capital Territory, 1966 establishments in Australia

The District of Tuggeranong is one of the original eighteen districts of the Australian Capital Territory used in land administration. The district is subdivided into divisions (suburbs), sections and blocks and is the southernmost town centre of Canberra, the capital city of Australia. The district comprises nineteen suburbs and occupies [tpl]convert|117|km2[/tpl] to the east of the Murrumbidgee River.
The name Tuggeranong is derived from an Aboriginal expression meaning "cold plains".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] From the earliest colonial times, the plain extending south into the centre of the present-day territory was referred to as Tuggeranong.
At the 2011 census, the population of the district was [tpl]formatnum:86900[/tpl].

==Establishment and governance==

The traditional custodians of the district are the indigenous people of the Ngunawal tribe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/heritage/aboriginal_heritage_in_the_act |title=Aboriginal Heritage in the ACT |work=Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate |publisher=ACT Government |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013 [/tpl]
Following the transfer of land from the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government in 1911, the district was established in 1966 by the Commonwealth via the gazettal of the Districts Ordinance 1966 No. 5 (Cth) which, after the enactment of the [tpl]Cite Legislation AU |Cth|act|acta1988482|Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988[/tpl], became the [tpl]Cite Legislation AU |ACT|repealed_act|da1966n5218|Districts Act 1966 No. 5[/tpl]. This Act was subsequently repealed by the ACT Government and the district is now administered subject to the [tpl]Cite Legislation AU |ACT|act|da2002133|Districts Act 2002[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/act/repealed_act/da1966n5218/notes.html |title=Districts Act 1966 Notes |work=Australian Capital Territory Repealed Acts |publisher=AustLII |year=2002 |accessdate=18 December 2013 [/tpl]

===History===

Cave paintings and Aboriginal artifacts discovered in the area confirm that the Tuggeranong region has been occupied by the original inhabitants, the Ngunnawal people, for over [tpl]formatnum:21000[/tpl] years.
The first Europeans arrived in the Canberra region in 1820 and a year later, a third expedition led by Charles Throsby reached the Murrumbidgee River near the present-day Pine Island and the valley[tpl]Cite book |last=Watson |first=Dr. F |title=Year Book Australia |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, ABS cat. no. 1301.0 |location=Canberra |year=1931 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument [/tpl] now occupied by the Tuggeranong district. In 1823 Joseph Wild was employed by Brigade Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie to guide them to the Murrumbidgee. They travelled south along the river and named the area now known as Tuggeranong Isabella's Plain in honour of Governor Brisbane's infant daughter. Unable to cross the river near the current site of Tharwa, they continued on to the Monaro Plains.
The last expedition in the region was undertaken by Allan Cunningham in 1824. Cunningham's reports verified that the region was suitable for grazing, and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.
In 1828, the bushranger John Tennant, known as the 'Terror of Argyle', was captured by James Ainslie and two others near the Murrumbidgee River in Tuggeranong. Tennant had been a convict assigned to Joshua John Moore at Canberry, a property in the present day inner north Canberra. Mount Tennent, behind Tharwa, is named after the bushranger (note the difference in spelling).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.canberrahistory.org.au/discover.asp |title=Discover our Territory |publisher=Canberra & District Historical Society |year= |accessdate=20 December 2013 [/tpl]
The first authorised settler was James Murdoch.  In 1824 he was offered a land grant on a small plain known by the natives as 'Togranong' meaning 'cold plains'.  He took up the grant in 1827.  Lanyon station was established in 1835 and originally owned by James Wright, his brother William and John Lanyon.  Wright bought the property from Lanyon, who had only remained in Australia for three years. In 1838, Wright commenced the building of the homestead, which he named after his partner, Lanyon. The homestead was built with the strength of a fort to withstand the attacks of bushrangers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2250545 |title=LANYON SOLD. |newspaper=The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995) |location=ACT |date=10 July 1931 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]  Wright sold to the Cunningham family in 1847.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128654353 |title=Lanyon—107 years young. |newspaper=The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995) |location=ACT |date=20 April 1966 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |page=21 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]  In 1835 Thomas Macquoid, then Sheriff of the New South Wales Supreme Court, bought Tuggeranong station then known as Waniassa property (sic).

The whole area was part of the Tuggeranong parish in the late nineteenth century. Tuggranong homestead was rebuilt by the Cunningham family in 1908.  In 1917 it was resumed by the Commonwealth Government for military purposes.  The Cunningham family remained at Lanyon until 1926.  Charles Bean, together with his staff, wrote the first two volumes of the twelve volume official history of Australia's involvement in World War I at the homestead from 1919 to 1925.  The Tuggeranong property was leased as a grazing property by the McCormack family from 1927 to 1976.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tuggeranonghomestead.com.au/history/mccormack/ |title=McCormick family |work=History |publisher=Tuggeranong Homestead |year= |accessdate=20 December 2013 [/tpl]
In 1973, the third of the new towns planned for Canberra was inaugurated at Tuggeranong on 21 February. It was originally planned to house between [tpl]formatnum:180000[/tpl] to [tpl]formatnum:220000[/tpl] people. Planning for the new town had begun in 1969.  The first families moved into the suburb of Kambah in 1974. The fifth Canberra fire station opened at Kambah in 1979 to service the new developing satellite city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://esa.act.gov.au/actfr/about/history/ |title=History |work=ACT Fire & Rescue |publisher=ACT Emergency Services Agency |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=20 December 2013 [/tpl]

==Location and urban structure==

The district is a set of contiguous residential suburbs consolidated around Lake Tuggeranong, in addition to vast pastoral leases that extend south of the suburbs of [tpl]ACTcity|Banks[/tpl], [tpl]ACTcity|Conder[/tpl] and [tpl]ACTcity|Gordon[/tpl]. The boundaries of the district are constrained by the Murrumbidgee River to the west, the border with the state of New South Wales to the south and east, and pastoral leases that mark the district's boundary to the north, including the remnants of the Tuggeranong Homestead, and to the north-west.
Lake Tuggeranong was created in 1987 by the construction of a dam on a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River. On the edge of the lake are a number of community facilities, including Lake Tuggeranong College, a school catering to years 11 and 12 (16 – 18 years old); a library, which is part of the ACT Library and Information Services, a community centre, and the Tuggeranong Arts Centre.
The Tuggeranong Town Centre is to the west of the lake. It includes a major shopping centre, known as the Centro Tuggeranong Hyperdome (referring to the architectural use of semi-opaque domes in the roof); managed, developed and part owned by Centro Properties Group. It is surrounded by offices of the Australian and ACT governments, and a light industrial area.
A further heavy industrial area is located in the suburb of [tpl]ACTcity|Hume[/tpl] that lies partly in the districts of both Tuggeranong and Jerrabomberra.

==List of suburbs==

A 1975 map of the proposed suburb names in Tuggeranong shows that many more suburbs were planned, and that the eventual layout of Tuggeranong is very different from what the planners were thinking. It was proposed that residential development would occur west of the Murrumbidigee River, a corridor that is subsequently free of urban development. Suburbs planned (but not built, or had their names changed) were:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.archives.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/195693/1975_Plan_Tuggeranong_proposed_suburb_names.pdf |format=PDF |title=Proposed Suburb Names in Tuggeranong 1975 |work=Archives ACT |publisher=ACT Government |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2013 [/tpl]
