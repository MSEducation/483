"Take Me In" is the fourth and final single released from Powderfinger's second album Double Allergic. The single was released on 12 May 1997, and received a warm response from fans, although it was not as successful as the prior singles from the album.  The video clips for Double Allergic were released onto a video (and later re-released on DVD) with the same cover as "Take Me In" with the small video collection entitled "Take Me In" also.
