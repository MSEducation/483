==B-side==

===Jungle===

"Jungle" is a song written by The Electric Light Orchestra which first appeared as an album track from their 1977 album, Out of the Blue.
According to the band members' opinions recording Jungle was a lot of fun owing to the various types of sound effects, the upbeat tune, and the jungle animal noises provided by Lynne, Bev Bevan, and Kelly Groucutt. Like most songs from the LP, the song starts with a fade in sequence by Tandy then continues in a different tune.
The A-Side to this song is the 1979 hit single, "Shine a Little Love", from the album, Discovery.
