[[Calcitonin receptor]]

The calcitonin receptor (CT) is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds the peptide hormone calcitonin and is involved in maintenance of calcium homeostasis,[tpl]cite journal | author = Purdue BW, Tilakaratne N, Sexton PM | title = Molecular pharmacology of the calcitonin receptor | journal = Recept.

CT works by activating the G-proteins Gs and Gq often found on osteoclasts, on cells in the kidney, and on cells in a number of regions of the brain.senselab It may also affect the ovaries in women and the testes in men.
The function of the CT receptor protein is modified through its interaction with Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), forming the multimeric amylin receptors AMY1 (CT + RAMP1), AMY2 (CT + RAMP2), and AMY3 (CT+ RAMP3).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.iuphar-db.org/GPCR/IntroductionDisplayForward?chapterID=1358 | title = Calcitonin Receptors: Introduction | accessdate = | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | format = | work = IUPHAR Database of Receptors and Ion Channels | publisher = International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = [/tpl]
