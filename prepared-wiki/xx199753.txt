CATEGORIES: Spiral galaxies, NGC objects, Lynx (constellation)

NGC 2770 is a type SASc spiral galaxy located about 88 million light years away, in the constellation Lynx. 
It has been referred toAstronomy Picture of the Day 18 January 2008 as the 'Supernova Factory' as three supernovas have occurred there recently: SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy, and SN 2008D.  The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-Rays released very early on in its formation, rather than by the optical light emitted during the later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity.Gemini Observatory Media Release
