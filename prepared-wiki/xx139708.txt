==Overview==

The Lesser Abay River, commonly considered to be the uppermost reach of the Blue Nile, originates in this woreda, and flows north into Lake Tana.
In June 2002, heavy rains caused flooding and landslides in nine kebeles in Sekela and neighboring woredas, which covered or completely washed away more than 1200 hectares of land planted in crops, and destroyed about 8600 quintals of harvested crops. One person and more than a hundred animals died in this disaster.Hugo RÃ¤mi, "Fewer surpluses in Gojam and Awi and Severe shortages in lowland areas of Abaye River Gorge", UN-OCHA Assessment Mission, October 2002 (accessed 23 April 2009)
