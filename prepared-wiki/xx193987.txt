===900 MW plant===

Gas is supplied from a 26 mile pipeline from Theddlethorpe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eon-uk.com/generation/killingholme.aspx|title=Killingholme|publisher=E.ON UK[/tpl]
When it was built by Powergen (now called E.ON UK) and opened in April 1993 it was only the second gas-fired power station built in the UK. It was taken out of service in 2002 due to the lower price of electricity and was then restored to full service in August 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://pressreleases.eon-uk.com/blogs/eonukpressreleases/archive/2005/08/16/e-on-uk-s-killingholme-power-station-returns-to-full-service-in-world-first.aspx|title=E.ON UK’s Killingholme Power Station returns to full service in world first|publisher=E.ON UK[/tpl] with one of the 450 MW units returning to service in April 2005.
