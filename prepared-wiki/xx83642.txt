The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is an independent agency of the United States government created by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA).  The Commission serves as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration. It is charged with administering payments to states and developing guidance to meet HAVA requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment.  It is also charged with developing and maintaining a national mail voter registration form.

==Responsibilities==

The EAC is tasked with performing a number of election-related duties including:EAC Divisions, see HAVA Sections 202, 205 through 209, 221 through 222, 231, 241-247, 801 through 804, and 902 and at NVRA Section 9

==History==

The HAVA dictates the EAC will create voluntary guidelines for voting systems, maintaining a clearinghouse of information regarding election administration procedures including testing and certification of election equipment, and administering the Election Assistance and Help America Vote Programs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In 2003, Congress appropriated US$1.5 billion for HAVA. The General Services Administration distributed most of the $650 million permitted under Title I of HAVA, but the remainder was earmarked for the EAC to disburse. The funds languished because the commissioners were not confirmed until 9 December 2003; the law had required that they be in place by 26 February 2003.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In its 2004 budget, Congress again allocated $1.5 billion to fund HAVA.  By January 2004, the EAC had no permanent offices or budget, even though it was required to publish state election reform plans in the Federal Register before money for new voting equipment could be disbursed to the states.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In 2011, United States Representative Gregg Harper introduced a bill to end the EAC and transfer some of its authority to the Federal Election Commission.[tpl]cite news | agency = Roll Call | url = http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_111/Election-Assistance-Commission-May-Be-Closing-204942-1.html | title = Election Assistance Commission May Be Closing | date = April 14, 2011 | author = Alex Knott [/tpl]

==Criticisms==

Critics have contended that the EAC has responded positively to political pressure from the Republican Party and the Department of Justice.  For example, the EAC is said to have overstated the problem of voter fraud, which is often cited by Republicans as a justification for restrictive measures that Democrats charge are intended to prevent qualified Democrats from voting.  The EAC Chair denied that there was any political pressure.[tpl]cite web|last=Fessler|first=Pam|title=Federal Panel on Voter Fraud Scrutinized|publisher=National Public Radio|date=2007-07-31|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12385655|accessdate=2007-08-30[/tpl]  Tova Wang, a consultant to the Commission, wrote a detailed account in The Washington Post about how her research and that of her Republican co-author had been disregarded or altered, to produce a published report "that completely stood our own work on its head."  The changes included playing up the voter fraud issue and omitting references to charges of voter intimidation lodged by Democrats, as well as removing all criticisms of the Department of Justice.[tpl]Cite news|last=Wang|first=Tova Andrea|title=A Rigged Report on U.S. Voting?| newspaper =The Washington Post|pages=A21|date=August 30, 2007|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082901928.html?hpid=opinionsbox1|postscript=[/tpl]
