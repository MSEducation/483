The Seoul Free Lunch Referendum was a referendum of allowing the free school meal in the schools around the Seoul Metropolitan Area held on 24 August 2011. The former mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, proposed to provide a limited free meal service to the 30% of the impoverished children in Seoul, but the Democratic Party proposed to make the free meal service to every kid in Seoul starting from younger elementary school children and gradually to middle school children.[tpl]cite news | first = Gi-cheol (기철) | last = Jung (정) | title = ‘친환경 무상급식’ 해결기미 가물가물 | date = 2010-10-22 | url = http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=409023 | work = Asia Today | accessdate = 2011-09-24 | language = Korean[/tpl] This has become the cause of Oh Se-hoon's action to make the final decision of the policy through a referendum. The referendum was later rejected due to the low voting rate of the referendum of 25.7%, significantly lower than the required voting rate of 33.3%.[tpl]cite news | first = Pul-ip (풀잎) | last = Kim (김) | title = 무상급식 주민투표 결과…투표율 25.7%에 무산 ‘오세훈 거취 주목’ | date = 2011-08-24 | url = http://artsnews.mk.co.kr/news/166518 | work = 아츠뉴스 사회 | accessdate = 2011-09-24 | language = Korean[/tpl] The low voting rate contributed Oh Se-hoon's resignation from the mayoralty of Seoul.
