Next in importance are the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries [[Hijri year|
of the Muslim era]] (AH – 8th and 9th century CE).Watt (1953), p.xi These include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad (the sira literature), which provide additional information about Muhammad's life.Reeves (2003), pp. 6–7
The earliest surviving written sira (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is Ibn Ishaq's Life of God's Messenger written c. 767 CE (150 AH). Although the work was lost, this sira was used verbatim at great length by Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari.S. A. Nigosian(2004), p. 6Donner (1998), p. 132 Another early history source is the history of Muhammad's campaigns by al-Waqidi (death 207 of Muslim era), and the work of his secretary Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi (death 230 of Muslim era).
Many scholars accept the accuracy of the earliest biographies, though their accuracy is unascertainable. Recent studies have led scholars to distinguish between the traditions touching legal matters and the purely historical ones. In the former sphere, traditions could have been subject to invention while in the latter sphere, aside from exceptional cases, the material may have been only subject to "tendential shaping".Watt (1953), p.xv

===Hadith===

In addition, the hadith collections are accounts of the verbal and physical traditions of Muhammad that date from several generations after his death.Lewis (1993), pp. 33–34
Western academics view the hadith collections with caution as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods, but judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.Madelung (1997), pp.xi, 19 and 20

==Pre-Islamic Arabia==

The Arabian Peninsula was largely arid and volcanic, agriculture was difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; two of the most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes.Watt (1953), pp.1–2 Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal grouping was encouraged by the need to act as a unit, this unity being based on the bond of kinship by blood.Watt (1953), pp. 16–18 Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling from one place to another seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival was also dependent on raiding caravans or oases, the nomads not viewing this as a crime.Loyal Rue, Religion Is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological,2005, p.224John Esposito, Islam, Expanded edition, Oxford University Press, p.4–5
Politically Arabia at the time was divided between two tribal confederations, the Banu Qais, loosely allied with Byzantium and who were originally powerful in Northern and Western Arabia, and the Banu Kalb, who had originally come from Yemen, and were loosely allied with Sassanid Persia. These rivalries were suppressed by Islam but continued to influence events in the Middle East and North Africa in post-Islamic times.
In pre-Islamic Arabia, gods or goddesses were viewed as protectors of individual tribes, their spirits being associated with sacred trees, stones, springs and wells. As well as being the site of an annual pilgrimage, the Kaaba shrine in Mecca housed 360 idol statues of tribal patron deities. Three goddesses were associated with Allah as his daughters: Allāt, Manāt and al-‘Uzzá. Monotheistic communities existed in Arabia, including Christians and Jews.[ref]See:

==Life==

===In Mecca===

[tpl]clear right[/tpl][tpl]Muhammad timeline in Mecca[/tpl]
Muhammad was born in Mecca and lived there for roughly the first 52 years of his life (c. 570–622). This period is generally divided into two phases, before and after declaring his prophetic visions.

====Childhood and early life====

Muhammad was born about the year 570 and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal.[tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam |last=Esposito |first=John L. (ed.) |coauthors= |year=2003 |isbn=978-0195125580 |page=198 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=E324pQEEQQcC&pg=PA198&dq=muhammad+birthday+Rabi%27+al-awwal#v=onepage&q=muhammad%20birthday%20Rabi%27%20al-awwal&f=false |accessdate=19 June 2012[/tpl] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, one of Mecca's prominent families, although it appears less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime.See also [tpl]cite quran|43|31|s=ns[/tpl] cited in EoI; Muhammad The Banu Hashim clan was part of the Quraysh tribe. Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca that year by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants. 20th century scholarship has suggested alternative dates for this event, such as 568 or 569.Watt (1974), p. 7.

His father, Abdullah, died almost six months before Muhammad was born.[tpl]citation |last=Meri |first=Josef W. |authorlink=Josef W. Meri |title=Medieval Islamic civilization |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC |accessdate=3 January 2013 |volume=1 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-96690-0 |page=525[/tpl] According to Islamic tradition, soon after Muhammad's birth he was sent to live with a Bedouin family in the desert, as desert life was considered healthier for infants. Muhammad stayed with his foster-mother, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, and her husband until he was two years old. Some western scholars of Islam have rejected the historicity of this tradition.Watt, "Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb", Encyclopaedia of Islam. At the age of six, Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and he became orphaned.Watt, Amina, Encyclopaedia of Islam For the next two years, he was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, of the Banu Hashim clan, but when Muhammad was eight, his grandfather also died. He then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of Banu Hashim. According to Islamic historian William Montgomery Watt there was a general disregard by guardians in taking care of weaker members of the tribes in Mecca during the 6th century, "Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, but it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time."Watt (1974), p. 8.
While still in his teens, Muhammad accompanied his uncle on trading journeys to Syria gaining experience in commercial trade, the only career open to Muhammad as an orphan. Islamic tradition states that when Muhammad was either nine or twelve while accompanying the Meccans' caravan to Syria, he met a Christian monk or hermit named Bahira who is said to have foreseen Muhammed's career as a prophet of God.Armand Abel, Bahira, Encyclopaedia of Islam
Little is known of Muhammad during his later youth, and from the fragmentary information that is available, it is difficult to separate history from legend. It is known that he became a merchant and "was involved in trade between the Indian ocean and the Mediterranean Sea."Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History (2005), v.3, p. 1025 Due to his upright character he acquired the nickname "al-Amin" (Arabic: الامين), meaning "faithful, trustworthy" and "al-Sadiq" meaning "truthful"[tpl]cite book |last1= Khan |first1= Majid Ali |title= Muhammad the final messenger |edition=1998 |page=332|year=1998|publisher=Islamic Book Service |location=India|isbn= 81-85738-25-4|ref=[/tpl] and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator.Esposito (1998), p. 6 His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadijah, a 40-year-old widow. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one.
Several years later, according to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone in place in the wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, had been removed to facilitate renovations to the Kaaba. The leaders of Mecca could not agree on which clan should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place. They agreed to wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to choose. That man was the 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his first revelation. He asked for a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad set the stone in place, satisfying the honour of all.[tpl]cite book|title=The sacred trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkapı Palace Museum, Istanbul|editor=Uğurluel, Talha|editor2=Doğru, Ahmet|author1=Dairesi, Hırka-i Saadet|author2=Aydın, Hilmi|publisher=Tughra Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-932099-72-0[/tpl]

===Beginnings of the Quran===

Muhammad adopted the practice of praying alone for several weeks every year in a cave on Mount Hira near Mecca.Emory C. Bogle (1998), p.6John Henry Haaren, Addison B. Poland (1904), p.83 Islamic tradition holds that during one of his visits to Mount Hira, the angel Gabriel appeared to him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite verses which would later be included in the Quran.Brown (2003), pp. 72–73 There is a consensus that the first words of the Quran to be revealed were the beginning of Surah [tpl]Cite quran|96|1|s=ns|b=n[/tpl].[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 11| pages = 54| first = A.J.| last = Wensinck | first2= A. | last2 = Rippen |title = Waḥy | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam| year = 2002 |isbn=9004127569[/tpl] 
Upon receiving his first revelations, he was deeply distressed. After returning home, Muhammad was consoled and reassured by Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal.Esposito (2010), p.8 He also feared that others would dismiss his claims as being possessed.  Shi'a tradition maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather Muhammad welcomed him as if he was expecting.[ref]See:
 
 
Sahih Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing his revelations as "sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell". Aisha reported, "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over)".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php |title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement |publisher=Cmje.org |accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] According to Welch these descriptions may be considered genuine, since they are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages.Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), p. 31. According to the Quran, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Quran [tpl]cite quran|38|70|s=ns|b=n[/tpl], Quran [tpl]cite quran|6|19|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]). Occasionally the Quran did not explicitly refer to Judgment day but provided examples from the history of extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Quran [tpl]cite quran|41|13|e=16|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]). Muhammad did not only warn those who rejected God's revelation, but also dispensed good news for those who abandoned evil, listening to the divine words and serving God.Daniel C. Peterson, Good News, Encyclopedia of the Quran Muhammad's mission also involves preaching monotheism: The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p. 185
The key themes of the early Quranic verses included the responsibility of man towards his creator; the resurrection of the dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise; and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill newborn girls.

===Opposition===

According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad's wife Khadija was the first to believe he was a prophet.Watt (1953), p. 86 She was followed by Muhammad's ten-year-old cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, close friend Abu Bakr, and adopted son Zaid. Around 613, Muhammad began to preach to the public(Quran [tpl]cite quran|26|214|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]).Ramadan (2007), p. 37–9 Most Meccans ignored him and mocked him, though a few became his followers. There were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants; people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it; and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners.Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), p. 36.
According to Ibn Sad, the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the Meccan forefathers who engaged in polytheism.F. E. Peters (1994), p.169 However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching.Uri Rubin, Quraysh, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an As the number of followers increased, he became a threat to the local tribes and rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Ka'aba, the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba. The powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching by offering him admission into the inner circle of merchants, and establishing his position therein by an advantageous marriage. However, he refused both.
Tradition records at great length the persecution and ill-treatment towards Muhammad and his followers. Sumayyah bint Khabbab, a slave of a prominent Meccan leader Abu Jahl, is famous as the first martyr of Islam; killed with a spear by her master when she refused to give up her faith. Bilal, another Muslim slave, was tortured by Umayyah ibn Khalaf who used to place a heavy rock on his chest to force his conversion.Jonathan E. Brockopp, Slaves and Slavery, Encyclopedia of the Qur'anW. Arafat, Bilal b. Rabah, Encyclopedia of Islam Apart from insults, Muhammad was protected from physical harm as he belonged to the Banu Hashim clan.Watt (1964) p. 76.Peters (1999) p. 172.
In 615, some of Muhammad's followers emigrated to the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar.
Muhammad, desperately hoping for an accommodation with his tribe, either from fear or in the hope of succeeding more readily in this way, pronounced a verse acknowledging the existence of three Meccan goddesses considered to be the daughters of Allah, and appealing for their intercession. Muhammad later retracted the verses at the behest of Gabriel, claiming that the verses were whispered by the devil himself.The Cambridge companion to Muhammad (2010), p.35The aforementioned Islamic histories recount that as Muhammad was reciting Sūra Al-Najm (Q.53), as revealed to him by the Archangel Gabriel, Satan tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20: "Have you thought of Allāt and al-'Uzzā and Manāt the third, the other; These are the exalted Gharaniq, whose intercession is hoped for." (Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans). cf Ibn Ishaq, A. Guillaume p. 166. This episode known as "The Story of the Cranes" (translation: [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]large|قصة الغرانيق[/tpl][/tpl], transliteration: Qissat al Gharaneeq) is also known as "Satanic Verses". Some scholars argued against the historic authenticity of these verses on various grounds."Kuran" in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd Edition, Vol. 5 (1986), p. 404 While this incident received widespread acceptance by early Muslims, strong objections to it were raised starting from the 10th century, on theological grounds. The objections continued on this point until rejection of these verses eventually became the only acceptable orthodox Muslim position.Shahab Ahmed, "Satanic Verses" in the Encyclopedia of the Qur'an.
In 617, the leaders of Makhzum and Banu Abd-Shams, two important Quraysh clans, declared a public boycott against Banu Hashim, their commercial rival, to pressure it into withdrawing its protection of Muhammad. The boycott lasted three years but eventually collapsed as it failed in its objective.F. E. Peters (2003b), p. 96Moojan Momen (1985), p. 4 During this, Muhammad was only able to preach during the holy pilgrimage months in which all hostilities between Arabs was suspended.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.186

===Isra and Mi'raj===

Islamic tradition states that in 620, Muhammad experienced the Isra and Mi'raj, a miraculous journey said to have occurred with the angel Gabriel in one night. In the beginning of the journey, the Isra, he is said to have travelled from Mecca on a winged steed (Buraq) to "the farthest mosque" (in Arabic: masjid al-aqsa), which Muslims usually identify with the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Later, during the Mi'raj, Muhammad is said to have toured heaven and hell, and spoke with earlier prophets, such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Ibn Ishaq, author of the first biography of Muhammad, presents the event as a spiritual experience; later historians, like Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir, present it as a physical journey.Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World (2003), p. 482
Some western scholars hold that the Isra and Mi'raj identified the journey as traveling through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial al-Baytu l-Maʿmur (heavenly prototype of the Kaaba); later traditions indicate Muhammad's journey as having been from Mecca to Jerusalem.Sells, Michael. Ascension, Encyclopedia of the Quran.

===Last years in Mecca before Hijra===

Muhammad's wife Khadijah and uncle Abu Talib both died in 619, the year thus being known as the "year of sorrow". With the death of Abu Talib, leadership of the Banu Hashim clan passed to Abu Lahab, a tenacious enemy of Muhammad. Soon afterwards, Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection over Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in danger; the withdrawal of clan protection implied that blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then visited Ta'if, another important city in Arabia, and tried to find a protector, but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut'im ibn Adi (and the protection of the tribe of Banu Nawfal) made it possible for him to safely re-enter his native city.
Many people were visiting Mecca on business or as pilgrims to the Kaaba. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called Medina). The Arab population of Yathrib were familiar with monotheism and were prepared for the appearance of a prophet because a Jewish community existed there.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p. 187 They also hoped, by the means of Muhammad and the new faith, to gain supremacy over Mecca; the Yathrib were jealous of its importance as the place of pilgrimage. Converts to Islam came from nearly all Arab tribes in Medina; by June of the subsequent year, seventy-five Muslims came to Mecca for pilgrimage and to meet Muhammad. Meeting him secretly by night, the group made what is known as the "Second Pledge of al-`Aqaba", or, in Orientalists' view, the "Pledge of War".Watt (1974) p. 83 Following the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to emigrate to Yathrib. As with the migration to Abyssinia, the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave.Peterson (2006), pp. 86–9

===Hijra===

The Hijra is the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. In September 622, warned of a plot to assassinate him, Muhammad secretly slipped out of Mecca and moved his followers to Medina, [tpl]convert|320|km|mi|abbr=off[/tpl] north of Mecca. The Hijra is celebrated annually on the first day of the Muslim year.

====Migration to Medina====

A delegation, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider.Esposito (1998), p. 17. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and an eye for an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 39 The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.
Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina, until nearly all his followers left Mecca. Being alarmed at the departure, according to tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate Muhammad. With the help of Ali, Muhammad fooled the Meccans watching him, and secretly slipped away from the town with Abu Bakr.Moojan Momen (1985), p. 5 By 622, Muhammad emigrated to Medina, a large agricultural oasis. Those who migrated from Mecca along with Muhammad became known as muhajirun (emigrants).

====Establishment of a new polity====

Among the first things Muhammad did to ease the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was to draft a document known as the Constitution of Medina, "establishing a kind of alliance or federation" among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca; this specified rights and duties of all citizens, and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including the Muslim community to other communities, specifically the Jews and other "Peoples of the Book"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, Ummah, had a religious outlook, also shaped by practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. It effectively established the first Islamic state.
Several ordinances were proclaimed to win over the numerous and wealthy Jewish population. These were soon rescinded as the Jews insisted on preserving the entire Mosaic law, and did not recognize him as a prophet because he was not of the race of David.
The first group of converts to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside.Watt (1956), p. 175. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam.Watt (1956), p. 177. Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Ali ibn Abitalib | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate =25 October 2007|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a043.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812205939/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a043.html|archivedate=12 August 2007[/tpl]

====Beginning of armed conflict====

Following the emigration, the people of Mecca seized property of Muslim emigrants yo Mecca.Fazlur Rahman (1979), p. 21 Economically uprooted with no available profession, the Muslim migrants turned to raiding Meccan caravans, initiating armed conflict with Mecca.Lewis (2002), p. 41.Watt (1961), p. 105.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.188 Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans (see sura Al-Hajj, Quran [tpl]cite quran|22|39|e=40|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]).John Kelsay (1993), p. 21 These attacks allowed the migrants to acquire wealth, power and prestige while working towards the ultimate goal of conquering Mecca.Watt(1961) p. 105, p. 107Lewis (1993), p. 41.
According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the Masjid al-Qiblatain in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God that he should be facing Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer. Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer.[tpl]cite book |author=William Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad: prophet and statesman |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zLN2hNidLw4C&pg=PA113 |accessdate=29 December 2011 |date=7 February 1974 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-881078-0 |pages=112–114[/tpl] According to Watt, the change may have been less sudden and definite than the story suggests – the related Quranic verses ([tpl]cite quran|2|136|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]–[tpl]cite quran|2|147|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]) appear to have been revealed at different times – and correlates with changes in Muhammad's political support base, symbolizing his turning away from Jews and adopting a more Arabian outlook.
In March 624, Muhammad led some three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr.Rodinson (2002), p. 164. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. A force from Mecca was sent to protect the caravan, and continued en route to confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. The Battle of Badr commenced.Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 45 Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl.Glubb (2002), pp. 179–186. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed in return for wealth or freed.Watt (1961), p. 123.Rodinson (2002), pp. 168–9. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.188 – 189 The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.Lewis(2002), p. 44An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.189
The victory strengthened Muhammad's position in Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers.Russ Rodgers, The Generalship of Muhammad: Battles and Campaigns of the Prophet of Allah (University Press of Florida; 2012) ch 1 As a result the opposition to him became less vocal. Pagans who had not yet converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan and Abu 'Afak, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their own or related clans, and no blood-feud followed.Watt (1956), p. 179.
Muhammad expelled from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, one of three main Jewish tribes. Although Muhammad wanted them executed, Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy chief of the Khazraj tribe did not agree and they were expelled to Syria but without their property. Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz.

====Conflict with Mecca====

The Meccans were eager to avenge their defeat. To maintain economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been reduced at Badr.Watt (1961), p. 132. In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties to Medina while Muhammad led expeditions against tribes allied with Mecca and sent raiders onto a Meccan caravan.Watt (1961), p. 134 Abu Sufyan gathered an army of three thousand men and set out for an attack on Medina.Lewis (1960), p. 45.
A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers a day later. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, dispute arose over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many senior figures suggested it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of the heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying crops, and huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the younger Muslims and readied the Muslim force for battle. Muhammad led his force outside to the mountain of Uhud (the location of the Meccans camp) and fought the Battle of Uhud on 23 March.C.F. Robinson, Uhud, Encyclopedia of IslamWatt (1964) p. 137 Although the Muslim army had the advantage in early encounters, lack of discipline on the part of strategically placed archers led to a Muslim defeat; 75 Muslims were killed including Hamza, Muhammad's uncle who became one of the best known martyrs in the Muslim tradition. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims, instead they marched back to Mecca declaring victory. The announcement is probably because Muhammad was wounded and thought dead. When they discovered that Muhammad lived, the Meccans did not return due to false information about new forces coming to his aid. The attack had failed to achieve their aim of completely destroying the Muslims.Watt (1974) p. 137David Cook(2007), p.24 The Muslims buried the dead, and returned to Medina that evening. Questions accumulated about the reasons for the loss; Muhammad delivered Quranic verses [tpl]cite quran|3|152|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] indicating that the defeat was twofold: partly a punishment for disobedience, partly a test for steadfastness.[ref]See:
Abu Sufyan directed his effort towards another attack on Medina. He gained support from the nomadic tribes to the north and east of Medina; using propaganda about Muhammad's weakness, promises of booty, memories of Quraysh prestige and through bribery.Watt (1956), p. 30. Muhammad's new policy was to prevent alliances against him. Whenever alliances against Medina were formed, he sent out expeditions to break them up. Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, and reacted in a severe.Watt (1956), p. 34 One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a chieftain of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir. al-Ashraf went to Mecca and wrote poems that roused the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the Battle of Badr.Watt (1956), p. 18[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Uri | year = 1990 | title = The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf | journal = Oriens | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–71 | jstor = 1580625 | doi = 10.2307/1580625[/tpl] Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Banu Nadir from MedinaWatt (1956), pp. 220–221 forcing their emigration to Syria; he allowed them to take some possessions, as he was unable to subdue the Banu Nadir in their strongholds. The rest of their property was claimed by Muhammad in the name of God as it was not gained with bloodshed. Muhammad surprised various Arab tribes, individually, with overwhelming force, causing his enemies to unite to annihilate him.An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.190 Muhammad's attempts to prevent a confederation against him were unsuccessful, though he was able to increase his own forces and stopped many potential tribes from joining his enemies.Watt (1956), p. 35

====Siege of Medina====

With the help of the exiled Banu Nadir, the Quraysh military leader Abu Sufyan mustered a force of 10,000 men. Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian. The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted two weeks.Watt (1956), p. 36, 37 Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to return home.[ref]See:
During the battle, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, located the south of Medina, entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad. Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him. No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad's scouts.Watt (1964) pp. 170–172 After the coalition's retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to Ibn Ishaq, all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved.Peterson(2007), p. 126Ramadan (2007), p. 141 Walid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq's narrative.Meri, Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia, p. 754. Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq's Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas, and a transmitter of "odd tales" by the later Ibn Hajar.Arafat, "New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina",  Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1976, p. 100–107. Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe was killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved.Ahmad, p. 85-94.Nemoy, "Barakat Ahmad's "Muhammad and the Jews"", p. 325. Nemoy is sourcing Ahmad's Muhammad and the Jews. Watt finds Arafat's arguments "not entirely convincing", while Meir J. Kister has contradicted [tpl]Clarify|date=March 2009[/tpl] the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad.Kister, "The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza".
In the siege of Medina, the Meccans exerted the available strength to destroy the Muslim community. The failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria vanished.Watt (1956), p. 39 Following the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur).

====Truce of Hudaybiyyah====

Although Muhammad had delivered Quranic verses commanding the Hajj,[tpl]cite quran|2|196|e=210|s=ns[/tpl] the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In the month of Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to prepare for a pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj.Lings (1987), p. 249 Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside of Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the sanctuaries prestige, that Islam was an Arabian religion.Watt, al- Hudaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya Encyclopedia of Islam
Negotiations commenced with emissaries travelling to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, Uthman bin al-Affan, had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad called upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee (or to stick with Muhammad, whatever decision he made) if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the "Pledge of Acceptance" ([tpl]lang-ar|بيعة الرضوان , bay'at al-ridhwān[/tpl]) or the "Pledge under the Tree". News of Uthman's safety allowed for negotiations to continue, and a treaty scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and Quraysh.Lewis (2002), p. 42. The main points of the treaty included: cessation of hostilities, the deferral of Muhammad's pilgrimage to the following year,An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.191 and agreement to send back any Meccan who emigrated to Medina without permission from their protector.
Many Muslims were not satisfied with the treaty. However, the Quranic sura "Al-Fath" (The Victory) (Quran [tpl]cite quran|48|1|e=29|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]) assured them that the expedition must be considered a victorious one.Lings (1987), p. 255 It was later that Muhammad's followers realized the benefit behind the treaty. These benefits included the requirement of the Meccans to identify Muhammad as an equal, cessation of military activity allowing Medina to gain strength, and the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the pilgrimage rituals.
After signing the truce, Muhammad assembled an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, known as the Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya.Vaglieri, Khaybar, Encyclopedia of Islam According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources).Lings (1987), p. 260Khan (1998), pp. 250–251An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.273 He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah, in which the Muslims were defeated.F. Buhl, Muta, Encyclopedia of Islam

===Final years===

====Conquest of Mecca====

 
 
The truce of Hudaybiyyah had been enforced for two years.Khan (1998), p. 274Lings (1987), p. 291 The tribe of Banu Khuza'a had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.Khan (1998), pp. 274–5.
The Meccans replied that they accepted the last condition. Soon they realized their mistake and sent Abu Sufyan to renew the Hudaybiyyah treaty, a request that was declined by Muhammad.
Muhammad began to prepare for a campaign.Lings (1987), p. 292 In 630, Muhammad marched on Mecca with an enormous force, said to number more than 10,000 men. With minimal casualties, Muhammad seized control of Mecca.Watt (1956), p. 66.An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.274 He declared an amnesty for past offences, except for ten men and women who were "guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace".The Message by Ayatullah Ja'far Subhani, chapter 48 referencing Sirah by Ibn Hisham, vol. II, page 409. Some of these were later pardoned.Rodinson (2002), p. 261. Most Meccans converted to Islam and Muhammad proceeded to destroy all the statues of Arabian gods in and around the Kaaba.Harold Wayne Ballard, Donald N. Penny, W. Glenn Jonas (2002), p.163F. E. Peters (2003), p.240 According to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al-Azraqi, Muhammad personally spared paintings or frescos of Mary and Jesus, but other traditions suggest that all pictures were erased.[tpl]cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.

====Conquest of Arabia====

Following the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a military threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army twice Muhammad's size. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to the decline of the prestige of Meccans.Watt (1974), p.207 Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.275
In the same year, Muhammad organized an attack against northern Arabia because of their previous defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah and reports of hostility adopted against Muslims. With great difficulty he assembled thirty thousand men; half of whom on the second day returned with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them.An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.276 Although Muhammad did not engage with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region.M.A. al-Bakhit, Tabuk, Encyclopedia of Islam
He also ordered destruction of any remaining pagan idols in Eastern Arabia. The last city to hold out against the Muslims in Eastern Arabia was Taif. Muhammad refused to accept the city's surrender until they agreed to convert to Islam and allowed men to destroy the statue of their goddess Allat.Ibn Ishaq (translated by Guillaume, A. 1955) The Life of Muhammad. Oxford University Press, Oxford. pg. pg. 916–918Haykal, M.H. (1933) The Life of Muhammad, translated by Isma'il Razi A. al-Faruqi.

A year after the Battle of Tabuk, the Banu Thaqif sent emissaries to surrender to Muhammad and adopt Islam. Many bedouins submitted to Muhammad to safeguard against his attacks and to benefit from the spoils of war. However, the bedouins were alien to the system of Islam and wanted to maintain independence: namely their code of virtue and ancestral traditions. Muhammad required a military and political agreement according to which they "acknowledge the suzerainty of Medina, to refrain from attack on the Muslims and their allies, and to pay the Zakat, the Muslim religious levy."Lewis (1993), pp.43–44

====Farewell pilgrimage====

 
 
In 632, at the end of the tenth year after migration to Medina, Muhammad completed his first truly Islamic pilgrimage, thereby teaching his followers the rites of the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. After completing the pilgrimage, Muhammad delivered a famous speech, known as The Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. He declared that an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab. Also a white has no superiority over black, nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.[tpl]cite book |last= Sultan |first= Sohaib |title=The Koran For Dummies|publisher= John Wiley & Sons |date=March 2011 |isbn= 0-7645-5581-2[/tpl] He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased, and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year.Devin J. Stewart, Farewell Pilgrimage, Encyclopedia of the Qur'anAl-Hibri (2003), p.17An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.278 According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" (Quran [tpl]cite quran|5|3|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]).An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.279 According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.[ref]See:

====Death and tomb====

A few months after the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and suffered for several days with fever, head pain, and weakness. He died on Monday, 8 June 632, in Medina, at the age of 62 or 63, in the house of his wife Aisha.The Last Prophet, page 3. By Lewis Lord of U.S. News & World Report. 7 April 2008.

===Post Muhammad===

Muhammad united the tribes of Arabia into a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life. With Muhammad's death, disagreement broke out over who his successor would be. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad's friend and collaborator. With additional support Abu Bakr was confirmed as the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm. Abu Bakr's immediately moved to strike against the Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) forces because of the previous defeat, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an event that Muslim historians later referred to as the Ridda wars, or "Wars of Apostasy".[ref]See:
[/ref]
The pre-Islamic Middle East was dominated by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the lands that would be conquered by Muslims many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Christian Orthodoxy which deemed them heretics. Within a decade Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt,Esposito (1998), p.35–36 large parts of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.

==Early reforms under Islam==

According to William Montgomery Watt religion, for Muhammad, was not a private and individual matter but “the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself. He was responding only... to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject."Cambridge History of Islam (1970), p. 30. Bernard Lewis says there are two important political traditions in Islam – Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca. His view believed Islam as a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies.Lewis (1998)
Historians generally agree that Islamic social reforms in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery and the rights of women and children improved on the status quo of Arab society.[ref]
Economic reforms addressed the plight of the poor, which was becoming an issue in pre-Islamic Mecca.Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 34 The Quran requires payment of an alms tax (zakat) for the benefit of the poor; as Muhammad's power grew he demanded that tribes who wished to ally with him implement the zakat in particular.Esposito (1998), p. 30Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 52

==Appearance==

Descriptions like these were often reproduced in calligraphic panels (hilya or, in Turkish, hilye), which in the 17th century developed into an art form of their own in the Ottoman Empire.

==Household==

Muhammad's life is traditionally defined into two periods: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca (from 570 to 622), and post-hijra in Medina (from 622 until 632). Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives (although two have ambiguous accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or concubine.See for example Marco Schöller,  Banu Qurayza, Encyclopedia of the Quran mentioning the differing accounts of the status of RayhanaBarbara Freyer Stowasser, Wives of the Prophet, Encyclopedia of the Quran) Eleven of the thirteen marriages occurred after the migration to Medina.
At the age of 25, Muhammad married the wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old.[tpl]cite book | last = Subhani | first = Jafar | title = The Message | url = http://www.al-islam.org/message | publisher = Ansariyan Publications, Qom | chapter = Chapter 9[/tpl] The marriage lasted for 25 years and was a happy one.Esposito (1998), p. 18 Muhammad relied upon Khadija and did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage.Bullough (1998), p. 119Reeves (2003), p. 46 After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad is said to have asked for arrangements to marry both.Watt, Aisha, Encyclopedia of Islam
Traditional sources dictate Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad,D. A.

After migration to Medina, Muhammad (now in his fifties) married several women. These marriages were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.Momen (1985), p.9
Muhammad did household chores and helped with housework such as preparing food, sewing clothes and repairing shoes. He is also said to have had accustomed his wives to dialogue; he listened to their advice, and the wives debated and even argued with him.Tariq Ramadan (2007), p. 168–9Asma Barlas (2002), p. 125Armstrong (1992), p. 157
Khadijah is said to have had four daughters with Muhammad (Ruqayyah bint Muhammad, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, Zainab bint Muhammad, Fatimah Zahra) and two sons (Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad and Qasim ibn Muhammad, who both died in childhood). All but one of his daughters, Fatimah, died before him. Some Shi'a scholars contend that Fatimah was Muhammad's only daughter.Ordoni (1990) pp. 32, 42–44. Maria al-Qibtiyya bore him a son named Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, but the child died when he was two years old.Nicholas Awde (2000), p.10
Nine of Muhammad's wives survived him. Aisha, who became known as Muhammad's favourite wife in Sunni tradition, survived him by decades and was instrumental in helping assemble the scattered sayings of Muhammad that form the Hadith literature for the Sunni branch of Islam.
Muhammad's descendants through Fatimah are known as sharifs, syeds or sayyids. These are honorific titles in Arabic, sharif meaning 'noble' and sayed or sayyid meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shi'a, though the Shi'a place much more emphasis and value on their distinction.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=Ali |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online[/tpl]
Zayd ibn Harith was a slave that Muhammad bought, freed, and then adopted as his son. He also had a wetnurse.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya recorded the list of some names of Muhammad's female-slaves in Zad al-Ma'ad, Part I, p. 116 Muhammad owned other slaves as well, whom he bought usually to free.'Human Rights in Islam'.

===Muslim views===

Following the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith. Every Muslim proclaims in Shahadah that "I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God". The Shahadah is the basic creed or tenet of Islam. Islamic belief believes ideally the Shahadah is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death. Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (adhan) and the prayer itself. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.Farah (1994), p.135

[tpl]Cite quran|10|37|s=ns[/tpl] states that "...it (the Quran) is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book – wherein there is no doubt – from The Lord of the Worlds.". Similarly [tpl]Cite quran|46|12|s=ns[/tpl] states "...And before this was the book of Moses, as a guide and a mercy. And this Book confirms (it)...", while [tpl]Cite quran|2|136|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] commands the believers of Islam to "Say: we believe in God and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered."
Historian Denis Gril believes the Quran does not overtly describe Muhammad performing miracles, and the supreme miracle of Muhammad is identified with the Quran itself.Denis Gril, Miracles, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an Muslim tradition credits Muhammad with several miracles or supernatural events.A.J. Wensinck, Muʿd̲j̲iza, Encyclopedia of Islam For example, many Muslim commentators and some Western scholars have interpreted the Surah [tpl]cite quran|54|1|e=2|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] as referring to Muhammad splitting the Moon in view of the Quraysh when they began persecuting his followers.Daniel Martin Varisco, Moon, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an
The Sunnah represents actions and sayings of Muhammad (preserved in reports known as Hadith), and covers a broad array of activities and beliefs ranging from religious rituals, personal hygiene, burial of the dead to the mystical questions involving the love between humans and God. The Sunnah is considered a model of emulation for pious Muslims and has to a great degree influenced the Muslim culture. The greeting that Muhammad taught Muslims to offer each other, "may peace be upon you" (Arabic: as-salamu `alaykum) is used by Muslims throughout the world. Many details of major Islamic rituals such as daily prayers, the fasting and the annual pilgrimage are only found in the Sunnah and not the Quran.Muhammad, Encyclopædia Britannica, p.9
The Sunnah also played a major role in the development of the Islamic sciences. It contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century.J. Schacht, Fiḳh, Encyclopedia of Islam Muslim mystics, known as sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a perfect saint. Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.Muhammad, Encyclopædia Britannica, p.11–12
Muslims have traditionally expressed love and veneration for Muhammad. Stories of Muhammad's life, his intercession and of his miracles (particularly "Splitting of the moon") have permeated popular Muslim thought and poetry. Among Arabic odes to Muhammad, the Qaṣīda al-Burda ("Poem of the Mantle") by the Egyptian Sufi al-Busiri (1211–1294) is particularly well known, and widely held to possess a healing, spiritual power.[tpl]cite book|author=Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych|title=The mantle odes: Arabic praise poems to the Prophet Muḥammad|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F-nY3_DXo-gC&pg=PR12|accessdate=27 January 2012|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22206-0|page=xii[/tpl] The Quran refers to Muhammad as "a mercy (rahmat) to the worlds" (Quran [tpl]cite quran|21|107|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]). The association of rain with mercy in Oriental countries has led to imagining Muhammad as a rain cloud dispensing blessings and stretching over lands, reviving the dead hearts, just as rain revives the seemingly dead earth (see, for example, the Sindhi poem of Shah ʿAbd al-Latif). Muhammad's birthday is celebrated as a major feast throughout the Islamic world, excluding Wahhabi-dominated Saudi Arabia where these public celebrations are discouraged.Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Encyclopædia Britannica, Muhammad, p.13 When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with Peace be upon him (Arabic: sallAllahu `alayhi wa sallam). In casual writing, this is sometimes abbreviated as PBUH or SAW; in printed matter, a small calligraphic rendition is commonly used instead of printing the entire phrase.

They have, until recently[tpl]when|date=January 2012[/tpl], mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.
The earliest extant depictions come from 13th century Anatolian Seljuk and Ilkhanid Persian miniatures, typically in literary genres describing the life and deeds of Muhammad.[tpl]cite book|author=Christiane Gruber|chapter=Between Logos (Kalima) and Light (Nur): Representations of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad in Islamic Painting|editor=Gulru Necipoglu|title=Muqarnas|url=http://umich.academia.edu/ChristianeGruber/Papers/443477/_Between_Logos_Kalima_and_Light_Nur_Representations_of_the_Prophet_Muhammad_in_Islamic_Painting_|volume=26|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17589-1|pages=234–235[/tpl] During the Ilkhanid period, when Persia's Mongol rulers converted to Islam, competing Sunni and Shi'a groups used visual imagery, including images of Muhammad, to promote their particular interpretation of Islam's key events. Influenced by the Buddhist tradition of representational religious art predating the Mongol elite's conversion, this innovation was unprecedented in the Islamic world, and accompanied by a "broader shift in Islamic artistic culture away from abstraction toward representation" in "mosques, on tapestries, silks, ceramics, and in glass and metalwork" besides books.[tpl]cite book|author=Johan Elverskog|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&pg=PA164|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4237-9|pages=164–169[/tpl] In the Persian lands, this tradition of realistic depictions lasted through the Timurid dynasty until the Safavids took power in the early 16th century. The Safavaids, who made Shi'i Islam the state religion, initiated a departure from the traditional Ilkhanid and Timurid artistic style by covering Muhammad's face with a veil to obscure his features and at the same time represent his luminous essence.[tpl]cite book|chapter=When Nubuvvat encounters Valayat: Safavid painting of the "Prophet" Mohammad's Mi'raj, c. 1500–50|author=Christiane Gruber|editor=Pedram Khosronejad|title=The Art and Material Culture of Iranian Shi'ism: Iconography and Religious Devotion in Shi'i Islam|url=http://www.academia.edu/1176067/When_Nubuvvat_Encounters_Valayat_Safavid_Paintings_of_the_Prophet_Muhammads_Miraj_ca._1500-50|year=2011|publisher=I.

===Non-Muslim views===

Non-Muslim views regarding Muhammad have ranged across a large spectrum of responses and beliefs, many of which have changed over time.Stillman, Norman (1979)."Mohammed and Mohammedanism", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913

====Historical Christian views====

The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources. They indicate that both Jews and Christians saw Muhammad as a "false prophet".Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", Church History, Vol. 38, No. 2 (June 1969), p. 139-149, p. 139-142, quoting from Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati 86–87 Another Greek source for Muhammad is Theophanes, a 9th-century writer. The earliest Syriac source is the 7th-century writer John bar Penkaye.Philip K. Hitti, History of the Arabs, 10th edition (1970), p.112.
According to Hossein Nasr, the earliest European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europe[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]primarily Latin-literate scholars[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]had access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad as a person who seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.
In later ages, Muhammad came to be seen as a schismatic: Brunetto Latini's 13th century Li livres dou tresor represents him as a former monk and cardinal, and Dante's Divine Comedy (Inferno, Canto 28), written in the early 1300s, puts Muhammadand his wife Ali, in Hell "among the sowers of discord and the schismatics, being lacerated by devils again and again." Cultural critic and author Edward Said wrote in Orientalism regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:
 Empirical data about the Orient...count for very little; ... What ... Dante tried to do in the Inferno, is ... to characterize the Orient as alien and to incorporate it schematically on a theatrical stage whose audience, manager, and actors are ... only for Europe. Hence the vacillation between the familiar and the alien; [tpl]as written|Mohammed[/tpl] is always the imposter (familiar, because he pretends to be like the Jesus we know) and always the Oriental (alien, because although he is in some ways "like" Jesus, he is after all not like him).[tpl]cite book |author=Said, Edward W |title=Orientalism |publisher=Penguin |year=2003 |isbn=9780141187426 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=zvJ3YwOkZAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=orientalism&cd=3#v=onepage&q |page=68[/tpl] 
However, Ibn Warraq has challenged Said's assessment of Dante's work as seriously flawed, writing: "Said does not come across as a careful reader of Dante and his masterpiece, The Divine Comedy". Warraq argues first that Said is oblivious to the allegorical content of The Divine Comedy; second, that Said ignores the historical context of Dante's work (i.e., Dante and some of his contemporaries believed that Muhammad was a schismatic Christian who intended to usurp the Pope, thus a heretic); and third that Said misinterprets Dante's placing of three notable Muslims (Avicenna and Averroes and Saladin) in the outer circle of hell: "these illustrious Muslims were included precisely because of Dante's reverence for all that was best in the non-Christian world, and their exclusion from salvation, inevitable under Christian doctrine, saddened him and put a great strain on his mind".[tpl]cite book|last=Warraq|first=Ibn|title=Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M8o6UZ37ppUC&pg=PA27|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus|location=New York|isbn=9781615920204|page=27[/tpl]
After the Reformation, Muhammad was often portrayed in a similar way.Lewis (2002) Guillaume Postel was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad. Boulainvilliers described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker. Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because "he did not deviate from the natural religion". Thomas Carlyle in his book Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1840) describes Muhammed as "a silent great soul; ... one of those who cannot but be in earnest".[tpl]cite book|first=Thomas|last=Carlyle|year=1841|title=On heroes, hero worship and the heroic in history|page=87|publisher=James Fraser|place=London[/tpl]
According to William Montgomery Watt and Richard Bell, recent writers generally dismiss the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad "was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith"Watt, Bell (1995) p. 18 and Muhammad's readiness to endure hardship for his cause, with what seemed to be no rational basis for hope, shows his sincerity.Watt (1974), p. 232 Watt says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken his subconscious for divine revelation.Watt (1974), p. 17 Watt and Bernard Lewis argue that viewing Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor makes it impossible to understand Islam's development.Watt, The Cambridge history of Islam, p. 37Lewis (1993), p. 45. Alford T. Welch holds that Muhammad was able to be so influential and successful because of his firm belief in his vocation.

===Criticism===

Criticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century. He has been attacked by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, as well as for his multiple marriages, possession of slaves and military expeditions across the Middle East.
