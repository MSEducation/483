==Club career==

Born in Coimbra, Miguel Veloso started his football career at S.L. Benfica, but was rejected for being slightly overweight at the time.

In order to give him more playing time, Sporting loaned Veloso to Clube Desportivo Olivais e Moscavide in the third division, and he helped it promote to the second level with a career-best seven goals. As a result he was recalled by the Lions – though it appeared difficult for him to grab a place in the starting team, because of the presence of players with much more experience such as Ânderson Polga, Tonel, Marco Caneira or Custódio – and ended up playing 23 league matches during the campaign, as Sporting (again) finished second. He was equally impressive in his debut in the UEFA Champions League, a 1–0 home win against Inter Milan where he stopped Patrick Vieira and Luís Figo from playing effectively; before the match much was made of Figo's homecoming, but by the end of the 90 minutes all the talk was about Veloso, who turned in a Man of the match display.
In 2007–08 Veloso was ever-present in Sporting's central midfield, alongside another club youth graduate, João Moutinho. The club again lost the league to F.C. Porto, and the same befell in the following season, with the player being involved in some run-ins with manager Paulo Bento;«Miguel Veloso está lesionado», diz o pai («Miguel Veloso is injured», says father); Record, 28 February 2009 [tpl]pt icon[/tpl] in the previous off-season and following January transfer window, he attracted interest from several Premier League clubs, but nothing materialized.Friday's gossip column; BBC Sport, 27 June 2008Spurs to revive Arshavin interest; BBC Sport, 27 August 2008Bolton priced out of Veloso race; BBC Sport, 31 January 2009
