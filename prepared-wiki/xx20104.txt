Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney, and bassist Mike Starr (who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez).
Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal and acoustic elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinct vocal style which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell.
Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 25 million albums worldwide,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140829 |title=ALICE IN CHAINS Interviewed By VOICE OF AMERICA|publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100530075734/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140829| archivedate= May 30, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and over 14 million in the US alone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=tblTopArt&action= |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl] In 1992, the band released their album Dirt, which was critically acclaimed and has been certified quadruple platinum. The band also achieved two No. 1 Billboard 200 releases, 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and eight Grammy Award nominations.
Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 with new lead vocalist William DuVall, and released their fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album was a success, being certified gold by the RIAA in 2010. Alice in Chains released their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, on May 28, 2013. They are currently on tour for this album.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=160902 |title=Alice in Chains Is Working On New Music, Says HEART's Ann Wilson |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl]

==History==

===Formation and early years (1984–89)===

Before the formation of Alice in Chains, then-drummer[tpl]cite web|author=de Sola, David |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/how-alice-in-chains-found-the-most-memorable-voice-in-grunge/255469/ |title=How Alice in Chains Found the Most Memorable Voice in Grunge |publisher=The Atlantic |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-16[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Prato | first=Greg | title=Grunge is Dead. The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eTg4whS9ClUC&printsec=frontcover | year=2009 | publisher=ECW Press | location=Toronto |pages=210–1 | isbn=978-1-55490-347-4[/tpl] Layne Staley landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer.  Other members of this group at that time were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen. This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains.Prato, Greg (2009). pp. 211-212. This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with a singer from another band about backstage passes. Due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it differently as Alice N' Chains to allay any parental concerns but Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she still was not happy with this at first.
While performing with Alice N' Chains, Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell while working at Music Bank rehearsal studios, where the two struggling musicians became roommates, and lived in a rehearsal space they shared. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded and Staley joined a funk band who at the time also required a guitarist. Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join Cantrell's band, which at the time included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr. Eventually the funk project broke up and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis, playing in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, often stretching 15 minutes of material into a 45-minute set. The band played a couple of gigs calling themselves several different monikers, including Diamond Lie, which was the name of Cantrell's previous band,[tpl]YouTube|WOZjcOCrepk|Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney (part 2)[/tpl]. before they eventually took the name that Staley's previous band had initially flirted with - Alice in Chains.[tpl]cite AV media notes | others=Alice in Chains | title=Music Bank| year=1996 |publisher=Columbia Records | id=69580[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Link With Brutality | author=Kleidermacher, Mordechai |date=July 1990 |publisher=Circus magazine[/tpl]
Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert, and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes, and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A&R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on The Treehouse Tapes, Ienner signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989. The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. This recording can be found on the bootleg release Sweet Alice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=86843 |title=Sweet Alice |publisher=Metal-archives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723054944/http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=86843| archivedate= July 23, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Facelift and Sap (1990–92)===

Alice in Chains soon became a top priority of the label, who released the band's first official recording in July 1990, a promotional EP We Die Young. The EP's lead single, "We Die Young", became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains' debut album into production with producer Dave Jerden.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060703145800/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archivedate=July 3, 2006 |title=Discography – Dirt |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a "moody aura" that was a "direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle".[tpl]cite journal| author=Moses, Michael |date=September 1991 |title=Alice in Chains: Who is Alice and Why is She in Chains? |publisher=Rockbeat magazine[/tpl]
The resulting album, Facelift, was released on August 21, 1990, peaking at number 42 in the summer of 1991 on the Billboard 200 chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Alice in Chains – Awards : Allmusic (Billboard Albums) |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alice-in-chains-mn0000007920/awards|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=2013-05-29[/tpl] Facelift was not an instant success, selling under 40,000 copies in the first six months of release, until MTV added "Man in the Box" to regular daytime rotation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://aic.gsg2007.de/Artikel/Dirt.html|title=Dirt |publisher=Guitar World |author=Gill, Chris |date=September 1999|accessdate=2012-09-26[/tpl] The single hit number 18 on the Mainstream rock charts, with the album's follow up single, "Sea of Sorrow", reaching number 27,[tpl]cite web|title=Alice in Chains - Awards: Allmusic (Billboard Singles)|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alice-in-chains-mn0000007920/awards|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2013-05-29[/tpl] and in six weeks Facelift sold 400,000 copies in the US. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic citing Facelift as "one of the most important records in establishing an audience for grunge and alternative rock among hard rock and heavy metal listeners."[tpl]cite web| author=Huey, Steve |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r264|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Facelift |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl]
Facelift was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America by the end of 1990, while the band continued to hone its audience, opening for such artists as Iggy Pop,[tpl]cite web| author=Glickman, Simon |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/alice-chains-biography |title=Enotes – Alice in Chains |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2007-12-28[/tpl] Van Halen, Poison, and Extreme. In early 1991, Alice in Chains landed the opening slot for the Clash of the Titans with Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer, exposing the band to a wide metal audience, but receiving mainly poor reception.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=59909 |title=Alice in Chains Guitarist Discusses 1990 Clash of the Titans tour, Touring With Ozzy |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=October 7, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] Alice in Chains was nominated for a Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy Award in 1992 for "Man in the Box", but lost to Van Halen for their 1991 album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1992/grammys.htm |title=34th Grammy Awards – 1992 |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2007-12-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080105140804/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1992/grammys.htm| archivedate= January 5, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Following the tour, Alice in Chains entered the studio to record demos for its next album, but ended up recording five acoustic songs instead. While in the studio, drummer Sean Kinney had a dream about "making an EP called Sap". The band decided "not to mess with fate", and on March 21, 1992, Alice in Chains released their second EP, Sap. The EP was released while Nirvana's Nevermind was at the top of the Billboard 200 charts, resulting in a rising popularity of Seattle-based bands, and the term grunge music. Sap was soon certified gold within two weeks. The EP features guest vocals by Ann Wilson from the band Heart, who joined Staley and Cantrell for the choruses of "Brother", "Am I Inside" and "Love Song". The EP also features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who appeared together on the song "Right Turn", credited to "Alice Mudgarden" in the liner notes.[tpl]cite AV media notes |others=Alice in Chains |title=Right Turn |year=1992 |publisher=Columbia Records |id=Buttnugget publishing/Jack Lord Music 67059[/tpl] In 1992, Alice in Chains appeared in the Cameron Crowe film Singles, performing as a "bar band".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/st_singles.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061125070118/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/st_singles.aspx| archivedate=November 25, 2006 |title=Singles – Soundtracks and music scores |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-28[/tpl] The band also contributed the song "Would?" to the film's soundtrack, whose video received an award for Best Video from a Film at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1993/mtvvmas.htm |title=1993 MTV Video Music Awards |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2007-12-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071207102814/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1993/mtvvmas.htm| archivedate= December 7, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Dirt (1992–93)===

In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than Facelift, with six of the album's thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction.[tpl]cite journal |date=February 1993 |author=Turman, Katherine |title=Digging Dirt |publisher=RIP magazine[/tpl] "We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There's a lot of intense feelings." Cantrell said, "We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play".
On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, Dirt. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, and since its release has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic praising the album as a "major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece".[tpl]cite web |author=Huey, Steve |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r70661|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Dirt |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] Chris Gill of Guitar World called Dirt "huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate", and "sublimely dark and brutally honest". Dirt spawned five top 30 singles: "Would?", "Rooster", "Them Bones", "Angry Chair" and "Down in a Hole", and remained on the charts for nearly two years.[tpl]cite web| author=Wiederhorn, Jon |date=April 6, 2004 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1486206/20040406/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Remembering Layne Staley: The Other Great Seattle Musician To Die On April 5 |publisher=VH1 |accessdate=2007-12-22[/tpl] Alice in Chains was added as openers to Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears tour.

===Jar of Flies (1993–94)===

Following Alice in Chains' extensive 1993 world tour, Staley said the band "just wanted to go into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened".[tpl]cite journal| author=Andrews, Rob |date=August 1994 |title=A Step Beyond Layne's World |publisher=Hit Parader[/tpl] "We never really planned on the music we made at that time to be released. But the record label heard it and they really liked it. For us, it was just the experience of four guys getting together in the studio and making some music."
While never originally intended for a public release, Columbia Records released Alice in Chains' second acoustic-based EP, Jar of Flies, on January 25, 1994. Written and recorded in one week,[tpl]cite web| url=http://aliceinchains.com/discography/JarOfFlies.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061208170925/http://aliceinchains.com/discography/JarOfFlies.aspx| archivedate=December 8, 2006 |title=Jar of Flies – Discography |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-28[/tpl] Jar of Flies debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming the first ever EP—and first Alice in Chains release—to top the charts. Paul Evans of Rolling Stone called the EP "darkly gorgeous",[tpl]cite web|author=Evans, Paul |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/jar-of-flies-19940324 |title=Jar of Flies |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl] and Steve Huey stated "Jar of Flies is a low-key stunner, achingly gorgeous and harrowingly sorrowful all at once".[tpl]cite web|author=Huey, Steve |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r191391|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Jar of Flies |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] Jar of Flies features Alice in Chains' first number-one single on the Mainstream Rock charts, "No Excuses". The second single, "I Stay Away", reached number ten on the Mainstream rock charts, while the final single "Don't Follow", reached number 25. After the release of Jar of Flies, Layne Staley entered rehab for heroin addiction.[tpl]cite web|author=Wiederhorn, Jon |date=February 8, 1996 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alice-in-chains-to-hell-and-back-rolling-stones-1996-feature-20110405 |title=To Hell and Back |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl] The band was scheduled to tour during the summer of 1994 with Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, Danzig and Fight, but while in rehearsal for the tour, Staley began using heroin again.[tpl]cite web|author=Rothman, Robin |date=February 8, 1996 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/layne-staley-found-dead-20020422 |title=Layne Staley Found Dead |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl] Staley's condition prompted the other band members to cancel all scheduled dates one day before the start of the tour, putting the band on hiatus. Alice in Chains was replaced by Candlebox on the tour.

===Alice in Chains (1995–96)===

While Alice in Chains was inactive during 1995, Staley joined the "grunge supergroup" Mad Season, which also featured Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, bassist John Baker Saunders from The Walkabouts and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin. Mad Season released one album, Above, for which Staley provided lead vocals and the album artwork. The album spawned a number-two single, "River of Deceit", as well as a home video release of Live at the Moore. In April 1995, Alice in Chains entered Bad Animals Studio in Seattle with producer Toby Wright, who had previously worked with Corrosion of Conformity and Slayer.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51361 |title=Meldrum Working With Producer Toby Wright |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080123193521/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51361| archivedate= January 23, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] While in the studio, an inferior version of the song "Grind" was leaked to radio, and received major airplay.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/alice-in-chains.aspx |title=Alice in Chains timeline |publisher=Sonymusic.com |accessdate=2008-02-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080222064518/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Alice-in-chains.aspx| archivedate= February 22, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] On October 6, 1995, the band released the studio version of the song to radio via satellite uplink.
On November 7, 1995, Columbia Records released the eponymous Alice in Chains, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has since been certified double platinum. Of the album's four singles, "Grind", "Again", "Over Now", and "Heaven Beside You", three feature Cantrell on lead vocals. Jon Wiederhorn of Rolling Stone called the album "liberating and enlightening, the songs achieve a startling, staggering and palpable impact."[tpl]cite web |author=Wiederhorn, Jon |date=November 30, 1995 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179804/review/5943047/aliceinchains |title=Alice in Chains: Alice in Chains review |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] The song "Got Me Wrong" unexpectedly charted three years after its release on the Sap EP.

===Hiatus and the death of Layne Staley (1996–2002)===

Although Alice in Chains never officially disbanded, Staley became a recluse, rarely leaving his Seattle condominium following the death of his ex-fiancée Demri Parrott in 1996, due to bacterial endocarditis. "Drugs worked for me for years", Staley told Rolling Stone in 1996, "and now they're turning against me, now I'm walking through hell". In 1997, Alice in Chains toured Japan, New Zealand and Australia as the support act for KISS during their Alive/Worldwide Reunion Tour when KISS reformed with their original members and returned to wearing their famous face paint. Unable to continue with new Alice in Chains material, Cantrell released his first solo album, Boggy Depot, in 1998 which also featured Sean Kinney and Mike Inez.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alice-in-chains-mn0000007920|title=Alice in Chains - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2012-09-22[/tpl] In 1998, Staley reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, "Get Born Again" and "Died". Originally written for Cantrell's solo album, the songs were released in the fall of 1999 on the box set, Music Bank. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, demos, and previous album tracks. The band also released a 15-track compilation titled Nothing Safe: Best of the Box, serving as a sampler for Music Bank, as well as the band's first compilation album. A live album, simply titled Live, released on December 5, 2000, and a second compilation, titled Greatest Hits in 2001.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/music.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060628204951/http://www.aliceinchains.com/music.aspx| archivedate=June 28, 2006 |title=Alice in Chains.com – Discography |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-28[/tpl]
By 2002, Cantrell had finished work on his second solo album, Degradation Trip. Written in 1998, the album's lyrical content focused heavily on what Cantrell regarded as the demise of Alice in Chains which still remained evident as the album approached its June 2002 release. However, in March that year, Cantrell commented, "We're all still around, so it's possible in Chains could all do something someday, and I fully hope someday we will."[tpl]cite web | last=Wiederhorn| first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452982/20020319/cantrell_jerry.jhtml | title=Jerry Cantrell Conjures Ghost Of Alice In Chains On New LP | publisher=MTV | date=March 20, 2002 | accessdate=June 20, 2009[/tpl]
After a decade of battling drug addiction, Layne Staley was found dead in his condominium on April 19, 2002.[tpl]cite news | first = Charles R. | last = Cross | title = The last days of Layne Staley; Alice in Chains singer dies at thirty-four after long battle with heroin | date = June 6, 2002 | work = ROLLING STONE no. 897[/tpl] His mother and stepfather became alarmed when accountants noticed that money was no longer being withdrawn from his accounts. With assistance from the police, they broke into his condo and made the discovery. An autopsy revealed Staley had died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine.  His friends speculate that in addition to drugs, he may have contracted an illness that his body could not fight off, due to a compromised immune system. His body was discovered two weeks after his death. In his last interview, which was given months before his death, Staley admitted, "I know I'm near death, I did crack and heroin for years. I never wanted to end my life this way."[tpl]cite web| author=Wiederhorn, Jon |date=February 25, 2003 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470138/20030225/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Late Alice In Chains Singer Layne Staley's Last Interview Revealed In New Book |publisher=MTV |accessdate=2007-12-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071217070928/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470138/20030225/alice_in_chains.jhtml| archivedate= December 17, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Cantrell dedicated his 2002 solo album, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/artists/JerryCantrell/| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080119070122/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/artists/JerryCantrell/| archivedate=January 19, 2008 |title=Well Worth The Trip |date=December 24, 2002 |publisher=Roadrunner Records UK |accessdate=2007-12-07[/tpl]

===Future plans and the death of Mike Starr (2010–2011)===

In April 2010, guitarist Jerry Cantrell revealed to MTV News that Alice in Chains was contemplating making a fifth studio album in the foreseeable future. He explained, "There are thoughts. We'll see how far we get. Staying in the moment is a good way to live and we certainly hope that it happens. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't happen."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=138381 |title=Alice in Chains Guitarist Says 'There Are Thoughts' Of A New Album |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100419122017/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=138381| archivedate= April 19, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Frontman William DuVall also commented on the next album and Alice in Chains' future, "we've got a lot of water to sail before we do that. There's a lot of shows. But yeah, generally speaking, yeah, we're excited about the future. I don't anticipate some long layoff."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.theweekender.com/music/Alice_In_Chains_finds_its_voice_04-13-2010.html |title=Alice In Chains finds its voice|publisher=Theweekender.com |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100417140031/http://www.theweekender.com/music/Alice_In_Chains_finds_its_voice_04-13-2010.html |archivedate=April 17, 2010[/tpl]
DuVall revealed in September 2010 that Alice in Chains had not begun writing their next album yet, but "there's plenty of riffs flying around." He added, "That was the case when we first started back up. We would just stockpile these fragments, and then some time later we would sift through the mountain of stuff, and that's what became Black Gives Way to Blue. The same thing has been happening since we've been touring Black Gives Way to Blue, so it would be only natural to at some point say, 'Hey, we've got a lot of stuff. Let's sift through and see what we've got this time.'" DuVall also mentioned that it was possible that the new album would feature songs that were written for Black Gives Way to Blue.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956467/alice-in-chains-follow-up-album-likely-says-frontman |title=Alice in Chains Follow-Up Album Likely, Says Frontman |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908081359/http://www.billboard.com/news| archivedate= September 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

By 2013, it had been reported through statements of both Cantrell and Inez that Alice In Chains had begun the recording process for their fifth studio album. The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains had begun writing for a new album in 2011, Cantrell's surgery delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, "The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs and cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now.

Jerry Cantrell's guitar style combines "pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures" to create "slow, brooding minor-key grinds".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/degradation-trip-r590407/review |title=Degradation Trip |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl] He is also recognized for his natural ability to blend acoustic and electric guitars. While down-tuned distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive "snarl-to-a-scream" vocals appealed to heavy metal fans, the band also had "a sense of melody that was undeniable", which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider audience outside of the heavy metal underground.
According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, Alice in Chains' sound has a "Black Sabbath-style riffing and an unconventional vocal style". The band has been described by Erlewine as "hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands". Three of the band's releases feature acoustic music, and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains' self-titled album combined the styles to form "a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers".
Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley (or DuVall) and Cantrell, which included overlapping passages, dual lead vocals, and trademark harmonies typically separated by a major third. Alyssa Burrows said the band's distinctive sound "came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction".[tpl]cite web| author=Burrows, Alyssa |date=May 17, 2002 |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=3778 |title=Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley dies on April 5, 2002. |publisher=Historylink.com |accessdate=2007-12-08[/tpl] Staley's songs were often considered "dark", with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide, while Cantrell's lyrics often dealt with personal relationships.
