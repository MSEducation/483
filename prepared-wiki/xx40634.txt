The Wellington Region as administered by the Greater Wellington Regional Council covers the conurbation around the capital city, Wellington, and the cities of Lower Hutt, Porirua, and Upper Hutt, each of which has a rural hinterland; it extends up the west coast of the North Island, taking in the coastal settlements of the Kapiti Coast district, which includes the southern fringe of the area commonly known as Horowhenua and the town of Otaki; east of the Rimutaka Range it includes three largely rural districts containing most of Wairarapa, covering the towns of Masterton and Carterton, Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough.[tpl]cite web | title=Greater Wellington Regional Council's constituencies | url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/section115.cfm | accessdate=2008-05-08[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==The term Wellington region==

In common usage the terms Wellington Region and Greater Wellington are not clearly defined and areas on the periphery of the region are often excluded.
In its more restrictive sense the region refers to the cluster of built-up areas west of the Tararua ranges. The much more sparsely populated area to the east has its own name, Wairarapa, and a centre in Masterton.
To a lesser extent, the Kapiti Coast is sometimes excluded from the region. Otaki in particular has strong connections to the Horowhenua District to the north.
Wellington City mayor Celia Wade-Brown is not in favour of the region adopting a 'super city' type council like the one in Auckland, though is in favour of reducing the number of councils from nine to "three or four".[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/No-super-city-for-Wellington---mayor/tabid/1607/articleID/284606/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= No 'super city' for Wellington - mayor| date=January 28, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The Māori who originally settled the region knew it as Te Upoko o te Ika a Māui, meaning "the head of Māui's fish". Legend recounts that Kupe discovered and explored the region in about the tenth century.
The region was settled by Europeans in 1839 by the New Zealand Company. Wellington became the capital of Wellington Province upon the creation of the province in 1853, until the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 Nov 1876.New Zealand Provinces 1848–77 Wellington became capital of New Zealand in 1865, the third capital after Russell and Auckland.

==Geography==

The region occupies the southern tip of the North Island, bounded to the west, south and east by the sea. To the west lies the Tasman Sea and to the east the Pacific Ocean, the two seas joined by the narrow and turbulent Cook Strait, which is [tpl]convert|28|km|mi[/tpl] wide at its narrowest point, between Cape Terawhiti and Perano Head in the Marlborough Sounds.
The region covers [tpl]convert|7860|km2|sqmi[/tpl], and extends north to Otaki and almost to Eketahuna in the east. Physically and topologically the region has four areas running roughly parallel along a northeast–southwest axis:

===Human geography===

Over three-quarters of the [tpl]NZ population data|Wellington Region|y|y|y|people (|)[/tpl] reside in the four cities at the southwestern corner. Other main centres of population are on the Kapiti Coast and in the fertile farming areas close to the upper Ruamahanga River in the Wairarapa.
Along the Kapiti Coast, numerous small towns sit close together, many of them occupying spaces close to popular beaches. From the north, these include Otaki,  Waikanae, Paraparaumu, the twin settlements of Raumati Beach and Raumati South, Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay, the latter being a northern suburb of Porirua. Each of these settlements has a population of between 2,000 and 10,000, making this moderately heavily populated.
In the Wairarapa the largest community by a considerable margin is Masterton, with a population of almost 20,000. Other towns include Featherston, Martinborough, Carterton and Greytown.
