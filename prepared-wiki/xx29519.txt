[[Phegopteris]]

CATEGORIES: Thelypteridaceae

Phegopteris is a genus of ferns known collectively as the Beech ferns. Traditionally this genus included only the first three species listed. However, recent genetic evidence clearly shows that the genera Macrothelypteris and Pseudophegopteris, as well as other segregates from the genus Thelypteris, are closely related to Phegopteris in a single clade,[tpl]citation | doi = 10.1640/0002-8444(2002)0920131:IROTTF2.0.CO;2 | year = 2002 | volume = 92 | pages = 131 | title = Intrafamilial Relationships of the Thelypteroid Ferns (Thelypteridaceae) | last1 = Smith | first1 = Alan R. | last2 = Cranfill | first2 = Raymond B. | journal = American Fern Journal | issue = 2[/tpl] and so are now included as Phegopteris species.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
