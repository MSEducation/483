The Kaskaskia Bell State Memorial is a 1948 brick building in Kaskaskia, Illinois that houses a bell cast in 1741 by King Louis XV of France as a gift to the Mission of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church at Kaskaskia.  Known as the "Liberty Bell of the West", the bell was rung by villagers to celebrate their July 4, 1778 liberation from the British by forces of American Colonel George Rogers Clark.  The Memorial also contains murals depicting Colonial scenes of Kaskaskia.  
The Memorial is maintained by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as a state historic site.
