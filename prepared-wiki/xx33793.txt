[[Māras]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity in Latvia, Public holidays in Latvia

In ancient Latvia, Māras or Māras diena (also Lielās Māras diena or Mātes diena) was a festival, celebrated on August 15, held in honor of Māra, the Latvian goddess.  It marked the midpoint between Jāņi (the summer solstice in June) and Miķeļi (end of harvest season). The exact date was probably already a result of Christian influence and identification of Māra with Mary, whose main festival (Assumption) falls on the same date since antiquity.
