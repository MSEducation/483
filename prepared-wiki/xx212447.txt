==Biography==

Alice Glass was born in 1988 in Toronto, Ontario.[tpl]cite web|title=Alice Glass|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer/alice-glass/|work=AskMen.com Celebs|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl] At the age of fourteen she ran away from home to live in a squat community of punks under the name Vicki Vale, yet continued going to school, dropping out before she graduated, and also started an all-girl crust-noise band Fetus Fatale.Alex Miller, "Alice in wonderland and other stories" (p. 26â€“30), NME, October 11, 2008. After seeing Glass perform with Fetus Fatale, Ethan Kath, impressed by her performance, gave her CD-Rs with 60 instrumental tracks of which she chose 5 to write vocals for. Alice Glass and Ethan Kath went to a recording studio to record the 5 songs and unknown to the band, the microphone check before the session was secretly recorded by the engineer, who later presented the band with a CD-R with 6 tracks. This 6th extra track was discovered by London UK's Merok Records who went on to release the track as the band's first vinyl single, "Alice Practice", despite Glass not knowing the track existed or what it sounded like, and named for the fact Glass was just doing soundchecks prior to starting her intended recording session.complex.com: Indie introduction Read at 2010-06-11[tpl]cite web| last = Gillen| first = Kieron| title = Crystal Castles Interview| publisher = Plan B magazine| url =http://www.planbmag.com/content/view/492/42/| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080103053445/http://www.planbmag.com/content/view/492/42/| archivedate=2008-01-03| accessdate =2010-06-11[/tpl]
In 2008, before the band's interview with Now Magazine, Glass disappeared and neither Ethan nor the band's manager could contact her.Now Magazine Crystal Castles was infamously shut down at Glastonbury 2008 after Glass climbed a speaker stand just before "Alice Practice" and was swallowed by the crowd during "Yes No".Gigwise
In March 2008 Glass broke two of her ribs in a car accident. Doctors instructed her to take at least six weeks off to allow time to heal but she continued the tour, performing a twenty minute set within days of the accident.[tpl]cite web|title=Alice Glass|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer/alice-glass/|work=AskMen.com Celebs|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl]
In Tokyo on 18 January 2011, Glass fell and put strain on the unhealed ankle injury, causing her ankle to break. Against the wishes of her physicians, Glass chose to perform 5 months' worth of shows on crutches instead of canceling.[tpl]cite web|title=Crystal Castles' Alice Glass Hospitalized With Broken Ankle|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2011/jan/21/crystal-castles-alice-glass-hospitalized-with-broken-ankle|accessdate=23 January 2011|work=CHARTattack|date=21 January 2011[/tpl]
During a 2012 performance with Crystal Castles at Brixton Academy, Glass kept a small shrine on stage in tribute to a deceased fan of the band (18 year old Connor Meek).http://www.gigwise.com/news/77883/crystal-castles-pay-tribute-to-tragic-fan-after-death-from-cancer The show was reported to be very chaotic, so much so that a security guard asked Glass to address the situation. She spoke directly to the crowd, a rarity for a Crystal Castles performance. Before performing "Wrath of God" she went on to explain that the shrine was for the band's friend Conor, who died at only 18 years old the previous day.  http://thefourohfive.com/review/article/brixton-academy-london-24-11-12
At the 2013 Glastonbury Festival, Crystal Castles began their set 20 minutes past the scheduled time, with Glass visibly sick and beginning "Plague" sitting with her head in her hands. According to NME,http://www.nme.com/photos/glastonbury-2013-the-friday-live-gallery/310451/10/1 Glass had been suffering from food poisoning, but chose to perform anyway. According to many fans, Glass pulled through the entire set.http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/71117
