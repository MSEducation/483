[[Government of Hamburg]]

CATEGORIES: Government of Hamburg

The government of Hamburg is divided into executive, legislative and judicial branches. Due to the characteristic that Hamburg is a city-state and a municipality in Germany, the governance deals with several details of both state politics and community politics. It takes place in two ranks – a city-wide and state administration (Senate of Hamburg), and a local rank for the boroughs. The head of the city-state's government is the First Mayor and President of the Senate. A ministry is called Behörde (office) and a state minister is a Senator in Hamburg. The legislature is the state parliament, called Hamburgische Bürgerschaft, and the judicial branch is composed of the state supreme court and other courts. The seat of the government is Hamburg Rathaus.
Prior to 1871, Hamburg was a fully sovereign country, and its government a sovereign government. Upon joining the German Empire, the city-state retained partial sovereignty as a federal state. It was one of three republics within the German Empire until 1919, which meant that its First Mayor enjoyed the same rank in the Empire as the federal princes. Prior to the constitutional reforms in 1919, the hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten, had a legally privileged position and were the only ones eligible for being elected to the senate.
The local rank is organised in the 7 boroughs of Hamburg.

==Political system==

The bases of the political system are the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and the Constitution of the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg.
The Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg is its own state in the Federal Republic of Germany. Hamburg is a republic, democratic welfare state and a constitutional state. At the same time Hamburg is a municipality, there is no separation between these two administrative tasks.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_8271-544-2-30.pdf |title=Local government and city states in Germany |last=Kramer |first=Jutta |accessdate=2009-07-25 |year=2005 |publisher=Konrad Adenauer Foundation |isbn=0-9584936-8-5 [/tpl] The power to create a law is restricted by federal law.
There is a clear separation of powers.

===Legislature===

The power to create, amend and ratify laws (legislature) is given to the parliament. A plebiscite and a referendum is possible due to the Constitution of Hamburg. In other German states the parliament is called Landtag.
The parliament is among other things responsible for the law, the election of the Erster Bürgermeister (First Mayor) for the election period and the control of the Senate (cabinet). The parliament is a unicameral parliament and the 121 deputies are elected in universal, direct, free, equal and secret elections every four years.[tpl]Citation |title=What is Hamburg Parliament? |publisher=Hamburgische Bürgerschaft |url=http://www.hamburgische-buergerschaft.de/cms_en.php?templ=par_sta.tpl&sub1=225&cont=360 | accessdate=2008-08-14 [/tpl][tpl]Citation |title=Who works in Parliament? |publisher=Hamburgische Bürgerschaft |url=http://www.hamburgische-buergerschaft.de/cms_en.php?templ=par_sta.tpl&sub1=224&cont=353 | accessdate=2008-08-14 [/tpl]
