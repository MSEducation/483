Big Brother Brasil 7 was the seventh season of Big Brother Brasil which premiered January 9, 2007 with the season finale airing April 3, 2007 on the Rede Globo television network.

The grand prize was R$1 million with tax allowances, with a R$50.000 prize offered to the runner up and a R$30.000 prize offered to the 3rd place.
Fani Pacheco returned to compete as a veteran in Big Brother Brasil 13.

==Overview==

There were sixteen housemates competing for the grand prize, an increase over the four previous seasons. The season lasted 85 days, an increase of one week over the previous season. For the first time since the fourth season, the finale night featured a final two rather than a final three.

===Ex-Housemate Exchange===

When two seasons in different countries are taking place simultaneously, housemates are sometimes temporarily exchanged between them. This season was the first time that Big Brother Brasil allow other contestant of other Big Brother to stay in the house.
Pablo Espósito, from Gran Hermano Argentina 4 spent four days (March 20 to March 25, 2007) in the Brazilian house, while Big Boss winner Íris Stefanelli spent another four days (March 27 to April 1, 2007) in the Argentinian house.

===Controversy===

Before the beginning of the show, the announced contestant Yumi Ouchi was replaced by Flávia Viana, as Rede Globo claimed that Yumi had a contract with SBT, another Brazilian television channel, although she denied that.
Another replacement happened on the premiere of the season, when Fernando Orozco was eliminated for having a friend who works as a director in the channel, which is against the rules of the show, as anyone who has any type of relationship with a Globo's employee is not allowed to be contestant in the program. He was replaced by Felipe Cobra.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u67448.shtml|title ="BBB7" tem a terceira menor audiência da história do programa|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-03-22[/tpl]
