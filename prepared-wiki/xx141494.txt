[[Black Boned Angel]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand heavy metal musical groups

Black Boned Angel is a Wellington-based drone metal project of New Zealand experimental musicians Campbell Kneale (who also performs solo as Birchville Cat Motel) and James Kirk (of Sandoz Lab Technicians, The Stumps, The Idle Suite). Originally a duo with Kirk,  recently Black Boned Angel has expanded to include Jules Desmond (of 1/3 Octave Band). Black Boned Angel incorporates elements of drone, industrial, dark ambient and influences taken from doom metal music. The project takes its name directly from a song by the band Godflesh, which can be found on their album "Selfless."  Black Boned Angel have released material on Kneale's own labels Battlecruiser and Celebrate Psi Phenomenon, as well as on 20 Buck Spin and Riot Season, and have been compared to artists such as Earth, Sunn O))), and Corrupted.
