The South East Europe Pipeline was a proposal for a natural gas pipeline from eastern Turkey to Baumgarten an der March in Austria. It was seen as an option for diversification of natural gas potential delivery routes for Europe from Azerbaijan. The pipeline would allow Azerbaijan to supply Europe with [tpl]convert|10|e9m3|abbr=off[/tpl] of natural gas a year.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LS4NTA6JTSEI01-4JDLA9KIUMAV010HE67BDHCA39 |title=BP to Consider New Pipeline to Transit Caspian Natural Gas to EU |publisher= Bloomberg Business Week |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]  The main source of the gas would be Shah Deniz gas field when its second stage comes online.
The pipeline was proposed by BP on 24 September 2011 as an alternative to the existing Southern Gas Corridor projects, including the Nabucco pipeline, Trans Adriatic Pipeline, and Interconnector Turkey–Greece–Italy.  The pipeline was to use existing pipelines, but also needed [tpl]convert|800|–|1000|km[/tpl] (by other sources [tpl]convert|1300|km[/tpl]) of new pipeline to be laid in different countries.  The total route is about [tpl]convert|3800|km[/tpl].
On 28 June 2012 the BP-led Shah Deniz consortium announced it will choose between Nabucco West and Trans Adriatic Pipeline as an export option, and accordingly development of the South East Europe Pipeline project will cease.
