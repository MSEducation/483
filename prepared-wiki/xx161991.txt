==Circumstances leading up to his death==

Garda Tadhg O’Leary, from Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, said Gardaí received a phone call from a woman on that day to report a car being brought into a back yard at Sean O’Casey Avenue and being covered with a sheet.
Garda O’Leary had a check run on the black Toyota Yaris, and the owner in Donnybrook confirmed it had been stolen. He later spotted four young men in the car.
“Terrence Wheelock, who was known to me, jumped from the passenger seat,” he said. “All four youths ran from the car into the back door of the house.”
Gardaí confirmed all four were surrounded in the square at the front of the house by officers and gave themselves up shortly after midday. The inquest heard Mr Wheelock and another man were brought to Store Street Garda station. At that point, Garda O’Leary said he discovered two bench warrants were in existence for Mr Wheelock and he would have to be held to appear before the District Court. “At the time of the arrest of the youths they were caught red-handed”, he said.Man found dead in garda cell 'caught in stolen car' | Ireland | BreakingNews.ie
Terence Wheelock died in hospital on 16 December 2005 after he was found unconscious in a cell in Store Street Garda Station two weeks earlier.
An inquiry by the Garda Ombudsman into the death of Mr Wheelock, who died following his arrest, has found he was not mistreated in any way in Store Street Garda Station.
The Ombudsman's Report also found that an allegation that he was sexually assaulted was wholly without foundation and that there was insufficient evidence to support an allegation of assault.
While no individual garda has been found to be culpable in relation to Mr Wheelock's death, the report identified a number of system failures including the failure to remove the cord from his tracksuit and to properly record details in custody.

===Garda View===

The Garda Siochana stated that Terence committed suicide while in his cell, hanging himself with a ligature which was secured to a fixture which is countersunk into the wall. Kieran Bisset, a member of Dublin Fire Brigade who provide ambulance cover in the Dublin area, said a number of Gardaí were performing CPR on the unconscious man when the Fire Brigade were called after 2.30pm.
“There was an obvious ligature mark around the front of his neck,” he said, adding it was deep and previous experience would indicate it was from a cord or a shoelace.
The Gardaí stated that on observing Terrence in the cell they took him into the open cell area where CPR was performed

===Family View===

The idea that Terence had hanged himself is one which has been contested by his family. According to his brother Larry, Terence was a healthy, happy-go-lucky young man with no history of self-harm and for him to have committed suicide would have been entirely out of character. His family believe that Terence died as a result of injuries received from the gardaí while in custody.
According to Larry Wheelock, Terrances' brother, Terrence was in fact a victim of police brutality and high-ranking members of the force have actively attempted to cover up what really happened.  Garda
