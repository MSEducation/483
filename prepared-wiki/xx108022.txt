INS ''Trishul'' (F43) (Trident) is the second ship of the [tpl]sclass|Talwar|frigate[/tpl] of the Indian Navy.

==Design==

Trishul belongs to the Talwar class of frigates. The Talwar class guided missile frigates are modified Krivak III class frigates built by Russia. These ships use stealth technologies and a special hull design to ensure a reduced radar cross section. Much of the equipment on the ship is Russian-made, but a significant number of systems of Indian origin have also been incorporated.

==Service history==

In December 2005, INS Trishul collided with a commercial ship, Ambuja Laxmi, outside the Mumbai harbour, while returning from a training mission. Radar systems installed by the port authorities and those on board the Ambuja Laxmi were unable to detect the INS Trishul, and were unable to prevent the side-on collision.Navy to keep MbPT, JNPT informed of stealth frigates movement Article in the Daily Excelsior, Retrieved on 18-11-2009
