Biddulph is a town in Staffordshire, England, about 7 miles (12 km) north of Stoke-on-Trent and south east of Congleton, Cheshire.

==Origin of the name==

Biddulph's name may come from Anglo-Saxon/Old English bī dylfe = "beside the pit or quarry".  Some have said[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=November 2010[/tpl] that the name Biddulph is a corruption of the Saxon/Old English Bidulfe, signifying Wolf Slayer, and as a result the Biddulph family crest is a wolf rampant.

==Education==

In common with other parts of the area administered by Staffordshire LEA, the Middle School system operates in Biddulph.
Biddulph has one high school (ages 13 to 16) with a sixth form (ages 16 to 18).  Called Biddulph High School, it was awarded Sports College status in 2002.  It has since gained Technology College status.  Biddulph also has two middle schools: Woodhouse Middle School and James Bateman Junior High School (formerly Park Middle School), serving pupils aged 9–13.  These are fed by several first schools, such as Kingsfield First School, Knypersley First School, Squirrel Hayes First School, Oxhey First School, and several more.
So the origin of Biddulph is Saxon/Old English.

==Recent developments==

The supermarket chain Sainsbury's opened a new store in Biddulph in November 2010.
In addition to the supermarket development, a number of derelict and semi-derelict buildings are currently being refurbished or rebuilt by the local Councils and private owners. These are in line with the intentions set out in the Town Centre Area Action Plan (2007),Biddulph Town Centre Area Action Plan, Staffordshire Moorlands District Council (February 2007) which aims to reverse the spiral of decline that has threatened the long-term viability of the town centre since the early 1990s.
A new 3000 square metre primary health facility for the North Staffordshire Primary Care Trust is also planned for the town centre as part of the ongoing regeneration and investment programme.
A new cafe for youngsters, 'Biddulph Young People’s Place' opened in March 2011 at Kingsfield First School after a year of planning and fund-raising.
in 2011 Biddulph, which has a population of approx. 20,000, was left without a post office for 4 months when the small supermarket in which it was situated closed down. A temporary Post Office was eventually set up in the town hall car park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Temporary-Post-Office-opens-Biddulph-month-wait/story-13688954-detail/story.html |title=Temporary Post Office opens in Biddulph after four-month wait |publisher=This is Staffordshire |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=2013-05-29[/tpl]
