The Sheffield Supertram (not derived from the previous tramways), operated by Stagecoach, opened in 1994, shortly after the similar Metrolink scheme in Manchester. Its network consists of [tpl]convert|37|mi|km[/tpl] of track and three lines, from Halfway to Malin Bridge (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to Middlewood (Yellow Line), and from Meadowhall to Herdings Park (Purple Line), with all three lines running via the city centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.supertram.net/about.html|title=About Us|work=Stagecoach Supertram website|publisher=Stagecoach Group|accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl] The system contains both on-street and segregated running, depending upon the section and line. The Supertram serves as an important connection between areas in the North East of Sheffield (namely Meadowhall and Valley Centertainment) and the city centre. Because it is operated by the Stagecoach Group, the ticketing system for the Supertram is integrated with Stagecoach buses in Sheffield, meaning passengers can switch between the two modes of transport without having to buy a separate ticket.Stagecoach Bus. Stagecoach Bus. Retrieved 24 August 2011.
Sheffield's local bus infrastructure has its main hub at Sheffield Interchange. Other bus stations lie at Halfway, Hillsborough and Meadowhall. A flurry of new operators was created after deregulation in 1986,[tpl]cite journal|last=Bayliss|first=David|year=1997|title=Bus Privatisation in Great Britain|journal=ICE Proceedings, Transport|volume=123|issue=2|pages=81–93|doi=10.1680/itran.1997.29377[/tpl] though a series of mergers has reduced the number. thumb|alt=A Sheffield Supertram in current blue, orange and red Stagecoach livery.

There are numerous bus operators within Sheffield: First, Stagecoach, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G&J Holmes, and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, part of FirstGroup, became by far the largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/Call-for-action-to-halt.1115892.jp|title=Call for action to halt fall in bus passengers |work=The Star|date=16 August 2005|accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/Next-stop-in-bus-protest.1332988.jp|title=Next stop in bus protest campaign|work=The Star|date=31 January 2006|accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl] Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city.

===Cycling===

For cycling, although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads. It is on the Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle Network route running from West to East from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North to South from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/|title=Welcome to the Trans Pennine Trail – Home Page|publisher=Trans Pennine Trail |accessdate=7 August 2009[/tpl]

==Education==

===Universities and colleges===

Sheffield has two universities, the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. The two combined bring about 65,000 students to the city every year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-uni-sheffield|title=University Guide: University of Sheffield|date=10 May 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=22 July 2009 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-sheffield-hallam-uni|title=University Guide: Sheffield Hallam University|date=10 May 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=22 July 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Sheffield University was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and became the University of Sheffield in 1905.
Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a university on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus is located in the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and Collegiate Crescent Campus is about two miles away, adjacent to Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. The university is the third largest in the UK, with more than 37,000 students (of whom over 4,000 are international students), 4,170 staff and 747 courses.
Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1834 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.
Sheffield has two further education colleges, The Sheffield College and Longley Park Sixth Form College. The Sheffield College is organised on a federal basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city, since reduced to just four: Sheffield City (formerly Castle)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheffcol.ac.uk/index.cfm?parentid=e69ba9a6-2eff-427f-af5a-2af03712076a|title=Castle College Milestone|date=11 December 2008|publisher=The Sheffield College|accessdate=21 June 2009[/tpl] near the city centre, Hillsborough, serving the north of the city and Norton and Peaks to the south.

==Sport==

Sheffield has a long sporting heritage. In 1857 a collective of cricketers formed the world's first-ever official football club, Sheffield F.C.,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/7060059.stm|title=Stars mark team's 150th birthday|date=24 November 2007|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl] and the world's second-ever, Hallam F.C., who also play at the world's oldest football ground in the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby Dronfield, Derbyshire.
By 1860 there were 15 football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.[tpl]cite book|last=Harvey|first=Adrian|title=Football: the first hundred years: the untold story|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|pages=92–125|chapter=Britain's first football culture—Sheffield 1857–67|isbn=0-415-35019-0[/tpl] There are two professional clubs in the Football League: Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday. Sheffield United play in Football League One and Sheffield Wednesday in the Football League Championship. Rotherham United, who play in Football League Two, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of Millmoor, Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat New York Stadium in Rotherham. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby, whilst United and Wednesday contest the Steel City derby.
There are also facilities for golf, climbing, and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena (IceSheffield).
Their most successful moment came in 1998, when, against all the odds they defeated Wigan Warriors in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone. Sheffield also put in a bid to be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.
Sheffield is also home to the Sheffield Steelers ice hockey team who play out of the 8,500 seater Sheffield Arena. They play in the 10 team professional Elite Ice Hockey League.
Many of Sheffield's sporting facilities were built for the World Student Games, which the city hosted in 1991, including Sheffield Arena and the Ponds Forge international diving and swimming complex. Ponds Forge is also the home of Sheffield City Swimming Club, a local swimming club competing in the Speedo league. The former Don Valley International Athletics Stadium, once the largest athletics stadium in the UK, was also constructed for the Universiade games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=sheffield&country=uk|title=Sheffield: Don Valley Stadium|last=Grose|first=Tim|year=2003|work=UK Running Track Directory|publisher=Tim Grose|accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl]

Sheffield also has many golf courses all around the city.
Sheffield was selected as a candidate host city by the Football Association (FA) as part of the English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid on 16 December 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.england2018bid.com/news/158/candidate-host-cities-revealed.aspx |title=Candidate host cities revealed |publisher=england2018bid.com, |accessdate=17 December 2009[/tpl]
