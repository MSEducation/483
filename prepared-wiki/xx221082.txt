[[Llenandose de gusanos]]

CATEGORIES: Corrupted (band) albums, 2004 albums

Llenandose de gusanos is the second full-length studio album by Japanese doom metal band Corrupted. The album comprises two CDs, each containing only one track. The first disc is in the typical doom style Corrupted is known for, while the second disc contains ambience.
The title is Spanish for "Filling of Worms" or "Filling Oneself with Worms", although the technical Spanish translation for "filling oneself" is llen√°ndose, not llenandose; the accent mark was left off the title.
