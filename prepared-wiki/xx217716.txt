Sir Andrew Marshall Porter, 1st Baronet PC, QC (27 June 1837 – 9 January 1919) was an Irish lawyer and judge.

==Background and education==

Porter was born in Belfast, the son of Reverend John Scott Porter. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, and Queen's University, Belfast.

==Legal and judicial career==

In 1860 Porter was called to the Bar and by 1872 had become Queen's Counsel. He sat as Member of Parliament for County Londonderry from 1881 to 1884 and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1881 to 1882 and as Attorney-General for Ireland from 1882 to 1883: in his official capacity he was deeply involved in the trials following the Phoenix Park murders. He was appointed Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1883 and served in that post until 1907. In 1902, he was made a baronet by King Edward VII. 
A. M. Sullivan described him as "a fine lawyer of noble presence and true dignity" who did not tolerate any disturbance to the decorum of his Court. As a judge Sullivan ranked him as one of the four greatest he had known, almost the equal of Christopher Palles.

==Family==

Porter married Agnes Horsburgh and they had several children including John who succeeded to the title. While living in Dublin, Porter resided at 42 Merrion Square East as noted in Ulysses by James Joyce.
