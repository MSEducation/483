Ollusion received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 4 reviews.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/ollusion/omarion|title=Ollusion Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More at Metacritic|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] Allmusic's editor Andy Kellman found it "Almost all of these beats would be classified as snapping, slapping, or smacking before banging, flecked with details yet simultaneously somewhat half-assed-sounding. Given the number of partially detached vocals, filled with android-in-heat impersonations, clipped-phrase drop-ins, and messing around, it’s as if Omarion wanted to make a concerted attempt to downplay his vocal ability, which only adds to the album’s weird, teasing charm.".[tpl]cite web |first=Andy |last=Kellman  |title=Review: Ollusion |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ollusion-mw0000833319/  |publisher=Allmusic  |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl] Monica Herrera of Billboard magazine wrote that the album "The set come off more like a bid for street cred than maturation. Lyrics full of hip-hop bravado over dirty, and distortion-heavy beats. But when Omarion reaches for the high notes, he shines like a seasoned star.".[tpl]cite web |first=Monica |last=Herrera  |title=Review: Omarion, Ollusion |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069760/omarion-ollusion |publisher=Billboard  |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that "Clunky lyrics are everywhere, undoing some of the progress Omarion has made. The otherwise lovely “Speedin’,” Omarion’s most convincing song here.".[tpl]cite web |first=Jon |last=Caramanica  |title=Critics' Choice - New CDs |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/arts/music/11choi.html?_r=0 |publisher=The New York Times  |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl]
