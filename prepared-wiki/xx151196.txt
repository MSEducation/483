CATEGORIES: International Race of Champions, 2006 in American motorsport

The 30th and final season of the Crown Royal International Race of Champions began on Friday, February 17, 2006 at Daytona International Speedway.  The all-star roster included thirteen drivers (in twelve cars) from seven premier racing series.  Tony Stewart consistently ran up front and won two races and finished ahead of the equally consistent Matt Kenseth by 12 points.  As with the past two editions, the drivers used their car colors and numbers from their native series (when feasible). This was also the first IROC season since 1991 to include a road course race (held on the Daytona International Speedway road course).
