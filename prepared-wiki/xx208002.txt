CATEGORIES: Defunct football clubs in Ukraine, Kiev Oblast

Inter Boyarka was a Ukrainian football club that last played in Boyarka, Kiev Oblast during Ukrainian Second League 2006-07 season.
Originally the club was based in Borodianka, Kiev Oblast and they had several name changes in their existence.
In 1992 the club originally was known as Hart, based on the Central Sports Club "Hart" of Ministry of Education, competed at the Amateur level and were champions in the 3rd Zone of the Ukrainian KFK competition. This was the entrance criterion for the club to enter the professional ranks. The next season they entered the Ukrainian Third League.
Before the 1994/1995 season the club renamed themselves to Systema-Boreks Borodianka for which they were better known while they competed in the professional leagues. With reasonable success the club spent 2 seasons in the Ukrainian First League. Before the 2004/5 season the club was renamed as Osvita Borodianka.
In 2005 with the club struggling financially and on the football arena they moved to Boyarka, Kiev Oblast and renamed themselves as Boyarka-2006 Boyarka. This did not help as the club after the 2007 season folded.
