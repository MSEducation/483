The Common Gull (European and Asian subspecies; see below) or Mew Gull (North American subspecies) Larus canus is a medium-sized gull which breeds in northern Asia, northern Europe and northwestern North America. It migrates further south in winter.del Hoyo, J., et al., eds. (1998). Handbook of the Birds of the World 3: 621. Lynx Edicions ISBN 84-87334-20-2. Its name does not indicate that it is an abundant species, but that during the winter it feeds on common land, short pasture used for grazing.Okill, Dave (2004) English names for Western Palearctic birds British Birds 97(7):  348-9

==Description==

Adult Common Gulls are 40–46 cm long, noticeably smaller than the Herring Gull, and slightly smaller than the Ring-billed Gull, also differing from the latter in its shorter, more tapered bill with a more greenish shade of yellow, as well as being unmarked during the breeding season. The body is grey above and white below. The legs are greenish-yellow. In winter, the head is streaked grey, and the bill often has a poorly defined blackish band near the tip (sometimes sufficiently obvious to cause confusion with Ring-billed Gull). They have black wingtips with large white "mirrors". Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern, and grey legs. They take two to three years to reach maturity. The call is a high-pitched "laughing" cry.Snow, D. W. & Perrins, C. M. (1998). The Birds of the Western Palearctic Concise Edition. OUP ISBN 0-19-854099-X.

==Taxonomy==

There are four subspecies, two of them considered distinct species by some authorities:Olsen, K. M., & Larsson, H. (2004). Gulls of Europe, Asia and North America. Helm ISBN 0-7136-7087-8. 

==Ecology==

Both Common and Mew Gulls breed colonially near water or in marshes, making a lined nest on the ground or in a small tree; colony size varies from 2 to 320 or even more pairs. Usually three eggs are laid (sometimes just one or two); they hatch after 24–26 days, with the chicks fledging after a further 30–35 days. Like most gulls, they are omnivores and will scavenge as well as hunt small prey. The global population is estimated to be about one million pairs; they are most numerous in Europe, with over half (possibly as much as 80-90%) of the world population.Hagemeijer, W. J. M., & Blair, M. J., eds. (1997). The EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds. Poyser, London ISBN 0-85661-091-7. By contrast, the Alaskan population is only about 10,000 pairs.

==Vagrancy==

The Common Gull occurs as a scarce winter visitor to coastal eastern Canada and as a vagrant to the northeastern USA,Sibley, D. (2000). The Sibley Guide to Birds. ISBN 0-679-45122-6. and there is one recent record of Mew Gull in Europe on the Azores.Alfrey, P., & Ahmad, M. (2007).

==Etymology==

The scientific name Larus canus simply translates from Latin as grey or hoary gull.[tpl]cite book |title=A Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names |last=Jobling |first=James A |year=1991 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-854634-3[/tpl] The name Common Gull was coined by Thomas Pennant in 1768 because he considered it the most numerous of its genus.[tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of British Bird Names |last=Lockwood |first=W B |year=1993 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-866196-2[/tpl] John Ray earlier used the name Common Sea-Mall. It is something of a cliche that Uncommon Gull is a more accurate description. There are many old British regional names for this species with variations on maa, mar and mew.[tpl]cite book|last=Jackson|first=Christine E.|title=British Names of Birds|year=1968|publisher=Witherby[/tpl]
