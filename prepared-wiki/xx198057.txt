The Planta Solar 20 (PS20)  solar power plant is a solar thermal energy plant in Sanlucar la Mayor near Seville in Andalusia, Spain. It was the world's most powerful solar power tower until the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California became operational in 2014.Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, Wikipedia The 20 megawatt (MW) solar power tower produces electricity with large movable mirrors called heliostats.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2007/2007-03-30-02.asp |title= First EU Commercial Concentrating Solar Power Tower Opens in Spain |date= 30 March 2007 |publisher= Environment News Service |accessdate= 20 March 2012 [/tpl]Abengoa Solar Begins Operation of World's Largest Solar Power Tower Plant
Construction of PS20 was started in 2006 and it commenced operation in 2009. It features several significant technological improvements over the earlier PS10. These include a receiver with higher efficiency, various improvements in the control and operational systems, and a better thermal energy storage system.
"PS20 consists of a solar field of 1,255 mirrored heliostats designed by Abengoa Solar. Each heliostat, with a surface area of [tpl]Convert|120|m2|ft2|abbr=on[/tpl], reflects the solar radiation it receives onto the receiver, located on the top of a [tpl]Convert|165|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high tower, producing steam which is converted into electricity by a turbine generator."[ref]

"The remaining power plants will be built over the next few years. They will include low- and high-concentration photovoltaic, tower thermoelectric, parabolic-trough collector and Stirling dish plants. Abengoa Solar's parabolic trough plants, Solnova 1, 3 and 4, which can generate 150MW of power, are under construction at the Solar Platform."[ref]

Resulting from cooperation between Ciemat, the IDEA, and the University of Seville, the whole plant is to be completed by 2013, when it will produce approximately 300 MW – energy for around 180,000 homes, equivalent to the needs of the city of Seville.
PS20 produces about 48,000 megawatt-hours (MW·h) per year, for which it receives €271 (US$360) per MW·h under its power purchase agreement.[ref]
