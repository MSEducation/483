Tavistock Street is a street in the Covent Garden area of London which runs parallel to the Strand between Drury Lane and Southampton Street just south of the market piazza.

==History==

In the early 19th century, the street was the location of many fashionable shops, such as are now to be found in Bond Street.  The congregation of rich carriages there was said to be one of the great sights of London at this time.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AJlk88XKayEC&pg=PA30 |page=30|title=The original |author=Thomas Walker |year=1850[/tpl]  It then became a centre of publishing of periodicals such as Country Life (no 8, designed in 1904 by Edwin Lutyens), The Stage and Vanity Fair.
