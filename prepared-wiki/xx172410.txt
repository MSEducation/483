The Brochet MB.100 was a three-seat light aircraft developed in France in the early 1950s. It was a further derivative of the Brochet MB.70, using essentially the same airframe as the MB.80, but with a revised tail and cabin, the latter now including a third seat. The Service de l'Aviation Légère et Sportive purchased several examples for distribution to French aeroclubs, including a number of tropicalised versions for use in North Africa. Unlike its predecessors, the MB.100 was designed without any thought of homebuilding.
