Born in Harlem, New York, Jones originally trained to be an advertising designer. He moved to the Netherlands in 1954 with a dance troupe. He was hired by a cabaret company and began a career singing, acting, and dancing. He was hired for the very first Dutch television show, the 1950s television hit Pension Hommeles (written by Annie M.G. Schmidt), in which he played Dinky Henderson, who sings the Cor Lemaire song "Ik zou je het liefste in een doosje willen doen," a Dutch hit and now one of the standards in the musical comedy genre.[tpl]cite news|last=Rubing|first=Lies|title=Donald Jones overleden|url=http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.wereldomroep.nl/actua/nl/cultuur/theater/donaldjones041108-redirected|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=8 November 2004[/tpl] This made Jones the first black star in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite news|title=Donald Jones overleden|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/706555/2004/11/07/Donald-Jones-overleden.dhtml|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=de Volkskrant|date=7 November 2004[/tpl]
