===Casting===

The Wachowskis struggled to cast the roles of Violet and Corky, seemingly because of the lesbian content of the film. Few actresses were interested. The part of Violet was expected to go to Linda Hamilton, and Jennifer Tilly read for the part of Corky. She loved the role and was looking forward to playing a character very different from previous parts in her career.[ref]

===Filming===

Bound was shot in thirty-eight days in Santa Monica, California. The Wachowskis' original director of photography resigned on the grounds that he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. Subsequently cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew "a bunch of cheap guys".[ref]
