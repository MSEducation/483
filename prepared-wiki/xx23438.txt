The Preakness Stakes is an American flat thoroughbred horse race held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a Grade I race run over a distance of 9.5 furlongs (1  3/16 miles) on dirt. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg); fillies 121 lb (55 kg). It is the second leg of the US Triple Crown, following the Kentucky Derby and followed by the Belmont Stakes.
First run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland Governor after a winning colt at Pimlico.  The race has been termed "The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans" because a blanket of yellow flowers altered to resemble the Maryland State flower is placed around the winner's neck.  Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America only trailing the Kentucky Derby.
The 139th running of The Preakness Stakes will take place on Saturday, May 17th, 2014 for a purse of $1,500,000.

==History==

Two years before the Preakness was run for the first time, Pimlico introduced its new stakes race for three-year-olds, the Preakness, during its first-ever spring race meet in 1873. Former Maryland Governor Oden Bowie named the then mile and one-half (2.41 km) race in honor of the colt Preakness from Milton Holbrook Sanford's Preakness Stables in Preakness, Wayne Township, New Jersey, who won the Dinner Party Stakes on the day Pimlico opened (October 25, 1870).  The New Jersey name was said to have come from the Native American name Pra-qua-les ("Quail Woods") for the area.Origin of the "Preakness" preakness-stakes.info - Retrieved May 17, 2009 After Preakness won the Dinner Party Stakes, his jockey, Billy Hayward,  untied a silk bag of gold coins that hung from a wire stretched across the track from the judges’ stand. This was the supposed way that the “wire” at the finish line was introduced and how the awarding of “purse” money came to be.[tpl]cite book|last=Dandrea|first=Phil|title=Sham: Great Was Second Best|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus Publishing|isbn=978-0-9842173-3-5|url=http://www.ShamHorse.com|title=www.ShamHorse.com[/tpl] In reality, the term "purse", meaning prize money, had been in use for well over a century.[tpl]cite book | last1=Pick |first1=William |last2=Johnson |first2=R. |title=The Turf Register (Volume I) |publisher=A.

The first Preakness, held on May 27, 1873, drew seven starters. John Chamberlain's three-year-old, Survivor, collected the $2,050 winning purse by galloping home easily by 10 lengths. This was the largest margin of victory until 2004, when Smarty Jones won by 11 1/2 lengths.Rogers, Mike. "History Fills Old Hilltop," PressBox (Baltimore), April 2009.
In 1890 Morris Park Racecourse in the Bronx, New York hosted the Preakness Stakes after which there was no race run for three years. For the 15 years from 1894 through 1908, the race was held at Gravesend Race Track on Coney Island, New York.  In 1909 it returned to Pimlico.Early History - preakness-stakes.info - Retrieved May 12, 2009
In March 2009 Magna Entertainment Corp., which owns Pimlico, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy thus throwing open the possibility the Stakes could move again.  On April 13, 2009, the Maryland Legislature approved a plan to buy the Stakes and the Pimlico course if Magna Entertainment cannot find a buyer.Md. legislators OK billon buying Preakness Stakes - courier-journal.com - April 14, 2009
Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes, the Breeders' Cup and the Kentucky Oaks. The attendance of the Preakness Stakes typically only trails the Kentucky Derby, for more information see American Thoroughbred Racing top Attended Events.

==Evolution of the Triple Crown series==

The Preakness is the second leg in American thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown series and almost always attracts the Kentucky Derby winner, some of the other horses that ran in the Derby, and often a few horses that did not start in the Derby. The Preakness is 1 3/16 miles, or 9½ furlongs, compared to the Kentucky Derby, which is 1¼ miles. It is followed by the third leg, the Belmont Stakes, which is 1½ miles.
Since 1932, the order of Triple Crown races has the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1932, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day.Turf'n'Sport, Retrieved on 2009-05-04.
Today, the Preakness is run on the third Saturday in May, two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes.

==Running the race==

Just after the horses for the Preakness are called to the post, the audience is invited to sing "Maryland, My Maryland", the official state song of Maryland. Traditionally, the Baltimore Colts' Marching Band led the song from the infield.[tpl]cite web|last=Rodricks|first=Dan|title=Just one serse of state song to be aired|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-05-17/news/1996138044_1_maryland-scum-choir|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=05/01/2012[/tpl]  Today, the United States Naval Academy Glee Club leads the song.[tpl]cite web|last=Brunelli|first=Laureen Miles|title=Maryland, My Maryland|url=http://baltimore.about.com/od/onlyinbaltimore/a/marylandmyMD.htm|accessdate=05/01/2012[/tpl] 
As soon as the Preakness winner has been declared official, a painter climbs a ladder to the top of a replica of the Old Clubhouse cupola. The colors of the victorious owner's silks are applied on the jockey and horse that are part of the weather vane atop the infield structure. The practice began in 1909 when a horse and rider weather vane sat atop the old Members' Clubhouse, which was constructed when Pimlico opened in 1870. The Victorian building was destroyed by fire in June 1966. A replica of the old building's cupola was built to stand in the Preakness winner's circle in the infield.Painting the Weather Vane – Preakness Stakes.

Should that horse have also won the Kentucky Derby, speculation and excitement immediately begin to mount as to whether that horse will go on to win the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing at the Belmont Stakes in June.

==Winning the race==

In 1917, the first Woodlawn Vase was awarded to the Preakness winner, who was not allowed to keep it. Eventually a half-size reproduction of the trophy was given to winners to keep permanently. The original trophy is kept at the Baltimore Museum of Art and brought to the race each year under guard, for the winner's presentation ceremony.Woodlawn Vase – Preakness Stakes.
In 1940, it was proposed to drape the winning horse in a garland of the Maryland State flower, Rudbeckia hirta, commonly called black-eyed Susans.  This posed a problem, as the race is run nearly two months before the flowers come into bloom in late June or July. At first, yellow Viking daisies were painted to resemble black-eyed Susans; workers switched to chrysanthemums later.  Although the Preakness is sometimes referred to as "the race for the black-eyed Susans", no black-eyed Susan is ever used.David Klatt, The Secret Behind the Preakness' Black-Eyed Susan Blanket May 14, 2009.The Black-Eyed Susan Blanket. Accessed 2009.05.14.  
In 1918, 26 horses entered the race, and it was run in two divisions, providing for two winners that year. Currently, the race is limited to 14 horses.
In 1948, the Preakness was televised for the first time by CBS.
The Preakness has been run at seven different distances:

==Purse Money==

On December 12, 2013 the Maryland Jockey Club announced for the 2014 running of the Preakness the purse would be moved from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 http://www.brisnet.com/cgi-bin/editorial/news/article.cgi?id=41710 The $1M USD amount had been in place since the 1998 edition of the race. 
At its inauguration in 1873, the Preakness carried a value of $1,000. The first major increase occurred in 1919 when the race had a $25,000 value. It climbed to $100,000 in 1946 and in 1959 was raised to $150,000. Subsequent increases occurred from 1979 to 1989, when the purse rose four times from $200,000 to $500,000, before going to $1 million in 1998.http://www.brisnet.com/cgi-bin/editorial/news/article.cgi?id=41710

==Records==

Speed record: 
Secretariat, the 1973 winner, was originally credited with a running time of 1:55. Two Daily Racing Form clockers, however, timed Secretariat's Preakness in 1:53 2/5, a new stakes record. A hearing was held over the time discrepancy, where a video replay proved Secretariat reached the wire before Canonero II, the then-current record holder. But instead of giving Secretariat the record, the Maryland Jockey Club decided to split the difference and make its official time that of Pimlico's clocker, who timed the race in 1:54 2/5. The matter was finally resolved in a June 2012 meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission, which unanimously ruled to change Secretariat's final time to 1:53 based on testimony and analysis of the race replays.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drf.com/news/secretariat-awarded-preakness-record-153-after-review|title=Secretariat awarded Preakness record at 1:53 after review|author=Hegarty, Matt|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl]
