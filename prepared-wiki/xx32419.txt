Nicholas Edward "Nick" Cave (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian musician, songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer and occasional film actor.
He is best known for his work as a frontman of the critically acclaimed rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, established in 1983, a group known for its eclectic influences and musical styles. Before that, he fronted the group The Birthday Party in the early 1980s, a band renowned for its highly gothic, challenging lyrics and violent sound influenced by post-punk, blues and free jazz. In 2006, he formed the garage rock band Grinderman that released its debut the following year. Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences, and lyrical obsessions with religion, death, love and violence.Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey, Allmusic, (((Nick Cave > Biography))). Retrieved 30 September 2009.
Upon Cave's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, ARIA Awards committee chairman Ed St John said, "Nick Cave has enjoyed—and continues to enjoy—one of the most extraordinary careers in the annals of popular music. He is an Australian artist like Sidney Nolan is an Australian artist—beyond comparison, beyond genre, beyond dispute."Nick Cave to enter ARIA Hall of Fame[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Youth, education and family==

Cave was born on 22 September 1957 at Warracknabeal, a small country town in the state of Victoria, Australia, to Dawn Cave (née Treadwell) and Colin Frank Cave.[tpl]cite web | url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/whats-on/nick-cave/curators-notes | title=Curator's Notes | publisher=Western Australian Museum | year=2009 | accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/22800062 |title=22 December 1949 - LIFE OF MELBOURNE Drama Prize |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=22 December 1949 |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] As a child, he lived in Warracknabeal and then Wangaratta in rural Victoria. His father, Colin, taught English and maths at the local school; his mother, Dawn, was its librarian.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/feb/23/popandrock.features | title=Old Nick | publisher=The Guardian | date=23 February 2008 | accessdate=30 March 2012 | author=Hattenstone, Simon[/tpl] Colin also organised the first symposium on the bushranger and anti-hero Ned Kelly,Cave, Colin (ed).

Retrieved 2 March 2013.
When Cave was 9 he joined the Cathedral choir of Wangaratta’s Holy Trinity Cathedral. At 13 he was expelled from Wangaratta High School. In 1970, Cave became a boarder and later day boy at Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne. Cave was 19 when his father was killed in a car accident; at the moment he was informed of this, his mother Dawn Cave was bailing him out of a St Kilda police station for a charge of burglary. Cave would later recall that his father "died at a point in my life when I was most confused", and "the loss of my father created in my life a vacuum, a space in which my words began to float and collect and find their purpose".Maume, Chris. "Nick Cave: Devil's advocate", The Independent. Retrieved on 10 November 2008.
After his secondary schooling, Cave studied painting (Fine Art) at the Caulfield Institute of Technology (now Monash University, Caulfield campus) in 1976, but dropped out in 1977 to pursue music. Cave revealed in a 2013 interview:
 
 I really wanted to be a painter—the lifestyle, what I considered a painter to be, I found really attractive when I was young. The solitary aspect of it. But I failed at arts school, so that was that ... I'm glad I'm not a painter now.
He also began using heroin around the time that he left art school.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.enjoy-your-style.com/nick-cave.html | title=Nick Cave, Style Icon | publisher=enjoy-your-style.com | accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl] On 28 March 2008, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws from this university.

==Music career==

===Early years and The Birthday Party (1973–83)===

In 1973, Cave met Mick Harvey (guitar), Phill Calvert (drums), John Cochivera (guitar), Brett Purcell (bass), and Chris Coyne (saxophone); fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. They founded a band with Cave as singer. Their repertoire consisted of proto-punk cover versions of songs by Lou Reed, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and Alex Harvey, among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave's friend Tracy Pew on bass. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name The Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original material. Guitarist and songwriter Rowland S. Howard joined the band in 1978, expanding to five members.
From 1977 until their dissolution in 1983 (by which time they were known as The Birthday Party) the band explored various styles. They were a leader of Melbourne's post-punk scene in the late 1970s, playing hundreds of live shows in Australia before changing their name to The Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, then West Berlin. Cave's Australian girlfriend and muse Anita Lane accompanied them to London. The band were notorious for their provocative live performances which featured Cave shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar feedback. Cave utilised old testament imagery with lyrics about sin, curses and damnation. The lyrics were full of "American gothic imagery", talking about horror stories. Cave grew to detest the "gothic" label; their single "Release the Bats" (1981), described by Harvey as a "comedic interlude", was intended as a sardonic parody of the scene, however it became highly influential in the genre and "a mantra for Goths everywhere".Hanson, Amy. Kicking Against the Pricks: An Armchair Guide to Nick Cave. Helter Skelter Publishing, 2005. ISBN 1-900924-96-X, p. 32 At that time, Cave also became a regular member of a gothic club in London called The Batcave.[tpl]cite web |author=Lowey, Nick |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04921-alien-sex-fiend-interview |title=In The Batcave With Mr & Mrs Fiend: Alien Sex Fiend On Goth & Marriage |work=TheQuietus |date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]
After establishing a cult following in Europe and Australia, The Birthday Party disbanded in 1984. Howard and Cave found it difficult to continue working together and both were rather worn down from alcohol and drug use.

===Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (1984–present)===

The band with Cave as their leader and frontman has released fifteen studio albums. Pitchfork Media calls the group one of rock's "most enduring, redoubtable" bands, with an accomplished discography.Stuart Berman, Pitchfork Media, "Album reviews: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds: From Her to Eternity / The First Born is Dead / Kicking Against the Pricks / Your Funeral ... My Trial, 6 May 2009. Retrieved 30 September 2009. Though their sound tends to change considerably from one album to another, the one constant of the band is an unpolished blending of disparate genres, and song structures which provide a vehicle for Cave's virtuosic, frequently histrionic theatrics. Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey wrote: "With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre, sometimes self-consciously eclectic hybrid of blues, gospel, rock, and arty post-punk."
Reviewing 2008's Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! album, NME used the sentence "gothic psycho-sexual apocalypse" to describe the "menace" present in the lyrics of the title track.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds/9484 |title= Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds Dig!!!

In mid-August 2013, Cave was a 'First Longlist' finalist for the 9th Coopers AMP, alongside artists such as Kevin Mitchell and The Drones.

In September 2013 interview, Cave explained that he returned to using a typewriter for songwriting after his experience with the Nocturama album, as he "could walk in on a bad day and hit 'delete' and that was the end of it". Cave believes that he lost valuable work due to a "bad day".

===Solo work===

In addition to his performances with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Cave has, since the 1990s, performed live 'solo' tours with himself on piano/vocals, Warren Ellis on violin/accordion and various others on bass and drums.

===Grinderman===

In 2006 Cave formed Grinderman - himself on vocals, guitar, organ & piano, Warren Ellis (tenor guitar, electric mandolin, violin, viola, guitar, backing vocals), Martyn P. Casey (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Jim Sclavunos (drums, percussion, backing vocals).
The alternative rock outfit was formed as "a way to escape the weight of The Bad Seeds."[tpl]cite journal|last1=Cave|first1=Nick|year=2010|title=And Now It's Cave's Other Deranged Blues Band!|journal=Uncut|issue=September 2010|page=55|accessdate=21 December 2010[/tpl] The band's name was inspired by a Memphis Slim song, "Grinder Man Blues," which Cave is noted to have started singing during one of the band's early rehearsal sessions. The band's eponymous debut studio album, Grinderman, was released in 2007 to extremely positive reviews and the band's second and final studio album, Grinderman 2, was released in 2010 to a similar reception.
Grinderman's first public performance was at All Tomorrow's Parties in April 2007 where Bobby Gillespie from Primal Scream accompanied Grinderman on backing vocals and percussion.
In December 2011, after performing at Meredith Music Festival, Cave announced that Grinderman were over.[tpl]cite web|title=Nick Cave announces that Grinderman are "over" - News | thevine.com.au|url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/news/nick-cave-announces-that-grinderman-was-%27over%2720111211.aspx|work=The Vine|author=Marcus|date=11 December 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Collaborations===

Nick Cave has also played with Shane MacGowan, in a cover version of Bob Dylan's "Death is Not the End", and Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World". Cave has also performed "What a Wonderful World" live with The Flaming Lips. Cave recorded a cover version of the Pogues song "Rainy Night in Soho", written by MacGowan.

On the Deluxe Edition of Pulp's Different Class another take of this cover can be found.
In 2000, one of Cave's heroes, Johnny Cash, covered Cave's "The Mercy Seat" on the album American III: Solitary Man, seemingly repaying Cave for the compliment he paid by covering Cash's "The Singer" (originally "The Folk Singer") on his Kicking Against the Pricks album. Cave was then invited to be one of many rock and country artists to contribute to the liner notes of the retrospective The Essential Johnny Cash CD, released to coincide with Cash's 70th birthday. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" for Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around album (2002). A similar duet, the American folk song "Cindy", was released posthumously on the "Johnny Cash: Unearthed" boxset. Cave's song "Let the Bells Ring" is a posthumous tribute to Cash.

Cave collaborated with the band Current 93 on their album All the Pretty Little Horses, where he sings the title track, a lullaby. For his 1996 album Murder Ballads, Cave recorded "Where the Wild Roses Grow" with Kylie Minogue, and "Henry Lee" with PJ Harvey.
Cave also took part in the "X-Files" compilation CD with some other artists, where he reads parts from the Bible combined with own texts, like "Time Jesum ...", he outed himself as a fan of the series some years ago, but since he does not watch much TV, it was one of the only things he watched. He collaborated on the 2003 single "Bring It On", with Chris Bailey, formerly of the Australian punk group, The Saints. Cave contributed vocals to the song "Sweet Rosyanne", on the 2006 album Catch That Train! from Dan Zanes & Friends, a children's music group.

==Writing==

Cave released his first book, King Ink, in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with Lydia Lunch.

While he was based in West Berlin, Cave started working on what was to become his debut novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989). Significant crossover is evident between the themes in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. "Swampland", from Mutiny, in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings ('mah' for 'my', for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted like an animal, approaching death and execution).

==Screenwriting==

Cave wrote the screenplay for The Proposition, a film set in the colonial Australian Outback. Directed by John Hillcoat and filmed in Queensland in 2004, it premiered in October 2005 and was later released worldwide to critical acclaim.Brett McCracken, Film Review of The Proposition, Relevant Magazine. Retrieved 25 November 2008. Cave explained his personal background in relation to writing the film's screenplay in a 2013 interview:
 
 I had written long-form before but it is pure story-telling in script writing and that goes back as far as I can remember for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say "tell me a story" so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.
The movie reviewer for British newspaper The Independent called The Proposition "peerless," "a star-studded and uncompromisingly violent outlaw film."Will Self, "The Proposition: Bringing the revisionist Western to the Australian outback," The Independent. Retrieved 25 November 2008. It even features on a website promoting tourism to the area."Australian Outback Movies," on Outback Australia Travel Guide. Retrieved 25 November 2008.

Their most notable collaborations include Lane's 'cameo' verse on Cave's Bob Dylan cover "Death Is Not The End" from the album Murder Ballads, and a cover of the Serge Gainsbourg/Jane Birkin song "Je t'aime, moi non plus/ I love you, nor do I". Lane co-wrote the lyrics to the title track for Cave's 1984 LP, From Her to Eternity, as well as the lyrics of the song "Stranger Than Kindness" from Your Funeral, My Trial. Cave, Lydia Lunch and Lane wrote a comic book together, entitled AS-FIX-E-8, in the style of the old "Pussy Galore"/Russ Meyer movies.

In the past, Cave identified as a Christian. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, he has claimed that any true love song is a song for God and has ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old to the New Testaments. He does not belong to a particular denomination and has distanced himself from "religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked".[tpl]cite web|last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2004/11/18/cave/index.html |title=The Resurrection of Nick Cave: The most talented romantic Christian poet rocker in the world talks to Salon about his new record and his return to songwriting form. Interview in Salon Magazine, 18 November 2004 |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=18 November 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl] He said in a Los Angeles Times article: "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part of what I do, that there is some divine element going on within my songs."[tpl]Cite news|author=John Payne |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Nick Cave's master plan |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-nick-cave-20101129,0,4557691.story |accessdate=29 November 2010 |date=29 November 2010[/tpl] When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was: "No".[tpl]cite web| quote=Do I personally believe in a personal God?

In 2009, Cave joked about plans to erect a gold statue of himself in his hometown of Warracknabeal, based on a foot-high scale model, which, according to Cave, features him "naked on a rearing horse. I have a modest loincloth on. It's this rather wonderful homoerotic work of art"."Nick Cave delays plans to erect gold statue of himself" (1 October 2009), NME. Retrieved 2 March 2013. Yarriambiack Council acknowledged the humour and tourist appeal behind Cave's proposal, daring him to "build a 50m-high Nick Cave with a viewing platform."Brown, Terry (24 June 2008).

In a mid-September 2013 conference keynote Q&A session, Cave explained: "I am Nick Cave and there is no going back to what I was. And on some level, I see that as being successful in my job and on the other hand sometimes it's fucking exhausting."
A film about the life of Nick Cave entitled 20,000 Days on Earth and directed by artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard is due for cinematic release in 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/27/day-in-the-life-nick-cave?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Interview: A Day in the Life of Nick Cave |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl]
