The Chinantec or Chinantecan languages constitute a branch of the Oto-Manguean family. Though traditionally considered a single language, Ethnologue lists 14 partially mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinantec.Enrique L. Palancar. Revisiting the complexity of the Chinantecan verb conjugation classes. Forthcoming in Jean-Léo Léonard and Alain Kihm (eds.), Issues in Meso-American morphology. Paris: Michel Houdiard http://www.surrey.ac.uk/englishandlanguages/research/smg/files/Revisiting_the_complexity_of_Chinantec.pdf The languages are spoken by the indigenous Chinantec people that live in Oaxaca and Veracruz, Mexico, especially in the districts of Cuicatlán, Ixtlán de Juárez, Tuxtepec and Choapan, and in Staten Island, New York.

==Languages==

Egland & Bartholomew (1978)*Egland, S. and Bartholomew, D.. 1978. La inteligibilidad inter-dialectal en Mexico: Resultados de algunos sondeos. Mexico, D.F.: Instituto Linguistico de Verano established fourteen Chinantec languages on the basis of 80% mutual intelligibility. Ethnologue found that one that had not been adequately compared (Tlaltepusco) was not distinct, but split another (Lalana from Tepinapa). At a looser criterion of 70% intelligibility, Lalana–Tepinapa, Quiotepec–Comaltepec, Palantla–Valle Nacional, and geographically distant Chiltepec–Tlacoatzintepec would be languages, reducing the count to ten. Leolao (Latani) is the most divergent.

==Segmental phonology==

A typical Chinantecan phoneme inventory distinguishes 7 vowels /i, e, a, u, o, ɨ, ø/ and consonants /p f b m θ d t ts s r l n k ŋ ʔ h/. Vowels can be nasalized, except usually /u/ and /ø/.

==Tone==

Chinantec is a tonal language and some dialects (Usila Chinantec) have five register tones, an uncommon trait in the world's languages. Whistled language is common. In the practical orthographies for Chinantec, tones are marked with superscript numbers after each syllable.
Chinantec also has ballistic syllables, apparently a kind of phonation.Merrifield, William and Calvin R. Rensch. 1990. Syllables, Tone, and Verb Paradigms, in Chinantec Languages 4.
