==Model==

In 1903, French physical chemist Victor Henri found that enzyme reactions were initiated by a bond (more generally, a binding interaction) between the enzyme and the substrate. His work was taken up by German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten, who investigated the kinetics of an enzymatic reaction mechanism, invertase, that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. In 1913, they proposed a mathematical model of the reaction. It involves an enzyme E binding to a substrate S to form a complex ES, which in turn is converted into a product P and the enzyme. This may be represented schematically as
Under certain assumptions – such as the enzyme concentration being much less than the substrate concentration – the rate of product formation is given by
The model is used in a variety of biochemical situations other than enzyme-substrate interaction, including antigen-antibody binding, DNA-DNA hybridization, and protein-protein interaction. It can be used to characterise a generic biochemical reaction, in the same way that the Langmuir equation can be used to model generic adsorption of biomolecular species. When an empirical equation of this form is applied to microbial growth, it is sometimes called a Monod equation.

==Applications==

Parameter values vary wildly between enzymes:
Michaelis–Menten kinetics have also been applied to a variety of spheres outside of biochemical reactions, including alveolar clearance of dusts, the richness of species pools, clearance of blood alcohol, the photosynthesis-irradiance relationship, and bacterial phage infection.

===Assumptions and limitations===

The first step in the derivation applies the law of mass action, which is reliant on free diffusion. However, in the environment of a living cell where there is a high concentration of proteins, the cytoplasm often behaves more like a gel than a liquid, limiting molecular movements and altering reaction rates. Whilst the law of mass action can be valid in heterogeneous environments, it is more appropriate to model the cytoplasm as a fractal, in order to capture its limited-mobility kinetics.
By contrast, the Briggs–Haldane quasi-steady-state analysis is valid if 
It is also important to remember that, while irreversibility is a necessary simplification in order to yield a tractable analytic solution, in the general case product formation is not in fact irreversible.  The enzyme reaction is more correctly described as
In general, the assumption of irreversibility is a good one in situations where one of the below is true: 
1. The concentration of substrate(s) is very much larger than the concentration of products:
This is true under standard in vitro assay conditions, and is true for many in vivo biological reactions, particularly where the product is continually removed by a subsequent reaction. 
2. The energy released in the reaction is very large, that is
In situations where neither of these two conditions hold (that is, the reaction is low energy and a substantial pool of product(s) exists), the Michaelis–Menten equation breaks down, and more complex modelling approaches explicitly taking the forward and reverse reactions into account must be taken to understand the enzyme biology.

==Determination of constants==

Before computing facilities to perform nonlinear regression became available, graphical methods involving linearisation of the equation were used. A number of these were proposed, including the Eadie–Hofstee diagram, Hanes–Woolf plot and Lineweaver–Burk plot; of these, the Hanes–Woolf plot is the most accurate. However, while useful for visualization, all three methods distort the error structure of the data and are inferior to nonlinear regression. Nonetheless, their use can still be found in modern literature.
In 1997 Santiago Schnell and Claudio Mendoza derived a closed form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of the Michaelis–Menten kinetics.Schnell S, Mendoza C. A closed form solution for time-dependent enzyme kinetics. Journal of theoretical Biology, 187 (1997): 207-212 DOI The solution, known as the Schnell-Mendoza equation, has the form:
where W is the Lambert-W function and where F(t) is
The equation below, obtained by Berberan-Santos in 2010 (MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 63, 283), encompasses the Schnell-Mendoza equation, and is still valid when the initial substrate concentration is close to that of enzyme,
where W is again the Lambert-W function.
