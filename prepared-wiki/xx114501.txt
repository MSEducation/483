Buckfastleigh railway station is situated on the South Devon Railway, a heritage railway in Devon, England. It serves the town of Buckfastleigh.

==History==

The station was opened by the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway on 1 May 1872. The railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1897 and this in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948.
The station closed to passengers in November 1958 although goods traffic on the line continued until 7 September 1962.
It was re-opened as the Dart Valley Railway, a heritage railway, on 5 April 1969. The South Devon Railway Trust took over the running of the line on 1 January 1991.
In 1971 Buckfastleigh became the terminus of the line when the route beyond the station was closed to allow improvements to the A38 road. Workshops have since been provided for restoring and repairing the locomotives and rolling stock used on the railway.
The goods shed has been converted to a railway museum and this is the home of Tiny the last remaining broad gauge locomotive.

==Services==

The station is served by trains on all operating days of the South Devon Railway. Trains operate daily from late March to the end of October. On most days a single train set operates, providing four journeys a day in each direction. On busy days two train sets may operate, providing more journeys.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.southdevonrailway.co.uk/timetable| title = Timetables| publisher = South Devon Railway Trust | accessdate = 18 January 2011 [/tpl]
