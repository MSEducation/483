Lake Maggiore ([tpl]lang-it|Lago Maggiore[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-it|ˈlaːɡo madˈdʒoːre|pron[/tpl] lit. 'Greater Lake') or Lago Verbano ([tpl]IPA-it|verˈbaːno|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|Lacus Verbanus[/tpl]) is a large lake located on the south side of the Alps. It is the second largest lake in Italy in the Lombardy region and largest lake of the canton of Ticino, Switzerland. Lake Maggiore is the most westerly of the three great prealpine lakes of Italy, it extends for about [tpl]convert|70|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] between Locarno and Arona.
The climate is mild in both summer and winter, producing Mediterranean vegetation, with beautiful gardens growing rare and exotic plants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Well-known gardens include those of the Isola Madre, Isola Bella and the Isole di Brissago, that of the Villa Taranto in Verbania, and the Alpinia botanical garden above Stresa.

==Geography==

Lake Maggiore is [tpl]convert|68|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] long, and [tpl]convert|3|to|5|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] wide, except at the bay opening westward between Pallanza and Stresa, where it is [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. It is the longest Italian lake, but Lake Garda has  a greater area. Its mean height above the sea level is 193 metres; a deep lake, its bottom is almost everywhere below sea-level: at its deepest, 179 metres below. Its form is very sinuous, so that there are few points from which any considerable part of its surface can be seen at a single glance. If this lessens the effect of the apparent size, it increases the variety of its scenery. While the upper end is completely alpine in character, the middle region lies between hills of gentler form, and the lower end advances to the verge of the plain of Lombardy.this paragraph is taken largely verbatim from John Ball, The Alpine Guide, Central Alps, 1856, p. 306
The lake basin has tectonic-glacial origins and its volume is [tpl]convert|37|km³|0|abbr=out[/tpl]. The lake has a surface area of about [tpl]convert|213|km2|0|abbr=out[/tpl], a maximum length of [tpl]convert|54|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and, at its widest, is [tpl]convert|12|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its main tributaries are the Ticino, the Maggia, the Toce (by which it receives the outflow of Lake Orta) and the Tresa (which is the sole emissary of Lake Lugano). The rivers Verzasca, Giona, and Cannobino also flow into the lake. Its outlet is the Ticino which, in turn, joins the river Po just south-east of Pavia.
The lake’s jagged banks are surrounded by the Lepontine Alps. The western bank is in Piedmont (provinces of Novara and Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola) and the eastern in Lombardy (province of Varese), whereas the most northerly section extends thirteen kilometres ([tpl]convert|13|km|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) into the canton of Ticino, where it constitutes its lowest point above sea-level as well as that of Switzerland.

===Climate===

Lake Maggiore weather is generally mild. It is known for its Mediterranean-like climate where sub-tropical plants can grow year-round.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] During winter, the lake helps to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding region (since water releases heat energy more slowly than air). The temperatures are cooled down in summer by the breezes that blow on the water's surface changing its colour. The area enjoys nearly 2300 hours of sunshine a year and an average annual temperature of [tpl]convert|15.5|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The water of the lake has a comfortable temperature of [tpl]convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in July and August. In winter snowfall is erratic and primarily affects the higher elevations. Rainfall is heaviest in May and lowest during the winter months.The history of Lake Maggiore lagomaggioreonline.it.

==Historical events==

Methane was first discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta as he analysed marsh gas from Lake Maggiore, between 1776 and 1778.
In 1936, a Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster, built 1925, was sunk in the lake by employees of Zürich architect Marco Schmucklerski, when Swiss custom officials investigated whether he had paid taxes on the car. The Bugatti was attached to an iron chain making it possible to recover it once the investigation was over, yet that never happened. When the chain corroded, the car sunk to the lake bed, where it was rediscovered on 18 August 1967 by local diver Ugo Pillon and became a favourite target for divers thereafter. When one of the divers, Damiano Tamagni, was killed in a hold-up on 1 February 2008, his friends from the Ascona divers' club decided to lift and sell the carwreck to raise funds for a yet to be created foundation named after the victim. The remains of the Bugatti were recovered on 12 July 2009. The sale took place at the Retro Mobile classic car exhibition in Paris on 23 January 2010. It was sold for 260,500 euros.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/121/article_6637.asp |title=RFI - 260,500 euros for rusty old car found at bottom of lake |publisher=Rfi.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]
