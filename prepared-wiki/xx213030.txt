Sharsheret ([tpl]lang-he-n|שַׁרְשֶׁרֶת[/tpl], lit. Chain) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and covering 6,000 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 290.
The village was established in 1951 with the help of the Jewish Agency for Israel by Bnei Akiva members who were immigrants from Tunisia . Its name is a combination of two words, Sar (lit. Minister, written with a Shin, and therefore also pronounceable as "Shar") and Sharett (referring to Moshe Sharett, who was Foreign Minister at the time the moshav was founded).
