CATEGORIES: Lakes of Kenya, Lakes of Tanzania, Pangani basin

Lake Jipe is an inter-territorial lake straddling the borders of Tanzania and Kenya. On the Tanzanian side, it is situated within Mwanga District, in Kilimanjaro Region while on the Kenyan side, it is located south of the village of Nghonji. The lake is fed mainly by the Lumi River, which descends from Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as streams from the North Pare Mountains, being on the leeward side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/outreach_actionplan_tanzania_jipe.pdf|title=Lake Jipe Awareness Raising Strategy (2005 – 2007)|last=Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Wildlife Division, The United Republic of Tanzania|date=May 2004|work=ramsar.org|page=6|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] The lake's outlet forms the Ruvu River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:2e4psS151TYJ:www.oceandocs.net/bitstream/1834/1492/1/WLCK-162-168.pdf+River+lumi+ruvu&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgCGQtRHRbyTd58huVgdd5XfMmglS-meICCJrH1eEEzeT_fg6Dx1lNf25JT-Xw0f6dHs7KAwj7ZurnbdW4ADAuyUe7pf3Bap24mMCSmVTRKzR8oCCC64gtfIwyw1zHcbrAx5Uwf&sig=AHIEtbT3U9ffbAfvC3C9Gw-2R2MPV772NA|title=The role of wetlands in lake ecological functions and sustainable livelihoods in lake environment: A case study on cross border Lake Jipe - Kenya/Tanzania|last=Ndetei|first=Robert |publisher=Kenya Wildlife Service|pages=163|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] Kenya's unfenced Tsavo West National Park protects part of the lake's northern shore, while on the Tanzania side Mkomazi Game Reserve is nearby.[tpl]cite book|last=Briggs|first=Philip|title=Bradt Tanzania: With Zanzibar,m Pemba & Mafia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SvZq4-BgBskC&pg=PA227|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=1 August 2006|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-153-1|pages=227–[/tpl] The lake is known for its endemic fish, as well as water birds, mammals, wetland plants and lake-edge swamps, which can extend [tpl]convert|2|km[/tpl] from Jipe's shore.[tpl]cite book|last=Maltby|first=Edward|title=The wetlands handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-K5TCHfEEtMC&pg=PA854|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-632-05255-4|pages=854–[/tpl]

==Geography==

The lake is accessible via the B1 Highway from the village of Kifaru, about [tpl]convert|40|km[/tpl] south of the Tanzanian town of Moshi.[tpl]cite book|last=Briggs|first=Philip|title=Northern Tanzania, 2nd: The Bradt Safari Guide with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DDf1ZMyQCIAC&pg=PA141|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=1 August 2009|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-292-7|pages=141–[/tpl] Jipe covers an area of roughly [tpl]convert|30|km2[/tpl], and measures approximately [tpl]convert|12|mi[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|3|-|4|mi[/tpl] broad. Jipe is a shallow backwater of the Lumi river, which afterwards becomes the Ruvu River, and enters in the Nyumba ya Mungu Reservoir. After joining there with the Kikuletwa the stream flows as Pangani River in the Indian Ocean at Pangani. The lake lacks a current as the river that flows in, turns round and flows out again. Its water is only drinkable after it has been well boiled and skimmed. On its southern bank, the mountains of Ugweno rise [tpl]convert|6000|-|7000|ft[/tpl], contrasting markedly with the opposite shore, which is a flat plain, but little raised above the lake.[tpl]cite book|first=Harry Hamilton |last=Johnston, Sir|title=The Kilima-Njaro expedition: A record of scientific exploration in eastern equatorial Africa.

==Demographics==

Some 120,000 people depend on the lake for their livelihood. The inhabitants of villages surrounding Lake Jipe are mainly involved in fishing, agriculture and animal husbandry. To the south-east of the great mountain is the little agricultural colony of Taveita. Ki-taveita is the language used by the Bantu half of the population, and Maasai is the language of the remainder. Ki-gweno is the dialect of the Ugweno mountains (Ugono) to the south of Lake Jipe. Lake water is used for irrigation of the surrounding farmlands.[tpl]Cite web|title=Taita Taveta District profile|publisher=Ministry of State for Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands|url=http://www.aridland.go.ke/semi_profiles/taita_taveta_profile.pdf[/tpl]

==Fauna==

The probability of long-time isolation from other wetlands is suggested by a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia.[tpl]cite book|last=Briggs|first=Philip|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Kenya|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=epbpZJoiEAUC&pg=PA189|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=1 September 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-8445-7|pages=189–[/tpl] Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluroids and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser Jacana and the Purple Gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare in other parts of Africa and Madagascar Squacco Heron, Black Heron, African Darter and African Skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is  frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.
