===Business ventures===

Gretzky has owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for $175,000 CA.[tpl]cite news |work=The Montreal Gazette |date=March 8, 1985 |title=Gretzky buys Hull juniors|page = C9[/tpl] During his ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena.[tpl]cite news |title=Gretzky brings Kings to Hull |last=Morrissey |first=Bob |work=Montreal Gazette |date=September 12, 1989 |page=F1[/tpl] Gretzky eventually sold the team in 1992 for $550,000 CA.[tpl]cite news|title=Junior Hockey; Gretzky sells his team; There will be at least another three Olympiques years in Hull; Senators want to train in Hull, but Henry not big on idea|page= E3 |date=May 15, 1992 |last=Warren |first=Ken |last2=Mayoh |first2=Rick |work=Ottawa Citizen[/tpl]
In 1991, Gretzky purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League with Bruce McNall and John Candy. The club won the Grey Cup championship in the first year of the partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the CFL corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names. In 1992, Gretzky and McNall partnered in an investment to buy a rare Honus Wagner T206 cigarette card for $451,000 US, later selling the card. It most recently sold for $2.8 million US.[ref]
