[[Raspeball]]

CATEGORIES: Norwegian cuisine, Dumplings, Potato dishes

Raspeball, also known in some areas as klubb, kumle, komle or kompe, is a potato dumpling, a traditional Norwegian or German dish. It consists of grated potatoes, where typically half is pre-cooked and half is raw, salt and varying kinds of flour (though often, barley is used). There are a great variety of regional variations to the dish, and in many areas the raspeball is filled with bits of salted lamb or pork.
The dish is more common in the southern (Sørlandet, where "kompe" is the most common name), western (Vestlandet, where "raspeball" and "komle" is the most used) and middle (Trøndelag, where it is nearly always called "klubb") parts of Norway than elsewhere. In Vestlandet, this dish is traditionally consumed on Thursdays, when it often makes an appearance as "Dish of the day" at cafes and restaurants specializing in local cuisine.
The condiments vary greatly throughout the Norwegian regions. They may include salted and boiled pork or lamb meat, bacon, sausages, melted butter, bacon fat, lard, mashed or cooked rutabaga, sour cream, sugar, syrup, cured meat, brown cheese sauce and, even, boiled potatoes. A variety of raspeballer is the fiskeball, where minced fish, fresh or salted, is added to the potato dough.
The raspeball is quite closely related to the Lithuanian cepelinai, the Acadian poutine râpée and the potato dumplings known as Klöße in Austria and Germany.
