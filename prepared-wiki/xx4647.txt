Impressionism in music is a vague term that is sometimes applied to various composers in Western classical music, mainly during the late 19th century and continuing into the beginning of the 20th century, whose music focuses on suggestion and atmosphere.[tpl]cn|date=May 2013[/tpl]
French critic Stéphane Mallarmé states that naming an object takes away three fourths of its power, "to suggest is to dream".[tpl]cite book|last=Kamien|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Kamien|title=Music: An Appreciation|publisher=McGraw-Hill|place=New York|year=1976|isbn=0070332665[/tpl][tpl]Pn|date=February 2013[/tpl] Claude Debussy found inspiration in Javanese music (especially gamelan)[tpl]Cn|date=June 2013[/tpl]. Debussy later wrote to a friend, "Do you not remember the Javanese music, able to express every shade of meaning, … which makes our tonic and dominant seem like ghosts?"Roger Kamien, Music: An Appreciation, eighth edition (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004): 412.
