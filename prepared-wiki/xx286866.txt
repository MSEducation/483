The police jury, the parish governing body, is now known as the Caddo Parish Commission.Veta Samuels, History of Caddo Parish Police Jury - Caddo parish Commission (government document) In 1966, Aulds was a candidate for the Louisiana State Board of Education for the seat representing the 4th congressional district. He vowed if elected to work to expand vocational education and higher education opportunities in the district. He lost to fellow Democrat and incumbent board member Robert H. Curry of Shreveport. That board was reorganized under the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 into the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. Another candidate in the race, Cecil K. Carter, Jr.,Minden Press-Herald, August 15, 1966, p. 1 was later elected to a term in the Louisiana State Senate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/members/s1880-2008.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana State Senate, 1880-2008|publisher=legis.state.la.us|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl]
In 1967, as a police juror and with extensive experience in real estate, he was a member of the site selection committee for the Northwest Louisiana School for the Mentally Retarded. The seven-member committee was headed by then State Representative and later U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. Other members of the panel included Representative Frank Fulco, later Representative P. J. Mills, and Edgar Hull, dean of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport."Nearby sites for retarded school sought", Shreveport Times, August 21, 1967 The completed facility is now known as the Northwest Louisiana Developmental Center, located at 5401 Shed Road in Bossier City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://la-bossier-city.doctors.at/dr/northwest-louisiana-developmental-center#sthash.UWXfQBMt.dpuf|title=Northweswt Louisiana Developmental Center|publisher=la-bossier-city.doctors.at|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]
Aulds left the police jury to run successfully for the state House of Representatives in the 1967-1968 election cycle, when Democrats swept the Caddo Parish offices. His colleagues included the Shreveport businessman Dayton Waller as well as the long-term members Algie D. Brown and Frank Fulco. Early in his first session of the legislature the freshman Aulds was named to replacd veteran Representative Fulco on the House Budget Committee at the request of Governor John McKeithen. The matter sparked discord in the Caddo Parish delegation, but McKeithen tried to smooth over the hard feelings with self-deprecating humor in an engagement in Shreveport in mid-February 1969.Charlotte Burrows, "McKeithen leaves them 'em Laughing, Gasping", Shreveport Times, February 18, 1969
