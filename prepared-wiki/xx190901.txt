The Army of the Midi (Armée du Midi) was a unit of the French army, stationed in the Midi region and  created by royal decree of Louis XVI on 13 April 1792.  It existed under this name for less than five months, and was split by a decree of the National Convention dated 1 October 1792 into the Armée des Alpes and the Armée des Pyrénées.  Another Armée du Midi was later gathered by Napoleon for the Peninsular War.
