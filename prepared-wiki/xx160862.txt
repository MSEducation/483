Ninesprings is a country park situated in the South East of Yeovil, Somerset, the United Kingdom. It is the largest country park in South Somerset, spanning over [tpl]convert|20|acre|ha|1[/tpl].
The site lies on Yeovil Sands (a yellow micaceous sand) of the Upper Lias, in the Lower Jurassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, formed some 160 million years ago and includes several springs supllying small streams and ponds. It is believed to have been developed as an ornamental park, for the Aldon Estate, in the early nineteenth century and now forms a broad-leaved woodland with coniferous trees forming less than 10% of the total.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ninesprings.net/floraandfauna.htm|title=Flora and Fauna|publisher=Ninesprings - Yeovil Country Park|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl] The nationally rare Water Vole has been seen amongst the swans and other fauna at the site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=10614|title=Protecting wildlife at Yeovil Country Park|publisher=South Somerset Council|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]

It follows the track bed of the former Great Western Railway route between Pen Mill and Yeovil Town railway station Notable landmarks along this path are Goldenstones leisure centre, the Ninesprings playground, the ski lodge, and Bowlplex/Cineworld.
Hills viewable from this walk include Tilly's Hill, Summerhouse Hill and Wyndham Hill.
