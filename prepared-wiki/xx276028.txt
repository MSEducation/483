[[Masalai]]

CATEGORIES: Papua New Guinean culture

Masalai are a type of spirit in Papua New Guinea. Margaret Mead defined them as: "supernatural beings that inhabit
specific  places,  usually  distinguished by some special natural feature (a water hole, waterfall, bend in a river, cliff, marsh, etc.), and that  exercise limited jurisdiction over their own  area; they  may manifest themselves as snakes, crocodiles and other creatures, often  with  bizarre features, such as strange coloring, two  heads, etc. Masalai may be associated with descent lines, moieties, hamlets, villages."
