"The kitchen is unassailable on any level and Feenie is a serious chef whose passion for cooking comes through in every dish." 
"Rare is the chef who combines raw talent, commitment to excellence, and heartfelt generosity - the requisites for operating a world class restaurant. Rob Feenie epitomizes that rarity and Vancouver is the richer for it." 
"Lumiere is quite possibly the finest restaurant in all of Canada."
