Geelong was named in 1827, with the name derived from the local Wathaurong Aboriginal name for the region, Jillong, thought to mean "land" or "cliffs". The area was first surveyed in 1838, three weeks after Melbourne. The Post Office was open by June 1840 (the second to open in the Port Phillip District).[ref]

The first woolstore was erected in this period and it became the port for the wool industry of the Western District. During the gold rush Geelong experienced a brief boom as the main port to the rich goldfields of the Ballarat district.[ref]Norman Houghton - 
[/ref] The city then diversified into manufacturing and during the 1860s it became one of the largest manufacturing centres in Australia with its wool mills, ropeworks, and paper mills.
It was proclaimed a city in 1910, with industrial growth from this time until the 1960s establishing the city as a manufacturing centre for the state, and saw the population grow to over 100,000 by the mid-1960s.[ref]
</ref> Population increases over the last decade were due to growth in service industries,<ref name="cogg-top10">

It is known for being home to car manufacturer Ford Australia and also the Geelong Football Club, known as The Cats.[tpl]cite web|title=Ford Siding|url=http://www.railgeelong.com/locations.php?name=Ford%20Siding|work=Rail Geelong|publisher=Marcus Wong|accessdate=6 October 2012|year=2005–2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history and foundation===

The area of Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula was originally occupied by the Wathaurong Indigenous Australian tribe.
The first non-Indigenous person recorded as visiting the region was Lt. John Murray, who commanded the brig [tpl]HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6[/tpl]. After anchoring outside Port Phillip Heads (the narrow entrance to Port Phillip, onto which both Geelong and Melbourne now front) on 1 February 1802 he sent a small boat with six men to explore.[ref]
