Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their countries because he was concerned that the Rwandan officers running his army were plotting a coup in order to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new Tutsi led rebel military movement called the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie (RCD) to fight against Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in  1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian militaries entered on the side of the government.
Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and was succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila, who called for multilateral peace talks. UN peacekeepers, MONUC, now known as MONUSCO, arrived in April 2001. Talks led to the signing of a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. A transitional government was set up until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters, and on 30 July 2006 DRC held its first multi-party elections. An election result dispute between Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba turned into an all-out battle between their supporters in the streets of Kinshasa. MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held in October 2006, which Kabila won and on December 2006 he was sworn in as President.
However, Laurent Nkunda, a member of a RCD branch integrated to the army, RCD-Goma, defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), which began an armed rebellion against the government, starting the Kivu conflict. They were believed to be again backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the Hutu group, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government, in which it agreed to become a political party and its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-U_1NZdVdXyssb9DPt47IHx7j7Q|title=DR Congo government, CNDP rebels 'sign peace deal'|date=23 March 2012|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|accessdate=18 November 2012|archivedate=18 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CKVBitcD|deadurl=no[/tpl] In 2012, the leader of the CNDP, Bosco Ntaganda, and troops loyal to him, mutinied and formed the rebel military March 23 Movement, claiming a violation of the treaty by the government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201204040870.html|title=Congo-Kinshasa: General Ntaganda and Loyalists Desert Armed Forces|first=Melanie|last=Gouby|date=4 April 2012|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=18 November 2012|archivedate=18 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CKVC5lJo|deadurl=no[/tpl] In the resulting M23 rebellion, M23 briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20565711|title=Rebels in DR Congo withdraw from Goma|date=1 December 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20405739|title=Goma: M23 rebels capture DR Congo city|date=20 November 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl] Neighboring countries, particularly Rwanda, have been accused of using rebels groups as proxies to gain control of the resource rich country and of arming rebels, a claim they deny.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19973366|title=Rwanda defence chief leads DR Congo rebels, UN report says|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2012-11-21|date=17 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18320288|title=Rwanda military aiding DRC mutiny, report says|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2012-11-21|date=4 June 2012[/tpl] In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council authorized the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade, the first offensive United Nations peacekeeping unit, to neutralize armed groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44876#.UizEW9JJOE0|title=Tanzanian troops arrive in eastern DR Congo as part of UN intervention brigade|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=10 May 2013[/tpl] On November 5, 2013, M23 declared an end to its insurgency.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24816223|title=DR Congo M23 rebels 'end insurgency'|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=5 November 2013|date=5 November 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is located in central sub-Saharan Africa, bounded by (clockwise from the southwest) Angola, the South Atlantic Ocean, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika, and Zambia. The country lies between latitudes 6°N and 14°S, and longitudes 12° and 32°E. It straddles the Equator, with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of Congo, [tpl]convert|2345408|km2|sqmi[/tpl], is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway.
As a result of its equatorial location, the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of [tpl]convert|2000|mm|in|disp=5[/tpl] in some places, and the area sustains the Congo Rainforest, the second largest rain forest in the world (after the Amazon). This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central basin of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north. High, glaciated mountains are found in the extreme eastern region (Rwenzori Mountains). [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The tropical climate has also produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly [tpl]convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The river and its tributaries (major offshoots include the Kasai, Sangha, Ubangi, Aruwimi, and Lulonga) form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation.
The sources of the Congo are in the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the western branch of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru. The river flows generally west from Kisangani just below Boyoma Falls, then gradually bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool (see NASA image). Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), and then running past Boma into the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest watershed of any river in the world (trailing the Amazon in both respects). The river and a 37 km wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country's only outlet to the Atlantic. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The previously mentioned Albertine Rift plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the rift's tectonic activities, this area also experiences volcanic activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the famous African Great Lakes, three of which lie on the Congo's eastern frontier: Lake Albert (known during the Mobutu era as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko), Lake Edward (known during the Amin era as Lake Idi Amin Dada), and Lake Tanganyika. Lake Edward and Lake Albert are connected by the Semliki River. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The Rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. Cobalt, copper, cadmium, industrial and gem-quality diamonds, gold, silver, zinc, manganese, tin, germanium, uranium, radium, bauxite, iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern Katanga region. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
On 17 January 2002 Mount Nyiragongo erupted in Congo, with the lava running out at 64 km/h (40 mph) and 46 m (50 yards) wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of Goma, killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava poisoned the water of Lake Kivu, killing fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, entrapping several airplanes. Six months after the 2002 eruption, nearby Mount Nyamulagira also erupted. Mount Nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
World Wide Fund for Nature ecoregions located in the Congo include:
World Heritage Sites located in Democratic Republic of Congo are:
Virunga National Park (1979),
Garamba National Park (1980),
Kahuzi-Biega National Park (1980),
Salonga National Park (1984) and
Okapi Wildlife Reserve (1996).

===Provinces===

[tpl]Main|Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Districts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo[/tpl][tpl]Further|Administrative divisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo[/tpl]
The country is divided into ten provinces and one city-province. The provinces are subdivided into districts which are divided into territories.

===Flora and fauna===

The rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great biodiversity, including many rare and endemic species, such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, the African forest elephant, mountain gorilla, okapi and white rhino. Five of the country's national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites: the Garumba, Kahuzi-Biega, Salonga and Virunga National Parks, and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html|title=Lambertini, A Naturalist's Guide to the Tropics, excerpt|accessdate=30 June 2008[/tpl]
The civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity. Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work. All five sites are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage in Danger. Over the past century or so, the DRC has developed into the center of what has been called the Central African "bushmeat" problem, which is regarded by many as a major environmental as well as socio-economic crisis. "Bushmeat" is another word for the meat of wild animals. It is typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with shotguns, poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

File:African Forest Elephant.jpg|The African forest elephant

The "bushmeat crisis" has emerged in the DRC mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it. A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions has forced many Congolese to become dependent on bushmeat, either as a means of acquiring income (hunting the meat and selling), or are dependent on it for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of Kinshasa into the prime market for commercial bushmeat. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
This combination has caused not only widespread endangerment of local fauna, but has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's rainforests (from corporate logging, in addition to farmers clearing out forest for agriculture), which allows hunters much easier access to previously unreachable jungle terrain, while simultaneously eroding away at the habitats of animals."The Bushman crisis: long term solutions – international, national and local policies", WWF (2001). Deforestation is accelerating in Central Africa.Adelaja, Abiose Deforestation accelerating in Central Africa, scidev.net, 8 June 2007.
A case that has particularly alarmed conservationists is that of primates. The Congo is inhabited by three distinct great ape species  — the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), the bonobo (Pan paniscus) and the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee and the gorilla, both of whose population once numbered in the millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=556&ArticleID=6033&l=en&t=long|title=Gorillas on Thin Ice|date= 15 January 2009|publisher= United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl] gorillas, 100,000[tpl]cite journal|author=Vigilant, Linda|year=2004|title=Chimpanzees|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=10|pages=R369–R371|doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2004.05.006|pmid=15186757[/tpl] chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 bonobos. Gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos are all classified as Endangered by the World Conservation Union, as well as the okapi, which is also native to the area geography.

==Politics==

===Government===

After a four-year interlude between two constitutions, with new political institutions established at the various levels of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic.
The 2003 transitional constitutionFull text of constitution (in French) had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly. The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a President and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly. The government – not the President – is responsible to the Parliament. The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments, creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the Constitutional Court. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Corruption===

Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the DRC, which he renamed Zaïre, from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: "Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out ten. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine."[tpl]cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Arnold M.|year=2002|title=King of the Mountain: The Nature of Political Leadership|page=72|isbn=0-8131-2233-3[/tpl] Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to an economic collapse in 1996.[tpl]cite book|last=Nafziger|first=E.

===Foreign relations and military===

The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China, India, Russia, Brazil and other developing countries require that developed countries employ new, integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring, on a continual basis, an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs. Highlighting the DR Congo's importance to United States national security, the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the U.S. to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region.

There are economic and strategic incentives to bringing more security to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt. Cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many diverse industrial and military applications. The largest use of cobalt is in superalloys, which are used to make jet engine parts. Cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented carbides. The chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain enamels; decolourisers for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics, paints, and plastics. The country contains 80% of the world's cobalt reserves.[tpl]cite web|author=Vandiver, John|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=69718|title=An April 2009 report to Congress by the National Defense Stockpile Center|publisher=Stripes.com|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl]

===Mining===

The Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt ore,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/cobalt/cobalt_t8.html|title=Cobalt: World Mine Production, By Country|accessdate=30 June 2008[/tpl] and a major producer of copper and diamonds, the latter coming from the Kasai province in the West. By far the largest mines in the Congo are located in the Katanga (formerly Shaba) province in the south, and are highly mechanized, with a maximum capacity of several millions of tons per year of copper and cobalt ore, and with the capability of refining it into metal. In terms of annual carats produced, the DRC is the second largest diamond-producing nation in the world, with artisanal and small-scale miners accounting for most production.
At the time of its independence in 1960, DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa, it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.Province orientale: le diamant et l'or quelle part dans la reconstruction socio – économique de la Province? (in French) @ societecivile.cd, 23 October 2009. The two recent conflicts (the First and Second Congo Wars), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have increased external debt, and have resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war, and associated famine and disease. Malnutrition affects approximately two thirds of the country's population. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The war has intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.
Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of International Monetary Fund and World Bank missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Joseph Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data. A United Nations Human Development Index report shows human development to be one of the worst in decades. Through 2011 the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries, classified lower than Niger despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country from 2010's numbers.

In 2007 Tremalt was owned by Prairie International Ltd, of which Dan Gertler's family trust was a major shareholder. Tremalt owned 80% of Savannah Mining, which held concessions C17 and C18 in Katanga Province and 50% of the Mukondo project. The other 50% of Mukonda was held by Boss Mining, which in turn was 80% owned by Central African Mining & Exploration Company (CAMEC). Boss Mining had rented and operated Bredenkamp's half of Mukondo. Gertler terminated this arrangement.
Katanga Mining Limited, a Swiss-owned company, owns the Luilu Metallurgical Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and 8,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world.

===Transportation===

Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflicts have led to long-term under-investment. 

====Rail====

Rail transportation is provided by the Congo Railroad Company (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo) and the Office National des Transports (Congo) (ONATRA) and the Office of the Uele Railways (Office des Chemins de fer des Ueles, CFU).

====Road====

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa — a total of 2250 km, of which only 1226 km is in good condition (see below). To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500 km (e.g. Matadi to Lubumbushi, 2700 km by road). The figure of 2250 km converts to 35 km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population. Comparative figures for Zambia  and Botswana  are 721 km and 3427 km respectively.The figures are obtained by dividing the population figures in the Wikipedia country articles by the paved roads figure in the 'Transport in country' articles.
Three routes in the Trans-African Highway network pass through DR Congo:

====Water====

The Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of navigable waterways, and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country. 

====Air====

As of April 2014 DR Congo had two major national airlines (CAA and Korongo Airlines) which offered flights inside DR Congo and to a small number of international locations. Korongo Airlines was based in Lumbumbashi and CAA was based in Kinshasa but both airlines operated many of the same flight routes. Several international airlines offer flights to the country's two international airports Kinshasa (Ndjili) International Airport (FIH) and Lubumbashi International Airport. All air carriers certified by the DRC have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission, due to inadequate safety standards.List of airlines banned within the EU, Official EC list, updated 20 April 2011; retrieved 20 September 2011.

===Energy===

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there are both coal and crude oil resources that were mainly used domestically in 2008. The Democratic Republic of Congo has infrastructure for hydro-electricity from the Congo River at the Inga dams.Technical Study preparing lobby-work on energy-resources and conflict prevention». Projet: EED Nr. 20036094 (in German; PDF). suedwind-institut.de; retrieved  27 February 2013.

The educational system in the DRC is similar to that of Belgium. In 2002, there were over 19,000 primary schools serving 160,000 students; and 8,000 secondary schools serving 110,000 students. Primary education in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not free and compulsory, even though the Congolese constitution says it should be (Article 43 of the 2005 Congolese Constitution).[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Constitution de la République démocratique du Congo – Wikisource.

==Demographics==

===Largest cities===

===Ethnic groups===

Over 200 ethnic groups populate the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which the majority are Bantu peoples. Together, Mongo, Luba and Kongo peoples (Bantu) and Mangbetu-Azande peoples constitute around 45% of the population.
In 2009, the United Nations estimated the country's population to be 66 million people,"Democratic Republic of the Congo". UNdata. a rapid increase from 39.1 million in 1992 despite the ongoing war."Zaire – Population". Library of Congress Country Studies. As many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named. The most numerous people are the Kongo, Luba, and Mongo. About 600,000 Pygmies are the aboriginal people of the DR Congo."Pygmies want UN tribunal to address cannibalism." Sydney Morning Herald. 23 May 2003. Although several hundred local languages and dialects are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of French and intermediary languages such as Kongo, Tshiluba, Swahili, and Lingala.

===Migration===

Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region – constituting an important subset of the population in the country. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the International Organization for Migration, the number of immigrants in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Official figures are unavailable on migrant workers, partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=41_42&products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en République Démocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=17 August 2010[/tpl]
Figures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe. The DRC has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to UNHCR, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.
Since 2003, more than 400,000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from Angola.""Calls for Angola to Investigate Abuse of Congolese Migrants", Inter Press Service. 21 May 2012.

===Religion===

Christianity is the majority religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by about 95% of the population according to Pew Research Center, and 80% according to CIA World Factbook.CIA World Factbook: DR Congo Indigenous beliefs accounts for about 1.8-10%, and Islam for 1.5-10%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php|title=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum[/tpl]

===Languages===

French is the official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is meant to be an ethnically neutral language, to ease communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo.
Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country, but only four have the status of national languages: Kikongo (Kituba), Lingala, Tshiluba and Swahili. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages, as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language. Primary education tends to be in the national Bantu language of the region, and secondary education, and beyond, tends to be in French.
Lingala was made the official language of the colonial army, the "Force Publique" under Belgian colonial rule. But since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent. When the country was a Belgian colony, it had already instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. During the colonial period both Dutch and French were the official languages but French was by far the most important. About 24,320,000 people of DRC speak French either as a first or second language. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Culture==

The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country  — from the mouth of the River Congo on the coast, upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism, the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the First and Second Congo Wars. Despite these pressures, the customs and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country's 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural. The 30% who live in urban areas have been the most open to Western influences.
Another notable feature in Congo culture is its sui generis music. The DROC has blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban rumba, and merengue to give birth to soukous. Other African nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous. Some of the African bands sing in Lingala, one of the main languages in the DRC. The same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of "le sapeur", Papa Wemba, has set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designers' clothes', they became to be known as the 4th generation of the Congolese music and they mostly come from the former well known band Wenge Musica. The Congo is also known for its art. Traditional art includes masks and wooden statues.
