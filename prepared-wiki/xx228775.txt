The housefly (also house fly, house-fly or common housefly), Musca domestica, is a fly of the suborder Cyclorrhapha. It is the most common of all domestic flies, accounting for about 91% of all flies in human habitations, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects, found all over the world. It is considered a pest that can carry serious diseases.

==Physical description==

The adults are about 5–8 mm long. Their thorax is gray or sometimes even black, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The whole body is covered with hair-like projections.  The females are slightly larger than the males, and have a much larger space between their red compound eyes. The mass of pupae can range from about 8 to 20 mg under different conditions.
Like other Diptera (meaning "two-winged"), houseflies have only one pair of wings; the hind pair is reduced to small halteres that aid in flight stability. Characteristically, the media vein (M1+2 or fourth long vein of the wing) shows a sharp upward bend.
Species that appear similar to the housefly include:

==Life cycle==

Each female fly can lay approximately 9,000 eggs in a life time, in several batches of about 75 to 150.[tpl]cite web |author=Stuart M. Bennett |year=2003 |title=Housefly |url=http://www.the-piedpiper.co.uk/th6a.htm[/tpl] The eggs are white and are about 1.2 mm in length. Within a day, larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed on (usually dead and decaying) organic material, such as garbage, carrion or feces. They are pale-whitish, 3–9 mm long, thinner at the mouth end, and have no legs. Their life cycle ranges from 14 hours to 36 hours. At the end of their third instar, the maggots crawl to a dry, cool place and transform into pupae, coloured reddish or brown and about 8 mm long. The adult flies then emerge from the pupae. (This whole cycle is known as complete metamorphosis.) The adults live from two weeks to a month in the wild, or longer in benign laboratory conditions. Having emerged from the pupae, the flies cease to grow; small flies are not necessarily young flies, but are instead the result of getting insufficient food during the larval stage.[tpl]cite news |author=Anthony DeBartolo |url=http://www.hydeparkmedia.com/housefly.html |title=Buzz off! The housefly has made a pest of himself for 25 million years |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=June 5, 1986[/tpl]
Some 36 hours after having emerged from the pupa, the female is receptive for mating. The male mounts her from behind to inject sperm. Copulation takes a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Normally, the female mates only once, storing the sperm to use it repeatedly for laying several sets of eggs.[tpl]cn|date = December 2013[/tpl]
The flies depend on warm temperatures; generally, the warmer the temperature, the faster the flies will develop.[tpl]cn|date = December 2013[/tpl]

==Aging==

Because the somatic tissue of the housefly consists of long-lived post-mitotic cells, it can be used as an informative model system for understanding cumulative age-related cellular alterations.  Agarwal and Sohal studied the level of the oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in houseflies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Agarwal S, Sohal RS |title=DNA oxidative damage and life expectancy in houseflies |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=25 |pages=12332–5 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7991627 |pmc=45431 |doi= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7991627[/tpl]  They found that the level of 8-OHdG increased with age of the flies.  They also found an inverse association of 8-OHdG level with life expectancy of the flies.  They concluded that their results support the hypothesis that oxidative molecular damage is a causal factor in senescence (aging).  These findings are in accord with the general view that oxidative DNA damage, particularly in post-mitotic tissues, is a principal cause of aging.Holmes GE, Bernstein C, Bernstein H (1992).

==Sex determination==

The housefly is an object of biological research, mainly because of one remarkable quality: the sex determination mechanism. Although a wide variety of sex determination mechanisms exist in nature (e.g. male and female heterogamy, haplodiploidy, environmental factors), the way sex is determined is usually fixed within one species. However, the housefly exhibits many different mechanisms for sex determination, such as male heterogamy (like most insects and mammals), female heterogamy (like birds) and maternal control over offspring sex. This makes the housefly one of the most suitable species to study the evolution of sex determination.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dübendorfer A, Hediger M, Burghardt G, Bopp D. |title=Musca domestica, a window on the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in insects |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology|year=2002 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75–79 |pmid=11902690[/tpl]

==Evolution==

Even though the order of flies (Diptera) is much older, true houseflies are believed to have evolved in the beginning of the Cenozoic era, some 65 million years ago.Brian M. Wiegmann, David K. Yeates, Jeffrey L. Thorne, Hirohisa Kishino, a fly's head, showing compound eyes and hair[tpl]dead_link|date=December 2012[/tpl] They are thought to have originated in the southern Palearctic region, particularly the Middle East. Because of their close, commensal relationship with humans, they probably owe their worldwide dispersal to co-migration with humans.

==Relationship with humans==

In colder climates, houseflies survive only with humans. 
They have a tendency to aggregate and are difficult to dispose of. They are capable of carrying over 100 pathogens, such as those causing typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ostrolenk M. & Welch H. |year=1942 |title=The house fly as a vector of food poisoning organisms in food producing establishments |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=487–494[/tpl] bacillary dysentery,[tpl]cite journal |author=Levine, O.S. & Levine M.M. |year=1991 |title=House flies (Musca domestica) as mechanical vectors of shigellosis |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=688–696 |pmid=1925289[/tpl] tuberculosis, anthrax, ophthalmia,  and parasitic worms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Förster M., Klimpel S. & Sievert K. |year=2009 |title=The house fly (Musca domestica) as a potential vector of metazoan parazites caught in a pig-pen in Germany |journal=Veterinary Parasitology |volume=160 |issue=1-2 |pages=163–167 |doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.087[/tpl] Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides.[tpl]cite journal |author=Georghiou G.P. & Hawley M.K. |year=1971 |title=Insecticide resistance resulting from sequential selection of houseflies in the field by organophosphorus compounds |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=43–51[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Keiding J. |year=1975 |title=Problems of housefly (Musca domestica) control due to multiresistance to insecticides |journal=Journal of Hygiene, Epidemiology, Microbiology and Immunology |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=340–355 |pmid=52667[/tpl]
House flies feed on liquid or semiliquid substances beside solid material which has been softened by saliva or vomit. Because of their large intake of food, they deposit feces constantly, one of the factors that makes the insect a dangerous carrier of pathogens. Although they are domestic flies, usually confined to human habitations, they can fly for several miles from the breeding place.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nazni W.A., Luke H., Wan Rozita W.M., Abdullah A.G., Sadiyah I., Azahari A.H., Zamree I., Tan S.B., Lee H.L. & Sofian A.M. |year=2005 |title=Determination of the flight range and despersal of the house fly, Musca domestica (L.) using mark release recapture technique |journal=Tropical Biomedicine |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |pmid=16880754[/tpl]
They are active only in daytime, and rest at night, e.g., at the corners of rooms, ceiling hangings, cellars, and barns, where they can survive the coldest winters by hibernation, and when spring arrives, adult flies are seen only a few days after the first thaw.

===Potential in waste management===

The ability of housefly larvae to feed and develop in a wide range of decaying organic matter is important for recycling of nutrients in nature. Research suggests that this adaptation may be exploited to combat ever-increasing amounts of waste.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miller B. F., Teotia J. S. & Thatcher T.
