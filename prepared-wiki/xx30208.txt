[[List of companies of Finland]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of companies by country, Companies of Finland, Lists of companies of Finland

This is a list of notable companies based in Finland, grouped by their Industry Classification Benchmark sector. For further information on the types of business entities in this country and their abbreviations, see "Business entities in Finland".
Size is not the only criterion of notability, and thus for inclusion in the listâ€”for instance, a small video game company with a well-known product can be included. While notability is not an exact criterion, the list should not grow to cover every single Finnish company with a Wikipedia article; the categories Companies of Finland and Finnish company stubs serve that purpose.
