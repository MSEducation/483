Adamant is a small, unincorporated community in Washington County, Vermont, United States, in the central part of the state.
The village is situated on the town line between Calais to the north and East Montpelier to the south.  There is no true boundary to define the village, and as such there is great debate as to what constitutes residence.  This is, however, purely theoretical as there is no legal, governmental or commercial status associated with residence.  The debate has given rise to the common aphorism that, "Adamant is a state of mind".
The village was originally known as Sodom from its inception in the mid-19th century as a granite quarry-town until 1905 when residents petitioned the state legislature for a name change.  The quarries remained an active part of the Vermont granite industry well into the mid-20th century.
The village center is the Adamant Co-op, a general store and post office located at the junction of Haggett, Quarry, Center and Sodom Pond Roads.  Founded in 1935, it is the state's oldest co-operative.
Perhaps the Village's most notable inclusion is the Adamant Music School, a summer-long piano and musicology school founded in 1942.
