==Biography==

His father was a dentist and his mother a homemaker.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|title=Meet Alex Jones, the Talk Radio Host Behind Charlie Sheen's Crazy Rants|work=Rolling Stone|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchik|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-03-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110329052117/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|archivedate=March 29, 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl] In one of his video podcasts, he reports that he is of German, Welsh, mostly British, and partially Native American descent.Alex Jones Puts Anti-Semitic Caller in His Place!! (2011-03-04). Alex Jones Channel/Prisonplanet.tv/Genesis Communications Network. Retrieved April 06, 2014. He was a lineman on his high school's football team and graduated from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas in 1993. As a teenager, he read Gary Allen's None Dare Call It Conspiracy, which strongly impacted him, and which he calls "the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302?page=3|title=Meet Alex Jones|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl] After high school, Jones attended Austin Community College.Howard Stern Radio Show, February 26, 2013.
He began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format public-access television cable TV program.  In 1996, Jones switched format to KJFK, hosting a show named The Final Edition.[tpl]cite web|last=Nichols|first=Lee|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:75039|title=Psst, It's a Conspiracy: KJFK Gives Alex Jones the Boot Media Clips|publisher=The Austin Chronicle|date=December 10, 1999[/tpl] During this time, Ron Paul was running for congress and was a guest on Jones' show several times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/alex-jones-2011-4/index1.html|title=How Radio Host Alex Jones Has Cornered the Bipartisan Paranoia Market|work=New York|accessdate=January 11, 2013[/tpl] The two share many beliefs and have been friends since then. In his early shows, he frequently talked about his belief that the U.S. government was behind the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, using the incident to put down a growing "states rights movement".[tpl]cite book|last=Kay|first=Jonathan|title=Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nUhkzzQklvEC&pg=PT26|accessdate=January 11, 2013|date=2011-05-17|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062004819|pages=26–[/tpl] In 1998, he released his first film, America Destroyed By Design.
In 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new Branch Davidian church as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often featured the project on his public-access television program and claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the ATF during the siege.
In 1999, he tied with Shannon Burke for that year's "Best Austin Talk Radio Host" poll as voted by The Austin Chronicle readers.[tpl]cite web|title=Best of Austin 1999 Readers Poll|year=1999|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin/?BOACategory=Media&Year=1999&Poll=Readers&Display=Long|accessdate=2007-08-14[/tpl] Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics, his viewpoints making the show hard to sell to advertisers, according to the station's operations manager. Jones argued: "It was purely political, and it came down from on high," and, "I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off Clinton, to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing the Marines, A to Z". He began spreading his show via internet connection from his home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302?page=4|title=Meet Alex Jones|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl]
In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open seat swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones stated that he was running "to be a watchdog on the inside",[tpl]Cite news|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&s_dispstring=%22to%20be%20a%20watchdog%20on%20the%20inside%22&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22to%20be%20a%20watchdog%20on%20the%20inside%22)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|date=January 4, 2000|page=B1|format=fee required|title=Nine to seek Greenberg's House seat|author=Scott S.

In July, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or get their shows thrown off the air.[tpl]cite news|first=Lee|last=Nichols|title=Alex Jones: Conspiracy Victim or Evil Mastermind?|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=77932|newspaper=Austin Chronicle|date=2000-07-14|accessdate=2008-05-20|quote=Alex Jones is no stranger to conspiracy theories.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120102000033/http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-07-14/77932/|archivedate=2012-01-02[/tpl]
In 2001, his show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. After the 9/11 terrorist attack, Jones began to speak of a conspiracy by the Bush administration as being behind the attack, which caused a number of the stations that had previously carried him to drop his program.
On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the Bilderberg group in Ottawa, Canada, Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said regarding the reason for his immigration hold, "I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."[tpl]cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Bilderberg-bound filmmaker held at airport|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=2006-06-08|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&k=12919|accessdate=2007-08-13[/tpl]
On September 8, 2007, he was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City. He was charged with operating a bullhorn without a permit. Two others were also cited for disorderly conduct when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. In an article, one of Jones's fellow protesters said, "It was ... guerrilla information warfare."[tpl]cite news|last=Grace|first=Melissa|author2=Xana O'Neill|title=Filmmaker arrested during city protest|date=2007-09-09|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_filmmaker_arrested_during_city_protest.html|accessdate=2007-09-10|newspaper=Daily News (New York)|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013231209/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_filmmaker_arrested_during_city_protest.html|archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

Jones has been the center of many controversies, such as the one surrounding his actions and statements about gun control after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has accused the U.S. government of being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing and September 11 attacks.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stahl|first=Jeremy|journal=Slate|title=Where Did 9/11 Conspiracies Come From?|date=September 6, 2011|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2302830/|accessdate=September 11, 2011[/tpl] Jones was in a "media crossfire" in 2011, which included criticism by Rush Limbaugh, when the news spread that Jared Loughner had been "a fan" of the 9/11 conspiracy film Loose Change, of which Jones had been an executive producer. In January 2013, Jones was invited to speak on Piers Morgan's show after promoting an online petition to deport Morgan due to his support of gun control laws.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2013/0109/Piers-Morgan-vs.-Alex-Jones-feud-helping-or-hurting-gun-control-video|title=Piers Morgan vs. Alex Jones feud: helping or hurting gun control?

The event drew widespread coverage, and according to The Huffington Post, Morgan and others such as Glenn Beck "agreed that Jones was a terrible spokesman for gun rights".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/piers-morgan-alex-jones-gun-control_n_2438963.html|title=Piers Morgan: Alex Jones 'Terrifying', A Perfect 'Advertisement For Gun Control'|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=January 9, 2013|first=Jack|last=Mirkinson|date=January 9, 2013[/tpl] Jones's appearance on the show was a top trending Twitter topic the following morning.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/07/us/piers-morgan-guns-debate/index.html|title=Social media abuzz over Piers Morgan vs. Alex Jones|work=CNN|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl]
On June 9, 2013, Jones appeared as a guest on the BBC's Sunday Politics.

In 2011, he had a larger on-line audience than Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh combined.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302#ixzz27xKeI02Z|title=Meet Alex Jones|last=ALEXANDER ZAITCHIK|date=March 2, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl] Author Will Bunch says that Jones was in part a model for Glenn Beck who "synthesized" some of the paranoia of Jones's commentaries into his persona.
Jones is also the operator of several web sites centered on news and information about civil liberties issues, global government, and a wide variety of current events topics. Several of these sites are www.infowars.com, www.prisonplanet.tv, www.prisonplanet.com, and www.jonesreport.com. As of February 2014, his YouTube channel, TheAlexJonesChannel, has received more than 360 million views and 750,000 subscriptions.
He has been able to mobilize his followers to create "Google bomb" actions that bring particular terms to the top of search engine listing, a tactic which has then inspired other online media, such as The Drudge Report, to cover the story.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302?page=2|title=Meet Alex Jones | Politics News | Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl]
