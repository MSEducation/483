The ankh ([tpl]IPAc-en|Àà|√¶|≈ã|k[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|Àà|…ëÀê|≈ã|k[/tpl]; Egyptian [tpl]IPA-sem|* ïaÀênax[/tpl]; U+2625 ‚ò• or U+132F9 ìãπ), also known as key of life, the key of the Nile or crux ansata (Latin meaning "cross with a handle"), was the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic character that read "life", a triliteral sign for the consonants Íú•-n-·∏´.
It represents the concept of eternal life, which is the general meaning of the symbol.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The Egyptian gods are often portrayed carrying it by its loop, or bearing one in each hand, arms crossed over their chest.

==Origin==

The origin of the symbol remains a mystery to Egyptologists, and no single hypothesis has been widely accepted. One of the earliest suggestions is that of Thomas Inman, first published in 1869:
 It is by Egyptologists called the symbol of life. It is also called the "handled cross", or crux ansata. It represents the male triad and the female unit, under a decent form. There are few symbols more commonly met with in Egyptian art. In some sculptures, where the sun's rays are represented as terminating in hands, the offerings which these bring are many a crux ansata, emblematic of the truth that a fruitful union is a gift from the deity.Inman, Thomas. Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism, Second Edition. New York: J. W. Bouton, 706 Broadway. Published 1875. Page 44. ISBN 978-1-4209-2987-4. 
E. A. Wallis Budge postulated that the symbol originated as the belt buckle of the mother goddess Isis,A Guide to the Third and Fourth Rooms of the British Museum (London: s.n.: 1904), 210. an idea joined by Wolfhart Westendorf[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] with the notion that both the ankh and the knot of Isis were used in many ceremonies. Sir Alan Gardiner speculated that it depicts a sandal strap, which is also written with the ankh hieroglyph.Gardiner, Alan. Egyptian Grammar, Third Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1957. p. 508.
In their 2004 book The Quick and the Dead,[tpl]cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Andrew Hunt|last2=Schwabe|first2=Calvin W|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1LbGCVlFtA4C&printsec=frontcover|title=The Quick and the Dead: Biomedical Theory in Ancient Egypt First Edition|publisher=Brill/Styx|date=2004|isbn=90-04-12391-1[/tpl] Andrew Hunt Gordon and Calvin W. Schwabe speculated that the ankh, djed, and was symbols have a biological basis derived from ancient cattle culture (linked to the Egyptian belief that semen was created in the spine), thus:

==History==

The ankh appears frequently in Egyptian tomb paintings and other art, often at the fingertips of a god or goddess in images that represent the deities of the afterlife conferring the gift of life on the dead person's mummy; this is thought to symbolize the act of conception.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Additionally, an ankh was often carried by Egyptians as an amulet, either alone, or in connection with two other hieroglyphs that mean "strength" and "health" (see explication of djed and was, above).[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Mirrors of beaten metal were also often made in the shape of an ankh, either for decorative reasons or to symbolize a perceived view into another world.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
A symbol similar to the ankh appears frequently in Minoan and Mycenaean sites. This is a combination of the sacral knot (symbol of holiness) with the double-edged axe (symbol of matriarchy)F. Schachermeyer. (1964) "Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta" pp. 161, 163‚Äì164 but it can be better compared with the Egyptian tyet which is similar. This symbol can be recognized on the two famous figurines of the chthonian Snake Goddess discovered in the palace of Knossos. Both snake goddesses have a knot with a projecting loop cord between their breasts.Cristopher L.C.E Witcombe. "Minoan snake goddess". 9: Snake charmers In the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) script, ankh is the phonetic sign za.M. Ventris, J. Chadwick
The ankh also appeared frequently in coins from ancient Cyprus and Asia Minor (particularly the city of Mallus in Cilicia).The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press; AsiaMinorCoins.com In some cases, especially with the early coinage of King Euelthon of Salamis, the letter ku, from the Cypriot syllabary, appeared within the circle ankh, representing Ku(prion) (Cypriots). To this day, the ankh is also used to represent the planet Venus (the namesake of which, the goddess Venus or Aphrodite, was chiefly worshipped on the island) and the metal copper (the heavy mining of which gave Cyprus its name). Fisher, Fred H., Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It, London: George Routledge and Sons 1878, pp. 13‚Äì14.
David P. Silverman notes how the depiction of the ancient Egyptian ankh was preserved by the Copts in their representation of the Christian cross, the coptic cross."Egyptian Religion", David P.
