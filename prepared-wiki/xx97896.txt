[[Partition coefficient]]

CATEGORIES: Equilibrium chemistry, Medicinal chemistry, Solvents

In the physical sciences, a partition- or distribution-coefficient  is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible phases at equilibrium. These coefficients are a measure of the difference in solubility of the compound in these two phases.
In the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences, the two phases are often restricted to mean two immiscible solvents. In this context, a partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in the two phases of a mixture of two immiscible liquids at equilibrium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leo A, Hansch C, and Elkins D|title=Partition coefficients and their uses |journal=Chem Rev |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=525–616 |year=1971 |doi=10.1021/cr60274a001[/tpl] Normally one of the solvents chosen is water while the second is hydrophobic such as 1-octanol.[tpl]cite book |last=Sangster |first=James |title=Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients: Fundamentals and Physical Chemistry, Vol. 2 of Wiley Series in Solution Chemistry |publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |year=1997 |location=Chichester |pages=178 pages |isbn=978-0-471-97397-3[/tpl] Hence both the partition and distribution coefficient are measures of how hydrophilic ("water-loving") or hydrophobic ("water-fearing") a chemical substance is. In medical practice, partition coefficients are useful for example in estimating distribution of drugs within the body. Hydrophobic drugs with high octanol/water partition coefficients are preferentially distributed to hydrophobic compartments such as lipid bilayers of cells while hydrophilic drugs (low octanol/water partition coefficients) preferentially are found in hydrophilic compartments such as blood serum.
If one of the solvents is a gas and the other a liquid, the "gas/liquid partition coefficient" is the same as the dimensionless form of the Henry's law constant. For example, the blood/gas partition coefficient of a general anesthetic measures how easily the anesthetic passes from gas to blood. Partition coefficients can also be used when one or both solvents is a solid (see solid solution).
The phrase "partition coefficient" is now considered obsolete by IUPAC, and "partition constant", "partition ratio", or "distribution ratio" are all more appropriate terms that should be used.[tpl]cite book | author = Wilkinson, Andrew M.; McNaught, Alan D. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Compendium of Chemical Terminology: IUPAC Recommendations | edition = | language = | publisher = Blackwell Science | location = Oxford | year = 1997 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-86542-684-8 | oclc = | doi = 10.1351/goldbook | url =  | accessdate = | chapter = Partition Coefficient | chapterurl = http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04437.html [/tpl]

==Partition coefficient and log P==

The partition coefficient is a ratio of concentrations of un-ionized compound between the two solutions.   To measure the partition coefficient of ionizable solutes, the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted such that the predominant form of the compound is un-ionized.   The logarithm of the ratio of the concentrations of the un-ionized solute in the solvents is called log ''P'': The log P value is also known as a measure of lipophilicity.

==Distribution coefficient and log D==

The distribution coefficient is the ratio of the sum of the concentrations of all forms of the compound (ionized plus un-ionized) in each of the two phases.   For measurements of distribution coefficient, the pH of the aqueous phase is buffered to a specific value such that the pH is not significantly perturbed by the introduction of the compound.  The logarithm of the ratio of the sum of concentrations of the solute's various forms in one solvent, to the sum of the concentrations of its forms in the other solvent is called log D:
In addition, log D is pH dependent, hence one must specify the pH at which the log D was measured.  Of particular interest is the log D at pH = 7.4 (the physiological pH of blood serum).
For un-ionizable compounds, log P = log D at any pH.

==Applications==

===Pharmacology===

A drug's distribution coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended target in the body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, and how long it will remain in the body in an active form.
LogP is one criterion used in medicinal chemistry to assess the druglikeness of a given molecule, and used to calculate lipophilic efficiency, a function of potency and LogP that evaluate the quality of research compounds.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Role of Physicochemical Properties and Ligand Lipophilicity Efficiency in Addressing Drug Safety Risks| author = Edwards MP, Price DA | doi = 10.1016/S0065-7743(10)45023-X | year = 2010 | journal = Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry | pages = 381–391| volume = 45 | series = Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-12-380902-5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Leeson PD, Springthorpe B | title = The influence of drug-like concepts on decision-making in medicinal chemistry | journal = Nat Rev Drug Discov | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 881–90 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 17971784 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2445 | url =  [/tpl] For a given compound lipophilic efficiency is defined as the pIC50 (or pEC50) of interest minus the LogP of the compound.

====Pharmacokinetics====

In the context of pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a drug), the distribution coefficient has a strong influence on ADME properties of the drug.  Hence the hydrophobicity of a compound (as measured by its distribution coefficient) is a major determinant of how drug-like it is.  More specifically, for a drug to be orally absorbed, it normally must first pass through lipid bilayers in the intestinal epithelium (a process known as transcellular transport).  For efficient transport, the drug must be hydrophobic enough to partition into the lipid bilayer, but not so hydrophobic, that once it is in the bilayer, it will not partition out again.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kubinyi H |title=Nonlinear dependence of biological activity on hydrophobic character: the bilinear model|journal= Farmaco Sci |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=248–76 |year= 1979 |pmid= 43264 [/tpl]  Likewise, hydrophobicity plays a major role in determining where drugs are distributed within the body after absorption and as a consequence in how rapidly they are metabolized and excreted.

====Pharmacodynamics====

In the context of pharmacodynamics (what a drug does to the body), the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eisenberg D, McLachlan AD|title=Solvation energy in protein folding and binding|journal= Nature |volume= 319 |issue= 6050 |pages= 199–203 |year= 1986 |pmid= 3945310 | doi = 10.1038/319199a0|bibcode = 1986Natur.319..199E [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Miyamoto S, Kollman PA |title=What determines the strength of noncovalent association of ligands to proteins in aqueous solution?|journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 90|issue= 18 |pages= 8402–6 |year= 1993 |pmid= 8378312 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.18.8402 |pmc=47364|bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.8402M [/tpl]  On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs tend to be more toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less selective in their binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive.  Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the therapeutic protein target.[tpl]cite book |last = Pliska |first = Vladimir |coauthors = Testa B, Van De Waterbeemd H |title = Lipophilicity in Drug Action and Toxicology |publisher = John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |year = 1996 |location = New York  |pages = 439 pages |isbn = 978-3-527-29383-4[/tpl]  Therefore the ideal distribution coefficient for a drug is usually intermediate (not too hydrophobic nor too hydrophilic).

===Consumer products===

Many other industries take into account distribution coefficients for example in the formulation of make-up, topical ointments, dyes, hair colors and many other consumer products.

===Agrochemicals===

Hydrophobic insecticides and herbicides tend to be more active.   Hydrophobic agrochemicals in general have longer half lives and therefore display increased risk of adverse environmental impact.

===Metallurgy===

In metallurgy, the partition coefficient is an important factor in determining how different impurities are distributed between molten and solidified metal. It is a critical parameter for purification using zone melting, and determines how effective an impurity can be removed using directional solidification, described by the Scheil equation.

===Environmental===

The hydrophobicity of a compound can give scientists an indication of how easily a compound might be taken up in groundwater to pollute waterways, and its toxicity to animals and aquatic life.[tpl]cite journal |author= Cronin D, Mark T |title=The Role of Hydrophobicity in Toxicity Prediction|journal=Current Computer - Aided Drug Design |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=405–413 |year= 2006| doi = 10.2174/157340906778992346[/tpl] Distribution coefficients may be measured or predicted for compounds currently causing problems or with foresight to gauge the structural modifications necessary to make a compound environmentally more friendly in the research phase.
In the field of hydrogeology, the octanol water partition coefficient, or Kow, is used to predict and model the migration of dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds in soil and groundwater.

==Measurement==

===Shake flask (or tube) method===

The classical and most reliable method of log P determination is the shake-flask method, which consists of dissolving some of the solute in question in a volume of octanol and water, then measuring the concentration of the solute in each solvent. The most common method of measuring the distribution of the solute is by UV/VIS spectroscopy. There are a number of pros and cons to this method:
Pros:
Cons:
As an alternative to UV/VIS spectroscopy other methods can be used to measure the distribution, one of the best is to use a carrier free radiotracer. In this method (which is well suited for the study of the extraction of metals) a known amount of a radioactive material is added to one of the phases. The two phases are then brought into contact and mixed until equilibrium has been reached. Then the two phases are separated before the radioactivity in each phase is measured. Using an energy dispersive detector (such as a high purity germanium detector) allows the use of several different radioactive metals at once, whereas the simpler gamma ray detectors only allow one radioactive element to be used in the sample.
If the volume of both of the phases are the same then the math is very simple.
For a hypothetical solute (S)
D or P = radioactivity of the organic phase / radioactivity of the aqueous phase
D or P = Sorganic/Saqueous
In such an experiment using a carrier free radioisotope the solvent loading is very small, hence the results are different from those obtained when the concentration of the solute is very high. A disadvantage of the carrier free radioisotope experiment is that the solute can adsorb to the surfaces of the glass (or plastic) equipment or at the interface between the two phases. To guard against this the mass balance should be calculated.
It should be the case that:
radioactivity of the organic phase + radioactivity of the aqueous phase = initial radioactivity of the phase bearing the radiotracer
For nonradioactive metals, it is possible in some cases to use ICP-MS or ICP-AES. Sadly ICP methods often suffer from many interferences that do not apply to gamma spectroscopy hence the use of radio-tracers (counted by gamma ray spectroscopy) is often more straightforward.

===HPLC determination===

A faster method of log P determination makes use of high-performance liquid chromatography. The log P of a solute can be determined by correlating its retention time with similar compounds with known log P values.[tpl]cite journal | author = Valkó K | title = Application of high-performance liquid chromatography based measurements of lipophilicity to model biological distribution | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 1037 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 299–310 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15214672 | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2003.10.084 [/tpl]

Cons:

===Electrochemical methods===

In the recent past some experiments using polarized liquid interfaces have been used to examine the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transfer of charged species from one phase to another. Two main methods exist.

==Prediction==

Quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) algorithms calculate a log P in several different ways:

==Limitations==

Log P is not an accurate determinant of lipophilicity for ionizable compounds because it only correctly describes the partition coefficient of neutral (uncharged) molecules.  Taking the example of drug discovery we see how the limitations of log P can affect research.  Since the majority of drugs (approximately 80%) are ionizable, log P is not an appropriate predictor of a compound's behaviour in the changing pH environments of the body. The distribution coefficient (Log D) is the correct descriptor for ionizable systems.
Alternatively, use may be made of the apparent partition coefficient, which is defined as follows: (true partition coefficient) x (fraction of the drug that is unionised). Clearly, if the drug is 100% un-ionized then Papparent = Ptrue.
