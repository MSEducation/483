An integer is a number that is written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, and −2048 are integers; 9.75, 5½, and [tpl]sqrt|2[/tpl] are not integers. The set of integers consists of the natural numbers ([tpl]num|1[/tpl], [tpl]num|2[/tpl], [tpl]num|3[/tpl], ...), zero ([tpl]num|0[/tpl]) and the opposites of the natural numbers (−1, −2, −3, ..., that are negative).
The integers (with addition as operation) form the smallest group containing the additive monoid of the natural numbers. Like the natural numbers, the integers form a countably infinite set. In algebraic number theory, these commonly understood integers, embedded in the field of rational numbers, are referred to as rational integers to distinguish them from the more broadly defined algebraic integers. 

==Algebraic properties==

Like the natural numbers, Z is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication, that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly, [tpl]num|0[/tpl], Z (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under subtraction. The integers form a unital ring which is the most basic one, in the following sense: for any unital ring, there is a unique ring homomorphism from the integers into this ring. This universal property, namely to be an initial object in the category of rings, characterizes the ring Z.
Z is not closed under division, since the quotient of two integers (e.g., 1 divided by 2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under exponentiation, the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).
The following lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers a, b and c.
In the language of abstract algebra, the first five properties listed above for addition say that Z under addition is an abelian group. As a group under addition, Z is a cyclic group, since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum [tpl]nowrap|1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1[/tpl] or [tpl]nowrap|(−1) + (−1) + ⋯ + (−1)[/tpl]. In fact, Z under addition is the only infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z.
The first four properties listed above for multiplication say that Z under multiplication is a commutative monoid. However not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g. there is no integer x such that [tpl]nowrap|2x [tpl]=[/tpl] 1,[/tpl] because the left hand side is even, while the right hand side is odd. This means that Z under multiplication is not a group.
All the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that Z together with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity. It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure. Only those equalities of expressions are true in Z for all values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Note that certain non-zero integers map to zero in certain rings.
At last, the property (*) says that the commutative ring Z is an integral domain. In fact, Z provides the motivation for defining such a structure.
The lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that Z is not closed under division, means that Z is not a field. The smallest field with the usual operations containing the integers is the field of rational numbers. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the field of fractions of any integral domain. And back, starting from an algebraic number field (an extension of rational numbers), its ring of integers can be extracted, which includes Z as its subring.
Although ordinary division is not defined on Z, the division "with remainder" is defined on them. It is called Euclidean division and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers a and b with [tpl]nowrap|b ≠ 0[/tpl], there exist unique integers q and r such that [tpl]nowrap|a [tpl]=[/tpl] q × b + r[/tpl] and {{nowrap|0 ≤ r Again, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that Z is a Euclidean domain. This implies that Z is a principal ideal domain and any positive integer can be written as the products of primes in an essentially unique way. This is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

==Order-theoretic properties==

Z is a totally ordered set without upper or lower bound. The ordering of Z is given by:
An integer is positive if it is greater than zero and negative if it is less than zero. Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.
The ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:
It follows that Z together with the above ordering is an ordered ring.
The integers are the only integral domain whose positive elements are well-ordered, and in which order is preserved by addition.
