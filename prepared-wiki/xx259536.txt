Homeobox protein NOBOX, also known as newborn ovary homeobox protein, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NOBOX gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: NOBOX oogenesis homeobox| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=135935| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Suzumori N, Yan C, Matzuk MM, Rajkovic A | title = Nobox is a homeobox-encoding gene preferentially expressed in primordial and growing oocytes | journal = Mech.

==Function==

NOBOX is a homeobox gene that is preferentially expressed in oocytes. In mice, it is essential for folliculogenesis and regulation of oocyte-specific genes.

==Clinical significance==

A mutation in the NOBOX gene is associated with premature ovarian failure.[tpl]cite journal | author = Qin Y, Choi Y, Zhao H, Simpson JL, Chen ZJ, Rajkovic A | title = NOBOX homeobox mutation causes premature ovarian failure | journal = Am.
