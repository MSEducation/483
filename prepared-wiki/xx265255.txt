Texas State Highway Spur 537 (Spur 537) is a state highway spur in San Antonio, Texas.

==Route description==

Spur 537 begins at an intersection with Loop 410 and San Pedro Avenue in Uptown San Antonio, near North Star Mall.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|404|accessdate=2011-01-07[/tpl] It follows San Pedro Avenue northbound until its terminus at the US 281 freeway, just west of the runways of San Antonio International Airport. The junction with US 281 is incomplete by design: northbound Spur 537 merges onto the northbound lanes of US 281, while the beginning of southbound Spur 537 is only accessible via an exit from southbound US 281.

==History==

Spur 537 was designated in 1978 after US 281 was rerouted along the McAllister Freeway through the north side of San Antonio.
