==Early life==

Born on 29 January 1969, in Sydney, Spencer grew up in the Hunters Hill/Gladesville area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/rise-and-shine/2006/02/18/1140151849206.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Rise and shine - TV & Radio - Entertainment |publisher=smh.com.au |date= 20 February 2006|accessdate=2013-10-13[/tpl]
Spencer was born without the muscle levator palpebrae superioris in his right upper eyelid, leading to permanent ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) and noticeable facial asymmetry. He later received a transplant from a donor in an operation performed by eye surgeon Fred Hollows, allowing him to "open" that eye.
Spencer attended St Aloysius' College in Sydney, and was a vice-captain of the College and Captain of the Australian Schools Debating Team.
He graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Science with first class honours in pure mathematics in 1991.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/appointments/of-theses-and-of-theatricality/story-e6frgckf-1111114287660 | work=The Australian[/tpl] While at university, he was one of the world's top-ranked debaters, reaching the final round of the World Universities Debating Championship three times (1990, 1992, 1996) and winning Worlds Best Speaker (1996).[tpl]cite web |url=http://flynn.debating.net/worhist.htm |title=History of the World Debating Championships |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 January 2013[/tpl] He also won the Australasian debating championship twice (1988, 1990).
