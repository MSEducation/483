[[Baso Liben]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Baso Liben is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. A triangular-shaped district at the southernmost point of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Baso Liben is bordered on the south by a bend of the Abay River which separates it from the Oromia Region, on the northwest by Guzamn, and on the northeast by Aneded; the Chamwaga river defines part of its western border. The major town in Baso Liben is Yejube.
Rivers in this woreda include the Yada, and the Sens which is a tributary of the Chamwaga. Several fords have been used from time immemorial to cross the Abay from Baso Liben into Guduru and Cheliya woredas in the Oromia Region which are, in downriver order: the Balanti, Malka, Malka Kuki, Malka Fursi, and Malka Yekatel.Per the map in R.
