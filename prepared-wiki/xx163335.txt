[[Austrian passport]]

CATEGORIES: Passports by country, Government of Austria

Austrian passports are issued to citizens of Austria to facilitate international travel.

==Physical appearance==

Austrian  passports are the same burgundy colour as other European passports, and with the Austrian Coat of arms emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The words  "EUROPÄISCHE UNION" (English:European Union) and "REPUBLIK ÖSTERREICH" ([tpl]lang-en|Republic of Austria[/tpl]) are inscribed above the coat of arms and the word "REISEPASS" ([tpl]lang-en|Passport[/tpl]) is inscribed below. Austrian passports have the standard biometric symbol at the bottom and use the standard EU design. Each page of the passport shows the coat of arms of a different Austrian province in the background.

===Different spellings of the same name within the same document===

German names containing umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and/or ß are spelled in the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone of the passport, but with simple vowel + E and/or SS in the machine-readable zone, e.g. Müller becomes MUELLER, Groß becomes GROSS, and Gößmann becomes GOESSMANN.
The transcription mentioned above is generally used for airplane tickets etc., but sometimes (like in US visas) also simple vowels are used (MULLER, GOSSMANN). The three possible spelling variants of the same name (e.g. Müller / Mueller / Muller) in different documents sometimes lead to confusion, and the use of two different spellings within the same document (like in the passport) may give people who are unfamiliar with the German orthography the impression that the document is a forgery.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The Austrian passport can (but does not always) contain a note in German, English, and French that AE / OE/ UE / SS are the common transcriptions for Ä / Ö / Ü / ß.

==The travel freedom of Austrian citizens==

According to the "Henley Visa Restrictions Index 2013," holders of an Austrian passport can visit 168 countries visa-free or with visa on arrival (as of July 2013). In the Index, Austria was ranked 5th in terms of travel freedom (together with Australia and Switzerland). See Visa requirements for Austrian citizens.

==Holding a second passport==

Austria allows its citizens to hold a second Austrian passport to circumvent certain travel restrictions (e.g. some Arab countries do not allow entry with Israeli passport stamps, e.g. Bahrain, Iraqi Kurdistan the rest of Iraq, Oman, Mauritania, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates).
Simultaneous holding an Austrian and a foreign passport (that is dual citizenship) is restricted under the current nationality law. For details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship.

==History==

Before Austria became a member of the European Union, passports had a dark green cover.
