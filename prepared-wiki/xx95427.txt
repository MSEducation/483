==Use in nutrition and medicine==

Oral glucosamine is a dietary supplement and is not a pharmaceutical drug.  It is illegal in the US to market any dietary supplement as a treatment for any disease or condition.Staff, FDA Last Updated April 11, 2013 Q&A on Dietary Supplements  Glucosamine is marketed to support the structure and function of joints and the marketing is targeted to people suffering from  osteoarthritis. Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine. Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane.  Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a "likely effective" rating for treating osteoarthritis.[tpl]cite web|title=Glucosamine sulfate: Effectiveness|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/807.html#Effectiveness|publisher=Medline Plus[/tpl] (2011)

===Evaluation as osteoarthritis treatment===

Since glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage, some have hoped that supplemental glucosamine could beneficially influence cartilage structure, and alleviate arthritis.  Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis appears safe,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] but there is no unequivocal evidence for its effectiveness.  There have been multiple clinical trials testing glucosamine as a potential medical therapy for osteoarthritis, but the results have not supported its use.
In general, the clinical trials of the mid-1990s that furnished positive results showing glucosamine efficacy were later deemed to be of poor quality due to shortcomings in their methods, including small size, short duration, poor analysis of drop-outs, and unclear procedures for blinding.[tpl]cite journal |author=Adams ME |title=Hype about glucosamine |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9176 |pages=353–4 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10437858 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)90040-5 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=McAlindon TE, LaValley MP, Gulin JP, Felson DT |title=Glucosamine and chondroitin for treatment of osteoarthritis: a systematic quality assessment and meta-analysis |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=283 |issue=11 |pages=1469–75 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10732937 |doi= 10.1001/jama.283.11.1469|url=[/tpl] At the same time, several independent studies did not detect any benefit of glucosamine supplementation on osteoarthritis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hughes R, Carr A |title=A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine sulphate as an analgesic in osteoarthritis of the knee |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England) |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11934964 |doi= 10.1093/rheumatology/41.3.279|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Cibere J |title=Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled glucosamine discontinuation trial in knee osteoarthritis |journal=Arthritis and Rheumatism |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=738–45 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15478160 |doi=10.1002/art.20697 |author-separator=, |author2=Kopec JA |author3=Thorne A |display-authors=3 |last4=Singer |first4=Joel |last5=Canvin |first5=Janice |last6=Robinson |first6=David B. |last7=Pope |first7=Janet |last8=Hong |first8=Paul |last9=Grant |first9=Eric |first10=John M.[/tpl]
A Cochrane 2005 meta-analysis of glucosamine therapy for osteoarthritis found that only the Rotta brand of glucosamine appeared to be superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic osteoarthritis.[tpl]cite cochrane |author=Towheed TE, Maxwell L, Anastassiades TP, et al. |title=Glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis |volume= |issue=2 |review=CD002946 |year=2005 |pmid=15846645 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002946.pub2[/tpl] However, when the low quality and older studies were discounted and only those using the highest-quality design were considered, there was no difference from placebo treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dahmer S, Schiller RM |title=Glucosamine |journal=American Family Physician |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=471–6 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18756654 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20080815/471.html[/tpl]
In 2006, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a 24 week, 12.5 million-dollar multicenter clinical trial (the GAIT trial) to study the effect of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin/glucosamine in combination, and celecoxib as a treatment for knee-pain in two groups of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: Patients with mild pain (n=1229), and patients with moderate to severe pain (n=354).[tpl]ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00032890|Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT)[/tpl] When the data from both groups were pooled and analyzed, there was no statistically significant difference between groups taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine/chondroitin; and those taking a placebo.

In a follow-up study in 2008, 572 patients from the GAIT trial continued their supplementation for 2 years.  After 2 years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint space width, when compared to a placebo.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sawitzke AD |title=The effect of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate on the progression of knee osteoarthritis: a report from the glucosamine/chondroitin arthritis intervention trial |journal=Arthritis and Rheumatism |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=3183–91 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18821708 |doi=10.1002/art.23973 |last2=Shi |first2=H |last3=Finco |first3=MF |last4=Dunlop |first4=DD |last5=Bingham Co |first5=3rd |last6=Harris |first6=CL |last7=Singer |first7=NG |last8=Bradley |first8=JD |last9=Silver |first9=D |pmc=2836125 |first10=Christopher G. |first11=Nancy E. |first12=Chester V. |first13=Fred |first14=Jeffrey |first15=Daniel E. |first16=Domenic J. |first17=Roland W. |first18=H.

===Adverse effects===

Clinical studies have consistently reported that glucosamine appears safe.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] However, a recent Université Laval study shows that people taking glucosamine tend to go beyond recommended guidelines, as they do not feel any positive effects from the dietary supplement. Beyond recommended dosages, researchers found in preliminary studies that glucosamine may damage pancreatic cells, possibly increasing the risk of developing diabetes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lafontaine-Lacasse M, Dore M, Picard, F |title=Hexosamines stimulate apoptosis by altering Sirt1 action and levelsin rodent pancreatic β-cells |journal=Journal of Endocrinology |pmid=20923823 |doi= 10.1677/JOE-10-0243 |volume=208 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=41–9[/tpl]

==Legal status==

===United States===

In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in humans.  Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the US, safety and formulation are solely the responsibility of the manufacturer; evidence of safety and efficacy is not required as long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/supplmnt.html |title=Dietary Supplements |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=December 10, 2009[/tpl] The U.S. National Institutes of Health is currently conducting a study of supplemental glucosamine in obese patients, since this population may be particularly sensitive to any effects of glucosamine on insulin resistance.[tpl]ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00065377|Effects of Oral Glucosamine on Insulin and Blood Vessel Activity in Normal and Obese People[/tpl]

===Europe===

In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate. In this case, evidence of safety and efficacy is required for the medical use of glucosamine and several guidelines have recommended its use as an effective and safe therapy for osteoarthritis.
