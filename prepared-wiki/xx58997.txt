She was a puppeteer in the films The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Dark Crystal (1982), and she appeared in various other Muppet series and specials.

It was very exciting because this lump of clay we modelled with a fairly neutral expression came to life."Johnston, Ian. "Headcases? We were miles better", The Independent, 6 April 2008
