Asphodelus ramosus, also known as branched asphodel, is a perennial herb in the Asparagales order. Similar in appearance to Asphodelus albus and particularly Asphodelus cerasiferus, it may be distinguished by its highly branched stem and smaller fruits.
In addition, at least on the Catalan coast where it is very common, in contrast to other asphodels, it shows an affinity for acidic soils, mainly schist. It is to be found close to the sea on the slopes of the Alb√®res massif, where it forms abundant colonies in April to May. Its very numerous flowers are white with six tepals bearing a central brown streak. The fruits are small round capsules.
