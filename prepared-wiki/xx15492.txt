</ref> As the altitude increases, the main form of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] becomes [[snow]] and the winds increase.[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002|p=12[/tpl]
The effect of the climate on the ecology at an elevation can be largely captured through a combination of amount of precipitation, and the biotemperature, as described by Leslie Holdridge in 1947.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm|last1=Lugo|first1=Ariel E.|first2=Sandra L.|last2=Brown|first3=Rusty|last3=Dodson|first4=Tom S.|last4=Smith|first5=Hank H.|last5=Shugart|year=1999|title=The Holdridge Life Zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=26|pages=1025–1038|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x|issue=5[/tpl] Biotemperature is the mean temperature, where all temperatures below [tpl]convert|0|C|F[/tpl] are considered to be 0 °C. When the temperature is below 0 °C, plants are dormant, so the exact temperature is unimportant. The peaks of mountains with permanent snow can have a biotemperature below [tpl]convert|1.5|C|F[/tpl].

==Ecology==

The colder climate on mountains affects the plants and animals residing on mountains. A particular set of plants and animals tend to be adapted to a relatively narrow range of climate. Thus, ecosystems tend to lie along elevation bands of roughly constant climate. This is called altitudinal zonation.[ref]
</ref>
In regions with dry climates, the tendency of mountains to have higher precipitation as well as lower temperatures also provides for varying conditions, which enhances zonation.[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Biotic Communities of the Colorado Plateau: C. Hart Merriam and the Life Zones Concept|url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/merriam.htm|accessdate=30 January 2010[/tpl]
Some plants and animals found in altitudinal zones tend to become isolated since the conditions above and below a particular zone will be inhospitable and thus constrain their movements or dispersal. These isolated ecological systems are known as sky islands.[tpl]cite book|last=Tweit|first=Susan J.|title=The Great Southwest Nature Factbook|publisher=Alaska Northwest Books|year=1992|pages=209–210|isbn=0-88240-434-2[/tpl]
Altitudinal zones tend to follow a typical pattern. At the highest elevations, trees cannot grow, and whatever life may be present will be of the alpine type, resembling tundra. Just below the tree line, one may find subalpine forests of needleleaf trees, which can withstand cold, dry conditions.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia|title=Tree|encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003| publisher=Microsoft Corporation|origyear=1993|year=2002|id=60210-442-1635445-74407[/tpl] Below that, montane forests grow. In the temperate portions of the earth, those forests tend to be needleleaf trees, while in the tropics, they can be broadleaf trees growing in a rain forest.

==In society==

Mountains are generally less preferable for human habitation than lowlands, because of harsh weather and little level ground suitable for agriculture. While 7% of the land area of Earth is above [tpl]convert|2500|m|ft[/tpl],[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002|p=14[/tpl] only 140 million people live above that altitude[tpl]cite journal|title=Human Genetic Adaptation to High Altitude|first=Lorna G.|last=Moore|journal=High Alt Med Biol|year=2001|volume=2|issue=2|pages=257–279|doi=10.1089/152702901750265341|pmid=11443005[/tpl] and only 20-30 million people above [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft[/tpl] elevation.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/106/4/1441.long|title=The influence of high-altitude living on body iron|first1=James D.|last1=Cook|first2=Erick|last2=Boy|first3=Carol|last3=Flowers|first4=Maria|last4=del Carmen Daroca|journal=Blood|year=2005|volume=106|pages=1441–1446|doi=10.1182/blood-2004-12-4782|issue=4|pmid=15870179[/tpl]  The decreasing atmospheric pressure with increasing elevation means that less oxygen is available for breathing, and there is less protection against solar radiation (UV).[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002[/tpl] Due to decreasing oxygen, the highest known permanent habitation in the world is at [tpl]convert|5100|m|ft[/tpl], while the highest known permanently tolerable altitude is at [tpl]convert|5950|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last=West|first=JB|pmid=12631426|title=Highest permanent human habitation|journal=High Altitude Medical Biology|volume=3|pages=401–7|year=2002|doi=10.1089/15270290260512882|issue=4[/tpl] Above [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft[/tpl] elevation, there is not enough oxygen to support human life. This is known as the "death zone". The summits of Mount Everest and K2 are in the death zone.thumb|right|Ben Nevis viewed from Neptune's Staircase
About half of mountain dwellers live in the Andes, Central Asia, and Africa. Traditional mountain societies rely on agriculture, with higher risk of crop failure than at lower elevations. Minerals often occur in mountains, with mining being an important component of the economics of some montane societies. More recently, tourism supports mountain communities, with some intensive development around attractions such as national parks or ski resorts.[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002|p=17[/tpl] About 80% of mountain people live below the poverty line.
Most of the world's rivers are fed from mountain sources, with snow acting as a storage mechanism for downstream users.[tpl]sfn|Blyth|2002|p=22[/tpl] More than half of humanity depends on mountains for water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wateryear2003.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3903&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061007104411/http://www.wateryear2003.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3903&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|archivedate=7 October 2006|title=International Year of Freshwater 2003|accessdate=7 December 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mountain.org/mountains/whymtns.cfm?slidepage=water|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060709060421/http://www.mountain.org/mountains/whymtns.cfm?slidepage=water|archivedate=9 July 2006|title=The Mountain Institute|accessdate=7 December 2006[/tpl]
Mountaineering, mountain climbing, or alpinism is the sport, hobby or profession of hiking, skiing, and climbing mountains. While mountaineering began as attempts to reach the highest point of unclimbed big mountains it has branched into specializations that address different aspects of the mountain and consists of three areas: rock-craft, snow-craft and skiing, depending on whether the route chosen is over rock, snow or ice. All require experience, athletic ability, and technical knowledge to maintain safety.[tpl]cite book | edition = 7 | editor1-last= Cox|editor1-first= Steven M.|editor2-first= Kris| editor2-last=Fulsaas | title = Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | origyear = 2003 | year=2009[/tpl]

==Superlatives==

Heights of mountains are typically measured above sea level. Using this metric, Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at [tpl]convert|8848|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8608913.stm|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height |publisher=BBC News |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] There are at least 100 mountains with heights of over [tpl]convert|7200|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level, all of which are located in central and southern Asia. The highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Mount McKinley,[tpl]cite book|title=The Finest Peaks: Prominence and Other Mountain Measures |last=Helman |first=Adam |year=2005 |publisher= Trafford |isbn=1412236649 |page=9 |quote=the base to peak rise of Mount McKinley is the largest of any mountain that lies entirely above sea level, some 18,000 feet.[/tpl]  Mount Kilimanjaro and Nanga Parbat are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea ([tpl]convert|4207|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about [tpl]convert|10203|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Pacific Ocean floor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/mountains-article/ |title=Mountains: Highest Points on Earth |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=19 September 2010[/tpl]
The highest mountains are not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa ([tpl]convert|4169|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about [tpl]convert|2000|sqmi|km2|-2|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and volume (about [tpl]convert|18000|mi3|km3|-3|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]).[tpl]cite conference|last=Kaye|first=G.D.|title=Using GIS to estimate the total volume of Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002CD/finalprogram/abstract_34712.htm|booktitle=98th Annual Meeting|conference=Geological Society of America|year=2002[/tpl] Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area ([tpl]convert|245|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and volume ([tpl]convert|1150|mi3|km3|0|abbr=on||disp=or[/tpl]).  Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area ([tpl]convert|120|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]).
The highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the figure of the Earth is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several miles farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of Chimborazo, Ecuador's tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of Peru's tallest mountain, Huascarán, is another contender.  Both have elevations above sea level more than [tpl]convert|2|km|ft[/tpl] less than that of Everest.
