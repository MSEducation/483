==History==

The parish was founded by the Augustinian friars on 22 April 1906, with the first Mass occurring in a small garage on North Street near Jerome Avenue. Immediately from 1906 on, construction of a permanent church with parochial buildings on Andrew Avenue and Fordham Road commenced. The complex would consist of a two-storey "combination building," a parochial school-over-church building, along with a separate rectory. Monsignor J. F. Mooney, V.G. laid the cornerstone on 15 July 1906. the church was dedicated by Archbishop (later Cardinal) Farley on 15 September 1907. In 1914, the property was valued at $135,000. By 1914, the University Avenue and Fordham Road property that the present church stands on was purchased and being prepared. The present Collegiate Gothic church structure was built 1927 to the designs of Delaney, O'Connor & Schultz. The building has been incorrectly dated by other sources to the 1950s and early 1900s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bronx.ny1.com/content/top_stories/114803/despite-fire--bronx-church-holds-service|title=Despite Fire, Bronx Church Holds Service|date=7 March 2010|work=New York One News (NY1 News)|accessdate=10 February 2011[/tpl]
On March 5, 2010, a suspicious two-alarm blaze filled the sanctuary with flames and smoke. "The fire started in a former confessional-turned-storage room in the vestibule of the church, blocking the main entrance." The Rev. Joseph Girone evacuated worshipers through the rectory after principal exits were blocked. Some firemen were injured from a falling plaster ceiling. FDNY Deputy Chief Kevin Scanlon called the fire "suspicious" that "accelerated rapidly and it was a heavy fire that didn't have the normal flow of a fire." A string of arson attacks against Bronx churches had recently claimed the Glory of Christ Church in December 2009 in Parkchester. Despite the fire, church services were resumed at the parish school's gym, adjacent to the church.
The parish is still staffed by the Augustinian friars.

The parochial school, which opened in 1907, was run by the Augustinian Fathers and the Sisters of Charity. In 1914, the school was run by 2 Sisters of Charity and 1 lay teacher. The school had 45 male and 45 female pupils. The original school was over the church, and took over the whole building when the present church building was completed in 1927. The school has around 376 students from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.org/new-york/bronx/4344-St.-Nicholas-Of-Tolentine-Elementary-School/|title=St. Nicholas of Tolentine Elementary School|publisher=New York City Great Schools|accessdate=10 February 2011[/tpl]
