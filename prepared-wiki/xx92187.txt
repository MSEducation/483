No part of SR 327 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS).[tpl]INDOT ref|title=NHS Map|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl]  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.[tpl]INDOT ref|title=NHS|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl]  The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other State Roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 800 vehicles and 70 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between SR 120 and Michigan state line. The peak traffic volumes were 7,880 vehicles and 1,910 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of SR 327 at is concurrent with US 6.[tpl]INDOT ref|title=Traffic Counts|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

After construction of Interstate 69 and the decommissioning of US 27 in 1967, State Road 327 became the designation for the old surface route of US 27 from Garrett south to the north side of Fort Wayne. Since that time, however, State Road 327 has been truncated just south of Garrett at State Road 205.
