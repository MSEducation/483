==Plot summary==

During a stormy night, Angelica insists that the babies keep themselves preoccupied by telling a ghost story, so she starts a story revolving around a haunted house with the characters filling out the roles in the story, Chuckie portraying the main protagonist of Angelica's tale; a boy sent into the haunted house. Chuckie's character is terrified of the ghoulish inhabitants of the house, including a pair of bizarre residents played by Phil and Lil, but soon encounters a ghost (played by Tommy) who is willing to guide him through the haunted house. However, on their way to the house's upper floor, the group encounters a pack of hungry monsters (the main characters Ickis, Krumm and Oblina featured in the Nickelodeon cartoon series Aaahh!!! Real Monsters) but manage to deceive them into believing that there is chocolate pudding in the kitchen of the house so that the monsters choose the dessert over the infants.
