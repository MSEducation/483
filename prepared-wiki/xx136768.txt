==History==

South Burlingame was formed on June 7, 1910 when B.M. Lombard, in partnership with Fulton Park Land Company, recorded a replat to a [tpl]convert|272|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] section of land that was, at the time, a part of the Fulton Park District.
The original Fulton Park District was [tpl]convert|411|acre|km2[/tpl], and was formed on July 20, 1888 when Philip A. Marquam sold the land to the South West Portland Company for $150,000. It included the present day South Burlingame neighborhood as well as an eight block corridor of land that follows Terwilliger Boulevard north from Interstate 5 to Capital Highway.
Prior to 1888 the original land was part of the Thomas F. Stephens donation land claim and was purchased from him in two separate transaction in 1858 and 1868.
