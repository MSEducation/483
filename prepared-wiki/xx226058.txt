The project was started on April 14, 2005, abandoned for a while and then moved to Wikia. In November 2006, it was moved to hitchwiki.org and relaunched as Hitchwiki; at the same time versions of it in other languages were started. As of March 2012 there are 2,351 articles on the English language Hitchwiki, while the site is available in another 10 languages, such as German, Spanish, French, Finnish, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Russian. The website makes use of MediaWiki, WordPress and BuddyPress and allows anonymous edits. It's possible to log in through OpenID. Database dumps of the articles are available for download.
