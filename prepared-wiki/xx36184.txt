[[Centralizer and normalizer]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Group theory, Ring theory, Lie algebras

In mathematics, especially group theory, the centralizer of a subset S of a group G is the set of elements of G that commute with each element of S, and the normalizer of S is the set of elements of G that commute with S "as a whole". The centralizer and normalizer of S are subgroups of G, and can provide insight into the structure of G.
The definitions also apply to monoids and semigroups.
In ring theory, the centralizer of a subset of a ring is defined with respect to the semigroup (multiplication) operation of the ring. The centralizer of a subset of a ring R is a subring of R. This article also deals with centralizers and normalizers in Lie algebra.
The idealizer in a semigroup or ring is another construction that is in the same vein as the centralizer and normalizer.

==Definitions==

The centralizer of a subset S of group (or semigroup) G is defined to beJacobson (2009), p. 41
Sometimes if there is no ambiguity about the group in question, the G is suppressed from the notation entirely. When S={a} is a singleton set, then CG({a}) can be abbreviated to CG(a). Another less common notation for the centralizer is Z(a), which parallels the notation for the center of a group.  With this latter notation, one must be careful to avoid confusion between the center of a group G, Z(G), and the centralizer of an element g in G, given by Z(g).
The normalizer of S in the group (or semigroup) G is defined to be
The definitions are similar but not identical. If g is in the centralizer of S and s is in S, then it must be that [tpl]nowrap|1=gs = sg[/tpl], however if g is in the normalizer, [tpl]nowrap|1=gs = tg[/tpl] for some t in S, potentially different from s. The same conventions mentioned previously about suppressing G and suppressing braces from singleton sets also apply to the normalizer notation. The normalizer should not be confused with the normal closure.
If R is a ring or an algebra, and S is a subset of the ring, then the centralizer of S is exactly as defined for groups, with R in the place of G.
The definition of centralizers for Lie rings is linked to the definition for rings in the following way. If R is an associative ring, then R can be given the bracket product [tpl]nowrap|1=x,y = xy âˆ’ yx[/tpl]. Of course then [tpl]nowrap|1=xy = yx[/tpl] if and only if [tpl]nowrap|1=x,y = 0[/tpl]. If we denote the set R with the bracket product as LR, then clearly the ring centralizer of S in R is equal to the Lie ring centralizer of S  in LR.
