Trona's football field is all-dirt, known as "the Pit".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/18/national/18FOOT.html|title=A Shrinking Team, but a Home Field Advantage|date=2002-11-18|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] The hard dirt surface gives local players a home-field advantage, though the school's small size and the town's decreasing population means it can't always field a football team, even though they play eight-man football.http://www.cifss.org/admin/images/history_corner/20tronahs.pdf The field is watered on game day and leveled, and an annual game against Boron High School is called the Borax Bowl.
