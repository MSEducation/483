CATEGORIES: 3rd-century BC rulers

Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou ([tpl]zh|t=東周文公|p=Dōng Zhōu Wén Gōng[/tpl]) was the last ruler of the Eastern Zhou state (not to be confused with the Eastern Zhou Dynasty) of ancient China.  Eastern Zhou was a tiny splinter state of the Western Zhou state, both existing during final decades of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.
In 256 BC the State of Qin annexed the Eastern Zhou Dynasty as well as the Western Zhou state, but the Eastern Zhou state survived until 249 BC, when it was also annexed by Qin.
