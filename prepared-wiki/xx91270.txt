Victoria Helen McCrae Duncan (25 November 1897 – 6 December 1956) was a Scottish medium best known as the last person to be imprisoned under the British Witchcraft Act of 1735.

==Early life==

(Victoria) Helen MacFarlane was born in Callander, Perthshire on 25 November 1897, the daughter of a slater.[tpl]Cite book|last=Gaskill|first=Malcolm|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=January 2008|chapter=Duncan  MacFarlane, (Victoria) Helen McCrae (1897–1956)[/tpl] At school, to the distress of her mother (a member of the Presbyterian church), she alarmed her fellow pupils with her dire prophecies and hysterical behaviour. In 1916 she married Henry Duncan, a cabinet maker and wounded war veteran, who was supportive of her supposed supernatural talents. In 1926 she developed from clairvoyant to medium by offering séances in which she claimed to summon the spirits of recently deceased persons by emitting ectoplasm from her mouth. A mother of six, she also worked part-time in a bleach factory.

==Practising medium==

In 1928, the photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of séances at the house of Duncan. During a séance he took various flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged "materialization" spirits including her spirit guide "Peggy".Malcolm Gaskill. (2001). Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches. Fourth Estate. p. 100. ISBN 978-1841151090 The photographs that were taken reveal the "spirits" to be fraudulently produced, such as a doll made from a painted papier-mache mask draped in an old sheet.Jason Karl. (2007). An Illustrated History of the Haunted World. New Holland Publishers. p. 79. ISBN 978-1845376871
In 1931 the London Spiritualist Alliance examined Duncan's method. An early examination of pieces of Duncan's ectoplasm revealed it was made of cheesecloth, paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan's tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of her séances by the London Spiritualist Alliance to rule out any chance of this trick being performed and because of this no ectoplasm appeared.Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press.
In a séance on January 6, 1933 in Edinburgh, a little girl called Peggy emerged in the séance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was revealed to be made from a stockinette undervest.Renée Haynes. (1982).

Harry Price (director of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research) was skeptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as "ectoplasm".Harry Price. (1931). Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship. (Bulletin I of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, 120pp with 44 illustrations.) Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan that it was made of cheesecloth.Marina Warner. (2008). Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty-first Century. Oxford University Press. p. 299. ISBN 978-0199239238 She reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. According to Harry Price in a report of the mediumship of Duncan:
Price in his report published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audiences were spirits.Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. p. 599. ISBN 978-0879753009 Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted that the ectoplasm materializations were the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again, pretending to be a spirit in the séance room; this time Duncan and her traveling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest Homer and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.Helena Normanton. (1945). The Trial of Mrs. Duncan. Edited with a Foreword by C. E. Bechhofer Roberts.

==HMS Barham sinking==

During World War II, in November 1941, Duncan held a séance in Portsmouth at which she claimed the spirit materialization of a sailor told her the HMS Barham had been sunk. Because the sinking of the HMS Barham was revealed, in strict confidence, only to the relatives of casualties, and not announced to the public until late January 1942, the Navy started to take an interest in her activities. Two lieutenants were among her audience at a séance on 14 January 1944 and this was followed up on 19 January, when police arrested her at another séance as a white-shrouded manifestation appeared.[tpl]cite journal|last=Correspondent|title=Alleged Séance Deception|date=24 March 1944|journal=The Times|location=London|issue=49813|page=8[/tpl] This proved to be Duncan herself, in a white cloth which she attempted to conceal when discovered, and she was arrested.[tpl]cite journal|title=Alleged Séance deceptions. Further evidence for the prosecution.|last=Correspondent|date=25 March 1944|journal=The Times|location=London|issue=49814|page=2[/tpl] Researcher Graeme Donald wrote that Duncan could have easily found out about the HMS Barham and she had no genuine psychic powers. According to Donald:
A leak concerning the HMS Barham was later discovered. A secretary of the First Lord had been indiscreet to Professor Michael Postan of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Postan escaped arrest by insisting that he had made a mistake by believing the information had been imparted on an official basis.Nigel West. (2010). Historical Dictionary of Naval Intelligence. Scarecrow Press. p. 98. ISBN 978-0810867604
Duncan was found to be in possession of a mocked-up HMS Barham hat-band.[tpl]cite journal|title=British Lion, the Witch and Her Wardrobe.|last=Correspondent|date=31 January 1998|journal=The Times|location=London|issue=49814|page=2[/tpl] This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS Barham, although Duncan appeared unaware that after 1939 sailors did not wear hat-bands identifying their ship.  She was initially arrested under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, a minor offence tried by magistrates. However, the authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent "spiritual" activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan's agent who went with her to set up séances. There were seven counts in total, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of public mischief (a common law offence). The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were afraid that she could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was.Spell broken for 20th century witch. BBC, 31 January 1998 There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the Recorder noted when passing sentence.
Duncan's trial for fraudulent witchcraft was a minor cause célèbre in wartime London. A number of prominent people, among them Alfred Dodd, an historian and senior Freemason, testified they were convinced she was authentic. Duncan was, however, barred by the judge from demonstrating her alleged powers as part of her defence against being fraudulent. The jury brought in a guilty verdict on count one, and the judge then discharged them from giving verdicts on the other counts, as he held that they were alternative offences for which Duncan might have been convicted had the jury acquitted her on the first count. Duncan was imprisoned for nine months. After the verdict, Winston Churchill wrote a memo to Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, complaining about the misuse of court resources on the "obsolete tomfoolery" of the charge.[ref]

==Repeal of the Witchcraft Act==

In 1944, Duncan was one of the last people convicted under the Witchcraft Act 1735, which made falsely claiming to procure spirits a crime. She was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. When convicted, she cried out "I have done nothing; is there a God?".[tpl]cite news | title=Medium Sentenced For Fraud | newspaper=The Times | location=London, England | date=1944-04-04 | page=2 | publisher=The Times Digital Archive[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/toil-and-trouble-the-last-witch-789353.html|title=Toil and trouble: the last witch?|last=McSmith|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy McSmith|date=29 February 2008|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=London[/tpl]
On her release in 1945, Duncan promised to stop conducting séances; however, she was arrested during another one in 1956. She died at her home in Edinburgh a short time later. Duncan's trial almost certainly contributed to the repeal of the Witchcraft Act, which was contained in the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 promoted by Walter Monslow, Labour Member of Parliament for Barrow-in-Furness. The campaign to repeal the Act had largely been led by Thomas Brooks, another Labour MP, who was a spiritualist. Duncan's original conviction still stood, and it was the subject of a sustained campaign to have it overturned.[tpl]cite news|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/notoriouscriminalsfeatureseries/Fraudulent-medium-or-powerful-psychic.2672279.jp|title=Fraudulent medium or powerful psychic: the trial of a Scottish witch|last=Howie|first=Craig|date=24 October 2005|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=12 September 2011|location=Edinburgh|quote="Mediums demand pardon for the murder of Helen Duncan'.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/hellish-nell-witch-hunt-that-led-to-capture-of-fake-medium-1-1193285|title=Hellish Nell: Witch-hunt that led to capture of fake medium|date=24 February 2009|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=31 May 2012|quote=many spiritualists, who have campaigned to have her 1944 conviction quashed[/tpl]

==Death==

Contrary to what spiritualists have written there was nothing odd about the death of Duncan and it was not caused by her "trance" being disturbed by the police. Duncan's medical records showed that she had a long history of ill-health and as early as 1944 she was described as an obese woman who could only move slowly as she suffered from heart trouble.

==Dramatization==

The naval investigation and subsequent trial was dramatized as a radio play. The Last Witch Trial by Melissa Murray, starring Joanna Monro as Duncan and Indira Varma as the undercover investigator, was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 4 June 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sknzt|title=Afternoon Drama, The Last Witch Trial|work=BBC Online|accessdate=30 May 2012[/tpl]
