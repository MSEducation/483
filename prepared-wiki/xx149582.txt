Khan was born in the mid-1960s in Kolkata.[tpl]cite news|last=Saha|first=Subro|title=When angels meet, melody rules|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2004-12-29|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041229/asp/calcutta/story_4180803.asp|accessdate=2009-10-02[/tpl] As the son and disciple of Imrat Khan, he is the torchbearer of seven generations and the 400-year old tradition of Indiaâ€™s most renowned musical family. Khan has mastered not only the North Indian classical idiom but also realms as diverse as Gregorian chant, Western classical music, abstract jazz, and Flamenco. His remarkable intuition for other musical traditions has led to collaborations with the world's leading performers and composers such as John McLaughlin, Philip Glass, Paco Pena, Evelyn Glennie, and Django Bates.  
Khan has performed at major venues internationally, including Carnegie Hall and the Lincoln Center in New York, and the Royal Albert Hall in London.  In 2004, he was invited to perform alongside Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin and others at the Crossroads Guitar Festival in Dallas.  In 2007 he toured across India with violinist Vanessa Mae and in 2008 toured Europe with his pioneering Spirit & Passion featuring Flamenco guitar great Paco Pena, and later that year performed a solo concert at the BBC Proms. In 2011 he composed his first Bollywood film score, "Yeh Saali Zindagi", for the acclaimed director Sudhir Mishra and in 2013, the Indian Government commissioned him to write a 70-minute orchestral score for the Indian classic silent film, 'A Throw of Dice'. The work was commissioned especially for performance at the Centenary Film Festival, which celebrates 100 years of Indian cinema. Later in 2013 he premiered his The Gate of the Moon (Sitar Concerto No 1) at the BBC Proms with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and David Atherton.
Khan is based in Beverly Hills, California, and works as a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
