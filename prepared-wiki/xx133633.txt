[[Stade Aline Sitoe Diatta]]

CATEGORIES: Football venues in Senegal, Ziguinchor, French West Africa

Stade Aline Sitoe Diatta is a multi-use stadium in Ziguinchor, Senegal. It was named after Aline Sitoe Diatta, a Diola woman regarded by many as the only woman who stood against the colonialist push into Casamance. It is currently used mostly for football matches and serves as a home ground of Casa Sport. The stadium holds 10,000 people, and was built to host the 1992 African Cup of Nations.
Located in the northern part of the city of Ziguinchor, it has been plagued by its poor pitch, because the stadium was built on what used to be a rice field, rendering it unusable during the rainy season. However, recent efforts by local authorities to change the pitch into a synthetic turf were successful.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.xibar.net/La-pelouse-synthetique-du-stade-Aline-Sitoe-Diatta-receptionnee-mardi_a11715.html | title = La pelouse synthétique du stade Aline Sitoë Diatta réceptionnée mardi | work = APS | date = [tpl]date|2008-07-11[/tpl] | accessdate = [tpl]date|2012-06-14[/tpl] [/tpl]
