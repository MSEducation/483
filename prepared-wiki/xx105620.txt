CATEGORIES: Waterfalls of Uganda, Nile

Murchison Falls, also known as Kabarega Falls, is a waterfall on the Nile. It breaks the Victoria Nile, which flows across northern Uganda from Lake Victoria to Lake Kyoga and then to the north end of Lake Albert in the western branch of the East African Rift. At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks, only [tpl]convert|7|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and tumbles [tpl]convert|43|m|ft[/tpl], then flows westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000 ft³/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than ten metres (30 ft) wide.
Sir Samuel Baker  named them after Sir Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society.Encyclopædia Britannica online   The falls lend their name to the surrounding Murchison Falls National Park.
