The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ 

==Issues==

===Cairo Programme of Action implementation===

Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the human rights-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting feminist language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice. In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.[tpl]cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights [/tpl]

===Abortion===

Lara Knudsen, a pro-choice activist, has suggested that "twenty percent of all pregnancies worldwide end in abortion, and nearly half of those abortions are unsafe and often illegal."[tpl]cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=1–2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights [/tpl] According to the WHO, more than 45 million (legal and illegal) abortions take place annually. At the same time, approximately 66,500 women die from the complications of unsafe abortion every year.According to data repeatedly published by Ipas[tpl]Nonspecific|date=June 2010[/tpl].
An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "fundamental right of women, irrespective of where they live" and unsafe abortion a "silent pandemic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16[/tpl] The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent public-health and human-rights imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves women’s health, and vice versa, as documented in Romania during the regime of President Nicolae Ceaușescu" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:
When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.[tpl]cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights [/tpl]
On April 18, 2008 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html
During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference. 
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:
“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, 'which makes no reference to abortion'.”European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)
With regard to the US, it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:
“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60
Some years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: “nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”.Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005 She added: “There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”.Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005
Collaborative research from the Institute of Development Studies states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to international development".[tpl]cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3[/tpl] The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.
Meanwhile, however the European Court of Human Rights settled the question through a landmark judgment (case of A. B. and C. v. Ireland), in which it is stated that the European Convention on Human Rights does not contain a right to abortion.

===Population control===

Compulsory or forced sterilizations and abortions may also occur in the context of population control policies.
From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.[tpl]cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights [/tpl] At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.[tpl]cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=0-8265-1528-2 |pages=4–5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&dq=reproductive+rights [/tpl]  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment conspiracy theories about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a racist agenda of eugenics, and of trying to reduce the African American birth rate in the U.S.[tpl]Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = New York Times | date = February 26, 2010 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = [/tpl]

===Sperm donation===

Laws in many countries and states require sperm donors to be either anonymous or known to the recipient, or the laws restrict the number of children each donor may father. Although many donors choose to remain anonymous, new technologies such as the Internet and DNA technology have opened up new avenues for those wishing to know more about the biological father, siblings and half-siblings.

===Compulsory sterilization===

====Roma women====

During the 20th century, forced sterilization of Roma women in European countries, especially in former Communist countries, was practiced,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8375960.stmhttp://popdev.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/u4763/DT%2071%20Albert.pdf and there are allegations that these practices continue unofficially in some countries, such as Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6409699.stmhttp://www.romea.cz/en/news/czech/kocab-draws-attention-to-the-forced-sterilization-of-romani-women-most-recent-incident-allegedly-took-place-in-2007 In V. C. vs. Slovakia, the European Court for Human Rights ruled in favor of a Roma woman who was the victim of forced sterilization in a state hospital in Slovakia in 2000.http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-107364#{%22itemid%22:%22001-107364%22}

====United States====

An individual’s sterilization is one of the main issues behind the reproductive rights that are being ignored by those who believe that they have a right to decide whether certain people are "fit" to have children. The mental stability of an individual and the physical defects that an individual might have played an important role in the beginnings of forced sterilization. Individuals were afraid that these defects were hereditary and wanted to put a stop to it before society became incompetent. Although there are numerous operations which may render one sterile, vasectomy in the male and salpingectomy in the female are considered the least radical. Neither operation is considered dangerous.[tpl]cite journal|last=Oswald|first=Frances|title=Eugenical Sterilization in the United States|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=July 1930|volume=36|issue=1|pages=65–73[/tpl]  The laws of the states in which sterilization is practiced vary. Numerous provisions have been made both by the United States and by individual states for limiting the number of degenerates in this country. The creation of voluntary programs such as Planned Parenthood (presented the use of abstinence and contraceptives as forms of controlling the population growth) were introduced to help families control their birth rate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dombroff|first=Robert M.|coauthors=Harris T. Lifshitz|title=Overpopulation: No Strength in Numbers|journal=Family Law Quarterly|year=1972|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93–144[/tpl]
Sterilization has long been a controversial topic in the United States. Up through 1970s, states could choose which women were allowed the procedure and which women were not eligible. This strategy proved repressive, both for women who wished to become sterilized and were not granted the right as well as for women who had no choice but to become sterilized. At the time as well as today, sterilization was a form of birth control highly sought after by some women. However, until the 1960s, it was illegal for women to become sterilized for reasons other than eugenics, which meant sterilization as birth control was illegal. This left many women with highly legitimate reasons for sterilization unable to receive the procedure. It also meant most women who were undergoing the procedure were getting it for non-birth control reasons and not by choice.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schoen|first=Johanna|title=Between Choice and Coercion: Women and the Politics of Sterilization in North Carolina, 1929-1975|journal=Journal of Women's History|year=2001|volume=13|issue=1|pages=132–156[/tpl]
Additionally, both compulsory and coercive sterilization has become an issue of unconstitutionality because some argue that it violates an individual’s ‘right to procreate’. In 1972 Eisenstadt v. Baird set the precedent: “the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision to bear or beget a child”. Yet, sterilization is still being used in court sentencing for both men and women in cases involving child abuse and/or neglect, drug abuse, and other criminal activity. The relationship between reproductive rights and sterilization is also visible in hospital settings where doctors have been documented as ordering women, namely low-income women of color, to consent to sterilization or else they will not be provided with birthing services.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carey|first=Allison C.|title=Gender and compulsory sterilization programs in America: 1907-1950|journal=Journal of Historical Sociology|year=1998|volume=11|issue=1|pages=74–105[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Roth|first=Rachel|title=No New Babies-Gender Inequality and Reproductive Control in the Criminal Justice and Prison Systems|journal=Am.

==Criticisms==

Some opponents of legalized abortion view the term "reproductive rights" as a euphemism to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  National Right to Life has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for abortion rights."[tpl]cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|year=2003[/tpl]
