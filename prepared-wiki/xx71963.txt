Rafi is noted for his ability to sing songs of different moods and varieties: They ranged from classical numbers to patriotic songs, sad lamentations to highly romantic numbers, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans. He is best known for romantic and duet songs and, as a playback singer, his ability to mould his voice to the persona of the actor lip-synching the song.[tpl]cite book| title=Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1-5| publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica (India)| page=238| url=http://books.google.ae/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=mohammed+rafi,+britannica+encyclopedia&source=bl&ots=1xRIrHUvoy&sig=Gm0XmcBFYPeNwB1ReXRy_W6VmPc&hl=en&ei=2KN1TqHmA5S0hAeDwsCbDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=rafi&f=false| isbn=0-85229-760-2| accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl]

==Early years and background==

Mohammed Rafi was the fifth youngest of six brothers. The sixth youngest Mohammad Siddique is still alive and lives in Lahore, Pakistan in their ancestral house.  His father was Hajji Ali Mohammad. The family originally belonged to Kotla Sultan Singh, a village near present-day Amritsar in Punjab, India.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060223/aplus.htm#1 | title=Striking the right chord| author=Varinder Walia | publisher=The Tribune: Amritsar Plus | date=2003-06-16 | accessdate=2007-04-28[/tpl] Rafi, whose nickname was Pheeko, began singing by imitating the chants of a fakir in the streets of Bhati gate Lahore where his family lived . Rafi's father moved to Lahore in the 1920s. His elder brother, Mohammad Deen, had a friend, Abdul Hameed, (future brother-in-law), who recognised the talent in Rafi in Lahore and encouraged him to sing. Abdul Hameed later convinced the family elders to let Rafi move to Mumbai; he accompanied him in 1944.
Rafi learnt classical music from Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami.[ref]
