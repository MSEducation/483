[[Nori]]

[tpl]Nihongo|Nori|海苔[/tpl] is the Japanese name for edible seaweed species of the red algae genus Porphyra, including P. yezoensis and P. tenera. It is called laver in Wales and other English-speaking countries,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nori |title=Nori |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl] though the popularity of sushi in the United States  means that the United States is often an exception to this, either referring to the product as "nori" as the Japanese do, or simply as seaweed. Finished products are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking.

==History==

Originally, the term nori was generic and referred to seaweeds including hijiki.[tpl]cite book|title= Kodansha encyclopedia of Japan|volume=6|publisher=Kōdansha|isbn= 0-87011-620-7|year=1983 |page=37|quote=The word nori is used in Japan both as a general term for seaweed and as a name for a species of red algae (Porphyra tenera) that is commonly used as a foodstuff and is also known as asakusa- nori.[/tpl] One of the oldest descriptions of nori is dated to around the 8th century. In the Taihō Code enacted in 701, nori was already included in the form of taxation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nisizawa|first=Kazutosi|coauthors=Noda, Hiroyuki; Kikuchi, Ryo; Watanabe, Tadaharu|title=The main seaweed foods in Japan|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=September 1987|volume=151-152|issue=1|page=5|doi=10.1007/BF00046102|accessdate=25 March 2013|quote=In the Law of Taiho (AD 701) which was established by the Emperor at that time, marine algae such as Laminaria, Undaria and its sporophyll, Porphyra and Gelidium are included among marine products which were paid to the Court as tax.[/tpl] Local people have been described as drying nori in Hitachi Province Fudoki (721–721), and nori was harvested in Izumo Province Fudoki (713–733), showing that nori was used as food from ancient times.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=vQc3AAAAMAAJ|quote=There is a description "local people were drying nori" in Hitachi Province Fudoki (721–721), and also there is a description "nori was harvested" in Izumo Province Fudoki (713–733). These show nori was used as food from ancient times.|title= 和漢古典植物考 (Japanese and Chinese Classical Botany)|first=Terayama |last=Hiroshi| publisher=asaka Shobō|year= 2003 |page=588[/tpl] In Utsubo Monogatari, written around 987, nori was recognized as a common food. The original nori was formed as a paste,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] and the sheet form was invented in Asakusa, Edo (contemporary Tokyo), in the Edo period through the method of Japanese paper-making.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=43puKgiAK2YC&pg=PA128|title=The Japanese kitchen: 250 recipes in a traditional spirit|first= Hiroko |last=Shimbo |publisher= Harvard Common Press|year= 2001 |isbn= 1-55832-177-2 |page=128[/tpl]
The word "nori" first appeared in an English-language publication in C. P. Thunberg's Trav., published in 1796.[tpl]cite web|title=Nori|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/128255|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition|accessdate=25 March 2013|date=September 2012[/tpl] It was used in conjugation as "Awa nori", probably referring to what is now called aonori.
The word nori started to be used widely in the United States, and the product (imported in dry form from Japan) became widely available at natural food stores and Asian-American grocery stores in the 1960s due to the influence of the macrobiotic movement, and in the 1970s with the growing number of sushi bars and Japanese restaurants.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In one study by Jan-Hendrik Hehemann, subjects of Japanese descent have been shown to be able to digest the polysaccharide of the seaweed, after gut microbes developed the enzyme from marine bacteria. Gut microbes from the North American subjects lacked these enzymes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hehemann|first=Jan-Hendrik|coauthors=Correc, Gaëlle; Barbeyron, Tristan; Helbert, William; Czjzek, Mirjam; Michel, Gurvan|title=Transfer of carbohydrate-active enzymes from marine bacteria to Japanese gut microbiota|journal=Nature|date=April 2010|volume=464|doi=10.1038/nature08937|pmid=20376150[/tpl]

==Production==

Production and processing of nori is an advanced form of agriculture. The biology of Porphyra, although complicated, is well understood, and this knowledge is used to control the production process. Farming takes place in the sea where the Porphyra plants grow attached to nets suspended at the sea surface and where the farmers operate from boats. The plants grow rapidly, requiring about 45 days from "seeding" until the first harvest. Multiple harvests can be taken from a single seeding, typically at about ten-day intervals. Harvesting is accomplished using mechanical harvesters of a variety of configurations. Processing of raw product is mostly accomplished by highly automated machines that accurately duplicate traditional manual processing steps, but with much improved efficiency and consistency. The final product is a paper-thin, black, dried sheet of approximately [tpl]convert|18|×|20|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|3|g[/tpl] in weight.
Several grades of nori are available in the United States.  The most common, and least expensive, grades are imported from China, costing about six cents per sheet.  At the high end, ranging up to 90 cents per sheet, are "delicate shin-nori" (nori from the first of the year's several harvests) cultivated in Ariake Sea, off the island of Kyushu in Japan".[tpl]cite news|last=Goode |first=J.J. |title=Nori Steps Away From the Sushi |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 9, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/dining/09nori.html?pagewanted=2 |accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl]
In Japan, over [tpl]convert|600|km2|mi2[/tpl] of Japanese coastal waters are given to producing [tpl]convert|350000|t|LT[/tpl] of nori, worth over a billion dollars. China produces about a third of this amount.[tpl]cite book|last=Thomas|first=David|title=Seaweeds|year=2002|publisher=Natural History Museum|location=London, England|isbn=0-565-09175-1[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Use==

Nori is commonly used as a wrap for sushi and onigiri.  It is also a garnish or flavoring in noodle preparations and soups. It is most typically toasted prior to consumption (yaki-nori). A common secondary product is toasted and flavored nori (ajitsuke-nori), in which a flavoring mixture (variable, but typically soy sauce, sugar, sake, mirin, and seasonings) is applied in combination with the toasting process.[tpl]cite book |title=The Book of Tofu: Food for Mankind, Volume 1 |first1=William |last1=Shurtleff |first2=Akiko |last2=Aoyagi |publisher=Soyinfo Center |year=1975 |isbn=0394734319 |url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=7rmfYjEYyu8C&pg=PA327&dq=%22ajitsuke-nori%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22ajitsuke-nori%22&f=false |page=327[/tpl] It is also eaten by making it into a soy sauce-flavored paste, nori no tsukudani ([tpl]lang|ja|海苔の佃煮[/tpl]).
Nori is sometimes used as a form of food decoration.
A related product, prepared from the unrelated green algae Monostroma and Enteromorpha, is called aonori ([tpl]lang|ja|青海苔[/tpl] literally blue/green nori) and is used like herbs on everyday meals, such as okonomiyaki and yakisoba.
Since nori sheets easily absorb water from the air and degrade, a desiccant is indispensable when storing it.

==Nutrition==

Nori is about one-third protein and one-third dietary fiber, and contains high proportions of iodine, vitamins A, B, and K, and iron.
