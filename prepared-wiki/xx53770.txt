Tramadol (marketed as the hydrochloride salt by Janssen Pharmaceutica as Ultram in the United States, Ralivia by Biovail in Canada and many other companies throughout the world) is a centrally-acting atypical opioid analgesic with additional serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake-inhibiting effects used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. It was launched and marketed as Tramal by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH in 1977 in West Germany, even though it would take another 20 years for it to be launched in English-speaking countries such as the UK, US and Australia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Leppert|first=W|title=Tramadol as an analgesic for mild to moderate cancer pain.|journal=Pharmacological reports|date=November–December 2009|volume=61|issue=6|pages=978–92|pmid=20081232|url=http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2009/6_978.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1016/s1734-1140(09)70159-8[/tpl]
Tramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both R and S stereoisomers. This is because the two isomers complement each other's analgesic activity. It is often combined with paracetamol as this is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Tramadol is an atypical opioid because it is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor of and, by itself, a fairly weak μ-opioid receptor agonist.[tpl]cite journal|author = Reimann W, Schneider F|title = Induction of 5-hydroxytryptamine release by tramadol, fenfluramine and reserpine|journal = European Journal of Pharmacology|volume = 349|issue = 2–3|pages = 199–203|year = 1998|pmid = 9671098|doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00195-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gobbi M, Moia M, Pirona L, et al. |title=p-Methylthioamphetamine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine, two non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasers in vivo, differ from neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives in their mode of action at 5-HT nerve endings in vitro |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=1435–43 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12354291 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01073.x[/tpl] Tramadol is metabolised to O-desmethyltramadol, which is a significantly more potent opioid with additional norepinephrine reuptake-inhibiting properties, making it analogous to tapentadol.[tpl]cite journal|last=Raffa|first=RB|coauthors=Buschmann, H; Christoph, T; Eichenbaum, G; Englberger, W; Flores, CM; Hertrampf, T; Kögel, B; Schiene, K; Straßburger, W; Terlinden, R; Tzschentke, TM|title=Mechanistic and functional differentiation of tapentadol and tramadol.|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date=July 2012|volume=13|issue=10|pages=1437–49|doi=10.1517/14656566.2012.696097|pmid=22698264[/tpl] The onset of pain relief, usually occurs, when taken as an immediate-release oral formulation, within about an hour.[tpl]cite journal|last=Katz|first=WA|title=Pharmacology and clinical experience with tramadol in osteoarthritis.|journal=Drugs|year=1996|volume=52 Suppl 3|pages=39–47|doi=10.2165/00003495-199600523-00007|pmid=8911798[/tpl]
Despite the original belief that tramadol was a purely synthetic opioid it has been recently found in a South African tree.

==Medical uses==

Tramadol is used primarily to treat moderate-severe pain, both acute and chronic.[tpl]cite journal|last=Grond|first=S|coauthors=Sablotzki, A|title=Clinical pharmacology of tramadol.|journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics|year=2004|volume=43|issue=13|pages=879–923|doi=10.2165/00003088-200443130-00004|pmid=15509185[/tpl] Tramadol is recommended for the management of pain in fibromyalgia by the European League Against Rheumatism.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carville|first=SF|coauthors=Arendt-Nielsen, S; Bliddal, H; Blotman, F; Branco, JC; Buskila, D; Da Silva, JA; Danneskiold-Samsøe, B; Dincer, F; Henriksson, C; Henriksson, KG; Kosek, E; Longley, K; McCarthy, GM; Perrot, S; Puszczewicz, M; Sarzi-Puttini, P; Silman, A; Späth, M; Choy, EH; EULAR,|title=EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome.|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=April 2008|volume=67|issue=4|pages=536–41|doi=10.1136/ard.2007.071522|pmid=17644548[/tpl] Its analgesic effects take about one hour to come into effect and 2–4 hours to peak after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis tramadol has about one-tenth the potency of morphine and is approximately equally potent when compared to pethidine and codeine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lee|first=CR|coauthors=McTavish, D; Sorkin, EM|title=Tramadol. A preliminary review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential in acute and chronic pain states.|journal=Drugs|date=August 1993|volume=46|issue=2|pages=313–40|doi=10.2165/00003495-199346020-00008|pmid=7691519[/tpl] For pain moderate in severity its effectiveness is equivalent to that of morphine; for severe pain it is less effective than morphine. These painkilling effects peak at about 3 hours, post-oral administration and last for approximately 6 hours. These analgesic effects are only partially reversed by naloxone, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole contributing factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2 adrenergic receptor antagonists like yohimbine and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron. Pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to levorphanol and tapentadol in that it not only binds to the mu opioid receptor, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its "atypical" opioid activity.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16762426 |year=2006 |last1=Micó |first1=JA |last2=Ardid |last3=Berrocoso |last4=Eschalier |title=Antidepressants and pain |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=348–54 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.004 |journal=Trends in pharmacological sciences |first2=D |first3=E |first4=A[/tpl]
Available dosage forms include capsules, tablets, including extended release formulations and injections.

===Investigational uses===

===Use in special populations===

====Pregnancy and lactation====

Its use in pregnancy is generally advised against as it may cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bloor|first=M|coauthors=Paech, MJ; Kaye, R|title=Tramadol in pregnancy and lactation.|journal=International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia|date=April 2012|volume=21|issue=2|pages=163–7|doi=10.1016/j.ijoa.2011.10.008|pmid=22317891[/tpl] Despite this a small prospective study in France found that while there was an increased risk of miscarriages there were no major malformations reported in the newborn. Its use during lactation is also generally advised against but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.88% of the dose the mothers were taking and despite this there was no evidence of this dose having a harmful effect on the newborn.

====Labour and delivery====

Its use as an analgesic during labour is generally advised against due to its long-onset of action (one hour). The ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the foetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labour pains has been estimated to be 94.

====Children====

Its use in children is generally advised against, although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist.

====Elderly====

There is an increased risk of opioid-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, falls, cognitive impairment and sedation.

====Liver and kidney failure====

It is advised that the drug be used with caution in those with liver or kidney failure, due to the high dependence of the drug on the liver and kidneys for metabolism to O-desmethyltramadol and elimination, respectively.

==Adverse effects==

Summary 
The most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and headache.[tpl]cite journal|last=Langley|first=PC|coauthors=Patkar, AD; Boswell, KA; Benson, CJ; Schein, JR|title=Adverse event profile of tramadol in recent clinical studies of chronic osteoarthritis pain.|journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion|date=January 2010|volume=26|issue=1|pages=239–51|doi=10.1185/03007990903426787|pmid=19929615|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0030170/[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Keating|first=GM|title=Tramadol sustained-release capsules.|journal=Drugs|year=2006|volume=66|issue=2|pages=223–30|doi=10.2165/00003495-200666020-00006|pmid=16451094[/tpl] Compared to other opioids respiratory depression and constipation is considered less of a problem with tramadol.

===Interactions===

Its serotonergic effects enable it to interact, potentially fatally, with other serotonergics such as antidepressants (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors, etc.), certain analgesics (such as pethidine (meperidine), tapentadol, oxycodone, dextromethorphan and fentanyl), certain anxiolytics (such as the SSRIs and buspirone), certain antibiotics (namely, linezolid and isoniazid), certain herbs (e.g. St. John's wort, syrian rue, passiflora, etc.), certain recreational drugs (e.g. MDMA), phentermine, lithium, methylene blue and numerous other therapeutic agents. As it is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, hence any agents with the ability to inhibit or induce these enzymes will likely interact with tramadol.

===Contraindications===

Its use is advised against in people lacking any CYP2D6 enzymes (which accounts for about 6-10% of Caucasians and 1-2% of Asians) as they are crucial to the therapeutic effects of tramadol, by means of enabling tramadol's metabolism to O-desmethyltramadol.

===Overdosage===

Fatalities with tramadol overdose have been reported and are increasing in frequency in Northern Ireland; the majority of these overdoses involve other drugs including alcohol.[tpl]cite journal|last=Randall|first=C|coauthors=Crane, J|title=Tramadol deaths in Northern Ireland: A review of cases from 1996 to 2012.|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|date=March 2014|volume=23C|pages=32–36|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2014.01.006|pmid=24661703[/tpl] Recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include depression, male gender, addiction and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.

===Physical dependence and withdrawal===

Long-term use of high doses of tramadol may be associated with physical dependence and a withdrawal syndrome.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=12563592 |doi=10.1053/ajem.2003.50039 |year=2003 |last1=Barsotti |first1=CE |last2=Mycyk |last3=Reyes |title=Withdrawal syndrome from tramadol hydrochloride |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=87–8 |journal=The American journal of emergency medicine |first2=MB |first3=J[/tpl] The atypical withdrawal symptoms are probably related to tramadol's effect on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.[tpl]cite journal|last=Epstein|first=DH|coauthors=Preston, KL; Jasinski, DR|title=Abuse liability, behavioral pharmacology, and physical-dependence potential of opioids in humans and laboratory animals: lessons from tramadol.|journal=Biological Psychology|date=July 2006|volume=73|issue=1|pages=90–9|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.01.010|pmid=16497429|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943845/pdf/nihms233690.pdf|format=PDF|pmc=2943845[/tpl] Symptoms may include those of SSRI discontinuation syndrome, such as anxiety, depression, anguish, severe mood swings, aggressiveness, brain "zaps", electric-shock-like sensations throughout the body, paresthesias, sweating, palpitations, restless legs syndrome, sneezing, insomnia, vivid dreams or nightmares, micropsia and/or macropsia, tremors, and headache among others. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal lasts longer than that of other opioids; seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically three or four days for other codeine analogues. It is recommended that those physically dependent on pain killers take their medication regularly to prevent onset of withdrawal symptoms and this is particularly relevant to tramadol because of its SNRI properties and, when the time comes to discontinue their tramadol, they do so gradually over a period of time that will vary according to the individual, dose and length of time on the drug.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=18704211 |year=2008 |last1=Choong |first1=K |last2=Ghiculescu |title=Iatrogenic neuropsychiatric syndromes |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=627–9 |journal=Australian family physician |first2=RA[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=15569913 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2326 |year=2004 |last1=Ripamonti |first1=C |last2=Fagnoni |last3=De Conno |title=Withdrawal syndrome after delayed tramadol intake |volume=161 |issue=12 |pages=2326–7 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |first2=E |first3=F[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=12825576 |year=2003 |title=Withdrawal syndrome and dependence: tramadol too |volume=12 |issue=65 |pages=99–100 |journal=Prescrire international[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=12633909 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(02)00321-6 |year=2003 |last1=Senay |first1=EC |last2=Adams |last3=Geller |last4=Inciardi |last5=Muñoz |last6=Schnoll |last7=Woody |last8=Cicero |title=Physical dependence on Ultram (tramadol hydrochloride): both opioid-like and atypical withdrawal symptoms occur |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=233–41 |journal=Drug and alcohol dependence |first2=EH |first3=A |first4=JA |first5=A |first6=SH |first7=GE |first8=TJ[/tpl]

===Psychological dependence and recreational use===

Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16615669 |doi=10.1080/1556365050014418 |year=2006 |last1=Jovanović-Cupić |first1=V |last2=Martinović |last3=Nesić |title=Seizures associated with intoxication and abuse of tramadol |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=143–6 |journal=Clinical toxicology |first2=Z |first3=N[/tpl] Tramadol can cause a higher incidence of nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite compared with opiates, which could deter abuse.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=17298254 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2006.0117 |year=2007 |author=Rodriguez RF, Bravo LE, Castro F, Montoya O, Castillo JM, Castillo MP, Daza P, Restrepo JM, Rodriguez MF|title=Incidence of weak opioids adverse events in the management of cancer pain: a double-blind comparative trial |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=56–60 |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine[/tpl] Compared to hydrocodone, fewer persons choose to abuse tramadol.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2005.10.006 |url=http://paincenter.wustl.edu/c/BasicResearch/documents/CiceroJPain2006.pdf |pmid=16716877 |year=2006 |last1=Adams |first1=EH |last2=Breiner |first2=S |last3=Cicero |first3=TJ |last4=Geller |first4=A |last5=Inciardi |first5=JA |last6=Schnoll |first6=SH |last7=Senay |first7=EC |last8=Woody |first8=GE |title=A Comparison of the Abuse Liability of Tramadol, NSAIDs, and Hydrocodone in Patients with Chronic Pain |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=465–76 |journal=Journal of pain and symptom management[/tpl] It may also have a large effect on sleeping patterns and high doses may cause insomnia. (Especially for those on methadone, both for maintenance and recreation. Though there is no scientific proof tramadol lessens effects of opiates or is a mixed agonist-antagonist, some people get the impression it is, while someone else might benefit being prescribed both for pain and breakthrough pain.)[tpl]cite journal |pmid=18557165 |year=2008 |last1=Vorsanger |first1=GJ |last2=Xiang |last3=Gana |last4=Pascual |last5=Fleming |title=Extended-release tramadol (tramadol ER) in the treatment of chronic low back pain |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=87–97 |journal=Journal of opioid management |first2=J |first3=TJ |first4=ML |first5=RR[/tpl]

===Detection in biological fluids===

Tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol may be quantified in blood, plasma or serum to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantitate these substances. The concentrations of O-desmethyltramadol in the blood or plasma of a person who has taken tramadol are generally 10–20% those of the parent drug.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=17575561|year=2007|last1=Karhu|first1=D|last2=El-Jammal|first2=A|last3=Dupain|first3=T|last4=Gaulin|first4=D|last5=Bouchard|first5=S|title=Pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of three Tramadol Contramid OAD tablet strengths|volume=28|issue=6|pages=323–30|doi=10.1002/bdd.561|journal=Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|pmid=17350197|year=2007|last1=Tjäderborn|first1=M|last2=Jönsson|first2=AK|last3=Hägg|first3=S|last4=Ahlner|first4=J|title=Fatal unintentional intoxications with tramadol during 1995–2005|volume=173|issue=2–3|pages=107–11|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.02.007|journal=Forensic Science International[/tpl]Baselt, R.

The chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature.Pharmaceutical Substances, Axel Kleemann, Jürgen Engel, Bernd Kutscher and Dieter Reichert, 4. ed. (2000) 2 volumes, Thieme-Verlag Stuttgart (Germany), p. 2085 bis 2086, ISBN 978-1-58890-031-9; since 2003 online with biannual actualizations. Tramadol 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol has two stereogenic centers at the cyclohexane ring. Thus, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol may exist in four different configurational forms:
The synthetic pathway leads to the racemate (1:1 mixture) of (1R,2R)-isomer and the (1S,2S)-isomer as the main products. Minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the (1R,2S)-isomer and the (1S,2R)-isomer are formed as well. The isolation of the (1R,2R)-isomer and the (1S,2S)-isomer from the diastereomeric minor racemate and (1S,2R)-isomer is realized by the recrystallization of the hydrochlorides.
The drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydrochlorides of the (1R,2R)-(+)- and the (1S,2S)-(–)-enantiomers.
The resolution of the racemate / (1S,2S)-(–)-isomer was described[tpl]cite journal|last1 = Zynovy|first1 =  Zinovy| last2 = Meckler|first2 = Harold|year = 2000| title = A Practical Procedure for the Resolution of (+)- and (−)-Tramadol|journal = Organic Process Research & Development|volume = 4| doi = 10.1021/op000281v|issue =4|pages = 291–294[/tpl] employing (R)-(–)- or (S)-(+)-mandelic acid.

Tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-HT2C receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT2C could be partially responsible for tramadol's reducing effect on depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=15105221 |year=2004 |last1=Ogata |first1=J |last2=Minami |last3=Uezono |last4=Okamoto |last5=Shiraishi |last6=Shigematsu |last7=Ueta |title=The inhibitory effects of tramadol on 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=1401–6, table of contents |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |first2=K |first3=Y |first4=T |first5=M |first6=A |first7=Y |doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000108963.77623.A4[/tpl] 5-HT2C blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-HT2C knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol's putative inhibition of GABA-A receptors at high doses.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, being O- and N-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, O-desmethyltramadol is the most significant since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours, compared with six hours for tramadol itself. As with codeine, in the 6% of the population that have reduced CYP2D6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), there is therefore a reduced analgesic effect. Those with decreased CYP2D6 activity will experience less analgesia. Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Grond S, Sablotzki A |title=Clinical pharmacology of tramadol |journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics |volume=43 |issue=13 |pages=879–923 |year=2004 |pmid= 15509185|doi=10.2165/00003088-200443130-00004[/tpl]
Its volume of distribution is approximately, 306 L after oral administration and 203 L after parenteral administration.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tramadol in March 1995 and an extended-release (ER) formulation in September 2005.[tpl]cite journal|title=Tramadol extended-release in the management of chronic pain |pmc=2386353|year=2007|volume=3|issue=3|pmid=18488071|pages=401–10|journal=Therapeutics and clinical risk management[/tpl] It is covered by U.S. patents nos. 6,254,887[tpl]Ref patent |country=US |number=6254887 |status=patent |title=Controlled Release Tramadol |gdate=3 July 2001 |inventor=Miller, Ronald Brown, et al.[/tpl] and 7,074,430.FDA AccessData entry for Tramadol Hydrochloride.

However, in August 2009, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled the patents invalid, which, if it survives appeal, would permit manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of Ultram ER in the United States.[tpl]cite press release |title=Par Pharmaceutical Wins on Invalidity in Ultram(R) ER Litigation |publisher=Par Pharmaceutical |date=17 August 2009 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/par-pharmaceutical-wins-on-invalidity-in-ultramr-er-litigation-62235432.html[/tpl]
In November 2013, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration initiated classification of Tramadol as a schedule IV controlled substance, pending a review process.http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2013/fr1104.htm Docket No. DEA-351: Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Tramadol Into Schedule IV Several states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wyoming and the U.S. military have classified Tramadol as a schedule IV controlled substance under state law.TRAMADOL (Trade Names: Ultram®, Ultracet®). Drug Enforcement Administration (February 2011)Tennessee News: Tramadol and Carisoprodol Now Classified Schedule IV – News – National Association of Boards of Pharmacy® (NABP®). Nabp.net (8 June 2011). Retrieved on 2012-12-26.
Thus, tramadol is classified as a Schedule 4 in the US, Schedule 4 in Australia rather than as a Schedule 8 Controlled Drug like opioids.[tpl]cite isbn|9780980579093[/tpl] Similarly, unlike opioid analgesics, tramadol is not currently scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.   However, it is controlled in certain states.[tpl]cite press release |title = Tramadol Listed as Schedule IV Substance in Kentucky |publisher=Kentucky Board of Pharmacy |date=8 December 2008 |url=http://pharmacy.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/9A7E27E4-1D37-4F44-A542-C9DD5B487822/0/TramadolNotification.pdf |accessdate=8 February 2009[/tpl]
Sweden, as of May 2008, has chosen to classify tramadol as a controlled substance in the same way as codeine and dextropropoxyphene. This means that the substance is a scheduled drug. But unlike codeine and dextropropoxyphene, a normal prescription can be used at this time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/Tpl/NewsPage7342.aspx |title=Substansen tramadol nu narkotikaklassad på samma sätt som kodein och dextropropoxifen – Läkemedelsverket |publisher=Lakemedelsverket.se |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2010[/tpl]

===Brand names===

Grünenthal GmbH, which still owns the patent on tramadol, has cross-licensed the drug to pharmaceutical companies internationally. Thus, tramadol is marketed under many trade names around the world, including:

==Veterinary medicine==

Tramadol may be used to treat post-operative, injury-related, and chronic (e.g., cancer-related) pain in dogs and cats as well as rabbits, coatis, many small mammals including rats and flying squirrels, guinea pigs, ferrets, and raccoons.[tpl]cite journal|last=Souza|first=MJ|coauthors=Cox, SK|title=Tramadol use in zoologic medicine.|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America|date=January 2011|volume=14|issue=1|pages=117–30|doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2010.09.005|pmid=21074707[/tpl]

==Pin cushion tree==

In 2013, researchers discovered that tramadol is also produced naturally in relatively high concentrations (1%+) in the roots of the African pin cushion tree (Nauclea latifolia).
