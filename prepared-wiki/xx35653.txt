EuroNat is an organisation of European nationalist political parties, formed initially at the congress of the French National Front (FN) in Strasbourg on 30 March 1997.Mareš, 2006, p. 11. It had a loose organisational structure, and was in practice based on coordination by activities of the FN. The organisation failed to attract much support in Western Europe, as FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was more successful in gathering support in Eastern Europe. NordNat was an attempt to form a regional organisation by Nordic parties. As of the late 2000s, only the FN, BNP, ND, MS-FT, DN and NR parties were listed as members of EuroNat.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://euronat.org/|work=EuroNat|accessdate=26 April 2011|title=Official website for cooperation between European Nationalist parties.[/tpl]
