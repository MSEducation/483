RAMP was an American soul/jazz band from Cincinnati, Ohio.allmusic ((( Ramp > Overview )))  RAMP has mistakenly been said to stand for "Roy Ayers Music Production" and "Roy Ayers Music Project", but Ayers was not a member, though he did write and produce songs on their debut album.allmusic ((( Come into Knowledge > Overview )))
The group released one album, Come Into Knowledge (1977), which is now considered a classic among rare groove collectors, artists (such as PM Dawn and A Tribe Called Quest who have used RAMP samples in their music) and Roy Ayers fans. Featuring the vocals of Sharon Matthews and Sibel Thrasher, the album was recorded in New York and California. The group were a vehicle for the songwriting talents of Roy Ayers and Edwin Birdsong.  Released in 1977, the set featured a version of Roy Ayers' "Everybody Loves The Sunshine" along with the 'rare groove' track "Daylight". The 12" vinyl release of the album used to (and still does) command very high prices as the album had originally never been released on any other format. The album was eventually re-released on CD in 2007.
The group split up shortly afterwards, but reformed in 2006 for new tours and recordings. 
RAMP performed June 30, 2007, with Washington, DC, jazz pianist Will Rast at Central Park SummerStage in New York City.
In 2008, the song "Daylight" was featured on Grand Theft Auto IV's fictional Soul/R&B radio station The Vibe 98.8.
