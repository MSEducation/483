Luxembourgish ([tpl]lang|ltz|Lëtzebuergesch[/tpl]) is a Moselle Franconian dialect that is spoken mainly in Luxembourg. About 400,000 people worldwide speak Luxembourgish.

==Language family==

Luxembourgish belongs to the West Central German group of High German languages and is the primary example of a Moselle Franconian language.

==Usage==

Luxembourgish is the national language of Luxembourg and one of three administrative languages, alongside French and German.Mémorial A no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196–7: "Loi du 24 février 1984 sur le régime des langues".
Luxembourgish is also spoken in the Arelerland region of Belgium (part of the Province of Luxembourg) and in small parts of Lorraine in France.
In the German Eifel and Hunsrück regions, and in Lorraine, similar local Moselle Franconian dialects of German are spoken. Furthermore, the language is spoken by a few descendants of Luxembourg immigrants in the United States, and another similar Moselle Franconian dialect is spoken by ethnic Germans long settled in Transylvania, Romania (Siebenbürgen).
Moselle Franconian dialects outside the Luxembourg state border tend to have far fewer French loan words, and these mostly remain from the French revolution.

===Varieties===

There are several distinct dialect forms of Luxembourgish including Areler (from Arlon), Eechternoacher (Echternach), Kliärrwer (Clervaux), Miseler (Moselle), Stater (Luxembourg), Veiner (Vianden), Minetter (Southern Luxembourg) and Weelzer (Wiltz). Further small vocabulary differences may be seen even between small villages.
Increasing mobility of the population and the dissemination of the language through mass media such as radio and television are leading to a gradual standardisation towards a "Standard Luxembourgish" through the process of koineization.

===Surrounding languages===

There is no distinct geographic boundary between the use of Luxembourgish and the use of other closely related High German dialects (for example Lorraine Franconian); it instead forms a dialect continuum of gradual change.
Spoken Luxembourgish is relatively hard to understand for speakers of German who are generally not familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects (or at least other West Central German dialects). However, they can usually read the language to some degree. For those Germans familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects, it is relatively easy to understand and speak Luxembourgish as far as the everyday vocabulary is concerned. However, the large number of French loanwords in Luxembourgish may hamper communication about certain topics, or with certain speakers (who use surpassingly many French loanwords).
There is no intelligibility between Luxembourgish and French or any of the Romance dialects spoken in the adjacent parts of Belgium and France.
Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, President of the Christian Social People's Party of Luxembourg 1995-2003, was active in promoting the language beyond Luxembourg's borders.

==Written Luxembourgish==

===Standardisation===

A number of proposals for standardising the orthography of Luxembourgish can be documented, going back to the middle of the 19th century. There was no officially recognised system, however, until the adoption of the "OLO" (ofizjel lezebuurjer ortografi) on 5 June 1946.http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1946/0400709/index.html Mémorial A no. 40 (7 September 1946), pp. 637–41: "Arrêté ministériel du 5 juin 1946 portant fixation d'un système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeois". This orthography provided a system for speakers of all varieties of Luxembourgish to transcribe words the way they pronounced them, rather than imposing a single, standard spelling for the words of the language. The rules explicitly rejected certain elements of German orthography (e.g., the use of "ä" and "ö","Et get kèèn ä geshriven. … Et get kèèn ö geshriven." (p. 639) the capitalisation of nouns). Similarly, new principles were adopted for the spelling of French loanwords.
This proposed orthography, so different from existing "foreign" standards that people were already familiar with, did not enjoy widespread approval.
A more successful standard eventually emerged from the work of the committee of specialists charged with the task of creating the Luxemburger Wörterbuch, published in 5 volumes between 1950 and 1977. The orthographic conventions adopted in this decades-long project, set out in Bruch (1955), provided the basis of the standard orthography that became official on 10 October 1975.Mémorial B no. 68 (16 November 1976), pp. 1365–90: "Arrêté ministériel du 10 octobre 1975 portant réforme du système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeoise". Modifications to this standard were proposed by the Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise and adopted officially in the spelling reform of 30 July 1999.http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1999/1121108/index.html Mémorial A no. 112 (11 August 1999), pp. 2040–8: "Règlement grand-ducal du 30 juillet 1999 portant réforme du système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeoise". A detailed explanation of current practice for Luxembourgish can be found in Schanen & Lulling (2003).

===Alphabet===

The Luxembourgish alphabet consists of the 26 Latin letters plus three letters with diacritics: "é", "ä", and "ë". In loanwords from French and High German, other diacritics are usually preserved:

===Eifeler Regel===

Like many other varieties of Western High German, Luxembourgish has a rule of final n-deletion in certain contexts. The effects of this rule (known as the "Eifel Rule") are indicated in writing, and therefore must be taken into account when spelling words and morphemes ending in [tpl]angbr|n[/tpl] or [tpl]angbr|nn[/tpl]. For example:

==Phonology==

This section aims to briefly describe the phonology and phonetics of central Luxembourgish, which is regarded as the emerging standard.

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory of Luxembourgish is quite similar to that of Standard German.[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=67[/tpl]
Fortis [tpl]IPA|/p t k/[/tpl] are aspirated in most positions, and lenis [tpl]IPA|/b d ɡ/[/tpl] are often voiceless. Luxembourgish features final-obstruent devoicing; voiced stops are devoiced in coda position,[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=68[/tpl] unless resyllabified. In addition, resyllabified fortis stops are subject to voicing if followed by a vowel, e.g. eng interessant Iddi [tpl]IPA|intʀæˈsɑnd‿ˈidi[/tpl] "an interesting idea".[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=72[/tpl]
The affricate [tpl]IPA|/p͡f/[/tpl] is non-native to Luxembourgish and occurs only in words of German origin. Just as among many native German-speakers, it tends to be simplified to [tpl]IPA|f[/tpl] word-initially. For example, Pflicht ("obligation") is pronounced [tpl]IPA|fliɕt[/tpl], or in careful speech [tpl]IPA|p͡fliɕt[/tpl].
[tpl]IPA|/ʀ/[/tpl] may be [tpl]IPA|ʁ[/tpl] for some speakers. It is vocalised to [tpl]IPAblink|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAblink|ɐ[/tpl] word-finally. It is [tpl]IPA|ʁ[/tpl] before short vowels and voiced consonants, and χ before voiceless consonants.
[tpl]IPA|ɕ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ʑ[/tpl] are allophones of [tpl]IPA|/χ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ʁ/[/tpl], respectively; [tpl]IPA|/χ ʁ/[/tpl] occur before back vowels, and the allophones in all other positions. Speakers increasingly do not distinguish between postalveolar and alveolo-palatal fricatives.[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=68–69[/tpl]
[tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] is an allophone of [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] after [tpl]IPA|/k t͡s ʃ/[/tpl], e.g. zwee [tpl]IPA|t͡sweː[/tpl] "two". [tpl]IPA|ʒ[/tpl] may replace [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl] in some instances, e.g. Juni [tpl]IPA|ˈjuːniː[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|ˈʒuːniː[/tpl] "June".[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|p=69[/tpl]
In external sandhi, syllable-final [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl] is deleted unless followed by [tpl]IPA|t d t͡s h[/tpl], with few exceptions. Furthermore, some unusual consonant clusters may arise post-lexically after cliticisation of the definite article d' (for feminine, neuter and plural forms), e.g. d'Land [tpl]IPA|dlɑnt[/tpl] "the country" or d'Kräiz [tpl]IPA|tkʀæːɪ̯t͡s[/tpl] "the cross".

====Pronunciation of the letter g====

In Luxembourgish, the letter g has no fewer than nine possible pronunciations, depending both on the origin of a word and the phonetic environment of g. By the now very common mergers of [tpl]IPA|ʒ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ʑ[/tpl], as well as [tpl]IPA|ʃ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ɕ[/tpl], this number may be reduced to seven, however. The pronunciation [tpl]IPA|j[/tpl] is also (generally) not obligatory but a common allophone of [tpl]IPA|ʑ[/tpl] in the environment indicated below.

===Vowels===

Luxembourgish has fourteen vowel monophthongs, [tpl]IPA|i eː e ə ɛː æ aː ɑ ɐ oː o uː u[/tpl], and eight diphthongs, [tpl]IPA|ɜɪ æːɪ ɑɪ uə əʊ æːʊ ɑʊ[/tpl]. [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl] are allophones of a single phoneme [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl], and appear in complementary distribution; [tpl]IPA|e[/tpl] before velar consonants, and [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl] in all other positions. [tpl]IPA|e[/tpl] may also be pronounced [tpl]IPA|ɛ[/tpl]. [tpl]IPA|ɐ[/tpl] appear frequently in unstressed position. [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl] may be pronounced with slight lip rounding, thus tending a little towards [tpl]IPA|ø[/tpl]. Long vowels in diphthongs may be pronounced short in fast speech and in unstressed position. Additional diphthongs arise after vocalisation of [tpl]IPA|/ʀ/[/tpl] (described above). [tpl]IPA|/eː/[/tpl] before [tpl]IPA|/ʀ/[/tpl] is pronounced [tpl]IPA|ɛː[/tpl].[tpl]harvcoltxt|Gilles|Trouvain|2013|pp=69–71[/tpl]
In loanwords from German and French, at least seven additional vowel phonemes occur: [tpl]IPA|/ɛː/, /øː/, /yː/, /y/, /ɑ̃/, /ɛ̃/, /õ/[/tpl]. Although they are absent in the originally Luxembourgish vocabulary and therefore relatively unfrequent, nearly all speakers distinguish these phonemes.
Note that the letter é is today pronounced like ë before -ch. The ostensibly inconsistent spelling é is based on the traditional, now widely obsolete pronunciation of -ch as a palatal [tpl]IPA|/ç/[/tpl]. As this is a relatively backward consonant, it triggered the use of allophone [tpl]IPA|/e/[/tpl] as before velar consonants ([tpl]IPA|/k/, /ŋ/[/tpl]). Since the more forward alveo-palatal [tpl]IPA|/ɕ/[/tpl] has replaced [tpl]IPA|/ç/[/tpl] in almost all speakers, the allophone [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl] is used as before any non-velar consonant. So the word mécht ("he makes"), which is now pronounced [tpl]IPA|/məɕt/[/tpl], used to be pronounced [tpl]IPA|/meçt/[/tpl], and this is the reason for its spelling. (One might now change the orthography to mëcht, but this is non-standard as yet.)

==Grammar==

===Nominal syntax===

Luxembourgish has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and has three cases (nominative, accusative, and dative). These are marked morphologically on determiners and pronouns. As in German, there is no morphological gender distinction in the plural.
The forms of the articles and of some selected determiners are given below:
||
|}
As seen above, Luxembourgish has plural forms of en ("a, an"), namely eng in the nominative/accusative and engen in the dative. They are not used as indefinite articles, which—as in German and English—do not exist in the plural, but they do occur in the compound pronouns wéi en ("what, which") and sou en ("such"). For example: wéi eng Saachen ("what things"); sou eng Saachen ("such things"). Moreover, they are used before numbers to express an estimation: eng 30.000 Spectateuren ("some 30,000 spectators").
Distinct nominative forms survive in a few nominal phrases such as der Däiwel ("the devil") and eiser Herrgott ("our Lord"). Rare examples of the genitive are also found: Enn des Mounts ("end of the month"), Ufanks der Woch ("at the beginning of the week"). The functions of the genitive are normally expressed using a combination of the dative and a possessive determiner: e.g. dem Mann säi Buch (lit. "to the man his book", i.e. "the man's book"). This is known as a periphrastic genitive, and is a phenomenon also commonly seen in dialectal and colloquial German, and in Dutch.
The forms of the personal pronouns are given in the following table (unstressed forms appear in parentheses):
The 2pl form is also used as a polite singular (like French vous, see T-V distinction); the forms are capitalised in writing:
Like most varieties of colloquial German, but even more invariably, Luxembourgish uses definite articles with personal names. They are obligatory and not to be translated:
A feature Luxembourgish shares with only some western dialects of German is that women and girls are most often referred to with forms of the neuter pronoun hatt:

===Adjectives===

Luxembourgish morphology distinguishes two types of adjective: attributive and predicative. Predicative adjectives appear with verbs like sinn ("to be"), and receive no extra ending:
Attributive adjectives are placed before the noun they describe, and change their ending according to the grammatical gender, number, and case:
Interesting to note is how the definite article changes with the use of an attributive adjective: feminine d goes to déi (or di), neuter d goes to dat, and plural d changes to déi.
The comparative in Luxembourgish is formed analytically, i.e. the adjective itself is not altered (compare the use of -er in German and English; tall → taller, klein → kleiner). Instead it is formed using the adverb méi: e.g. schéin → méi schéin
The superlative involves a synthetic form consisting of the adjective and the suffix -st: e.g. schéin → schéin'st'  (compare German schönst, English prettiest). Attributive modification requires the emphatic definite article and the inflected superlative adjective:
Predicative modification uses either the same adjectival structure or the adverbial structure am+ -sten: e.g. schéin → am schéinsten:
Some common adjectives have exceptional comparative and superlative forms:
Several other adjectives also have comparative forms. However, these are not commonly used as normal comparatives, but in special senses:

===Word-order===

Luxembourgish exhibits "verb second" word order in clauses. More specifically, Luxembourgish is a V2-SOV language, like German and Dutch. In other words, we find the following finite clausal structures:
Non-finite verbs (infinitives and participles) generally appear in final position:
These rules interact so that in subordinate clauses, the finite verb and any non-finite verbs must all cluster at the end. Luxembourgish allows different word orders in these cases:
This is also the case when two non-finite verb forms occur together:
Luxembourgish (like Dutch and German) allows prepositional phrases to appear after the verb cluster in subordinate clauses:

==Vocabulary==

Luxembourgish has borrowed many French words. For example, the name for a bus driver is Buschauffeur (also Dutch), which would be Busfahrer in German and chauffeur de bus in French.
Some words are different from Standard German but have equivalents in German dialects. An example is gromperen (potatoes - German: Kartoffeln). Other words are exclusive to Luxembourgish.

===Selected common phrases===

Note: Words spoken in sound clip do not reflect all words on this list.

===Neologisms===

Neologisms in Luxembourgish include both entirely new words, and the attachment of new meanings to old words in everyday speech. The most recent neologisms come from the English language in the fields of telecommunications, computer science, and the Internet.
Recent neologisms in Luxembourgish include:Lulling, Jérôme. (2002) La créativité lexicale en luxembourgeois, Doctoral thesis, Université Paul Valéry Montpellier III

==Academic projects==

Between 2000 and 2002, the Luxembourgish linguist, Jérôme Lulling, compiled a lexical database of 125,000 word forms as the basis for the very first Luxembourgish spellchecker (Projet C.ORT.IN.A).
The LaF (Lëtzebuergesch als Friemsprooch – Luxembourgish as a Foreign Language) is a set of four language proficiency certifications for Luxembourgish and follows the ALTE framework of language examination standards. The tests are administered by the Institut National des Langues Luxembourg.Institut national des langues - INL - Passer un examen à l'INL
The "Centre for Luxembourg Studies" at the University of Sheffield was founded in 1995 on the initiative of Professor Gerald Newton. It is supported by the government of Luxembourg which funds an endowed chair in Luxembourg Studies at the university.[tpl]Cite web|title=Centre for Luxembourg Studies|url=http://shef.ac.uk/luxembourg-studies|accessdate=11 September 2011[/tpl]
