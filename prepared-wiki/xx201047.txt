The 1967–68 FA Cup was the 87th season of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. West Bromwich Albion won the competition, beating Everton 1–0 after extra time in the final at Wembley, London.
Matches were played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If the weather was inclement, a match may have been played at a different date to that originally planned. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
