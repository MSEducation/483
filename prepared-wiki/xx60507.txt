The Heim ins Reich ([tpl]Audio|De-Heim ins Reich.ogg|listen[/tpl]; German; "Home into the Empire" or "Back to the Reich"),A less literal translation might be "Return to the Nation" was a foreign policy pursued by Adolf Hitler beginning in 1938.  The aim of his initiative was to convince all of the ethnically German people who were living outside of the Third Reich (e.g. in Austria and the western districts of Poland) that they should strive to bring these regions "home" into Greater Germany. It included areas ceded after the Treaty of Versailles, as well as other areas containing significant German populations such as the Sudetenland.
The policy was managed by VOMI (Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle or "Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans"). As a state agency of the NSDAP, it handled all Volksdeutsch issues. By 1941, the VOMI was under the control of the SS.

==History==

Prior to the Anschluss, a powerful transmitter in Munich bombarded Austria with propaganda of what Hitler had already done for Germany, and what he could do for his native home country Austria.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p27 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York
The annexation of Austria was presented as "entering German land as representatives of a general German will to unity, to establish brotherhood with the German people and soldiers there.""Marching into Austria"  Similarly, the last chapter of Eugen Hadamovsky's World History on the March glorifies Hitler's obtaining Memel from Lithuania as "the latest stage in the progress of history"."Hadamovsky on the Memel District (1939)"
Concurrent with this were the beginnings of attempts to ethnically cleanse non-Germans both from Germany and from the areas intended to be part of a "Greater Germany".  Alternately, Hitler also made attempts to Germanize those who were considered ethnically or racially close enough to Germans to be "worth keeping" as part of a future German nation, such as the population of Luxembourg (officially, Germany considered these populations to actually be German, but not part of the Greater German Reich, and were thus the targets of propaganda promoting this view in order to integrate them). These attempts were largely unpopular with the targets of the Germanization, and the citizens of Luxembourg voted in a referendum 97% against becoming citizens of Germany.
Propaganda was also directed to Germans outside the Third Reich, to return as regions, or as individuals from other regions.  Hitler hoped to make full use of the "German Diaspora."Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p. 194. ISBN 0-679-77663-X
As part of an effort to lure ethnic Germans back to Germany,Nicholas, p. 195. folksy Heimatbriefe or "letters from the homeland" were sent to German immigrants to the United States.Nicholas, p. 197.  The reaction to these was on the whole negative, particularly as they picked up.Nicholas, p. 199.  Goebbels also hoped to use German-Americans to keep America neutral during the war, but this actually produced great hostility to Nazi propagandists.Rhodes, p. 147.
Newspapers in occupied Ukraine printed articles about antecedents of German rule over Ukraine, such as Catherine the Great and the Goths.Karel C. Berkhoff, Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine Under Nazi Rule p. 192. ISBN 0-674-01313-1

=="Heim ins Reich" in occupied Poland 1939-1944==

The same motto (Heim ins Reich) was also applied to a different, but somewhat related policy: the uprooting and relocation of ethnically German communities (Volksdeutsche) from some Central and Eastern European countries, which had been there for hundreds of years. The Nazi government determined which of these communities were not "viable", started propaganda among the local population, and then made arrangements  and organized their transport. The use of scare tactics about the Soviet Union led to tens of thousands leaving.Nicholas, p. 207-9.  This included Germans from Bukovina, Bessarabia, Dobruja and Yugoslavia. For example, after the Soviets had assumed control of this territory, about 45,000 ethnic Germans had left Northern Bukovina by November 1940.Leonid Ryaboshapko. Pravove stanovishche nationalinyh mensyn v Ukraini (1917-2000) - P. 259 (in Ukrainian)  (Stalin permitted this out of fear they would be loyal to Germany.)Nicholas, p. 204.
In the Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) region (joined together with the Lodz district and dubbed "Wartheland" by the Germans), the Nazis' goal was the complete "Germanization", or political, cultural, social, and economic assimilation of the territory into the German Reich. In pursuit of this goal, the installed bureaucracy renamed streets and cities and seized tens of thousands of Polish enterprises, from large industrial firms to small shops, without payment to the owners. This area incorporated 350,000 such "ethnic Germans" and 1.7 million Poles deemed Germanizable, including between one and two hundred thousand children who had been taken from their parents (plus about 400,000 German settlers from the "Old Reich").Pierre Aycoberry, The Social History of the Third Reich, 1933-1945, p 228, ISBN 1-56584-549-8  They were housed in farms left vacant by expulsion of the local Poles.Nicholas, p. 213-4. Militant party members were sent to teach them to be "true Germans".Aycoberry, p. 255. Hitler Youth and League of German Girls sent young people for "Eastern Service", which entailed (particularly for the girls) assisting in Germanization efforts.Nicholas, p. 215. They were harassed by Polish partisans (Armia Krajowa) during the war. As Nazi Germany lost the war, they were expelled to remaining Germany.
Eberhardt cites estimates for the ethnic German influx provided by Szobak, Łuczak, and a collective report, ranging from 404,612 (Szobak) to 631,500 (Łuczak).Piotr Eberhardt, Political Migrations in Poland, 1939-1948, Warsaw 2006, p.24 http://www.igipz.pan.pl/zpz/Political_migrations.pdf Anna Bramwell says 591,000 ethnic Germans moved into the annexed territories, and details the areas of colonists' origin as follows: 93,000 were from Bessarabia, 21,000 from Dobruja, 98,000 from Bukovina, 68,000 from Volhynia, 58,000 from Galicia, 130,000 from the Baltic states, 38,000 from eastern Poland, 72,000 from the Sudetenland, and 13,000 from Slovenia. Anna Bramwell citing the ILO study, Refugees in the age of total war, Routledge, 1988, p.123, ISBN 0-04-445194-6 During "Heim ins Reich" Germans were settled in the homes of expelled Poles.
Additionally some 400,000 German officials, technical staff, and clerks were sent to those areas in order to administer them, according to "Atlas Ziem Polski" citing a joint Polish-German scholarly publication on the aspect of population changes during the warWysiedlenia, wypędzenia i ucieczki 1939-1959: atlas ziem Polski: Polacy, Żydzi, Niemcy, Ukraińcy. Warszawa Demart 2008 Eberhardt estimates that the total influx from the Altreich was about 500,000 people.Eberhardt, p. 22. Duiker and Spielvogel note that up to two million Germans had been settled in pre-war Poland by 1942.William J. Duiker, Jackson J. Spielvogel, World History, 1997: By 1942, two million ethnic Germans had been settled in Poland. page 794 Eberhardt gives a total of two million Germans present in the area of all pre-war Poland by the end of the war, 1.3 million of whom moved in during the war, adding to a pre-war population of 700,000. 
The increase of German population was most visible in the urban centres: in Poznań, the German population increased from ~6,000 in 1939 to 93,589 in 1944; in Łódź, from ~60,000 to 140,721; and in Inowrocław, from 956 to 10,713.Eberhardt, p.26. Eberhardt refers to Polska Zachodnia..., 1961, p. 294. In Warthegau, where most Germans were settled, the share of the German population increased from 6.6% in 1939 to 21.2% in 1943.Eberhardt, p. 26.
