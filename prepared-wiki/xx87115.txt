Maurice Edward Clarett (born October 29, 1983)[tpl]cite web|date=August 27, 2006|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=7277|title=ESPN Player Card[/tpl] is an American football running back who played for the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League. During his freshman year at Ohio State University in 2002, he helped lead the Buckeyes to a national championship. In a widely unexpected move, Clarett was drafted on the first day of the 2005 NFL Draft with the final pick of the 3rd round (#101 overall) by the Denver Broncos. He is well known for unsuccessfully challenging the NFL's draft eligibility rules requiring a player to be three years removed from high school and for his tumultuous life outside of football, including his dismissal from Ohio State, several arrests, and later, imprisonment.

==Personal==

Clarett is the son of Myke Clarett Sr. and Michelle Renee Clarett (now divorced). His father once worked as a Regional Representative for the Secretary of State in Ohio.  His mother worked as a senior administrator for the Youngstown City Clerk of Court.

Clarett has a daughter, born July 16, 2006, with girlfriend Ashley Evans.

==Football career==

===High school===

After displaying his abilities as a punishing freshman tailback on the Austintown-Fitch High School varsity team, Clarett transferred to Warren G. Harding High School to continue his scholastic career and garnered national attention. When he graduated from Harding, many national publications ranked him among the top 100 players nationally.NFL Events: Draft Player Profiles[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] He was a 2002 U.S. Army All-American.  Clarett received an offer from Ohio State University and verbally committed to Ohio State over offers from Notre Dame, Fresno State, and the University of Miami.  He formally committed to the Buckeyes in February 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?Sport=1&pr_key=418 |title=Maurice Clarett |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2010[/tpl] Ohio State's coach, Jim Tressel, had previously been coach of Clarett's hometown Youngstown State Penguins. Later, Clarett received the USA Today Offensive High School Player of the Year and Parade All-American distinctions.

===College===

Clarett starred at Ohio State for one season, rushing for 1,237 yards (a school record for a freshman) and scoring 18 touchdowns, which helped the Buckeyes to a 14-0 record and the 2002 BCS National Championship. He scored the winning touchdown against the University of Miami with a five-yard run in the second overtime in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl (played January 3, 2003). He also made a key defensive play in that game, stealing the ball on the Miami 28 from Hurricanes safety Sean Taylor, who was returning an interception from the end zone of a pass thrown by Craig Krenzel.  After that play, Ohio State kicked a field goal, giving them a 10-point lead at the time. Clarett was the first freshman to be the leading rusher on a national championship team since Ahman Green of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1995.

====Career rushing statistics at Ohio State====

====Dismissal from Ohio State====

Clarett's time at Ohio State University was marked by several troubling incidents.  He was seen yelling at his position coach during the Northwestern - Ohio State game in the 2002 season.  In December 2002, he publicly maligned OSU officials for not paying for him to fly home for the funeral of a friend and accused administrators of lying when they said he had not filed the necessary paperwork.  In July 2003, Clarett became the center of an academic scandal when a teaching assistant told the New York Times that Clarett had received preferential treatment from a professor; the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct.
Ohio State later suspended Clarett for the 2003 athletic year after he was charged with filing a false police report. Clarett had filed a false claim that more than $10,000 in clothing, CDs, cash and stereo equipment were stolen from a car he borrowed from a local dealership in September 2003.  Athletic Director Andy Geiger stated that Clarett also took in special benefits totaling approximately $20,000, and repeatedly misled investigators.  Clarett later pleaded guilty to a lesser criminal charge (failure to aid a law enforcement official) in that incident.
Clarett moved to Los Angeles after his dismissal from Ohio State, and, while living there, sued to be included in the 2004 NFL Draft.  He won his case at trial.  However, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision.  Subsequently, Clarett worked with trainers in preparation for the 2005 NFL Combine, hoping to impress for the upcoming draft.[tpl]cite news|title=Clarett's call came two hours before arrest|publisher=ESPN the Magazine|author=Tom Friend|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2545078[/tpl]  It was also in Los Angeles that Clarett's problems with drugs and alcohol began.http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8747028/maurice-clarett-formerly-ohio-state-buckeyes-talks-drugs-jail-football  Clarett has battled depression and alcoholism since as early as 2004.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/08/28/Maurice-Clarett-talks-mental-illness-promotes-medicaid-expansion.html

===National Football League===

In his attempt to enter the 2004 NFL Draft, Clarett challenged the NFL's rule that a player must wait three years after graduating from High School to declare for the draft. Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin initially ruled based on anti-trust grounds that the NFL could not bar Clarett from participating in the 2004 NFL Draft.See Clarett v. Nat'l Football League, 306 F. Supp. 2d 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) This decision was later overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in an opinion by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Clarett's petition for certiorari was refused by the Supreme Court.See Clarett v. Nat'l Football League, 369 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1728 (2005) Clarett and USC wide receiver Mike Williams, who were both hoping to enter the draft early, were then barred from the draft by the NFL. Later, because they both signed agents before being denied the opportunity to join the NFL Draft, the NCAA refused to reinstate the college eligibility of Clarett or Williams.
Clarett has been represented by California attorney David Kenner. Clarett also lived with Kenner and claims that Kenner helped him straighten out his life[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]. Kenner is also the longtime attorney of Death Row Records CEO and hip-hop kingpin Marion "Suge" Knight.
In February 2005, he participated in the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. During a press conference, he uttered the phrase: "It's a humbling thing being humble." After running a disappointing 4.72 and 4.82 seconds in the 40-yard dash, he refused to participate further, and was referred to as "Slow-Mo" by the sports media, who were largely critical of his obvious lack of preparation.
Ohio State declined to allow him to take part in a private workout for pro scouts in Columbus because it wanted to avoid a "circus" situation.

====2005 NFL draft====

In a widely unexpected move, Clarett was drafted on the first day of the 2005 NFL Draft with the final pick of the 3rd round (#101 overall) by the Denver Broncos. Many experts felt that he would fall to the 6th or 7th round, if he was drafted at all.NFL Draft Scout However, Clarett turned out to be unimpressive in the Denver Broncos' preseason training camp.  In part due to having not played a game in two years or practiced in over a year, he entered training camp weighing 248 pounds, more than 20 pounds overweight. He was also slow to recover from an injury.
Despite his unimpressive training camp, Clarett signed a four-year contract on July 28, 2005 with the Broncos in which he gave up $413,000 of guaranteed money in order to secure an incentive-laden deal. Clarett signed this deal against the advice of his former agents, Steve Feldman and Josh Luchs. Clarett's motivation was to replace the proposed deal with a package that would pay him first-round money if he rushed for 1,000 yards in multiple seasons.
However, after further disappointments and incidents with his coaches and never playing a preseason game, Clarett was released on waivers on August 28, 2005, only a month after signing his contract and before playing even a single down in the NFL. As is standard procedure in the NFL, for a 24-hour period after his release, other teams could have claimed him and taken on his contract. After that 24-hour period, he was freed from his contract and able to negotiate with any team, but no team expressed interest.[tpl]cite news|author=John Clayton|authorlink=John Clayton (sportscaster)|title=Broncos to release Maurice Clarett|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2145372[/tpl]

====Post-NFL troubles====

As his college and NFL careers tanked, The Miami Herald reported in September that Clarett was already $1 million in debt from legal fees for his fight with the NFL and other costs. They also reported that Clarett turned down the traditional signing bonus in the originally proposed contract from Denver because Kenner wanted incentives that would pay Clarett if he became a star.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/football/12575349.htm|title=Rookie RB Brown keeps ego in check|work=Miami Herald|date=September 7, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051210213538/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/football/12575349.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2005[/tpl] Article was quoted in CNNSI.com "Daily Scorecard" feature on Sept. 7, 2005.

===Exploring alternatives to the NFL===

In December 2005, Clarett was in talks to play for the Steubenville Stampede, a squad in the North Division of the American Indoor Football League.  According to Jim Terry, Manager of the Stampede, "I have been in contact with Clarett's agent and he's expressed interest with us... Clarett is hungry and has something to prove. He has a chip on his shoulder and wants to show he can still play."[tpl]cite web|last=Zarotney|first=Shelby|title=Steubenville Stampede: Ready To Play?|url=http://www.wtov9.com/news/5307279/detail.html|publisher=WTOV|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051211112025/http://www.wtov9.com/news/5307279/detail.html|archivedate=December 11, 2005|location=Steubenville, Ohio|date=November 11, 2005[/tpl]  However, Clarett never signed with the Stampede.  In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch published on August 10, 2006, Terry claimed that Clarett attempted to call him just minutes before the events on the morning of August 9 that led to Clarett's arrest.
Clarett also expressed interest in playing for NFL Europe. Josh Luchs, Clarett's agent, reported that Clarett was going to sign with the NFL on January 2, 2006, and was expected to be allocated to NFL Europe. There were also discussions about Clarett playing for the semi-pro Eastern Indoor Football League team the Mahoning Valley Hitmen, coached by the same Jim Terry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2006/jul/14/clarett-says-hell-play-for-mahoning-valley-hitmen/|title=Clarett says he'll play for Mahoning Valley Hitmen|author=Scalzo, Joe|work=The Vindicator|place=Youngstown, Ohio|date=July 14, 2006|accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl]
On August 23, 2010, Clarett was released from a halfway house and requested permission from Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge David Fais to attend a tryout for the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League.

====Blog and Post Football Life====

While in prison, Clarett blogged about his life there on The Mind of Maurice Clarett.  Because he did not have Internet access in the prison, he sent his entries to his girlfriend, who posted them for him.
In one post, Clarett summed up his attitude towards prison by saying "Understand my struggle so you can respect my hustle. I am never coming back here, believe that. Never, I am cool on this. It is first-class living from the day I get out. I WILL NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS, EVER AGAIN. That goes for communication, personal relationships, housing, education, friendships, and travel arrangements. Everything. I have the fire in my eyes"[tpl]cite web|url=http://mauriceclarett.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/conservation-to-myself-reflecting/ |title=Conservation to Myself/ Reflecting |publisher=The Mind of Maurice Clarett |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 26, 2010[/tpl]
