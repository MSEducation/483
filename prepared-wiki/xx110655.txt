"Someday (I Will Understand)" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears. It was written by Spears and produced by herself and Guy Sigsworth. The song was released on 2006, by Jive Records, as the sole single from Spears' first extended play, Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005). In July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, later revealing she would be taking another career break to start a family. Spears wrote the song two weeks before knowing she was pregnant with her first child, Sean Preston Federline. A pop ballad, "Someday (I Will Understand)" lyrics refer to a feeling of empowerment as a pregnant woman. A remixed version of the song was included on the 2005 remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes.
"Someday (I Will Understand)" has received mixed reviews from music critics. A few reviewers considered it as a lesson on the singer's history and a "tear-jerker" ballad, while others considered it a non-savable "flop single". The song reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and also charted in a number of European countries. An accompanying music video, directed by Michael Haussman, premiered on the finale of Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. Entirely shot in black-and-white, the music video features Spears as a pregnant woman and portrays a transformation of her character. Contemporary critics noted the video as a departure from Spears' previous music videos, while comparing the imagery of it to American entertainer Madonna's Kabbalah makeover.

==Background==

In July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff[/tpl] The initial stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[tpl]harvnb|Heller|2007|p=80[/tpl] In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1492692/20041016/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Announces She's Taking A Break From Her Career|date=October 16, 2004|accessdate=June 10, 2010|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|publisher=MTV[/tpl] Spears gave birth to her first child, Sean Preston Federline, on September 14, 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1039012_1107631,00.html|title=Britney Welcomes Home Sean Preston|date=September 21, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2010| work=People[/tpl]
"Someday (I Will Understand)" was composed by Spears on the piano at her house, two weeks before she learned of her pregnancy with Sean Preston. She explained the song came "like a prophecy... when you're pregnant, you're empowered".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-06-14-chaotic-recap_x.htm|title='Chaotic': Britney's happily-ever-after|date=June 14, 2005|accessdate=March 5, 2010| last=Maxwell|first=Alison|work= USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company, Inc.[/tpl] It was produced by Guy Sigsworth, who previously worked with the singer on "Everytime" (2003).

==Critical response==

"Someday (I Will Understand)" received mixed reviews from music critics. While reviewing Britney & Kevin: Chaotic, Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody noted, "Britney now sings about either the husband or the kid. (Sorry, people. It's a sad day for the middle-aged American male sicko.) For everyone else, these bonus tracks further Spears' upward path of totally bangin' production and almost uncanny Prince-channeling."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/#/album/Alb.7637248|title=Britney & Kevin: Chaotic by Britney Spears|last=McGuirk|first=Mike|date=September 27, 2005|accessdate=April 23, 2011|publisher=Rhapsody Music[/tpl] Gil Kaufman of MTV thought the song a "horrible Britney ballad with the black-and-white video that began her descent into madness."[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/03/26/idols-david-archuleta-stumps-one-of-our-resident-pop-music-nerds/|title=Idol's David Archuleta Stumps Our Resident Pop Music Nerd|date=March 26, 2008|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|accessdate=September 14, 2011|publisher=MTV.

==Music video==

The music video for "Someday (I Will Understand)" was directed by Michael Haussman. Spears commented that he "did a great job capturing the song, the essence and the emotion" and added that the video had "a different feeling" from any of her previous videos.[tpl]cite video|people=Britney Spears|title=Britney & Kevin: Chaotic|date=2005|publisher=Jive Records|medium=DVD[/tpl] It was shot entirely in black-and-white.[tpl]cite journal|url=|title=The Complete Video Guide: "Someday (I Will Understand)"|year=2009|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|last=Reporter|first=Rolling Stone|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv[/tpl] Spears asserted that her life had "come full circle" and implied that in the process she underwent changes in her soul and body, as shown in the video.[tpl]harvnb|Heller|2007|p=92[/tpl] It premiered on June 14, 2005 during the fifth and last episode of Spears's reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic, titled "Veil of Secrecy".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8193036/|title=Britney to debut music video on ‘Chaotic’ finale|date=June 12, 2005|accessdate=March 5, 2010| last=Staff|first=Associated Press|publisher=msnbc.com. NBC Universal / Microsoft[/tpl] The music video features a pregnant Spears lying in bed and walking around a house while singing to her unborn child. She also gazes through the window at the Roman sculptures in the garden.
Dana Alice Heller noted that her provocative costuming and dancing are replaced in the video with a solitary, fabric-draped Spears that evokes an ethereal calmness. Heller compared the imagery to Madonna's Kabbalah makeover, but added that while Madonna was "in her thirties after a tabloid head-lining first marriage and a few other misguided relationships, Spears was only twenty-two, making her transformation seem forced". Hayley Butler of Jam! said "the video is a far cry from the snake handling, sweating and skimpy Britney videos of the past. Dressed in a classy silk dress, she runs through gardens, lies in bed and walks through the grass, all with a burgeoning belly."[tpl]cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/B/Britney_And_Kevin_Chaotic/2005/06/16/1091361-ca.html|title=Britney's 'Chaotic' series wraps up|last=Butler|first=Hayley|publisher=Jam!|date=June 14, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011[/tpl] John Mitchel of MTV included the video on the list "Beyonce, Britney And Madonna: What To Expect When You're Expecting — Music Video Edition" in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/10/04/beyonce-countdown-baby-bump-britney-spears-madonna-videos/|title=Beyonce, Britney And Madonna: What To Expect When You're Expecting — Music Video Edition|last=Mitchel|first=John|publisher=MTV.
