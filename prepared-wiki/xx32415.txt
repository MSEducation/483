Sugar Ray Leonard (born May 17, 1956) is a retired professional American boxer, motivational speaker, and occasional actor. He was given the birth name Ray Charles Leonard, after his mother's favorite singer, Ray Charles. Leonard was the first boxer to earn more than $100 million in purses, won world titles in five weight divisions, and defeated future fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Wilfred Benítez, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Durán, and Marvin Hagler.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=Leonard_Sugar_Ray |title=Sugar Ray was ring artist |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/greatest/featureVideo?page=greatest1120 |title=ESPN 50 Greatest Boxers of All Time |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1994-11-05 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Leonard was named "Boxer of the Decade" for the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Mark_Grossinger_Etess_Award |title=Mark Grossinger Etess Award |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

==Early life==

Leonard, the fifth of seven children, was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to Cicero and Getha Leonard. Leonard was named after singer Ray Charles.see page 5, The Big Fight: My Life In and Out of the Ring by Sugar Ray Leonard ISBN 0452298040
The family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager, and his mother was a nurse.  Sugar Ray Leonard went to high school at Parkdale High School. Parkdale High School is located at 6001 Good Luck Road in Riverdale, MD.
Leonard was a shy child, and aside from the time he nearly drowned in a creek during a Seat Pleasant, Maryland,inserted state name for clarification flood, his childhood was uneventful. He stayed home a lot, reading comic books and playing with his dog. "He never did talk too much," his mother said. "We never could tell what he was thinking. But I never had any problems with him. I never had to go to school once because of him."[tpl]cite news|last=Nack|first=William|authorlink=William Nack|title=Sugar Sure Is Sweet|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126346/4/index.htm|accessdate=17 July 2011|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=26 November 1979[/tpl]

==Amateur career==

Leonard started boxing at the Palmer Park Recreation Center in 1969. His older brother, Roger, started boxing first. Roger helped start the boxing program, urging the center's director, Ollie Dunlap, to form a team. Dave Jacobs, a former boxer, and Janks Morton volunteered as boxing coaches. Roger won some trophies and showed them off in front of Ray, goading him to start boxing.
In 1972, Leonard boxed in the featherweight quarterfinals of the National AAU Tournament, losing by decision to Jerome Artis. It was his first defeat. Later that year, he boxed in the Eastern Olympic Trials. The rules stated that a boxer had to be seventeen to box in international competition, so Leonard, only sixteen, lied about his age.see page 1, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff, ISBN 0-07-065003-9 He made it to the lightweight semifinals, losing a disputed decision to Greg Whaley, who took such a beating that he wasn't allowed to continue in the trials and never boxed again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3U4NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zm0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3639,2945747&dq=greg-whaley+ray+leonard&hl=en |title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette June 17, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-06-17 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Sarge Johnson, assistant coach of the U.S. Olympic Boxing Team, said to Dave Jacobs, "That kid you got is sweet as sugar." The nickname stuck. However, given his style and first name, it was probably only a matter of time before people started calling him Sugar Ray, after the man many consider to be the best boxer of all time, Sugar Ray Robinson.see pages 7 & 8, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff, ISBN 0-07-065003-9
In 1973, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves Lightweight Championship, but lost to Randy Shields in the lightweight final of the National AAU Tournament. The following year, Leonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Lightweight Championships.
Leonard suffered his last two losses as an amateur in 1974. He lost a disputed decision to Anatoli Kamnev in Moscow, after which, Kamnev gave the winner's trophy to Leonard. In Poland, Kazimier Szczerba was given a decision victory over Leonard, even though he was dominated in the first two rounds and dropped three times in the third.[tpl]cite news|author=Edited by Gay Flood |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126394/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated December 10, 1979 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1979-12-10 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard won the National Golden Gloves and National AAU Light Welterweight Championships in 1974. The following year, he again won the National AAU Light Welterweight Championship, as well as the Light Welterweight Championship at the Pan American Games.
In 1976, Leonard made the U.S. Olympic Team as the light welterweight representative. The team also included Leon and Michael Spinks, Howard Davis, Jr., Leo Randolph, Charles Mooney and John Tate. Many consider the 1976 U.S. team to be the greatest boxing team in the history of the Olympics.[tpl]cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-usabox082008 |title=One USA Boxing team stands above the rest by Kevin Iole |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard won his first four Olympic bouts by 5–0 decisions. He faced Kazimier Szczerba in the semifinals and won by a 5–0 decision, avenging his last amateur loss. In the final, he boxed the great Cuban knockout artist Andrés Aldama, who scored five straight knockouts to reach the final.
Leonard landed several good left hooks in the first round. In the second, he dropped Aldama with a left to the chin. Late in the final round, he again hurt Aldama, which brought a standing eight count from the referee. With only a few seconds left in the fight, a Leonard combination forced another standing eight count. Leonard was awarded a 5–0 decision and the Olympic Gold Medal.
Afterward, Leonard announced, "I'm finished...I've fought my last fight. My journey has ended, my dream is fulfilled. Now I want to go to school." He was given a scholarship to the University of Maryland, a gift from the citizens of Glenarden, Maryland. He planned to study business administration and communications.see pages 42 & 43, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff, ISBN 0-07-065003-9
He finished his amateur career with a record of 145–5 and 75 KO's.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091398/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated August 9, 1976 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1976-08-09 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===Achievements===

==Change in plans==

Juanita Wilkinson, Leonard's high school girlfriend, told him she was pregnant in the summer of 1973. They decided to have the baby but marriage would be put off until after the Olympics in 1976. Leonard would continue to pursue his Olympic dream while she and the baby, Ray Charles Leonard Jr., lived with her parents. When Leonard boxed in the Olympics, he had a picture of Wilkinson taped to his sock.
Shortly before the Olympics, Wilkinson had filed an application to receive $156 a month in child support payments from Prince George's County. She named Leonard as the father and the county's state attorney's office filed a civil suit against Leonard to establish paternity and get support payments for the child. Leonard learned of the suit several days after returning home from the Olympics. The headline in the Washington Star read, "Sugar Ray Leonard Named in Welfare Dept. Paternity Suit."see pages 33, 34 & 43 Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff ISBN 0-07-065003-9
Wilkinson went to the Olympics to watch Leonard box, but she did not tell him about the suit and never asked him for any money. "I didn't feel like being bothered by all those complications by asking him for any money for support," she said. Leonard pledged he would support his son, even if he had to scrap plans to attend college.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G-0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2051,2385110&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+paternity&hl=en |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune August 6, 1976 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard had hoped to get lucrative endorsements following his gold medal win, but the publicity from the paternity suit chased off any big commercial possibilities. To make matters worse, his father was hospitalized with meningitis and his mother suffered a heart attack. With neither parent able to work, with his child and the mother of his child to support, and without any endorsement opportunities, Leonard decided to become a professional boxer.see page 63, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff ISBN 0-07-065003-9

==Professional career==

===Early professional career===

When Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked twenty-four of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard's career with an investment of $21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, was brought in to be Leonard's trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager's traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard's opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard's purse.see pages 65–68, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff ISBN 0-07-065003-9
Leonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977 before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was paid $40,044 for the fight. His opponent was Luis "The Bull" Vega, whom he defeated by a six-round unanimous decision.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092048/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, February 14, 1977 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1977-02-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] After the fight, Leonard paid back his $21,000 loan to the investors.see page 75, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff ISBN 0-07-065003-9
In his fourteenth professional fight, Leonard fought his first world-ranked opponent, Floyd Mayweather, who was ranked seventeenth. The fight took place on September 9, 1978. Leonard won by a tenth-round knockout.see page 93, Sugar Ray Leonard and Other Noble Warriors by Sam Toperoff ISBN 0-07-065003-9 A month later, Leonard defeated his old amateur nemesis Randy Shields by a ten-round unanimous decision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_4EpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tWUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1558,971183&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+randy+shields&hl=en |title=Lewiston Evening Journal, October 7, 1978 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
On August 12, 1979, Leonard knocked out Pete Ranzany in four rounds to win the NABF Welterweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hMYRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vu4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2969,7439654&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+ranzany&hl=en |title=The Spokesman-Review, August 13, 1979 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1979-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
The following month, he made his first title defense against Andy Price. Many felt that Price would give Leonard a tough fight, but Leonard took him out in the first round, advancing his record to 25–0 with 16 knockouts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w8csAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3607,6629526&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+andy+price&hl=en |title=Star-News, September 29, 1979 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1979-09-29 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===First world title===

Leonard fought Wilfred Benitez for the WBC Welterweight Championship on November 30, 1979 at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Leonard received $1 million and Benitez, a two-division champion with a record of 38–0–1, received $1.2 million.
It was a highly competitive and tactical battle. In the first round, Leonard rocked Benitez with a left hook that came off a jab and right cross. Late in the third, Leonard dropped Benitez on the seat of his pants with a stiff left jab. More embarrassed than hurt, Benitez got up quickly.
Benitez started to do better in the fourth, slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand. "I wasn't aware I was in a championship early because I hit him so easy," Leonard said. "But then he adjusted to my style. It was like looking in a mirror."
In the sixth, there was an accidental clash of heads, which opened a cut on the forehead of Benitez. Blood flowed down his forehead and the bridge of his nose but stayed out of his eyes.
Leonard landed the harder punches and had Benitez hurt several times late in the fight, but Leonard couldn't put him away. Benitez was very slick. "No one, I mean no one, can make me miss punches like that," Leonard said.
Going into the final round, Leonard led by scores of 137–130, 137–133, and 136–134. The two went toe-to-toe in the fifteenth. Late in the round, Leonard dropped Benitez with a left. He got up, but after a few more punches, the referee stopped the fight. The time was 2:54 of round fifteen.[tpl]cite news|author=William Nack |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126376/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, December 12, 1979 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1979-12-10 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
The Boxing Writers Association of America and The Ring named Leonard "Fighter of the Year" for 1979.
Leonard made his first title defense in Landover, Maryland on March 31, 1980. His opponent was Dave "Boy" Green. The British challenger had a record of 33–2. In the fourth round, Leonard knocked Green out with a devastating left hook. Leonard called it "the hardest single punch I ever threw."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XZwcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xWcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2693,594525&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+dave+green&hl=en |title=Sarasota Herald Tribune, April 2, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===The Brawl in Montreal===

On June 20, 1980, Leonard returned to the Olympic Stadium in Montreal to defend his title against Roberto Durán before a crowd of 46,317. Durán, the former Undisputed World Lightweight Champion, had a record of 71–1 and was the #1 welterweight contender. Durán received $1.5 million and Leonard, working for a percentage of the closed-circuit gate as well as a guarantee, received over $9 million.
Angelo Dundee counseled Leonard to box, to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes. However, Leonard decided to fight Durán's way. "Flat-footed," he said. "I will not run."[tpl]cite news|author=William Nack |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123556/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, June 30, 1980 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1980-06-30 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Durán forced the issue and took the fight to Leonard, cutting off the ring and denying Leonard space to fight his fight. Durán attacked at almost every turn. Leonard battled back again and again, but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing, at times simply to survive. In the second, Durán rocked Leonard with a left hook, sending him into the ropes. Leonard started to do better by the fifth round, finding some punching room and throwing numerous multi-punch combinations. The two fought with great intensity throughout the fight. According to Bill Nack:
 It was, from almost the opening salvo, a fight that belonged to Durán. The Panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had. He took control, attacking and driving Leonard against the ropes, bulling him back, hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner. Always moving forward, he mauled and wrestled Leonard, scoring inside with hooks and rights. For three rounds Durán drove at Sugar Ray with a fury, and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five. Unable to get away, unable to counter and unable to slide away to open up the ring, Leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault. Now and then he got loose and countered—left-right-left to Durán's bobbing head—but he missed punches and could not work inside, could not jab, could not mount an offense to keep Durán at bay. 
Durán was awarded a unanimous decision, although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring. The scorecard of judge Angelo Poletti was incorrectly added and announced as 147–147. He actually scored it 148–147. In rounds, he had it three for Durán, two for Leonard, and ten even. Sports Illustrated called his scorecard "a monument to indecision." Judges Raymond Baldeyrou and Harry Gibbs scored the fight 146–144 and 145–144, respectively. The Associated Press had it 144–141 for Durán, while The New York Times had Leonard ahead 144–142.
"I did the best I could," Leonard said. "I think I pretty much fought from the heart." Asked if Leonard was the best he ever fought, Durán thought for a moment and then answered, "Si, si." Durán said. "He does have a heart. That's why he's living."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xXkjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N9MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1886,1882505&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+roberto+duran&hl=en |title=Daytona Beach Morning Journal, June 21, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-06-21 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GgseAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qlEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3075,9644208&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+roberto+duran&hl=en |title=The Dispatch, June 21, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-06-21 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===Revenge in New Orleans===

The rematch took place November 25, 1980 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Leonard received $7 million and Durán received $8 million.
Dave Jacobs disagreed with the decision to have an immediate rematch with Durán and terminated his relationship with Leonard when the rematch was made. "My idea is that he should have a tuneup fight before he fights with Roberto again," Jacobs said. "I think he won the fight with Durán, but I don't think it is healthy for him to be fighting Durán right away."The Spokesman-Review September 11, 1980
After the Montreal fight Durán went on a partying binge and ballooned in weight. Leonard was aware of this, and in an interview for Beyond the Glory he said: "My intention was to fight Durán ASAP because I knew Durán's habits. I knew he would indulge himself, he'd gain 40–50 lbs and then sweat it off to make 147." Unlike the fight in Montreal, Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Durán. "The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving," Leonard said. "And Voom! I snapped his head back with a jab. Voom! I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I'd pivot, spin off and Pow! Come under with a punch."
In round seven, Leonard started to taunt Durán. Leonard's most memorable punch came late in the round. Winding up his right hand, as if to throw a bolo punch, Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Durán flush in the face. "It made his eyes water," Leonard said. He continued to taunt Durán mercilessly. He stuck out his chin, inviting Durán to hit it. Durán hesitated. Leonard kept it up, continuing to move, stop, and mug.
In the closing seconds of the eighth round, Durán turned his back to Leonard and quit, saying to referee Octavio Meyran, "No Mas." Leonard was the winner by a technical knockout at 2:44 of round eight, regaining the WBC Welterweight Championship. Leonard led by scores of 68–66, 68–66 and 67–66.[tpl]cite news|author=William Nack |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124024/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, December 8, 1980 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1980-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Durán said he quit because of stomach cramps, caused by overeating after the weigh-in. "At the end of the fifth round, I got cramps in my stomach and it kept getting worse and worse," Duran later said. "I felt weaker and weaker in my body and arms." He then announced, "I am retiring from boxing right now." During the night Durán was admitted to a hospital with stomach pains, and discharged the following day.
Everyone was surprised by Durán's actions, none more so than his veteran trainers, Freddie Brown and Ray Arcel. "I was shocked," Brown said. "There was no indication that he was in pain or getting weak."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0pATAAAAIBAJ&sjid=swUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3414,5038011&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+roberto+duran&hl=en |title=Ocala Star-Banner, November 26, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-11-26 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Arcel was angry. "That's it," he said. "I've had it. This is terrible. I've handled thousands of fighters and never had anyone quit on me. I think he needs a psychiatrist more than he needs anything else." Durán's manager, Carlos Eleta, said, "Durán didn't quit because of stomach cramps. He quit because he was embarrassed. I know this."Roberto Duran Speaks: The Untold Story Is Finally Revealed!, Bill Brubaker, New York Daily News, 1981 According to Randy Gordon, who witnessed Durán's antics beforehand and was in his dressing room immediately afterwards, Durán quit because of his huge eating binge prior to the fight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/310/mas-version/ |title=No Mas: My Version |publisher=Thesweetscience.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
"I made him quit," Leonard said. "To make a man quit, to make Roberto Durán quit, was better than knocking him out."[tpl]cite news|author=William Nack |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124024/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, December 8, 1980 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1980-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===Second world title===

On March 28, 1981, Leonard defended his title against Larry Bonds, the WBC sixth-ranked contender, at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. Bonds was a southpaw, which made him a good opponent for Leonard, given that his next opponent was scheduled to be the WBA Light Middleweight Champion Ayub Kalule, a southpaw.
Leonard was the aggressor throughout, with Bonds circling the ring. He staggered Bonds with a right in the fourth round and dropped him with a follow-up combination. Bonds got up and continued to move, with Leonard in pursuit. Leonard dropped him again in the tenth. Bonds rose but Leonard didn't let him off the hook. The referee stopped the fight with Bonds taking punishment in a corner.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124363/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, April 6, 1981 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1981-04-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard moved up to the junior middleweight division and faced Kalule on June 25, 1981 at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Kalule, who was 36–0, had been the WBA Light Middleweight Champion for two years.
Kalule and his handlers had expected Leonard to use lateral movement against him, but Leonard took the fight to Kalule. After eight tough rounds, Leonard was ahead although Kalule appeared to be coming on strong in the eight and ninth. Leonard finally hurt him with a right to the head. Shortly afterward, Leonard dropped him with a flurry of punches. Kalule got up but the referee waved it off. Leonard celebrated his victory with a full 360-degree, no-hands flip.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124625/1/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, July 6, 1981 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1981-07-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Despite an official stoppage time of 2.59, the fight was actually stopped at 3.06 into the round, meaning Kalule should have been saved by the bell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Ayub_Kalule_vs._Sugar_Ray_Leonard |title=Ayub Kalule vs. Sugar Ray Leonard - Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21[/tpl]

===The Showdown===

Promoted as "The Showdown," Leonard fought Thomas Hearns on September 16, 1981 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to unify the World Welterweight Championship in a scheduled fifteen-rounder. They fought before a live crowd of 23,618. Hearns was paid $5.1 million, and Leonard made over $11 million.
Hearns, 32–0 with 30 knockouts, won the WBA Welterweight Championship in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of Jose 'Pipino' Cuevas in Detroit, Michigan. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.
The fight began as expected, Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns' long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer. The fight billed as a classic showdown between a powerful knockout artist and the best boxer/puncher the welterweight division had seen in decades devolved into a tactical and boring fight.
Hearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Angelo Dundee told Leonard, "You're blowing it, son! You're blowing it!".
Leonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches. Hearns' legs were clearly gone and after more pressure from Leonard he was bundled through the ropes, no knockdown was given as it wasn't a punch that sent him there. Hearns managed to rise, but was dropped by a flurry of hard punches near the end of the round.
In round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the Unified World Welterweight Championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124–122, 125–122, and 125–121.
After the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10–9 margin. Many felt that the ten-point must scoring system was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10–8.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124814/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, September 28, 1981 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1981-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Some also considered the stoppage premature. Veteran ringside commentator Don Dunphy said "They're stopping the fight. I don't believe it. Hearns was ahead on points." However, Emanuel Steward, Hearns' manager and trainer, said, "I felt that the referee was justified in stopping the fight ... Tommy did not have enough energy to make it through the fight."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_LR7s-Ui4 Showtime, "The 12 Greatest Rounds of Boxing: The Untold Stories"
The fight was named "Fight of the Year" by The Ring.
Leonard was named "Fighter of the Year" by The Ring and The Boxing Writers Association of America.

==Retirement and return==

On February 15, 1982, Leonard defended the unified title against Bruce Finch, the WBC fourth-ranked contender. Leonard knocked him out in the third round.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125270/2/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, March 1, 1982 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1982-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Leonard's next fight was scheduled to be against Roger Stafford on May 14, 1982 in Buffalo, New York. While training, Leonard started to see floaters. He went to a doctor and discovered that he had a detached retina.

On November 9, 1982, Leonard invited Marvin Hagler and other boxing dignitaries to a charity event in Baltimore, Maryland to hear him announce whether he would continue his career. Standing in a boxing ring with Howard Cosell, the master of ceremonies, Leonard announced his retirement, saying a bout with Hagler would unfortunately never happen. Leonard maintained his eye was fully healed, but that he just didn't want to box anymore.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uNYfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HNkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4277,5056212&dq=ray+leonard+cosell+retirement+hagler+baltimore&hl=en |title=The Fort Scott Tribune, November 10, 1982 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1982-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Missing the limelight and the competition, Leonard announced in December 1983 that he was returning to the ring. Leonard boasted that he would have a couple of ten-round bouts and then take on Milton McCrory, Donald Curry, Durán, Hearns and finally Hagler. This decision was met with a torrent of criticism from fans and the media, who felt Leonard was taking unnecessary risks with his surgically repaired eye.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MnobAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Tk4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6743,7041153&dq=ray+leonard+comeback&hl=en |title=The Times-News, December 12, 1983 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1983-12-12 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
A bout with Philadelphia's Kevin Howard, who was 20–4–1, was scheduled for February 25, 1984. The fight was postponed when Leonard had minor surgery on his right eye to fix a loose retina. This latest eye problem further fueled the flames of those who opposed Leonard's comeback.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZroeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vGgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2022,4806303&dq=ray+leonard+eye+kevin+howard&hl=en |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune, February 15, 1984 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Before the fight with Howard, Dave Jacobs rejoined Leonard's team in a limited role. Jacobs had quit in 1980, disagreeing with Leonard's decision to have an immediate rematch with Durán.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QLslAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FPMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,2512945&dq=leonard+dave-jacobs&hl=en |title=The Miami News, May 10, 1984 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1984-05-10 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard and Howard fought on May 11, 1984 in Worcester, Massachusetts. Howard knocked Leonard flat on his back in the fourth round. It was the first knockdown of Leonard's professional career. Leonard came back to stop Howard in the ninth round, but the stoppage was disputed, with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely. Leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. At the post-fight press conference, Leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again, saying he just didn't have it anymore.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O_8KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eVADAAAAIBAJ&pg=7143,2519858&dq=ray+leonard+kevin+howard&hl=en |title=The Courier, May 13, 1984 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1984-05-13 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===The Super Fight===

On March 10, 1986, Marvelous Marvin Hagler knocked out John "The Beast" Mugabi in eleven rounds to retain the Undisputed World Middleweight Championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to 62–2–2. "I was ringside," Leonard said. "I'm watching John 'The Beast' Mugabi outbox Hagler. Of all people, John 'The Beast' Mugabi." It was then that Leonard decided to come back and fight Hagler. He called Mike Trainer and said, "I can beat Hagler."
On May 1, 1986, Leonard announced on a Washington, D.C. talk show that he would return to the ring to fight Hagler. The announcement generated a lot of controversy because of Leonard's inactivity and eye injuries, yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier. Hagler took a few months to decide, then agreed to the match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-05/news/8701220087_1_hagler-and-leonard-marvelous-marvin-hagler-fight |title=After A Year's Prefight, Bell Tolls For These |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=1987-04-05 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
The fight, promoted as "The Super Fight," was scheduled for April 6, 1987 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Leonard was guaranteed $11 million, and Hagler was guaranteed $12 million. Hagler was a heavy favorite. The odds started at 4–1, then settled at 3–1.
The original fight plan for Leonard was to go toe-to-toe with Hagler and try to cut him, but the plan changed about five days before the fight. Leonard got hit by sparring partner Quincy Taylor and was badly buckled. "He almost knocked me out," Leonard said. After that, Leonard decided to box Hagler.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2694437 |title=Leonard's memories the stuff of legends |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Many were surprised that Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, but Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight. Hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy Leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the NBC network re-broadcast Gil Clancy to remark "...and is he ever missing...Leonard isn't doing anything to make him miss, he's just missing!"
By the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and move less. However, he was able to outpunch Hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges. Hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against Thomas Hearns two years earlier, when he brutalized Hearns and scored a third-round knockout. Hagler's punches lacked snap and, although he was scoring solidly to the body, he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years. Leonard's observation that the Hagler who beat John Mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on.
In rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent. Round nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard looked to be in trouble, but he furiously fought his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. However, Hagler's moments were more spectacular and one of Hagler's cornermen: Roger Perron (in an interview that took place on an episode of HBO's Legendary Nights episode segments in 2003) later stated that: "the ninth round was probably Marvin (Hagler)'s, best round".
Round ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with Hagler having more spectacular moments. Despite Leonard's obvious fatigue, he boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier and more eye-catching, if not as effective. But at that point in the fight, Hagler appeared to be slightly more ring-general and clearly more aggressive. Between rounds eleven and twelve, Leonard's trainer: Angelo Dundee, implored Sugar Ray to get up off his stool yelling "We got three minutes...new champ...new champ!" Leonard yelled "Yeah!" and played to the screaming crowd. Hagler's corner was much more reserved prompting Clancy to comment: "They're talking to him like it's an IBM meeting or something...no emotion." In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a furious flurry, landing few punches but whipping the upset-hoping crowd into a frenzy. Hagler backed off, and Leonard danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. At the final bell, even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding Leonard's effort.Sugar Ray...Still In Style, Nigel Collins, The Ring August 1987
Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1430F93AA35757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |title=New York Times, April 9, 1987 |publisher=New York Times |date=1987-04-09 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Ira |last=Berkow[/tpl]
Leonard was awarded a controversial split-decision. Judge Dave Moretti scored it 115–113 for Leonard, while judge Lou Filippo had it 115–113 for Hagler. Judge Jose Guerra scored the fight 118–110 for Leonard. Many felt that Hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches. British boxing journalist Hugh McIlvanney wrote that Leonard's plan was to "steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries....he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion's gloves and arms."[tpl]cite news|author=Hugh McIlvanney |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065875/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1987-04-20 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Many others felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship. Jim Murray, long-time sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, "It wasn't even close...He didn't just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes.... Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often.... He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him. If you moved, he was lost."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3cUlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iPwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3643,2396700&dq=jim-murray+sugar+ray+leonard+hagler&hl=en |title=Sugar Ray Exposed Him, Jim Murray, 1987 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1987-04-08 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
The fight was named "Fight of the Year" and "Upset of the Year" by The Ring.
Despite requests from the Hagler camp, Leonard was uninterested in a rematch and retired on May 27, 1987. "I'll try, I'll give it a shot," Leonard said of his latest retirement. "But you guys know me."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-sugar-ray-retires-again.html?pagewanted=1 |title=New York Times, May 28, 1987 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-05-28 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Dave |last=Anderson[/tpl] A month after Hagler's formal retirement in June 1988 Leonard would announce another comeback.

===Another comeback===

On November 7, 1988, Leonard made another comeback, facing Don Lalonde at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. They fought for Lalonde's WBC Light Heavyweight Championship and the newly created WBC Super Middleweight Championship, which meant that Lalonde had to make 168 lbs. Many were critical of Leonard for stipulating that his opponent—a natural 175 pounder—should weigh less than his usual fighting weight, which could possibly weaken him. However, Lalonde later told HBO's Larry Merchant that he didn't have any trouble making weight.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_LR7s-Ui4 HBO "Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Donny Lalonde"
Lalonde, 31–2 with 26 knockouts, was guaranteed at least $6 million and Leonard was guaranteed over $10 million.
This would be Leonard's first professional fight without Angelo Dundee. For Leonard's fight with Hagler, Dundee worked without a contract and received $175,000, which was less than 2% of Leonard's purse. Dundee was unhappy with that amount. He requested a contract for the Lalonde fight and Leonard refused. "I don't have contracts. My word is my bond," Leonard said. Janks Morton and Dave Jacobs trained Leonard for the Lalonde fight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mQAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DJADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6857,1391955&dq=leonard+dundee+lalonde+janks&hl=en |title=New Sunday Times, October 21, 1988 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1988-10-21 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-leonard-s-missing-voice.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The New York Times, November 6, 1988 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1988-11-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Dave |last=Anderson[/tpl]
Lalonde's size and awkwardness troubled Leonard. In the fourth round, a right hand to the top of Leonard's head dropped him for just the second time in his career. Early in the ninth, Lalonde hurt Leonard with a right to the chin. Leonard fired back and hurt Lalonde with a right. He drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault. Lalonde tried to tie up Leonard, but got dropped with a powerful left hook. He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Judges Chuck Giampa and Franz Marti had Leonard ahead by scores of 77–74 and 77–75, respectively. Judge Stuart Kirshenbaum had Lalonde ahead 76–75.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/sports/leonard-knocks-out-lalonde-to-win-two-titles.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The New York Times, November 8, 1988 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1988-11-08 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Phil |last=Berger[/tpl]
After the fight, Leonard vacated the light heavyweight title, but kept the super middleweight title. Also, Leonard and Janks Morton split because of personal differences. Morton was replaced as co-trainer by Pepe Correa, who had worked with Leonard for most of the previous fifteen years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2ZMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h2MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6893,5209299&dq=leonard+dundee+janks+pepe+hearns&hl=en |title=The Pittsburgh Press, June 9, 1989 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
On June 12, 1989, Leonard defended the WBC Super Middleweight Championship in a rematch with Thomas Hearns at Caesar's Palace. It was promoted as "The War." Hearns was guaranteed $11 million and Leonard was guaranteed $14 million.
Hearns dropped Leonard with a right cross in the third round, but Leonard came back and battered Hearns around the ring in the fifth. Early in the seventh round, Hearns hurt Leonard but punched himself out going for the knockout. With Hearns fatigued, Leonard came back and had a strong finish to the round. Rounds nine and ten were good rounds for Leonard, but he ran into trouble in the eleventh round. Three booming rights from Hearns sent Leonard down for the second time in the fight. Knowing he needed a big finish, Leonard fought furiously and had a big final round.
The judges scored the fight a draw and Leonard retained the title. Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113–112 for Hearns, Judge Tom Kazmarek scored it 113–112 for Leonard, and Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 112–112. Shirley was the only judge to give Leonard a 10–8 margin in the twelfth. If he had scored it 10–9, as his two colleagues did, Hearns would have won by a split decision. The decision was soundly booed, as most felt that Hearns had won.[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068500/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, June 19, 1989 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1989-06-19 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Eventually, Leonard admitted that Hearns deserved the decision.
On December 7, 1989, Leonard defended the title against Roberto Durán, who was the reigning WBC Middleweight Champion. Durán was guaranteed $7.6 million and Leonard's arrangement guaranteed him over $13 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/27/sports/leonard-and-duran-in-rematch-in-november.html |title=The New York Times, July 27, 1989 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-07-27 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Phil |last=Berger[/tpl]
For the Durán fight, Leonard cut his entourage from twenty-one to six. Dave Jacobs was one of the people let go, leaving Correa as the sole trainer. Correa was instructed not to spare the whip. "For the first time in a long time, I allowed someone to push me," Leonard said.
The fight took place at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard used constant lateral movement and won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision over a listless Durán. The scores were 120–110, 119–109, and 116–111. In a fight that many considered to be very boring, both fighters were booed often by the fans and many left the arena before the decision was announced. Pat Putnam of Sports Illustrated wrote, "Leonard gave them artistic perfection when they wanted heated battle, and they booed lustily. Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers, but they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear."[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069236/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, December 18, 1989 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1989-12-18 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Although Leonard dominated the fight, he suffered several cuts.

On February 9, 1991, Leonard went down to 154 lbs and fought WBC Light Middleweight Champion Terry Norris at Madison Square Garden. Leonard entered the bout as a 3-1 favorite but Norris dominated the fight, giving Leonard a heavy beating. He knocked Leonard down with a left hook in the second round, and in the seventh, he dropped Leonard again with a short right. Leonard had no answer for the skillful, younger, faster man. Leonard went the distance but lost by a lopsided decision. The scores were 120–104, 119–103, and 116–110. After the verdict was announced, Leonard announced his retirement. "It took this fight to show me it is no longer my time," Leonard said. "Tonight was my last fight. I know how Hagler felt now."[tpl]cite news|author=Pat Putnam |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1118875/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, February 18, 1991 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1991-02-18 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===The last comeback===

In October 1996, the 40-year-old Leonard announced that he was coming out of retirement to fight 34-year-old Héctor Camacho for the lightly regarded IBC Middleweight Championship. Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw, was a three-time world champion with a record of 62–3–1. However, Camacho was also considered to be past his prime. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on his fight with the 45-year-old Roberto Duran the previous year. Camacho won by a disputed unanimous decision, which Leonard called "an early Christmas gift."
Leonard blamed his poor performance against Norris on lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. "It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs," Leonard said. "This is different. I'm in the best shape possible."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/26/sports/leonard-s-corner-keeps-game-plan-draped-in-secrecy.html |title=The New York Times, February 26, 1997 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1997-02-26 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Clifton |last=Brown[/tpl]
For the Camacho fight, Leonard had a new trainer, Adrian Davis. "He's a great trainer, a throwback," Leonard said. "He has really helped me get ready."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/sports/before-the-first-bell-rings-the-jabbing-begins.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The New York Times, February 27, 1997 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1997-02-27 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Clifton |last=Brown[/tpl]
In January 1997, it was announced that Leonard had been voted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in Canastota, New York. The rules state that a boxer must be retired for five years before being eligible for induction. When the vote took place, Leonard had been retired for more than five years, therefore, he was eligible, even though he had a fight scheduled. The induction ceremony was on June 15, 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X24KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C0sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2208,2433810&dq=ray+leonard+international+boxing+hall+of+fame&hl=en |title=The Victoria Advocate, January 15, 1997 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1997-01-15 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
The fight with Camacho took place on March 1, 1997 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Camacho applied pressure from the opening bell and started to score well in the third. He continued to score well in the fourth and opened a cut above Leonard's right eye. In the fifth, Camacho dropped Leonard with a right followed by two left uppercuts. Leonard got up, but was unable to ward off Camacho. The referee stopped the fight with Camacho teeing off on a defenseless Leonard on the ropes. It was the only time in Leonard's career that he was knocked out.
Afterward, Leonard retired again, saying, "For sure, my career is definitely over for me in the ring." However, less than a week after the fight, Leonard said he planned to fight again. He blamed his loss on a torn right calf muscle. His doctor suggested that he cancel the fight, but Leonard wanted to go through with it. Before the fight, he was given a shot of novocaine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-LwvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eN0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4310,9033500&dq=ray+leonard+hector+camacho&hl=en |title=The Southern Missourian, March 3, 1997 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1997-03-03 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

Leonard has worked as a boxing analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, HBO and EPIX. His relationship with HBO lasted for more than a decade. It ended in 1990, after HBO was not offered an opportunity to bid on the telecast rights to Leonard's fight with Terry Norris. HBO believed it would be inappropriate for Leonard to continue with them if they couldn't bid on his fights. Leonard's attorney, Mike Trainer, said, "There never has been a linkage between his broadcasting and his fighting."[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/dailypress/access/88522553.html?dids=88522553:88522553&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+16%2C+1990&author=From+staff%2C+wire+reports&pub=Daily+Press&desc=SIDELINES%3A+MIFFED+HBO+KO%27S+SUGAR+RAY+OVER+FIGHT+TELECAST+RIGHTS&pqatl=google |title=Daily Press, October 16, 1990 |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1990-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Leonard has provided commercial endorsements for companies including Coca-Cola, EA Sports, Ford, Nabisco, Revlon  and 7 Up. His most famous commercial was a 7 Up ad he did with his son, Ray Jr., Roberto Durán and Durán's son Roberto Jr. in the early 1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Au0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LH8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6410,6001894&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+son+7+up&hl=en |title=The Cavalier Daily, April 30, 1982 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1982-04-30 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl][tpl]youtube|id=VkFgBBPzW_U|title=Sugar Ray Leonard 7 Up commercial[/tpl] Leonard is among the most sought-after motivational/inspirational speakers in the world today.

Leonard has also worked as an actor. He has appeared in numerous television shows, including Half & Half, L.A. Heat, Married With Children, Renegade and Tales From The Crypt. He has also appeared in several movies, including I Spy and most recently The Fighter, starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. This movie brought back memories of his fight with Dicky Eklund. He also worked as an adviser in the 2011 robot boxing film Real Steel. Leonard served as host and mentor to the aspiring fighters on The Contender. Sylvester Stallone, who co-hosted during the first season, was one of the executive producers, along with Mark Burnett. When Leonard left the show, he was replaced as host by Tony Danza for the final season.[tpl]IMDb title|0416359|The Contender[/tpl]

I took great pride in it. But the TV show came about and made my decision a lot easier. I already had it in the back of my mind to dissolve the company. The working environment was not healthy."[tpl]cite news|last=Rafael |first=Dan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-10-19-leonard-business_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 19, 2004 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2004-10-19 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

Their six-year-old son, Ray Jr., served as the ring bearer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DsspAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3u4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2968,2889272&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+juanita+wilkinson&hl=en |title=The Spokesman-Review, January 21, 1980 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] In 1984, they had another son, Jarrel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=adAyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fKcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2883,8111774&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+juanita+jarrel&hl=en |title=Anchorage Daily News, June 15, 1984 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1984-06-15 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
They were divorced in 1990. During divorce proceedings, Juanita Leonard accused her husband of physically abusing her while under the influence of alcohol. She also said he was an occasional cocaine user.
After the Los Angeles Times broke the story, Leonard held a press conference and acknowledged that the accusations were true. He said he started using after he retired in 1982, following surgery to repair a detached retina. "I wanted more," Leonard said. "I wanted that arena. I didn't want anyone to tell me my career had to end."
"I decided to search for a substitute...I resorted to cocaine. I used when I felt bad, I used when I missed competing at that level," he said. "It was a crutch, something that enabled me to forget."
He said he quit using drugs in early 1986, when he woke up one morning and "what I saw in the mirror was scary."
"I can never erase the pain or the scars I have made through my stupidity, my selfishness," Leonard said. "All I can do is say I'm sorry, but that is not enough."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2hAbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FEgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6730,6962641&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+juanita+divorce&hl=en |title=Daily News, March 31, 1991 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1991-03-31 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
In 2011, Sugar Ray revealed in an NPR broadcast that he had been free of alcohol since July 2006.
In 1989, Leonard was introduced to Bernadette Robi by Kenny G at a Luther Vandross concert. Robi is the daughter of Paul Robi, one of the original Platters and she is the ex-wife of Lynn Swann.
Leonard and Robi were married at Leonard's $8.7 million estate in Pacific Palisades, California in August 1993. At the wedding ceremony, the grounds were converted into a garden with 10,000 roses and blossoms of other flowers flown in from the Netherlands. They have two children, Camille and Daniel Ray.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_leonard_sugar_ray.html |title=Duran wanted "no mas" of Leonard |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2003-11-19 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
