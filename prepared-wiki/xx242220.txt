Teglholmen (English: The Tiles Islet) is a peninsula in the South Harbour of Copenhagen, Denmark, located between Sluseholmen and Enghave Brygge. As part of the Southern Docklands of the Port of Copenhagen, the area used to house. While some industry activities remain in the area, but since most industry left the area, starting in the 1970s, it has undergone massive redevelopment, though some industrial activities remain, most notably  MAN B&W Diesel's motor development plant. Today the area houses both a considerable number of Danish and regional headquarters of multinational companies and residential developments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/article/20060515/nyhedsoversigt/105150198/|title=TV2 samles på Teglholmen|publisher=Berlingske Tidende|accessdate=2009-01-10[/tpl]

==History==

Teglholmen takes its name from a tile works whch established in the area in 1871, for many years supplying particularly Vesterbro with tiles. Around World War I, the tile works closed and the extensive clay pit was turned into a new harbour basin by connecting it to  the main harbour, forming what is today known as Teglværkshavnen, separating Teglholmen from Sluseholmen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.byoghavn.dk/da-DK/Byomraader/Teglholmen.aspx|title=Teglholmen|publisher=By & Havn|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] The next generation of companies to establish in the area were shipyards, foundries and a car assembly plant.
In the 1970s, the industryial activities in the Teglholmen area started to close and from the end of the 1990s, a number of multinational companies started to establish Danish or Regional headquarters at Teglværkshavnen. From the middle of the 2000s, Tegljolmen also started to attract residential developments. In 2006, Odense-based  TV2 collected its Copenhagen activities in a new media house at Teglholmen.
