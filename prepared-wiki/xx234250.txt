CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera, Flora of Australia

Lawrencella is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family endemic to Australia. 
The genus comprises two species: Lawrencella davenportii with a distribution in arid regions of Western Australia, The Northern Territory, and South Australia and Lawrencella rosea which is restricted to Southern Western Australia. Wilson, P.G. 1998 “The  Lawrencella complex (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae: Angianthinae) of Australia” Nuytsia 8:3
Both species are annual herbs growing to approximately 40cm in height. The strap-shaped leaves up to 10cm in length are covered with short hairs.  Flower heads are produce don stalks well above the main leaves, and have yellow centres with pink or occasionally white bracts. Flowering usually occurs in spring or summer in years with good cool season rain. Corrick, M.G., Alexander, B. 2002. “Wildflowers of Southern Western Australia” Five Mile Press, Noble Park.http://asgap.org.au/l-ros.html
Both species have horticultural potential for their colourful flower displays and their drought hardiness. However, difficulties in germination of seed have restricted their widespread cultivation to datehttp://asgap.org.au/l-ros.html http://www.ngia.com.au/files/nurserypapers/NP_1996_06.pdf
The genus Lawrencella is closely related to two other Australian genera, Schoenia and Bellida.
