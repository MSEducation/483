[tpl]nihongo|Tokyo Imperial Palace|皇居|Kōkyo|literally, "Imperial Residence"[/tpl] is the main residence of the Emperor of Japan. It is a large park-like area located in the Chiyoda area of Tokyo close to Tokyo Station and contains several buildings including the main palace ([tpl]nihongo|宮殿|Kyūden[/tpl], the private residences of the imperial family, an archive, museum and administrative offices.
It is built on the site of the old Edo castle. The total area including the gardens is [tpl]convert|3.41|sqkm|mi2[/tpl]. During the height of the 1980s Japanese property bubble, the palace grounds were valued by some as more than the value of all the real estate in the state of California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/2891993/Oriental-risks-and-rewards-for-optimistic-occidentals.html |title=Oriental risks and rewards for optimistic occidentals |accessdate=2013-05-07 |author=Ian Cowie |date=7 August 2004 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/02/what-was-lost-and-found-in-japans-lost-decade |title=What Was Lost (and Found) in Japan's Lost Decade |accessdate=2011-09-02 |author=Edward Jay Epstein |date=17 February 2009 |work=Vanity Fair |publisher=VF Daily[/tpl]

==History==

===Edo castle===

After the capitulation of the Shogunate and the Meiji Restoration, the inhabitants, including the Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, were required to vacate the premises of the Edo Castle. Leaving Kyoto Imperial Palace, on 26 November 1868 the emperor arrived at Edo castle, made it to his new residence and renamed it to [tpl]nihongo|Tōkei Castle|東京城|Tōkei-jō[/tpl]. At this time Tōkyō had also been called Tōkei. He left for Kyōto again, and after coming back on 9 May 1869 it was renamed to [tpl]nihongo|Imperial Castle|皇城|Kōjō[/tpl].http://www.wdic.org/w/CUL/%E7%9A%87%E5%B1%85
Previous fires had destroyed the Honmaru area containing the old donjon (which itself burned in the 1657 Meireki fire). On the night of 5 May 1873, a fire consumed the Nishinomaru Palace (formerly the shogun's residence), and the new imperial [tpl]nihongo|Palace Castle|宮城|Kyūjō[/tpl] was constructed on the site in 1888.
A non-profit "Rebuilding Edo-jo Association" (NPO江戸城再建) was founded in 2004 with the aim of a historically correct reconstruction of at least the main donjon. In March 2013 Naotaka Kotake, head of the group, said that "The capital city needs a symbolic building," and that the group planned to collect donations and signatures on a petition in support of rebuilding the tower. A reconstruction blueprint had been made based on old documents. The Imperial Household Agency at the time had not indicated whether it would support the project.[tpl]cite web |url=http://npo-edojo.org/|title=Rebuilding "Edo-jo" Association |accessdate=2008-09-17 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl] Daily Yomiuri NPO wants to restore Edo Castle glory March 21, 2013 

===Old palace===

In the Meiji era, most structures from Edo Castle disappeared.  Some were cleared to make way for other buildings while others were destroyed by earthquakes and fire. For example, the wooden [tpl]nihongo|double bridges|二重橋|Nijūbashi[/tpl] over the moat were replaced with stone and iron bridges. The buildings of the Imperial Palace constructed in the Meiji era were constructed of wood.  Their design employed traditional Japanese architecture in their exterior appearance while the interiors were an eclectic mixture of then-fashionable Japanese and European elements. The ceilings of the grand chambers were coffered with Japanese elements; however, Western chairs, tables, and heavy curtains furnished the spaces. The floors of the public rooms had parquets or carpets while the residential spaces used traditional tatami mats.
The main audience hall was the central part of the palace. It was the largest building in the compound. Guests were received there for public events. The floor space was more than 223 tsubo or approximately [tpl]convert|737.25|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the interior, the coffered ceiling was traditional Japanese-style, while the floor was parquetry. The roof was styled similarly to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, but was covered with (fireproof) copper plates rather than Japanese cypress shingles.
In the late Taisho and early Showa eras, more concrete buildings were added, such as the headquarters of the Imperial Household Ministry and the Privy Council. These structures exhibited only token Japanese elements.
From 1888 to 1948, the compound was called [tpl]nihongo|Palace Castle|宮城|Kyūjō[/tpl]. On the night of 25 May 1945, most structures of the Imperial Palace were destroyed in the Allied firebombing raid on Tokyo. Emperor Showa (Hirohito) declared the capitulation of Japan from the basement of the concrete library on 15 August 1945, ending World War II. Due to the large-scale destruction of the Meiji-era palace, a new main palace hall ([tpl]nihongo|Kyūden|宮殿[/tpl]) and residences were constructed on the western portion of the site in the 1960s. The area was renamed [tpl]nihongo|Imperial Residence|皇居|Kōkyo[/tpl] in 1948 while the eastern part was renamed [tpl]nihongo|East Garden|東御苑|Higashi-Gyoen[/tpl] and became a public park in 1968.

===Present palace===

The present Imperial Palace encompasses the retrenchments of the former Edo Castle. The modern palace [tpl]nihongo|Kyūden|宮殿[/tpl] for various imperial court functions is located in the old Nishinomaru, while the residence of the emperor and empress is located in the Fukiage Gardens. 
Except for Imperial Household Agency and the East Gardens, the palace is generally closed to the public. Each New Year (January 2) and Emperor's Birthday, the public is permitted to enter through the Nakamon (inner gate) where they gather in the Kyuden Totei Plaza in front of the Chowaden Hall. The imperial family appears on the balcony before the jubilant crowd and the emperor normally gives a short speech greeting and thanking the visitors and wishing them good health and blessings.
Every year a poetry convention called Utakai Hajime is held at the palace on January 1.[tpl]cite web|title=Ceremony of the Utakai Hajime|url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-culture/utakai.html|publisher=Imperial Household Agnecy|accessdate=13 November 2012[/tpl] 
The old Honmaru, Ninomaru, and Sannomaru compounds now comprise the East Gardens, an area with public access containing administrative and other public buildings.
The Kitanomaru Park is located to the north and is the former northern enceinte of Edo Castle. It is a public park and is the site of Nippon Budokan Hall. To the south are the outer gardens of the Imperial Palace (Kōkyo-gaien), which are also a public park.

===Kyūden===

The Imperial Palace ([tpl]nihongo|Kyūden|宮殿[/tpl]) and the headquarters of the Imperial Household Agency are located in the former Nishinomaru enceinte (West Citadel) of the Edo Castle.[tpl]cite news| author= Takahiro Fukada| work=The Japan Times |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100120i1.html| title= Imperial Palace resides in otherworldly expanse: History abounds in cultural and religious preserve in heart of metropolis |date= 20 January 2010| page= 3| accessdate=[/tpl]
The main buildings of the palace grounds, including the ([tpl]nihongo|Kyūden|宮殿[/tpl]) main palace, home of the liaison conference of the Imperial General Headquarters, were severely damaged by the fire of May 1945. Today's palace consists of multiple modern structures that are interconnected. The palace complex was finished in 1968 and was constructed of steel-framed reinforced concrete structures produced domestically, with two stories above ground and one story below. The buildings of the Imperial Palace were constructed by the Takenaka Corporation in a modernist style with clear Japanese architectural references such as the large, gabled hipped roof, columns and beams.
The complex consists of seven wings, including:
Halls include the Minami-Damari, Nami-no-Ma, multiple Kairo, Kita-Kurumayose, Kita-Damari, Syakkyo-no-Ma, Shunju-no-Ma, Seiden-Sugitoe (Kaede), Seiden-Sugitoe (Sakura), Take-no-Ma, Ume-no-Ma and Matsu-no-Ma.
The ([tpl]nihongo|Kyūden|宮殿[/tpl]) is used for both receiving state guests and holding official state ceremonies and functions. The Matsu-no-Ma (Pine Chamber) is the throne room, the emperor gives audiences to the prime minister here as well as to newly appointed or departing ambassadors.

===Fukiage Garden===

The Fukiage Garden has carried the name since the Edo period and is used as the residential area for the imperial family.
The [tpl]nihongo|Fukiage Ōmiya Palace|吹上大宮御所|Fukiage Ōmiya-gosho[/tpl] in the northern section was originally the residence of Emperor Showa and Empress Kōjun and was called the Fukiage Palace. After the Emperor's death in 1989, the palace was renamed the Fukiage Ōmiya Palace and was the residence of the Empress Dowager until her death in 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e07/ed07-01-02-01.html |title=The Imperial Palace and other Imperial Household Establishments |accessdate=16 October 2008 | date= |publisher=Imperial Household Agency[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The palace precincts include the Three Palace Sanctuaries (Kyūchū-sanden, 宮中三殿). Parts of the Imperial Regalia of Japan are kept here and the sanctuary plays a religious role in imperial coronations and weddings.

==East Garden==

The East Garden is where most of the administrative buildings for the palace are located and encompasses the former Honmaru and Ninomaru areas of Edo Castle, a total of [tpl]convert|210000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Located on the grounds of the East Garden is the Imperial Tokagakudo Music Hall, the Music Department of the Board of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household, the Archives and Mausolea Department Imperial Household Agency, structures for the guards such as the Saineikan dojo, and the Museum of the Imperial Collections. 
Several structures that were added since the Meiji period were removed over time to allow construction of the East Garden. In 1932, the kuretake-ryō was built as a dormitory for imperial princesses, however this building was removed prior to the construction of the present gardens. Other buildings such as stables and housing were removed to create the East Garden in its present configuration. 
Construction work began in 1961 with a new pond in the Ninomaru, as well as the repair and restoration of various keeps and structures from the Edo period. On 30 May 1963, the area was declared by the Japanese government a "Special Historic Relic" under the Cultural Properties Protection Law.

===Tōkagakudō (Music Hall)===

The Tōkagakudō (Peach Blossom Music Hall,桃華楽堂) is located to the east of the former main donjon of Edo Castle in the Honmaru. This music hall was built in commemoration of the 60th birthday of Empress Kojun on 6 March 1963. The ferro-concrete building covers a total area of [tpl]convert|1254|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. The hall is octahedron-shaped and each of its eight outer walls is decorated with differently designed mosaic tiles. Construction began in August 1964 and was completed in February 1966.

===Ninomaru Garden===

Symbolic trees representing each prefecture in Japan are planted in the northwestern corner of Ninomaru enceinte. Such trees have been donated from each prefecture and there are total of 260, covering 30 varieties.

===Suwa no Chaya===

The Suwa no Chaya is a teahouse that was located in the Fukiage Garden during the Edo period. It was moved to the Akasaka Detached Palace after the Meiji restoration but was reconstructed in its original location in 1912. It was moved to the present location with the construction of the East Garden.

==Kitanomaru==

The Kitanomaru Park is located to the north and is the former northern enceinte of Edo Castle. It is a public park and is the site of Nippon Budokan Hall.

==Kōkyo-gaien==
