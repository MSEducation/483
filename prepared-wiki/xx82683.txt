==Family and background==

Locke was born and grew up in Christchurch, to Jack and Elsie Locke, prominent lifelong political activists for a wide variety of causes. Their four children were brought up in this environment and followed their parents into a life of activism, (as well as Keith, his sister Maire Leadbeater is a well-known activist and former city councillor for Auckland City Council). Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon is said to have described the Lockes as the most "notorious Communist family in New Zealand". The Lockes lived in the Avon Loop area of the Christchurch Central City and were very active in the community notably organising Avon River clean-ups and native tree planting and arguing against development of the area, and in favour of retaining the character of the area.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.converge.org.nz/abc/elsobit.htm |title=Obituary Elsie Locke |first=Murray last=Horton |accessdate=26 October 2013[/tpl]

==Political history==

Politically active all his life, he joined the Socialist Action League (SAL) in 1970. By 1972 he was both the National Secretary of the SAL and chairman of "Socialists for Labour". By 1985 Locke had left the SAL but was still involved in various issue movements. These included Latin America, the Philippines and East Timor solidarity movements and the anti-nuclear movement.
In 1989 Jim Anderton broke away from the Labour Party to form the NewLabour Party (NLP). Locke as well as several other former SAL members were given roles in the NLP's first National Council. Locke was their foreign affairs spokesperson and stood as the NLP candidate for Eden in the 1990 election.
In December 1991 the NLP merged with the Greens, Mana Motuhake and the Democrats to form the Alliance Party. Locke continued as foreign affairs spokesperson for the Alliance and stood in Eden in the 1993 election and Owairaka in the 1996 election.
However, by 1997 the Greens had decided to leave the Alliance. Soon after Locke left the Alliance and joined the Greens where he was made foreign affairs spokesperson.

===Political viewpoints===

As a Member of Parliament, Locke has established a profile of being an "unofficial civil liberties watchdog". Recently, Locke has been involved in campaigns against the New Zealand Police being armed with Taser guns, and repeal of the law of sedition.
Locke is a supporter of a New Zealand republic. In his maiden speech, Locke stated "We should also break free of the British Crown and become a republic. The question is not whether the monarchy has a lot of power over us. In practice it doesn't. The problem is that bowing before the British Queen reflects a colonial mentality."Keith Locke's Maiden Speech, 1999 In 2002, Locke put forward the Head of State (Referenda) Bill, which if passed would bring about a referendum on the question of whether New Zealand should become a republic.[tpl]cite new |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=940393 |title=Republic Bill near |accessdate=19 September 2007 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |author=New Zealand Press Association |date=21 February 2002 |accessdate=26 October 2013[/tpl] The Bill was drawn from the Ballot of members' Bills on 14 October 2009[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7B3B73E3-47FC-456C-83D3-8BA19D6A5BAC/115528/00HOH20091015_orderpaper1.pdf |date=15 October 2009 |title=Parliament of New Zealand Order Paper, Thursday 15 October 2009[/tpl] but defeated at its first reading in April 2010.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3609674/Queen-to-be-kept-as-NZ-head-of-state/ |title=Queen to be kept as NZ head of state |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2010[/tpl]

==Controversy==

His political enemies have referred to him during question time as "Pol Pot" or "the Honourable Member for Cambodia" due to supportive articles he wrote while editor of the New Zealand Socialist Action newspaper about the Khmer Rouge regime under the headline; Cambodia liberated: victory for humanity. Locke has claimed his initial support for the Khmer Rouge was because "...many people thought the Khmer Rouge were an adjunct of the Vietnamese communist forces" and that he thought they "...would be better than the regimes they replaced". He also responded that he renounced his support after hearing of their atrocities, while the New Zealand Government of the time continued to express support for the regime.[tpl]cite web | url= https://www.greens.org.nz/speeches/people-glass-houses-should-not-throw-pol-pots |title=People in glass houses should not throw (Pol) Pots |first=Keith |last=Locke |date=22 June 2005 |accessdate=26 October 2013[/tpl]
Similarly, while he opposed the 2001 war in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban, he wrote an article (in Socialist Action) entitled "Why workers should support Soviet action in Afghanistan" in 1980. This led to accusations of hypocrisy.Parliamentary Debate: Terrorist Attacks---Retaliation against Afghanistan, New Zealand Hansard, 18 September 2001 Locke explained that his previous support for the Soviet invasion was the position of the Socialist Action League, that he was wrong to have supported it, that he was incorrect in believing it would protect human rights in Afghanistan, and that he now believes it encouraged Islamic extremist groups.Personal Explanation - Alleged Support of Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, New Zealand Hansard, 10 October 2001
During the 2005 election he contested the Epsom electorate in Auckland and at a public meeting he promised to run through the streets of Epsom naked if the electorate was won by ACT New Zealand's leader Rodney Hide. Hide won the seat. "I'll do it. I have to," Locke was reported as saying. "I was so confident, but I have turned out to be wrong and I have got to do it."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10346229 |title=Locke really regretting nude run promise |author=Claire Harvey |date=19 September 2005 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=10 September 2011[/tpl] Locke's promise made headlines in media around the world.Editor's insight Nevil GibsonBBC news On Sunday 25 September 2005 Locke walked near-naked down Broadway (a main shopping street in Newmarket, Auckland) wearing shoes, socks, a G-string, and body paint.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/author/story.cfm?a_id=74&ObjectID=10347301 |title=Locke learns the art of losing gracefully |first=Claire |last=Trevett |date=26 September 2005 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=10 September 2011[/tpl] The paint camouflaged Locke's skin by depicting a suit and tie from the neck down.
