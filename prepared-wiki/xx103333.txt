[[Schiffler point]]

CATEGORIES: Triangle centers

In geometry, the Schiffler point of a triangle is a point defined from the triangle that is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the triangle. This point was first defined and investigated by Schiffler et al. (1985).
A triangle ABC with the incenter I has its Schiffler point at the point of concurrence of the Euler lines of the four triangles BCI, CAI, ABI, and ABC. Schiffler's theorem states that these lines are concurrent.
Trilinear coordinates for the Schiffler point are
or, equivalently,
where a, b, and c denote the side lengths of triangle ABC.
