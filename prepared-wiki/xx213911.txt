Slug is a common name for an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word "slug" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, has a very reduced shell, or has only a small internal shell (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can retract its soft parts fully into it).
Slugs exist on land and in the sea, and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs, Acochlidium. The unadorned word "slug" is however applied primarily to land slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as "sea slugs" or "freshwater slugs". Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial, but is too small to retract into (like many in the family Urocyclidae), are known as semislugs.
Various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, for example, the various families of land slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category "slug" is emphatically a polyphyletic one.
Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation—but externally, the bodies of land slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the pneumostome, which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry. The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs.

==Taxonomy==

Of the six orders of Pulmonata, two – the Onchidiacea and Soleolifera – solely comprise slugs. A third family, the Sigmurethra, contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs.[tpl]cite journal|author= Burton, D. W. |year= 1982 |title=How to be sluggish |journal=Tuatara |volume=25|issue=2 |pages=48–63|url= http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bio25Tuat02-t1-body-d2.html[/tpl] The taxonomy of this group is in the process of being revised in the light of DNA sequencing.White, T. R.; Conrad, M. M.; Tseng, R.; Balayan, S.; Golding, R.; de Frias Martins, A. M. & Dayrat, B. A. (2011). "Ten new complete mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates (Mollusca: Gastropoda) and their impact on phylogenetic relationships". BMC Evolutionary Biology 11 (1): 295 It appears that pulmonates are paraphyletic and basal to the opisthobranchs, which are a terminal branch of the tree. The family Ellobiidae are also polyphyletic.

==Description==

Like other pulmonate land gastropods, the majority of land slugs have two pairs of 'feelers' or tentacles on their head. The upper pair is light sensing and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the sense of smell. Both pairs are retractable, and can be regrown if lost.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
On top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped mantle, and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a respiratory opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the pneumostome. Within the tissue of the mantle in some species is a very small, rather flat shell, or in some other cases a collection of calcareous granules.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Like most gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscular contraction on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of mucus that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues.[tpl]cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|coauthors=Gosline, J. M.|title=The physical properties of the pedal mucus of the terrestrial slug, Ariolimax columbianus|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1980|volume=88|pages=375–393|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/88/1/375.full.pdf[/tpl] Around the edge of the foot is the 'foot fringe' or 'skirt'.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Most slugs retain a remnant of their shell, which is usually internalized. This organ generally serves as storage for calcium salts, often in conjunction with the digestive glands.[tpl]cite jstor|30155937[/tpl] An internal shell is present in the Limacidae[ref]
</ref> and Parmacellidae.<ref>

==Physiology==

Slugs' bodies are made up mostly of water, and without a full-sized shell, their soft tissues are prone to desiccation. They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under tree bark, fallen logs, rocks, and man-made structures, such as planters, to help retain body moisture.
Slugs produce two types of mucus: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are hygroscopic. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.
The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The "slime trail" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs. Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful.[tpl]cite web|last=Nixon|first=P|title=Slugs|url=http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/pastpest/199809g.html|work=Home, Yard & Garden Pest Newsletter|publisher=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois|accessdate=14 December 2012[/tpl] Some species of slug, such as Limax maximus, secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.

==Reproduction==

Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both female and male reproductive organs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/24/perverted-cannibalistic-hermaphrodites-haunt-the-pacific-northwest/ |title=Perverted cannibalistic hermaphrodites haunt the Pacific Northwest! « The Oyster’s Garter |publisher=Theoystersgarter.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl] Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later, the slugs lay around thirty eggs in a hole in the ground, or beneath the cover of an object such as a fallen log.
Apophallation is a commonly seen practice among many slugs. In apophallating species, the penis curls like a corkscrew and during mating, it often becomes entangled in the mate's genitalia. Apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves by one or both of the slugs chewing off the other's penis. Once its penis has been removed, the slug is still able to mate using only the female parts of its reproductive system.

==Ecology==

Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem by eating decaying plant material and fungi. Most carnivorous slugs on occasion also eat dead of their own kind.

===Feeding habits===

Most species of slugs are generalists, feeding on a broad spectrum of organic materials, including leaves from living plants, lichens, mushrooms, and even carrion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://diet.yukozimo.com/what-do-slugs-eat/ |title=What Do Slugs Eat?|publisher=Diet.yukozimo.com |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Keller|first=H.

Published 10 July 2008. Retrieved 10 July 2008.
Slugs can feed on a wide variety of vegetables and herbs, including flowers such as petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies, daffodils, narcissus, gentians, primroses, tuberous begonias, hollyhocks, irises, and fruits such as strawberries. They also feed on carrots, peas, apples, and cabbage that are offered as a sole food source.
Slugs from different families are fungivores. It is the case in the Philomycidae (e. g. Philomycus carolinianus and Phylomicus flexuolaris) and Ariolimacidae (Ariolimax californianus), which respectively feed on slime molds (myxomycetes) and mushrooms (basidiomycetes). Species of mushroom producing fungi used as food source by slugs include milk-caps, Lactarius spp., the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus and the penny bun, Boletus edulis. Other species pertaining to different genera, such as Agaricus, Pleurocybella and Russula, are also eaten by slugs. Slime molds used as food source by slugs include Stemonitis axifera and Symphytocarpus flaccidus. Some slugs are selective towards certain parts or developmental stages of the fungi they eat, though this is very variable. Depending on the species and other factors, slugs eat only fungi at specific stages of development. Moreover, in other cases, whole mushrooms can be eaten, without any selection or bias towards ontogenetic stages.

===Predators===

Slugs are preyed upon by a myriad of vertebrates and invertebrates. The predation of slugs has been the subject of studies for at least a century. Because some species of slugs are considered agricultural pests, research investments have been made to comprehend and investigate potential predators. This is a necessary knowledge to establish biological control strategies.

====Vertebrates====

Slugs are preyed upon by virtually every major vertebrate group. With many examples among reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians and fish, vertebrates can occasionally feed on, or be specialized predators of slugs. Fish that feed on slugs include the brown trout, (Salmo trutta), which occasionally feeds on Arion circumscriptus, an arionid slug.[tpl]cite book|last=South|first=A.|title=Terrestrial Slugs: Biology, ecology and control|year=1992|publisher=Chapman & Hall|location=Boundary Row, London, UK|isbn=0412368102|pages=428 pp[/tpl] Similarly, the shortjaw kokopu (Galaxias postvectis) includes slugs in its diet.[tpl]cite journal|last=McDowall|first=R. M.|coauthors=Main, M. R.; West, D. W.; Lyon, G. L.|title=Terrestrial and benthic foods in the diet of the shortjawed kokopu, Galaxias postvectis Clarke (Teleostei: Galaxiidae)|journal=New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research|year=1996|volume=30|issue=2|pages=257–269|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00288330.1996.9516713|doi=10.1080/00288330.1996.9516713[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Amphibians such as frogs and toads have long been regarded as important predators of slugs. Among them are species in the genus Bufo (e. g.  Bufo marinus) and Ceratophrys.
Reptiles that feed on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some colubrid snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal populations of the garter snake,Thamnophis elegans, have a specialized diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Britt|first=E. J.|coauthors=Hicks, J. W.; Bennett, A. F.|title=The energetic consequences of dietary specialization in populations of the garter snake, Thamnophis elegans|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=2006|volume=209|pages=3164–3169|doi=10.1242/jeb.02366|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/16/3164.full|issue=16[/tpl] One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters.[tpl]cite journal|last=Maia|first=T|coauthors=Dorigo, T.

Birds that prey upon slugs include common blackbirds,  starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), jackdaws (Corvus monedula), owls, vultures and ducks. Studies on slug predation also cite fieldfares (feeding on Deroceras reticulatum), redwings (feeding on Limax and Arion), thrushes (on Limax and Arion ater), red grouse (on Deroceras and Arion hortensis), game birds, wrynecks (on Limax flavus), rock doves and charadriiform birds as slug predators.
Mammals that eat slugs, include foxes, badgers and hedgehogs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cardiff.ac.uk/biosi/staffinfo/wocs2.html |title=Slugs |publisher=Cardiff.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl]

===Parasites and parasitoids===

Slugs are parasitised by several organisms, including acari and a wide variety of nematodes.[tpl]cite journal |pages=487–9 |doi=10.1590/S0074-02761993000300020 |title=On the diversity of mollusc intermediate hosts of Angiostrongylus costaricensis Morera & Cespedes, 1971 in southern Brazil |year=1993|last1=Teixeira |first1=C.

Several species of nematodes are known to parasitise slugs. The nematode worms Agfa flexilis and Angiostoma limacis respectively live in the salivary glands and rectum of Limax maximus.Taylor J. W. (1902). Part 8, pages 1-52. Monograph of the land and freshwater Mollusca of the British Isles. Testacellidae. Limacidae. Arionidae. Taylor Brothers, Leeds. Introduction page XV., pages 34-52. Species of widely known medical importance pertaining to the genus Angiostrongylus are also parasites of slugs. Both Angiostrongylus costaricensis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a meningitis-causing nematode, have larval stages that can only live in mollusks, including slugs, such as Limax maximus.
Insects such as dipterans are known parasitoids of mollusks. To complete their development, many dipterans use slugs as hosts during their ontogeny. Some species of blow-flies (Calliphoridae) in the genus Melinda are known parasitoids of Arionidae, Limacidae and Philomycidae. Flies in the family Phoridae, specially those in the genus Megaselia, are parasitoids of Agriolimacidae, including many species of Deroceras.[tpl]cite journal|last=Robinson|first=W.

==Behavior==

When attacked, slugs can contract their body, making themselves harder and more compact. By doing this, they become firmly attached to the substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general behavioral pattern, the Kerry slug retracts its head, lets go of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape.[ref]
