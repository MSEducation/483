==Battelle-Geneva's pioneering work on NiMH, 1967==

The pioneering work on NiMH batteries - essentially based on sintered Ti2Ni+TiNi+x alloys for the negative electrode and NiOOH-electrodes for the positives - was performed at the Battelle Geneva Research Center starting after its invention in 1967: The development work was sponsored over nearly 2 decades by Daimler-Benz Comp./Stuttgart and by Volkswagen AG. within the framework of Deutsche Automobilgesellschaft. The batteries showed high energy and power densities up to 50 Wh/kg, 1000 W/kg and a reasonable cycle life of 500 cycles. - Patent applications were filed in European countries (priority: Switzerland), USA and Japan and the patents transferred to Daimler-Benz Comp./Stuttgart.  - Ref: Elektrode zur Speicherung und Aktivierung von Wasserstoff",  K.D. Beccu, Battelle-Geneva,  CH Priority Application No. 6333/67-Bb3/CH/2 - (2.05.1967),  Patent: DE 2317505 C2 (18.10.73). Negative electrode of Ti-Ni alloy hydride phases, US patent US 3,669,745 (06/13,1972), inventor: K.D. Beccu, Ph.D, Battelle-Geneva R&D Center. See also NiMH batteries   
The "invented NiMH variation" of Mr. Ovshinsky consisted in special alloys with disordered alloy structure and specific multicomponent alloy compositions. This variation made possible to increase the battery performance, i.e. the energy density, the cycle life and other characteristics.

Retrieved on 2007-08-06.Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. 2006 Proxy Statement. Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. 2006-10-16. Mr. Ovshinsky invented a variation on the NiMH battery, and ECD Ovonics holds crucial patents on some types of NiMH battery technology, licensing them to all major NiMH battery producers. Among its many activities, it produces consumer-oriented NiMH batteries, while Cobasys focuses on higher-energy industrial applications.

===Ovonic Battery Company, 1982===

Ovonic Battery Company (OBC) was formed in 1982 as a joint venture between ECD Ovonics and Detroit, Michigan-based American Natural Resources Company (ANR) to capitalize on the rechargeable NiMH batteries which Mr. Ovshinsky had invented.Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.: Information from Answers.com. Answers.com. Retrieved on 2007-08-06. ANR had invested $23 million before backing out of the venture in 1995, at which point ECD Ovonics purchased ANR for $8 million in stock and notes, leaving OBC as a wholly owned subsidiary of ECD Ovonics.
In the early 1980s OBC produced Ovonic NiMH batteries for the consumer market. Until that time, Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) batteries dominated the consumer rechargeable battery market, but NiMH batteries were safer, and stored more energy in an equivalent size. It also began work with Hyundai Motor Company and an unnamed Japanese automaker on batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). In 1992, OCB was awarded a contract by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), a consortium of US automakers, to develop EV batteries, and in 1993, their first EV NiMH battery pack was used in the Chrysler TE van, which previously used Li-alloy/FeS batteries.Chilenskas, A. A., and G. Barlow. Li/FeS battery design for an electric van. (Abstract Only).

==Patent dispute with Panasonic EV Energy==

Panasonic EV Energy (PEVE), a joint venture between Matsushita and Toyota begun in 1996, pioneered several advances in large-format NiMH batteries suitable for electric vehicles.

Retrieved on 2007-08-08. as well as the first Honda Insight and, with Sanyo Electric Co, first generation Civic hybrid models. BEV production by major automakers ceased in the early 2000s, with most leased BEV vehicles crushed by their manufacturers, and replacement batteries unavailable for remaining vehicles.
A 2001 patent infringement lawsuit brought by ECD Ovonics and Ovonic Battery Company, Inc. against Matsushita, Toyota, and PEVE was settled in July 2004. Settlement terms called for cross-licensing between parties of current and future NiMH-related patents filed through December 31, 2014. The terms prevented Matushita, Toyota, and PEVE from selling certain NiMH batteries for transportation applications in North America until the second half of 2007, and commercial quantities of certain NiMH batteries in North America until the second half of 2010. Additionally, Ovonic Battery Co. and ECD Ovonics received a $10 million patent license fee, Cobasys received a $20 million patent license fee, $16 million of which was earmarked to reimburse legal expenses, and Cobasys would receive royalties on certain batteries sold by Matushita/PEVE in North America.US SEC Form 8-K, Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., July 7, 2004.

==Criticisms==

Large-format NiMH batteries were commercially viable and ready for mass production, but there is evidence to support that Chevron and other oil-related interests may have suppressed the technology. Presumably to forestall the introduction of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.Boschert, S. Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers, 2007. ISBN 978-0-86571-571-4.
In her book, Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell or license them to small companies or individuals. Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles."

In an interview with the Economist, Stan Ovshinsky stated, "I think we at ECD we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company, frankly speaking. And I think it’s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business, rather than building the business.http://www.theenergyroadmap.com/futureblogger/show/1030-stanford-ovshinsky-and-the-future-of-energy-interview-part-1"  In a later interview, however, when asked, "So it’s your opinion that Cobasys is preventing other people from making it for that reason?", he responded "Cobasys is not preventing anybody. Cobasys just needs an infusion of cash.".http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2p78U8qcY
