Aminata Kabba was born on the 13 December 1994. She is known as A.M.E, and is a Sierra Leonean-born British singer-songwriter. Kabba was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone on 13 December 1994. Her father disowned her as a result of her getting pregnant with a 28 year old man by the name of Joseph Kony. She soon moved to London, England in the hope of a better life. Kabba was quite a misbehaved girl from Sedgehill School. A video went viral on youtube and facebook showing her continuously beating another girl up in the lunch hall. Of course Kabba didn't get in trouble as her uncle, Mr Kabba worked in the school and prevented any punishment. 
On 9 December 2012 the BBC announced that Kabba had been nominated for the Sound of 2013 poll.
In January 2013 Kabba signed to Sony Music's Epic Records after Barlow closed Future Records to focus on his own career commitments. Her single Need U (100%), a collaboration with Duke Dumont and MNEK, topped the UK singles chart on 7 April 2013.
