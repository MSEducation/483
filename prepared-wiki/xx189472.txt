==Massacres==

San Fernando, Tamaulipas is notorious for experiencing two of the largest recorded massacres of the Mexican Drug War. The first massacre, known as the 2010 San Fernando massacre, occurred following a gunfight in the state of Tamaulipas between drug cartel gunmen and Mexican authorities, in which three gunmen and a marine were killed. After the authorities patrolled the nearby area, they found a horrifying surprise—72 bodies were found in a remote ranch in the state of  Tamaulipas.[tpl]cite news|title=72 bodies found on ranch in Mexico|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0825/mexico.html|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=RTÉ News|date=25 August 2010[/tpl] It was "the biggest single discovery of its kind" in the ongoing drug war.[tpl]cite news|title=Drug hitmen dump 72 bodies at Mexican ranch|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67O2NF20100826|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=Reuters|date=25 August 2010|author=Robin Emmott|author2=Patrick Rucker|author3=Miguel Angel Gutierrez[/tpl] The 58 men and 14 women were believed to be undocumented migrants from South and Central America trying to cross the border to the United States.[tpl]cite news|title=Murdered bodies found in Mexico 'were migrants'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11090563|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 August 2010[/tpl] A surviving migrant claims that the migrants were kidnapped by the Los Zetas cartel and killed for refusing to do work for them.[tpl]cite news|title=Survivor: Drug gang massacred 72 migrants in northern Mexico|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/25/AR2010082506776.html|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 August 2010|author=William Booth[/tpl] Twenty one rifles, 101 ammunition clips, four bullet-proof vests, camouflage uniforms and four vehicles were seized by officials.[tpl]cite news|title=72 bodies found in Mexico ranch|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/72-bodies-found-in-Mexico-ranch/Article1-591920.aspx|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=26 August 2010[/tpl] The bodies were found in a room, some of which were piled up on top of each other.
