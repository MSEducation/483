Live in New York was a 2-CD live album released by performance artist Laurie Anderson on Nonesuch Records in 2002. It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982. The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall, New York City September 19–20, 2001, however the official title of the album is just Live in New York.
Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works, including songs from her then-recent album Life on a String, as well as earlier albums such as United States Live, Big Science, Bright Red, Home of the Brave and Strange Angels.
Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of "O Superman," the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can—in retrospect—be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks. One song, "Progress", is a retitled performance of the song "The Dream Before" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We? and later featured on Strange Angels.
