Ce soir je t'attendais (Tonight, I Waited for You) was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, performed in French by French singer Michèle Torr.
Torr had had her breakthrough on the francophone music scene as a 16 year old in 1963 with her second single Dans mes bras, oublie ta peine (In my Arms, Forget Your Pain). At the time she was signed to the French subsidiary of Mercury Records. 
Ce soir je t'attendais is an up-tempo pop track, with Torr telling her lover about her feelings of anticipation as she waited for him to arrive at her house. She sings that she had planned a romantic evening, but was slightly concerned due to the manner in which they had left each other the last time they were together. In any event, her confidence that he would come, paid off. 
Torr recorded her entry in five languages: French, German (Er kommt heute Abend zu mir), English (Only Tears are Left for Me), Spanish (Te esperaba), and Italian (Stasera ti aspettavo).
The song was performed fourth on the night (following Belgium's Tonia with Un peu de poivre, un peu de sel and preceding Yugoslavia's Berta Ambrož with Brez besed). At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 10th in a field of 18.
It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1967 Contest by Vicky with L'amour est bleu. Michèle Torr went on to represent Monaco at the 1977 Contest with Une petite française.
