Indianapolis [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|ɪ|n|d|i|ə|ˈ|n|æ|p|o-|l|ɨ|s[/tpl] (abbreviated Indy [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|n|d|i[/tpl]) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Indiana, and also the county seat of Marion County. As of the 2010 census, the city's population is 820,445.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Indiana's 2010 Census Population Totals, Including First Look at Race and Hispanic Origin Data for Legislative Redistricting|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn26.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=December 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] It is the 13th largest city in the United States and the 29th largest metropolitan area in the United States.
Historically, Indianapolis has oriented itself around government (a byproduct of its state capital function) and industry, particularly manufacturing. Over the late decades of the 20th century, the city's Unigov began a long process to revitalize the downtown area. Today, Indianapolis has a much more diversified economy, contributing to the fields of education, health care, and finance. Tourism is also a vital part of the economy of Indianapolis, with the city playing host to numerous conventions and sporting events. Of these, perhaps the most well known are the annual Indianapolis 500, Brickyard 400, and NHRA U.S. Nationals. Other major sporting events include the annual Big Ten Conference football championship and the Men's and Women's NCAA basketball tournaments. Indianapolis also hosted the Pan American Games in 1987 and Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.

==History==

Native Americans who lived in the area originally included the Miami and Lenape (or Delaware) tribes, but they were displaced from the area by the early 1820s.[ref]

Indianapolis was selected as the site of the new state capital in 1820, the old state capital having been Corydon since the formation of the state of Indiana in 1816. While most American state capitals tend to be located in the central region of their respective states, Indianapolis is the closest capital to being placed in the exact center of its state.[tpl]cite book|last=Caldwell|first=Howard|coauthors=Jones, Darryl|title=Indianapolis|editor=Goodall, Kenneth|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1990|isbn=0-253-32998-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BKLMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=December 25, 2008[/tpl] It was founded on the White River both because of this, and because of the incorrect assumption that the river would serve as a major transportation artery. However, the waterway eventually proved to be too sandy for trade. Jeremiah Sullivan, a judge of the Indiana Supreme Court, invented the name Indianapolis by joining Indiana with polis, the Greek word for city; Indianapolis literally means "Indiana City". The state commissioned Alexander Ralston to design the new capital city. Ralston was an apprentice to the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, and he helped L'Enfant plan Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a city of only one square mile (3 km²). At the center of the city sat Governor's Circle, a large circular commons, which was to be the site of the governor's mansion. Meridian and Market Streets converge at the Circle and continue north–south and east–west, respectively. The Capital moved from Corydon on January 10, 1825. The governor's mansion was eventually demolished in 1857 and in its place stands a [tpl]convert|284|ft|m|0|sing=on[/tpl] tall neoclassical limestone and bronze monument, the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. The surrounding street is now known as Monument Circle or just "The Circle".
The city lies on the original east–west National Road. The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Madison and Indianapolis, began operation on October 1, 1847, and subsequent railroad connections made expansive growth possible. Indianapolis was the home of the first Union Station, or common rail passenger terminal, in the United States. By the turn of the 20th century, Indianapolis had become a large automobile manufacturer, rivaling the likes of Detroit. With roads leading out of the city in all directions, Indianapolis became a major hub of regional transport connecting to Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus, Detroit, Cleveland, and St. Louis, befitting the capital of a state whose nickname is "The Crossroads of America". This same network of roads would allow quick and easy access to suburban areas in future years.
City population grew rapidly throughout the first half of the 20th century. While rapid suburbanization began to take place in the second half of the century, race relations deteriorated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Even so, on the night that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, Indianapolis was one of the few major cities in which rioting did not occur.[tpl]cite web|author=Morning Edition|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89365887|title=Robert Kennedy: Delivering News of King's Death|publisher=NPR|accessdate=July 1, 2010[/tpl] Many credit the speech by Robert F. Kennedy, who was in town campaigning for President that night, for helping to calm the tensions. Racial tensions heightened in 1970 with the passage of Unigov, which further isolated the middle class from Indianapolis's growing African American community.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Although Indianapolis and the state of Indiana abolished segregated schools just prior to Brown vs. Board of Education, the later action of court-ordered school desegregation busing by Judge S. Hugh Dillin was a controversial change.
In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were about 80 percent of the population.[tpl]cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html[/tpl] The 1970s and 1980s ushered in a period of planning and revitalization for the urban core of Indianapolis. Changes came early with the reorientation of the city’s government. Unigov was created as the result of a 1970 consolidation between city and county government. The city of Indianapolis merged most government services with those of Marion County. For the most part, this resulted in a unification of Indianapolis with its immediate suburbs. This caused the boundaries of the city to grow tremendously, reflected in Indianapolis’ jump in ranking to the nation's 11th largest city in 1970. The City-County Building housed the newly consolidated government. At its completion, the City-County Building became the city’s tallest building and the first building in the city to be taller than the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Amidst the changes in government and growth, the city’s role as a major transportation hub and tourist destination was further strengthened with the Weir Cook Municipal Airport receiving its international designation in 1975.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Indianapolis suffered at the hands of urban decay and white flight. Major revitalization of the city's blighted areas, such as Fall Creek Place and Downtown Indianapolis, began in the 1980s and led to an acceleration of growth on the fringes of the metropolitan area. The openings of the RCA Dome, Circle Centre, and the Indianapolis Artsgarden revitalized the central business district. The city hosted the 1987 Pan American Games. The city and state have invested heavily in improvement projects such as an expansion to the Indiana Convention Center, upgrade of the I-465 beltway, and construction of an entirely new airport terminal for the Indianapolis International Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wishtv.com/global/story.asp?s=6707164|title=Indiana Convention Center Expansion Revealed|publisher=WISH-TV| date=June 25, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Construction of the Indianapolis Colts' new home, Lucas Oil Stadium, was completed in August 2008, and the hotel and convention center expansion were completed in early 2011.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance), or portion of Marion County that is not part of another municipality, has a total area of [tpl]convert|368.2|sqmi|km2[/tpl]–[tpl]convert|361.5|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of which is land and [tpl]convert|6.7|sqmi|km2[/tpl] is water. However, these figures do not represent the entire consolidated City of Indianapolis, whose total area covers approximately [tpl]convert|373.1|sqmi|km2[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] and includes all of Marion County, with the exception of four communities: Beech Grove, Lawrence, Speedway, and Southport.[tpl]cite web| title = Indiana InDepth Profile: Largest Cities and Towns in Indiana (35,000+)| work = | publisher = Indiana Business Research Center, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business | url = http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/profiles.asp?scope_choice=a&county_changer=18000&button1=Get+Profile&id=2&page_path=Area+Profiles&path_id=11&panel_number=1 | accessdate = November 20, 2013[/tpl]
The original plan of Indianapolis was a [tpl]convert|1|sqmi|km2[/tpl] area, platted in 1821. This area, known as the Mile Square, is bounded by East, West, North, and South streets, with a circular street at Monument Circle, originally called Governor's Circle, in the city's center.[tpl]cite journal| author =William A. Browne Jr. | title =The Ralston Plan: Naming the Streets of Indianapolis | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =25 | issue =3 | page =8 and 9 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Summer 2013 | url =| accessdate =December 3, 2013[/tpl] The original grid included the four diagonal streets of Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana avenues, which extend outward, beginning in the city block just beyond the Circle.Browne, p. 11 and 16. Other major streets in the Mile Square are named after states that were part of the Union when Indianapolis was initially planned (1820–21) and Michigan, at that time a U.S. territory bordering Indiana to the north.Michigan did not enter the Union until 1837. See Browne, p. 9 and 17. Notable exceptions to the city's street names include: Washington Street, an east-west street named in honor of George Washington or possibly in reference to Washington, D.C., the city on which the original plan of Indianapolis is based; Meridian Street, the north-south street that aligns with the 86W degree longitude, or meridian, and intersects the Circle; and Market Street, which intersects Meridian Street at Monument Circle and is named in the original design for the two city markets planned for the east and west sides of town.Brown, p. 9 and 10. Tennessee and Mississippi streets were renamed Capitol and Senate avenues in 1895.Browne, p. 17 State government buildings, including the Indiana Statehouse, the Indiana Government Center North, and the Indiana Government Center South are located west of the Circle, along these two major north-south streets. The city's street-numbering system begins one block south of the Circle, where Meridian Street intersects Washington Street (a part of the historic National Road).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Indianapolis is situated in the Central Till Plains region of the United States. Two natural waterways dissect the city: the White River and Fall Creek. Prior to the city's settlement and land-clearing efforts in the nineteenth century, a mix of deciduous forests and prairie once covered much of the area. Land within the city limits varies from flat to gently sloping, with variations in elevation from 700 to 900 feet occurring throughout the city limits. Most of the changes in elevation are so gradual that they go unnoticed and appear to be flat at close range. The city's mean elevation is [tpl]convert|717|ft|m|0[/tpl]. Its highest point at [tpl]convert|914|ft[/tpl] above sea level is located in the northwest corner [tpl]convert|400|ft[/tpl] south of the Boone County line and [tpl]convert|400|ft[/tpl] east of the Hendricks County line.[tpl]cite web|title=Statistics - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=http://www.imcpl.org/resources/guides/government/statistics/|publisher=The Indianapolis Public Library|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl] Prior to the implementation of Unigov the highest point was at the tomb of famed Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley in Crown Hill Cemetery, with an elevation of [tpl]convert|842|ft|m|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.moveinandout.com/city_guide_for_moving_to_indianapolis_indiana.aspx |title=Guide for Moving to Indianapolis, Indiana |publisher=MoveInAndOut.com |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl] The lowest point, an approximate elevation of [tpl]convert|680|ft|m|0[/tpl], lies to the south at the Marion County-Johnson County line. Mann Hill, a bluff located along the White River in Southwestway Park, is the city's highest hill, rising nearly [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|0[/tpl] above the surrounding landscape. Indianapolis has a few moderately sized bluffs and valleys within the city, particularly along the waterways of the White River, Fall Creek, Geist Reservoir, and Eagle Creek Reservoir, and especially on the city's northeast and northwest sides.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Cityscape===

High rise construction in Indianapolis started in 1888 with the [tpl]convert|256|ft|m|0|sing=on[/tpl] high Indiana Statehouse, followed by the [tpl]convert|284|ft|m|0|sing=on[/tpl] Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in 1898. However, because of a special ordinance disallowing building higher than the structure, the monument remained the highest structure until the completion of the City-County Building in 1962.
In the 1970s, the central business district saw decreased economic activity and, as a result, downtown Indianapolis saw little new construction. By the 1980s, the city of Indianapolis addressed these issues by developing plans to redefine the city's downtown and neighborhoods. Tall skyscrapers started being built to define Indianapolis's skyline, such as the One America building in 1982. This development also carried over to the 1990s, when the Chase Tower was built.
Neighborhood development was also addressed. Indianapolis neighborhoods were designated in relation to their proximity to the city center, and plans were initiated for them to be redeveloped.

===Climate===

As is typical in much of the Midwest, Indianapolis has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid, with a July daily average temperature of [tpl]convert|75.4|°F|1[/tpl]. High temperatures reach or exceed [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] an average of 18 days each year, and occasionally exceed [tpl]convert|95|°F[/tpl]. Spring and autumn are usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable; midday temperature drops exceeding [tpl]convert|30|F-change|disp=or[/tpl] are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days ([tpl]convert|80|°F|0|disp=or[/tpl]) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of [tpl]convert|28.1|°F|1[/tpl]. Temperatures dip to [tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] or below an average of 4.7 nights per year. The rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of [tpl]convert|5.05|in|cm[/tpl] of precipitation. Most rain is derived from thunderstorm activity; there is no distinct dry season.

==Culture==

Indianapolis prides itself on its rich cultural heritage. Several initiatives have been made by the Indianapolis government in recent years to increase Indianapolis's appeal as a destination for arts and culture.
Indianapolis has designated six official Cultural Districts. They are Broad Ripple Village, Massachusetts Avenue, Fountain Square, The Wholesale District, Canal and White River State Park, and Indiana Avenue. These areas have held historic and cultural importance to the city. In recent years they have been revitalized and are becoming major centers for tourism, commerce and residential living.
Constructed between 2007 and 2013, the Indianapolis Cultural Trail is an urban bike and pedestrian path that connects the city's five downtown Cultural Districts, neighborhoods and entertainment amenities, and serves as the downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. The trail includes benches, bike racks, lighting, signage and bike rentals/drop-offs along the way and also features local art work. It was officially opened in May 2013.[tpl]cite web|author=Foxio |url=http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/ |title=Indianapolis Cultural Trail |publisher=Indyculturaltrail.org |date=June 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.pps.org/blog/making-the-journey-a-destination-indianapolis-cultural-trail-debuts/ |title=Project for Public Spaces |publisher=Pps.org |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2014[/tpl]
At the center of Indianapolis is Monument Circle, a traffic circle at the intersection of Meridian and Market Streets, featuring the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Monument Circle is depicted on the city’s flag. It is in the shadow of Indiana's tallest skyscraper, the Chase Tower. Until the early 1960s, Indianapolis zoning laws stated that no building could be taller than the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Each Christmas season, lights are strung onto the monument and lit in a ceremony known as the Circle of Lights, which attracts tens of thousands of Hoosiers to downtown Indianapolis on the day after Thanksgiving.
A five-block plaza at the intersection of Meridian and Vermont surrounds a large memorial dedicated to Hoosiers who have fought in American wars. It was originally constructed to honor the Indiana soldiers who died in World War I, but construction was halted due to lack of funding during the Great Depression, and it was finished in 1951. The purpose of the memorial was later altered to encompass all American wars in which Hoosiers fought.
The monument is modeled after the Mausoleum of Maussollos. At [tpl]convert|210|ft|m[/tpl] tall, it is approximately 75 feet taller than the original Mausoleum. On the north end of the War Memorial Plaza is the national headquarters of the American Legion and the Indianapolis Public Library's Central Library.
The Statehouse houses the Indiana General Assembly, the Governor of Indiana, state courts, and other state officials.
The city is second only to Washington, D.C., for the number of war monuments inside city limits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080605/NEWS/80605055|title=Marine training in Indy stirs concerns|publisher=Indianapolis Star| date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The Indy 500 is the largest single–day sporting event in the world, hosting more than 257,000 permanent seats (not including the infield area). The track is often referred to as the Brickyard, because it was paved with 3.2 million bricks shortly after its construction in 1909. Today the track is paved in asphalt, although a one–yard strip of bricks remains at the start/finish line.
IMS also hosts the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series' Brickyard 400. The first running of the Brickyard 400 was in 1994, and the race has traditionally been NASCAR's highest attended event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=ycn-8824925 |title=NASCAR records at the Brickyard 400 - NASCAR - Yahoo!

===Indianapolis Zoo===

Opened in 1988, the Indianapolis Zoo is the largest zoo in the state, and is located just west of downtown in White River State Park. It has 360 species of animals, and is known for its dolphin exhibit.

==Law and government==

Indianapolis has a consolidated city-county government known as Unigov. Under this system, many functions of the city and county governments are consolidated, though some remain separate. The city has a mayor-council form of government.
The executive branch is headed by an elected mayor, who serves as the chief executive of both the city and Marion County. The current Mayor of Indianapolis is Republican Greg Ballard. The mayor appoints deputy mayors, city department heads and members of various boards and commissions.
The legislative body for the city and county is the City-County Council. It is made up of 29 members, 25 of whom represent districts, with the remaining four elected at large. Following the 2011 elections, Democrats hold a 16–13 majority over Republicans. The council passes ordinances for the city and county and also makes appointments to certain boards and commissions.
With the exception of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, all of the courts of law in Indianapolis are part of the Indiana state court system. The Marion Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction. The 35 judges on the court hear all criminal, juvenile, probate, and traffic violation cases, as well as most civil cases. The Marion Circuit Court hears certain types of civil cases. Small claims cases are heard by Small Claims Courts in each of Marion County's nine townships. The Appeals Courts and the Indiana Supreme Court meet in the Indiana Statehouse.

===Fire protection===

The Indianapolis Fire Department provides fire protection services for six townships in Marion County (Washington, Lawrence, Center, Warren, Perry, and Franklin), plus those portions of the other three townships that were part of Indianapolis prior to the establishment of Unigov. The individual fire departments of Decatur, Pike, and Wayne townships, the town of Speedway, and the cities of Beech Grove and Lawrence, provide such services for their respective jurisdictions.

===Emergency medical services===

Emergency medical services (EMS) for six townships in Indianapolis (Washington, Lawrence, Center, Warren, Perry and Franklin) and the Town of Speedway are provided by Indianapolis Emergency medical services. The fire departments of Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, as well as the cities of Beech Grove and Lawrence, provide EMS services to their respective jurisdictions.

===Law enforcement===

Indianapolis and Marion County historically maintained separate police agencies: the Indianapolis Police Department and Marion County Sheriff's Department. On January 1, 2007, a new agency, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, was formed by merging the two departments. IMPD is a separate agency, as the Sheriff's Department maintains jail and court functions. IMPD has jurisdiction over those portions of Marion County not explicitly covered by the police of an excluded city or by a legacy pre-Unigov force. As of February 29, 2008, the IMPD is headed by a Public Safety Director appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis; the Public Safety Director appoints the Police Chief. The IMPD was formerly under the leadership of the Sheriff of Marion County, Frank J. Anderson prior to his retirement in January, 2011. The Sheriff remains in charge of the County Jail and security for the City-County Building, service of warrants, and certain other functions. The Sheriff must be consulted, but does not have final say, on the appointment of the Public Safety Director and the Police Chief.[tpl]cite web|title=Council vote gives Ballard IMPD control|publisher=Indianapolis Star|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008302120002|date=April 3, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Crime====

In the late 1990s, violent crimes in inner-city neighborhoods located within the old city limits (pre-consolidation) peaked. The former Indianapolis Police District (IPD), which serves about 37% of the county's total population and has a geographic area covering mostly the old pre-consolidation city limits, recorded 130 homicides in 1998 to average approximately 40.3 homicides per 100,000 people. This is over 6 times the 1998 national homicide average of 6.3 per 100,000 people. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Meanwhile, the former Marion County Sheriff's Department district serving the remaining 63% of the county's population, which includes the majority of the residents in the Consolidated City, recorded only 32 homicides in 1998, averaging about 5.9 murders per 100,000 people, slightly less than the 1998 national homicide average. Homicides in the IPD police district dropped dramatically in 1999 and have remained lower through 2005. In 2005, the IPD police district recorded 88 homicides to average 27.3 homicides per 100,000 people; nonetheless, the murder rate in the IPD is still almost 5 times the 2005 national average. In 2007, city leaders such as Sheriff Frank J. Anderson and former Mayor Bart Peterson held rallies in neighborhoods in effort to stop the violence in the city.
The immediate downtown area of the city around most main attractions, venues, and museums remain relatively safe. IMPD uses horseback officers and bicycle officers to patrol the downtown area or the city. Certain areas of Indianapolis remain a challenge for law enforcement officials. Indianapolis was ranked as the 33rd most dangerous city in the United States in the 2008–2009 edition of CQ Press's City Crime Rankings and the 22nd most dangerous city according to Yahoo! Finance in 2012.[tpl]cite book|editors=Kathleen O'Leary Morgan, Scott Morgan, Rachel Boba|title=City Crime Rankings 2008–2009|year=2008|publisher=CQ Press|url=http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime2008/citycrime2008.htm|isbn=978-0-87289-932-2|author=Kathleen O'Leary Morgan and Scott Morgan, editors[/tpl] Retrieved on January 2, 2009.[tpl]cite book|title=The 25 Most Dangerous Cities in America|year=2012|publisher=Yahoo!

Finance also reported that the city averaged 52.2 forcible rapes per 100,000 people. The national average stands at 26.8 forcible rapes per 100,000 people.

===Politics===

Until the late 1990s, Indianapolis was considered to be one of the most conservative metropolitan areas in the country but this trend has reversed recently. Republicans had held the majority in the City-County Council for 36 years, and the city had a Republican mayor for 32 years from 1967 to 1999. This was in part because the creation of Unigov added several then-heavily Republican areas of Marion County to the Indianapolis city limits. More recently, Republicans have generally been stronger in the southern and western parts (Decatur, Franklin, Perry, and Wayne, townships) of the county while Democrats have been stronger in the central and northern parts (Center, Pike, and Washington townships). Republican and Democratic prevalence is split in Warren and Lawrence townships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080315/NEWS05/803150480&GID=nIq1uOP+A3cbqZSZNGuHlLASClyMUoB2zZgnAmgB4lo%3D|title=Voter turnout a key factor in Carson win|publisher=Indianapolis Star|date=March 15, 2008|accessdate=March 15, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Indianapolis suburbs, on the other hand, remain some of the most reliably Republican areas in Indiana and the nation.
In the 1999 municipal election, Democrat Bart Peterson defeated Indiana Secretary of State Sue Anne Gilroy by 52% to 41%. Four years later, Peterson was re-elected with 63% of the vote over Marion County Treasurer Greg Jordan. Republicans narrowly lost control of the City-County Council that year. In 2004, Democrats won the Marion County offices of treasurer, surveyor and coroner for the first time since the 1970s. The county GOP lost further ground during the 2006 elections with Democrats winning the offices of county clerk, assessor, recorder and auditor. Only one GOP countywide office remained: Prosecutor Carl Brizzi, who defeated Democratic challenger Melina Kennedy with 51% of the vote in his bid for a second term, despite outspending her two-to-one. At the township level, Democrats picked up the trustee offices in Washington, Lawrence, Warren and Wayne townships, while holding on to Pike and Center townships.
In the 2007 municipal election, fueled by voter angst against increases in property and income taxes as well as a rise in crime, Republican challenger Greg Ballard narrowly defeated Peterson 51% to 47%—the first time an incumbent Indianapolis mayor was removed from office since 1967. Discontent among these issues also returned control of the City-County Council to the GOP with a 16–13 majority.[tpl]cite web|url=http://imcwwa2k3.indygov.org/elecnight/2007gen/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071109102321/http://imcwwa2k3.indygov.org/elecnight/2007gen/|archivedate=November 9, 2007|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=November 9, 2007|accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl] Ballard was re-elected mayor in 2011. Control of the city-county council reverted to Democrats 16-13 over Republicans, marking only the second time in the Unigov era of split-party control of county government between the council and mayor.
In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama easily won in Indianapolis by earning 64% of all Marion County votes while 35% of the votes went to John McCain for a victory of about 107,000 votes.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.in.gov/apps/sos/election/general/general2008?page=district&countyID=32&officeID=36&districtID=937&candidate=| title=Indiana General Election November 4, 2008, by County| publisher=Indiana Secretary of State| date=November 4, 2008| accessdate=November 7, 2008[/tpl]
As 2010 came to an end, despite a strong performance by the GOP statewide, Democrats swept all county offices once again, including reclaiming the office of county prosecutor for the first time since 1990.

Indianapolis is the home of Butler University, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, Lincoln College of Technology, Marian University, Martin University, Oakland City University–Indianapolis, The Art Institute of Indianapolis, Vincennes University Aviation Technology Center, the University of Indianapolis, the University of Phoenix, and WGU Indiana.
Butler University was originally founded in 1855 as North Western Christian University. The school purchased land in the Irvington area in 1875. The school moved again in 1928 to its current location at the edge of the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood. The school removed itself officially from religious affiliation, giving up the theological school to Christian Theological Seminary. A private institution, Butler's current student enrollment is approximately 4,400. Butler has a storied sports heritage in regards to basketball and volleyball. Butler is the site where both the film Hoosiers and the events that inspired it were filmed, the so-called Milan Miracle. Butler's basketball stadium, Hinkle Fieldhouse, was the largest basketball facility when built and also historically hosted the first bout between the U.S. and Soviet Union in basketball. Butler University made its own impact felt with a championship appearance in its home city of Indianapolis in the NCAA championship game in 2010, and a repeat appearance in the NCAA Championship game in 2011. Butler also has hosted to date the largest attended volleyball match at 14,000 spectators.
Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis was originally an urban conglomeration of branch campuses of the two major state universities: Indiana University in Bloomington and Purdue University in West Lafayette, created by the state legislature. In 1969 a merged campus was created at the site of the Indiana University School of Medicine. IUPUI's student body is currently just above 30,000, making it the third-largest campus for higher learning in Indiana after the main campuses of IU and Purdue. The Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law is located on the IUPUI campus; the school's distinctive Inlow Hall is located on the southeast corner of the campus. This campus is also home to Herron School of Art and Design, which was established privately in 1902. A new building was built in 2005 under both private donation and state contribution enabling the school to move from its original location. IUPUI has a division one basketball program and has made tournament appearances in the Summit League alongside Indianapolis's other division one school, Butler University. IUPUI has the only Android Studies Department in the United States.
Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, a state funded public school, was founded as Indiana Vocational Technical College in 1963. In 2008, Ivy Tech became "the state’s largest public-college system, surpassing Indiana University in enrollment."[tpl]cite news|last=Soderlund|first=Kelly|title=Ivy Tech grows to biggest state college|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081211/LOCAL04/812110306/1026/LOCAL04|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=The Journal Gazette|date=December 12, 2011|location=Fort Wayne, Indiana[/tpl] With 30 campuses across Indiana, Ivy Tech has a total enrollment of over 174,000 as of the 2010-2011 school year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ivytech.edu/institutional-research/enrollment/FINAL_10-11_headcount.pdf|title=''Ivy Tech Community College Institutional Progress Report 2010-11|work=http://www.in.gov/che|accessdate=November 27, 2012[/tpl]

===Primary and secondary education===

|}
Indianapolis has eleven unified public school districts (eight township educational authorities and three legacy districts from before the unification of city and county government), each of which providing primary, secondary, and adult education services within its boundaries. The boundaries of these districts do not exactly correspond to township (or traditional) boundaries, but rather cover the areas of their townships that were outside the pre-Unigov city limits. Indianapolis Public Schools, which serves what was the city of Indianapolis prior to the Unigov merger, is still the largest school corporation in Indiana today.
Private schools run by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis are Bishop Chatard, Roncalli, Cardinal Ritter, and Scecina. Other private schools include Brebeuf Jesuit, Park Tudor, Cathedral and Heritage Christian.

===Libraries===

Public library services are provided to the citizens of Indianapolis and Marion County by the Indianapolis Public Library. The educational and cultural institution, founded in 1873, now consists of a main library, Central Library, located in downtown Indianapolis, and 22 branch locations spread throughout the city. Serving over 5.43 million visitors in 2006, its mission is to provide "materials and programs in support of the lifelong learning, recreational and economic interests of all citizens of Marion County." The renovated Central Library building opened on December 9, 2007, ending a controversial multi-year rebuilding plan.Storybook Ending?, Indianapolis Star. Retrieved December 22, 2007.

===Airports===

Indianapolis International Airport is the largest airport in Indiana, serving about 7.5 million passengers and transporting 985,000 tons of cargo annually.[tpl]cite web|coauthors=|year=2011|url=http://www.indypartnership.com/media/docs/Industry%20Packets/Indianapolis%20Region%20-%20Logistics%20Industry%20Packet.pdf|title=Indianapolis International Airport–Airport Facts & Statistics|publisher=IndyPartnership|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] The airport is home to the second-largest FedEx operation in the world (after the Memphis headquarters) and the United States Postal Service Eagle Network Hub. The entire airport is a global free trade zone called INZONE with eighteen designated subzones.
Thirty years in planning, a new midfield terminal complex was completed in 2008. It officially opened for arriving flights on November 11, 2008 and departures on November 12, 2008. The $1.1 billion project represents the largest development initiative in the city's history. The new Indianapolis Airport covers [tpl]convert|1200000|sqft|m2[/tpl], and has 40 gates, a [tpl]convert|145000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] baggage processing area, a [tpl]convert|73000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] baggage claim area, a large pre-security gathering, a concession space with a [tpl]convert|60|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] skylight, numerous local and national restaurants and retailers, and local Indianapolis artwork.

Several interstates serve the Indianapolis area. Interstate 65 runs northwest to Gary, where other roads eventually take drivers to Chicago, and southward to Louisville, Kentucky. Interstate 69 runs northeast to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and currently terminates in the city at I-465, but will eventually be routed around the city on 465 to the new extension of Interstate 69 towards Evansville. Interstate 70 follows the old National Road, running east to Columbus, Ohio and southwest to St. Louis, Missouri. Interstate 74 goes northwest towards Danville, Illinois, and southeast towards Cincinnati, Ohio. Finally, Interstate 465 circles Marion County, and joins the aforementioned highways together. In 2002, the interstate segment connecting Interstate 465 to Interstate 65 on the northwest side of the city was redesignated Interstate 865 to reduce confusion. The Indianapolis area also has two other expressways: Sam Jones Expressway (formerly Airport Expressway), and Shadeland Avenue Expressway.
To comply with an Indiana state law limiting the number of miles of state highways, all US and Indiana State numbered routes were rerouted along I-465 instead of going through the center of the city. At one point (between Exits 47 and 49) on the southeast side of the city, I-465, US 31, US 36, US 40, US 52, US 421, Indiana 37, and Indiana 67 use the same right-of-way. Between Exits 49 and 2 (along the south end of the city), I-74, I-465, US 31, US 36, US 40, US 52, Indiana 37 and Indiana 67 operate on the same right-of-way.

===Intercity transit===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Indianapolis at the Indianapolis Union Station. Amtrak provides a twice-weekly service of the Cardinal to Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. as well as the daily Hoosier State to Chicago.
Greyhound Lines operates a bus depot at Indianapolis Union Station, and Megabus has a stop adjacent to the Indianapolis City-County Building.

===Mass transit===

The Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, known locally as IndyGo, provides public transportation for the city. IndyGo was established in 1975 after the city of Indianapolis took over the city's transit system. Prior to 1997, IndyGo was called Metro. Central Indiana Commuter Services (CICS), funded by IndyGo to reduce pollution, serves Indianapolis and surrounding counties.
Efforts to expand mass transit in central Indiana have been initiated through an organization called IndyConnect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indyconnect.org/pages/home/ |title=A Central Indiana Public Transportation Initiative | Home |publisher=Indy Connect |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2014[/tpl] Starting in 2010, private industry leaders from Central Indiana proposed a $10 billion multimodal regional transportation plan that includes expanded roadways, express bus routes, light rail, and commuter rail pathways. If public and legislative approval is granted, construction could begin as soon as 2015. In addition, a private company known as Downtown Indianapolis Streetcar Corp., has put together a team to study the possibilities of creating a streetcar for the downtown Indianapolis area.http://indianapolisstreetcar.org/home.html

===People mover===

Indiana University Health operates a people mover connecting the Indiana University School of Medicine, Riley Hospital for Children, Wishard Hospital and IUPUI facilities at the north end of the Downtown Canal with Methodist Hospital. It is open to the public but mostly used by doctors, staff, and patients of the various medical facilities. It is currently the only example of light or commuter rail in Indianapolis. The existing people mover is sometimes inaccurately described as a monorail, but in fact rides on dual concrete beams with the guideway as wide as the vehicle.
