==Membership==

The Commission has 15 members,[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7371693.stm | work=BBC News | title=Devolution body members announced | date=2008-04-28 | accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]Members of the Commission on Scottish Devolution including nominees of the three Unionist parties, representatives of business, trade unions, academia and community organisations.

==Task groups==

The Commission established five task groups to assist it in its work.  These met in between meetings of the full Commission.  The task groups and their chairs are as follows:

==Independent expert group==

There is also an independent expert group established to advise the Commission on financial accountability.  This is chaired by Professor Anton Muscatelli, Vice-Chancellor and Principal of Heriot-Watt University, and includes academics from Scotland, the rest of the UK and overseas.  It produced a detailed report for the Commission in November 2008, examining different models for funding sub-national parliaments, and suggesting that a mixture of grant funding, tax devolution and tax assignment was likely to be necessary in a Scottish context.  In June 2009, the IEG published further reports on borrowing and on natural resource taxation, plus a response to some of the Commission's consultation questions.

==First report==

The Commission's first report, released in December 2008The Future of Scottish Devolution within the Union: A First Report declared that devolution had been a success, while making the case for Scotland's continued place within the United Kingdom.  On funding, it endorsed the view of the independent expert group that full fiscal autonomy is incompatible with the continuation of the United Kingdom.Full Scots fiscal power ruled out  The Report launched a second phase of consultation, inviting further evidence on a wide range of questions (encapsulated in an accompanying consultation document) by the end of February 2009.

==Final report==

The Commission's final report was published on 15 June 2009.
The main conclusions and recommendations are:

==Calman Review white paper==

Responding to the findings of the review, the British Government announced on 25 November 2009, that new powers would be devolved to the Scottish Government, notably on how it can raise tax and carry out capital borrowing, and the running of Scottish Parliament elections. These proposals were detailed in a white paper setting out a new Scotland Bill, to become law before the 2015 Holyrood elections. The proposal was criticised by the British Parliament opposition parties for not proposing to implement any changes before the next general election. Scottish Constitution Minister Michael Russell criticised the white paper, calling it "flimsy" and stating that their proposed Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010, whose own white paper was to be published five days later, would be "more substantial". According to The Independent, the Calman Review white paper proposals fall short of what would normally be seen as requiring a referendum.

==2010 UK coalition government==

The United Kingdom Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government which was elected in 2010 pledged to implement the findings of the Calman CommissionPolicy-by-policy: The coalition government's plans and subsequently used them as the basis for the Scotland Act 2012. In 2014 the UK government announced that in 2015 the Scottish Parliament would also be given direct access to capital funds and the ability to issue bonds.[tpl]cite news|title=Scottish independence: Scottish government to finance bond powers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26245684|publisher=BBC News|date=19 February 2014[/tpl]
