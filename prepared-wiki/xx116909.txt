==Bishop Closes Haitian Ministries==

As the Hartford Courant newspaper reported, the Bishop collected more than $300,000 on behalf of his charity, Haitian Ministries for the Diocese of Norwich.  None of the money was received by the charity, and in December 2010 the Bishop closed down the charity, firing its executive director and creating a new charity on behalf of Haiti.http://blogs.courant.com/susan_campbell/2010/12/haitian-ministries-is-shut-dow.html
