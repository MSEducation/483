The Evangelical Baptist Mission of South Haiti or Mission Evangélique Baptiste du Sud d'Haïti (MEBSH) grew out of the successful efforts of the non-denominational World Team, the Cuba Bible Institute and deported Haitian sugarcane workers from Cuba. Workers deported from Cuba returned to their motherland of Haiti and began to spread the gospel they had found.
In 1936, 3 American and Cuban missionaries began to work among these Haitians who had been converted under Baptist ministry while they were working in Cuban sugar cane fields. In 1937, the mission opened a Bible school in Les Cayes. On Christmas Day, 1958, MEBSH and World Team launched Radio Lumièrehttp://www.radiolumiere.org - a network of 9 radio stations, including a radio station, studio & television station in Port-au-Prince.Conley, Joseph F.
