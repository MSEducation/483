Southwold lighthouse is a lighthouse operated by Trinity House in the centre of Southwold in Suffolk, England. It stands on the North Sea coast, acting as a warning light for shipping passing along the east coast and as a guide for vessels navigating to Southwold harbour.
The lighthouse, which is a prominent local landmark, was commissioned in 1890, and was automated and electrified in 1938. It survived a fire in its original oil-fired lamp just six days after commissioning and today operates a 150-watt lamp. The main navigation lamp has a range of [tpl]convert|24|nmi|km mi[/tpl].

==History==

Construction of the lighthouse began in 1887, led by Sir James Douglass, Engineer in Chief of Trinity House.Southwold, Trinity House. Retrieved 2012-10-29. A light was lit on a temporary structure in February 1889 and the lighthouse itself began operating on 3 September 1890. It replaced three lighthouses that had been condemned as a result of serious coastal erosion. The lantern itself was previously used at the Happisburgh low lighthouse but became available when the latter light was demolished.Point 2 - The Lighthouse, BBC News Suffolk, 2 July 2005. Retrieved 2012-10-29.
The original light was powered by a six-wick Argand oil burner.Application note 32064 - Southwold Conversion, Pelangi. Retrieved 2013-01-04. Just six days after the light was commissioned there was a fire in the lighthouse with the burner being destroyed.Discovering Southwold, BBC News Suffolk, 4 July 2005. Retrieved 2012-10-29.The sea - Southwold's lighthouse, Southwold Museum. Retrieved 2012-10-29. The inexperience of the new lighthouse keepers was blamed for the fire. The burner was replaced with an oil-fired light in 1906 and a petroleum burner in 1923. The light was electrified and automated in 1938. It was converted to battery operation, with the batteries charged using mains electricity, in 2001.
The lighthouse, along with Lowestoft lighthouse to the north, was threatened with closure by Trinity House in 2005, with shipping companies increasingly using satellite navigation systems rather than relying on lighthouses.Landmark lighthouses may be axed, BBC News, 4 August 2005. Retrieved 2012-10-29.Barnes, Jonathan. (4 August 2005). Historic lighthouses face closure, East Anglian Daily Times, Retrieved 2012-10-29. Both lighthouses were reprieved in 2009 following a review by Trinity House that found that satellite navigation systems were not yet sufficiently reliable.Lighthouse wins reprieve as sat nav for ships not reliable enough, The Daily Telegraph, 9 January 2009.
