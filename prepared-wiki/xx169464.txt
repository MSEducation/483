Fudbalski klub Novi Pazar (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Hoви Пaзap, English: Novi Pazar Football Club) is an Serbian  association football club from Novi Pazar who play in the Serbian SuperLiga. The club was formed in 1928 as FK Sandžak. FK Novi Pazar play their home games at the 12,000 capacity Novi Pazar City Stadium.

==History==

===Formation===

The club was founded in 1928, under the name FK Sandžak, which later changed to FK Deževa. The club has played under its current name since 1962, when FK Deževa and another local football club, the FK Ras, merged under the name FK Novi Pazar. The club was a Yugoslav amateur-league champion, and was later a member of the Yugoslav Second League.

===Recent history(1995–2003)===

The club qualified for a promotion play-off spot for the First League of FR Yugoslavia twice, but lost on both occasions. They lost to Sutjeska Nikšić in 1994, and to Sloboda Užice in 1995.  In 2002, the club was relegated to the Serbian League, third division in Serbia. After one season in the Serbian League they were promoted back to the Serbian First League.

===First time in SuperLiga===

The club played in the second tier until 2011, when they came in third. At the end of the 2010–11 Serbian First League season, first-placed second-tier team FK BASK was not financially prepared for the Serbian SuperLiga, which caused a huge controversy and debate in Serbian football circles regarding who in BASK's place should take the birth in the top-tier Serbian SuperLiga in the following season. Two candidates emerged: FK Inđija, which had occupied a regulation place in the previous SuperLiga season, and FK Novi Pazar, which finished in non-promoting third place in the second-tier championship. Both clubs were backed by political proxies in their campaigns to take BASKS's place in the SuperLiga. Goran Ješić, who was the president of the municipality of Inđija as well as an official of the Democratic Party, represented the lobby for FK Inđija to keep its place in the top flight. FK Novi Pazar, meanwhile, was backed by the powerful lobby of Rasim Ljajić. In the end, FK Novi Pazar was promoted along with second-place FK Radnički Kragujevac. The 2011–12 Serbian SuperLiga was the first ever season in which FK Novi Pazar played in the top flight. Ivan Babić participated in a historic moment for FK Novi Pazar after scoring the first goal in the top division for the club.http://www.danas.rs/dodaci/sandzak/gol_babica_i_pobeda_nad_slobodom.42.html?news_id=230229
