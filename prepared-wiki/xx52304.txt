==Controversial advertising==

===Australian illegal immigrants advertisement===

In Australia, Nando's ran an advertising campaign based around the 2002 political controversy regarding the mandatory detention of illegal immigrants. The detainees had been waging a hunger strike campaign, even resorting to physically sewing their lips closed. Nando's adverts proclaimed that the strikers "decided to unsew their lips after hearing the news that with every Nando's quarter chicken combo, Nando's are giving away an extra quarter chicken free". Melbourne's Sphere Advertising said that the ad was designed to spark controversy, saying that they knew that "there's a section of our audience that's going to be uncomfortable...but we want to evoke a response".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/28/1027818485483.html |title=Asylum seekers' plight used to peddle chickens |date=29 July 2002 |author=Peter Gotting |publisher=The Age |accessdate=2012-12-20 [/tpl]

===Malema advertisement===

During the South African national elections of 2009, Nando's made an advert lampooning African National Congress Youth League then president Julius Malema by using a puppet that resembled him. Malema's lawyers sued Nando's and the original advert was removed. However, an altered version was released, with the puppet's face pixelated and the voice altered. The puppet used in the advert was later sold at auction for R100,000 which was donated to an educational charity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?from=rss_South%20Africa&set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=nw20090507105043840C186257 |title=Julius puppet finds new home |date=7 May 2009 |author=Karyn Maughan |publisher= IOL News |accessdate=2012-12-20 [/tpl]

===Last Dictator advertisement===

In 2011 Nando's launched a "Last dictators" advert in South Africa.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.2oceansvibe.com/2011/11/24/nandos-releases-last-dictator-spoof-commercial-feat-mugabe-gaddafi-and-hussein/ |title=Nando’s Releases ‘Last Dictator’ Commercial, Feat. Mugabe, Gaddafi And Hussein |date=24 Nov 2011 |author= Seth Rotherham |publisher=2OceansVibe |accessdate=2012-12-20 [/tpl] The 60-second commercial shows a sad Robert Mugabe dining alone at Christmas in a large mansion while he reminisces about "happier times" with former dictators, such as playing water tag with Muammar Gaddafi, making snow angels in the sand with Saddam Hussein, singing Karaoke with Mao Zedong, pushing P. W. Botha on a swing set, and riding a tank with Idi Amin in a similar fashion to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embracing each other from the movie Titanic while the music from "Those Were the Days" is being played. Musekiwa Kumbula, holder of the Nando's franchise in Zimbabwe, said his group "strongly feels the advertisement is insensitive and in poor taste". The advert also offended Chipangano, a Zimbabwean youth militia loyal to Mugabe, who then demanded an apology from Nando’s, threatened to boycott the South Africa-based chain, and demanded the ad be withdrawn or the restaurant face retribution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/last-dictator-spoof-angers-mugabe-faithful-6269818.html |title='Last dictator' spoof angers Mugabe faithful |date=30 Nov 2011 |author=Angus Shaw |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=2012-12-20 [/tpl] Nando's South Africa subsequently withdrew the advert citing threats to its staff in Zimbabwe from a youth group.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16002239 |title=Nando's 'Mugabe' ad causes controversy in South Africa |date=2 December 2011 |author= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2012-12-20 [/tpl]
