==Location and features==

The summit of Buller can be reached by vehicle via the village coupled with a [tpl]convert|500|m[/tpl] short walk. It is also possible to climb the peak from Delatite River level you can follow the Klingsporn walking track. The Klingsporn track was the bridle trail in days gone by when stockmen would take their cattle up high for the summer months. The walk begins at Merimbah and is a [tpl]convert|8|km[/tpl] walk on a well defined track. An adventurous twist on this walk is to walk to the aptly named "Thank Christ Corner" on Shoulder spur and go off track along shoulder spur to Mclaughlin Spur to the summit. Mclaughlin Spur offers good views to the summit fire tower and the rocky outcrops that must be traversed. At the summit there is a stone distance dial and a fire tower that is manned during the summer months. 
The adjacent Mount Buller Alpine Resort is an attractive destination for many families and skiers who wish to attend for the day. With it only being a 3Â hr drive, it is the closest major mountain to Melbourne.

==Etymology==

Mount Buller was named by the explorer and surveyor Major Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell after an acquaintance in the Colonial Office. However the Aboriginal name for the mountain is Bulla Bulla meaning "good".[tpl]cite book |title=Place names of Victoria |first=Les |last=Blake |location=Adelaide |publisher=Rigby |year=1977 |pages=182, 50 [/tpl]
