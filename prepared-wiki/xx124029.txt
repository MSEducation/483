==Accident and death==

On January 10, 2012, Burke was seriously injured while training on the Park City Mountain Resort Eagle superpipe in Park City, Utah. This is the same superpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce was seriously injured in 2009. Onlookers reported that Burke had completed a trick fairly well yet fell onto her head, and the accident did not appear to be very severe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/action/freeskiing/story/_/id/7455119/freeskier-sarah-burke-remains-critical-surgery |title=Sarah Burke critical after surgery |publisher=A.P. at ESPN.go.com |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2012[/tpl] Moments later, however, she went into cardiac arrest while still on the ski slope,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/skiing/story/2012/01/16/sp-skiing-burke-condition.html|title=Freestyler Burke went into cardiac arrest after accident|publisher=CBC Sports[/tpl] making her chance of survival extremely low.[tpl]cite web|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/112/24_suppl/IV-146.full|title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Part 10.7: Cardiac Arrest Associated With Trauma|publisher=American Heart Association|date=November 28, 2005[/tpl] She was resuscitated and airlifted to the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, where she was reported to have been placed in a medically induced coma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/sarah-burke-freestyle-skier-coma-crash-training_n_1198669.html |title=Sarah Burke In Coma: Freestyle Skier Injured During Training In Park City, Utah |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2012[/tpl] The following day, she underwent neurosurgery to repair a tear in a vertebral artery.

Because the event at which she fell was unsanctioned and hosted by Burke's sponsor Monster Energy, Burke was not covered under the insurance policy that applied to her when she competed for the Canada Freestyle Ski Association. The day after her death, Burke's agent established a website to raise $550,000 to help pay her estimated $200,000 hospital costs and establish "a foundation to honour Sarah's legacy and promote the ideals she valued and embodied". Sarah Burke's medical bills covered by donations: British Columbia CBC News January 20, 2012
On February 23, 2014, Sarah's ashes were spread in the mountains over Sochi, Russia during the 2014 Olympic Games. Her former coach, Trennon Paynter, spread them on the highest point at Rosa Khutor complex, and in the halfpipe.
