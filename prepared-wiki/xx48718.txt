==History==

Less than a year after acquiring NeXT in the final days of 1996, Apple opened an online store on November 10, 1997, built using NeXT's WebObjects web application technology.
WebObjects enabled Apple to build and deploy its online store within a year. Steve Jobs announced that the new online store received over $12 million in orders in its first month of operation.http://www.uc.edu/ucitnow/winter_98/apple.html[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
