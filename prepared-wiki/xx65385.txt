Holley Mims (February 10, 1929 – January 13, 1970) was a highly regarded middleweight boxer during the 1950s and 1960s. His overall record 64-27-6 (13 KOs)Cyber Boxing Zone - http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mims-h.htm meant that he spent much of his career ranked among the top ten boxers in the middleweight category.
