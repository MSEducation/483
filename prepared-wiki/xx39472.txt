The Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a Muslim civil liberties advocacy organization that deals with civil advocacy. It is headquartered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., with regional offices nationwide.[tpl]cite web|title=CAIR at a Glance|url=http://www.cair.com/AboutUs/CAIRataGlance.aspx[/tpl]
Through media relations, lobbying, and education, CAIR presents an Islamic perspective on issues of importance to the American public, and seeks to empower the American Muslim community and encourage its social and political activism. Annual banquets, through which CAIR raises the majority of its funds, are attended by American politicians, statesmen, interfaith leaders, activists and media personalities. Critics of CAIR consider it to be pursuing an extremist Islamist agenda.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | title=Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S. | publisher=The New York Times. | date=March 14, 2007 | accessdate=February 8, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years (1994–2001)===

CAIR was founded in June 1994The North American Muslim resource guide: Muslim community life in the United States and Canada. Mohamed Nimer, Taylor & Francis, 2002, ISBN 9780415937283. by three former officers of the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP)—Omar Ahmad (IAP President; became CAIR President), Nihad Awad (IAP PR Director; became CAIR Secretary & Treasurer), and Rafeeq Jaber (IAP Chicago Chapter President; became CAIR Vice President). Also, Ibrahim Hooper became CAIR's communications director. As Nihad Awad later said in an interview, "Omar Ahmed suggested to me that we leave the IAP and concentrate on combating anti-Muslim discrimination." Testimony of Matthew Epstein Before the US Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security September 10, 2003 p. 10, accessed May 5, 2012
CAIR's first office was located in Washington D.C., as is its present-day headquarters on Capitol Hill. Its founding was partly in response to the film True Lies, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger which Arab and Muslim groups condemned for its stereotyping of Arab and Muslim villains.Shaheen, Jack, "Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People," 2001, ISBN 1-56656-388-7, Olive Branch Press The offices opened a month before the film's release. CAIR's first advocacy campaign was in response to an offensive greeting card that used the term "shia" to refer to human excrement. CAIR led a national campaign and used activists to pressure the greeting card company, which eventually withdrew the card from the market."News, July 2000". Islamic Voice. Retrieved on 2011-03-19.Noakes, Greg. "CAIR Counters Anti-Islam Card." Washington Report on Middle East Affairs November/December 1994: 62–64 CAIR opened its first chapter in the San Francisco Bay area.
In 1995, CAIR handled its first case of hijab (the headscarf traditionally worn by Muslim women) discrimination, in which a Muslim employee was denied the right to wear the hijab; this type of complaint is now one of the most common received by CAIR's civil rights department.Muslim minorities in the West: visible and invisible.

CAIR continued its advocacy work in the aftermath of the April 19, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. Following the attack, Muslim-Americans were subjected to an upsurge in harassment and discrimination, including a rise in hate crimes nationally;A Rush to Judgment: A Special Report on Anti-Muslim Stereotyping.

In 1996, CAIR began "CAIR-NET", a read-only e-mail listserve aimed to help American Muslims identify and combat anti-Muslim prejudice in the U.S. and Canada. CAIR-NET contains descriptions of news, bias incidents or hate speech and hate crimes, often followed by information as to who readers may contact to influence resolution of an issue.Smith, Jane. Islam in America. New York. Columbia University Press, 1999. CAIR also held its first voter registration drive in 1996; CAIR continues to encourage active political participation by American Muslims, for them to address political candidates and elected representatives with greater frequency.Wilgoren, Debbi. "Making Muslim Voices Heard: To Promote the Vote, Leaders Provide Answers and Forms." Washington Post. September 14, 1996: B01.
In 1996 CAIR published a report The Usual Suspects regarding its perception of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the media after the crash of TWA Flight 800. Their research showed 138 uses of the terms "Muslim" and "Arab" in the 48 hours after the crash in Reuters, UPI, and AP articles covering the incident. The official NTSB report said that the probable cause was mechanical.The North American Muslim resource guide: Muslim community life in the United States and Canada. Mohamed Nimer, p. 134, Taylor & Francis, 2002, ISBN 978-0-415-93728-3. Accessed December 9, 2009.
In 1997 CAIR objected to the production of sneaker made by Nike with a design on the heel similar to the Arabic word for "Allah"."Nike Recalls Disputed Logo" The Cincinnati Enquirer, June 25, 1997. Accessed October 24, 2011 As part of an agreement reached between CAIR officials and Nike representatives, Nike apologized to the Muslim community, recalled the products carrying the design, launched an investigation as to how the logo came about, and built a number of children's playgrounds near some Islamic centers in America.Nike and Islamic group end logo logjam.

In 2005 CAIR coordinated the joint release of a fatwa by 344 American Muslim organizations, mosques, and imams nationwide that stated: "Islam strictly condemns religious extremism and the use of violence against innocent lives. There is no justification in Islam for extremism or terrorism. Targeting civilians' life and property through suicide bombings or any other method of attack is haram or forbidden—and those who commit these barbaric acts are criminals, not martyrs.""Full text of July 2005 Fatwa against terrorism with list of signatories". CAIR.com. The fatwa cited passages from the Quran and hadith that prohibit violence against innocent people and injustice, and was signed by the Fiqh Council of North America.

In May 2007, the U.S. filed an action against the Holy Land Foundation (the largest Muslim charity in the United States at the time) for providing funds to Hamas, and federal prosecutors filed pleadings.

While being listed as co-conspirator does not mean that CAIR has been charged with anything, the organization was concerned that the label will forever taint it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/us/16charity.html|title=Muslim Groups Oppose a List of ‘Co-Conspirators’|last=MacFARQUHAR|first=Neil|date=2007-08-16|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 21, 2010[/tpl]
In response, National Association of Muslim Lawyers and National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, saying that the move to list the largest Muslim organizations in America as unindicted co-conspirators was an effort to smear the entire Muslim community. They also stated that the list breached the department’s own guidelines against releasing the names of unindicted co-conspirators.
The Investigative Project on Terrorism reported that on August 7, 2007, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent testified at the Holy Land Foundation trial that CAIR was "listed as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Palestine Committee", that it had received money from the Foundation (conflicting with Nihad Awad's Congressional testimony), and that co-founders Awad and Omar Ahmad were "listed as individual members of the Brotherhood Palestine Committee in America."Bawer, Bruce, Surrender: Appeasing Islam, Sacrificing Freedom, Random House, Inc., 2009, ISBN 0-385-52398-X, 9780385523981

In 2008, the FBI discontinued its long-standing relationship with CAIR.

As we have stated repeatedly since the 9/11 terror attacks, bin Laden never represented Muslims or Islam. In fact, in addition to the killing of thousands of Americans, he and Al Qaeda caused the deaths of countless Muslims worldwide.

==Controversy==

===Allegations of ties to Hamas===

Critics of CAIR have accused it of having past ties to Hamas. Federal Judge Jorge A. Solis said that there was evidence to show that that CAIR had an association with the Holy Land Foundation,  Islamic Association for Palestine and Hamas. However, Judge Solis' acknowledged that this evidence predates the official designation of these groups as terrorist organizations.[tpl]cite web|title=The King hearings: Is CAIR a 'terrorist organization'?|author=Glenn Kessler|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2011/03/the_king_hearings_is_cair_a_te.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=2011-03-10[/tpl]

As of 2007, FBI officials attended CAIR events.

===Foreign funding===

CAIR has an annual budget of around $3 million (as of 2007). It states that while the majority of its funding comes from American Muslims, it accepts donations from individuals of any faith and also foreigners. In the past CAIR has accepted donations from individuals and foundations close to Arab governments.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html?ex=1331524800&en=8b587f5174217e8d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neil|date= March 14, 2007 |title= Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S. |work= New York Times |accessdate= November 30, 2009 [/tpl] Within CAIR there is debate regarding foreign funding, and several CAIR branches have criticized the national office for accepting foreign donations.
According to Zuhdi Jasser, founder of American Islamic Forum for Democracy, CAIR has received "significant Saudi financing".[tpl]cite web|title=Exposing the 'Flying Imams'|publisher=Middle East Quarterly|date=Winter 2008|pages=3–11|url=http://www.meforum.org/1809/exposing-the-flying-imams|author=M.

In April 2011, Rep.

Steven Emerson called the funding request "hypocritical."Lawmaker Criticizes Muslim Group Director's 2009 Fundraising Letter to Qaddafi while CAIR spokesman, Ibrahim Hooper, said that the organization didn't receive any money from the Libyan government and also that CAIR was one of the first American organizations to call for a no-fly zone

===Lobbying and victimology===

Tawfik Hamid referred to CAIR as "perhaps the most conspicuous organization to persistently accuse opponents of Islamophobia". He criticised the way the organisation uses the "charge of 'Islamophobia' as a tool to intimidate and blackmail those ... who rightly criticize current Islamic practices and preachings", citing its lawsuit filed in the Flying imams incident.[tpl]cite web|author=Tawfik Hamid|title=How to End 'Islamophobia|url=http://www.standwithus.com/news/article.asp?id=101|publisher=StandWithUs|accessdate=24 January 2014[/tpl] Zuhdi Jasser has been stridently critical of CAIR by claiming that its agenda focused on "victimology". Neuroscientist and best-selling author Sam Harris, noted mainly for his contribution to the New Atheism movement, criticized CAIR by doubting their legitimacy saying CAIR is "an Islamist public relations firm posing as a civil-rights lobby".Sam Harris: Losing Our Spines to Save Our Necks. Huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-19.
Some Muslims criticize CAIR for taking a conservative religious approach on many issues. These critics claim that statements by the organization (for example, that all Muslim women are required to veil) often follow conservative Saudi religious doctrine and do not capture diverse religious perspectives.Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S.

==Responses to criticisms==

CAIR suggested that "the statements and agendas of our detractors will show that they represent the extremes in our society."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cair.com/PDF/urbanlegends.pdf | title=Urban Legends |publisher=Council on American-Islamic Relations | date=January 19, 2007 | accessdate=April 11, 2008[/tpl] CAIR also stated on its website that in 2004 an FBI agent said "false claims originate from one or two biased sources," and that a senior FBI official said CAIR would just have to live with them. In early 2007, the New York Times wrote that "more than one government official described the standards used by critics to link CAIR to terrorism as akin to McCarthyism, essentially guilt by association." At that time (prior to the Holy Land trial), the Times called efforts to link the organization to Hamas and Hezbollah "unsuccessful," citing a retired FBI official who was active through 2005 and who suggested that while "of all the groups, there is probably more suspicion about CAIR", you don't get "cold hard facts"[tpl]context needed[/tpl] although the article goes on to cite the suspicious background of some of CAIR's donors as a source of contention within members of the organization itself. The Times also noted that even though a handful of its former members had faced prosecution, no criminal charges had at the time ever been linked to CAIR.
CAIR also says that accusations against it have their roots in its refusal to endorse the U.S.'s blanket condemnation of Hezbollah and Hamas, though it says it did criticize Hamas for civilian deaths.
Senator Boxer's 2006 decision to withdraw a "certificate of accomplishment" originally given to former CAIR official Basim Elkarra on grounds of suspicions about the organization's background "provoked an outcry from organizations that vouch for the group's advocacy, including the ACLU and the California Council of Churches. "They have been a leading organization that has advocated for civil rights and civil liberties in the face of fear and intolerance, in the face of religious and ethnic profiling," said Maya Harris, executive director of the ACLU of Northern California.

==Litigation==

A book entitled Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld That's Conspiring to Islamize America by Paul David Gaubatz and Paul Sperry was published in October 2009. According to the Charlotte Observer, it portrays CAIR "as a subversive organization allied with international terrorists."Doyle, Michael, "Judge: Controversial 'Muslim Mafia' used stolen papers", Charlotte Observer, November 10, 2009, accessed November 17, 2009[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Consequently, CAIR brought a federal civil lawsuit against Dave Gaubatz and his son (who had obtained the book's CAIR source documents as a CAIR intern) for allegedly stealing the documents.25-page Opinion of Federal judge Kollar-Kotelly in Counsel on American-Islamic Relations vs. Gaubatz (November 3, 2009), accessed November 17, 2009Doyle, Michael, "Muslim Mafia Author Ordered to Remove Documents from Web", Kansas City Star, November 9, 2009, accessed November 15, 2009Abbott, Ryan (November 2, 2009).

Fox News Accessed November 15, 2009.Laney, Mary (November 12, 2009). "What is Going On in America? Corporate Diversity is not National Security". Chicago Daily Observer. Accessed November 15, 2009. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly concluded that the Gaubatzs "unlawfully obtained access to, and have already caused repeated public disclosure of, material containing CAIR's proprietary, confidential and privileged information," which CAIR says included names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of CAIR employees and donors. As a result the judge ordered Gaubatz to remove certain documents from his website. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also said that CAIR's employees have reported a dramatic increase in the number of threatening communications since the release of Mr. Gaubatz's book.
Gaubatz agreed in early November to return more than 12,000 pages of disputed CAIR records while the judge considered the lawsuit, but in late November before he could do so the U.S. Government, which previously had no role in the lawsuit, filed a motion in the case under seal, and FBI agents served the Gaubatzes' attorneys with a grand jury subpoena demanding the CAIR records.Gerstein, Josh, "FBI moves to seize CAIR records from author".
