Metallica is an American heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding "big four" of thrash metal alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Metallica was formed in 1981 when James Hetfield responded to an advertisement that drummer Lars Ulrich had posted in a local newspaper. The current line-up features founders Hetfield (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ulrich (drums), longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo, who joined the band in 2003. Previous members of the band are lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, bassists Ron McGovney (demos only), Cliff Burton (the first three records, died in 1986), and Jason Newsted. The band also had a long collaboration with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of its albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.
The band earned a growing fan-base in the underground music community and critical acclaim with its first four albums, with their third, Master of Puppets (1986), described as one of the most influential and heavy thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with their eponymous fifth album (also known as The Black Album), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.
In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without any band member's consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the "steel-sounding" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 25 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the first band to do so. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan Era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the fourth best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 53,642,000 albums in the United States alone.
In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings, and took ownership of all of their albums and videos.[tpl]cite web|title=Metallica Launch New Record Label|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/metallica-launch-new-record-label-20121130|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years (1981–1983)===

Metallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when the Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper—The Recycler—which read "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden." Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Early 1981 – Early 1982 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h73iF8Ol |work=MTV |archivedate=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2009[/tpl] The band was officially formed in October 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&n_categoryid=1988&year=1981?sPosx=41 |title=1981: Events |work=Timeline |publisher=Metallica |accessdate=December 26, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090623031847/http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&n_categoryid=1988&year=1981?sPosx=41 |archivedate=June 23, 2009[/tpl]
Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich used Metallica for the name of his band. A second advertisement was placed in The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered, and after seeing his expensive guitar equipment, Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song "Hit the Lights" for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo. Released on June 14, 1982, early pressings of Metal Massacre I listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica".[tpl]cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/lloyd-grant-interview-metallica/| title=Lloyd Grant Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=4 January 2012|last=Saulnier|first=Jason[/tpl] Although angered by the error, Metallica managed to create enough "buzz" with the song and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline March 14, 1982 – July 6, 1982 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=2 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h747w4yB |work=MTV |archivedate=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2009[/tpl] Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982. The term "thrash metal" was first referred to by Kerrang![tpl]'s[/tpl] journalist Malcolm Dome while making a reference to the Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad" in Kerrang![tpl]'s[/tpl] issue 62, page 8, published on February 23, 1984.[tpl]cite book | last = Dome | first = Malcolm | title = Kerrang! | chapter = Anthrax 'Fistful of Metal' | volume = 62 | publisher = Spotlight Publications Ltd. | date = February 23, 1984 | location = London, UK | page = 8[/tpl]
Prior to this, James Hetfield referred to their sound as "power metal". In the fall of 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go which featured bassist Cliff Burton in a band called Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney out as they thought that he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed." Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Fall 1982 – April 16, 1983 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=3 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBuBZnaR |work=MTV |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009[/tpl]
Metallica was ready to record its debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record's recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[tpl]Harvnb|Pillsbury|2006|p=2[/tpl]

===Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning (1983–1984)===

In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York, to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, with production duties handled by Paul Curcio.[tpl]Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=86[/tpl] Band members decided to kick Mustaine out of the band for drug and alcohol abuse and violent behavior just prior to the sessions on April 11, 1983.[tpl]cite journal |last=Cecolini |first=Vinny |date=November 1998 |title=Foreclosure of a Team |journal=Metal Hammer |ref=harv[/tpl] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett flew in to replace Mustaine the same afternoon.
Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews. He said Hammett "stole my job."[tpl]cite web |title=Dave Mustaine: James Hetfield Is Jealous of Me |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=27141 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBun2sKu |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 21, 2004 |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009[/tpl] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing the guitar leads that Mustaine wrote.[tpl]cite web |author=AskMen.com Editors |title=Interview: Dave Mustaine news |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_100/149b_dave_mustaine_interview.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hBvB86jd |work=AskMen.com |publisher=IGN Entertainment |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2009[/tpl] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine slammed Hammett saying, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No. 1 guitarist in your magazine."[tpl]cite web |title=Love it to Death – Bernard Doe speaks to Dave Mustaine about life after Metallica |last=Doe |first=Bernard |publisher=Metal Forces |url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-megadeth-mf12/ |accessdate=June 16, 2012[/tpl] On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar. Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983 at the nightclub The Showplace in Dover, New Jersey with Anthrax's original line-up, including Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin, as direct support.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.metallipromo.com/an.html |title=Anthrax; |publisher=Metallipromo.com |date=December 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2013[/tpl] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.
The band's debut studio album was initially going to be titled Metal Up Your Ass. Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album with that name, it was renamed Kill 'Em All. Released on Megaforce Records in the United States and Music for Nations in Europe, the album peaked at number 120 on the Billboard 200 in 1986, and although the album was not initially a financial success, some songs like "Whiplash", "Seek & Destroy", "Hit The Lights" and "The Four Horseman" earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[tpl]cite news|last=Lepage|first=Mark|date=October 31, 2009|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=9a47a506-f3a6-44e2-9fd3-443a42042b63|title=Metal metamorphosis|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=James Orban|accessdate=June 12, 2013[/tpl] The band embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven to support the release.[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline May 10–27, 1983 – July 27 – Sept 3, 1983 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=4 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hA8pmpfV |work=MTV |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2009[/tpl] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, where the band performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline October–December 1983 – August 1984 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=5 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hA91rPYW |work=MTV |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2009[/tpl]
Metallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. Released in August 1984, the album reached number 100 on the Billboard 200. A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Other songs on the album include "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Fade to Black", "Creeping Death", and the instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".

===Master of Puppets (1984–1986)===

Elektra Records A&R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a September 1984 Metallica concert. Impressed with what they saw, they signed Metallica to Elektra Records and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management.[tpl]cite web |title=Metallica Timeline Fall, 1984 – March 27, 1986 |url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=6 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hEnas3Pr |work=MTV |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009[/tpl] Metallica's burgeoning success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released a limited edition "Creeping Death" single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the United States. Two of the three songs on the record (cover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?", and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg") appeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[tpl]Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=130[/tpl] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S. marked a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and Armored Saint supporting. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt at Donington Park in England, playing in front of 70,000 people. A show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival saw the band play in front of a crowd of 60,000.
Metallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard 200, and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[tpl]cite web |title=Discography – Metallica |url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=metallica|chart=all[/tpl] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hEnwRGkd |work=Billboard |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009[/tpl] The album was the band's first to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Master%20of%20Puppets&artist=Metallica&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=May 26, 2010[/tpl] Steve Huey of Allmusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[tpl]cite web |first=Steve |last=Huey |title=Master of Puppets Overview |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=master-of-puppets-mw0000667490|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hEoIdeum |publisher=Allmusic |archivedate=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009[/tpl] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne for a United States tour. Hetfield broke his wrist skateboarding down a hill and continued the tour performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.

===Burton's death and Garage Days Re-Revisited (1986–1987)===

On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine the bunks of the tour bus in which they would sleep. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. Around dawn near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to flip several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and did not survive. Hetfield recalls, "I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the driver. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore." Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided that Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement.[tpl]cite web|title=Jason Newsted Interview|url= http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/jason-newsted-interview/|publisher=Music Legends |accessdate=May 6, 2013[/tpl]
Roughly 40 people tried out for auditions including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam. Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist, and after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided that Newsted was the one to replace Burton, and Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members took it on themselves to "initiate" Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.
After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice space (dubbed "the Metalli-mansion", a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker) and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, North of San Francisco.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2008/08/29/listening-to-death-magnetic-at-metallica-hq/ |title=MercuryNews.com – Listening to Death Magnetic at Metallica HQ |publisher=Blogs.mercurynews.com |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl]
Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield broke his wrist a second time skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel a Saturday Night Live appearance. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The extended play was recorded in an effort to utilize the band's newly constructed recording studio, test out the talents of Newsted, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All was released in 1987 commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica. Footage included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.

===...And Justice for All (1988–1990)===

...And Justice for All, the band's first studio album since Burton's death, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the Billboard 200, the band's first album to enter the top 10. The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[tpl]Harvnb|Christe|2003|p=196[/tpl] Newsted's bass was purposely turned down on the album as a part of the continuous "hazing" he received, and his musical ideas were ignored (however, he did receive writing credit on the track "Blackened"). There were complaints with the production; namely, Steve Huey of Allmusic noted Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=and-justice-for-all-mw0000196917|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=...And Justice for All – Review|author=Huey, Steve|accessdate=December 23, 2006|publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] The Damaged Justice tour followed to promote the album.
In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All, in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win; however, the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave. The result generated controversy among fans and the press, as Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony as he was expecting Metallica to win."Rockin' on an Island". Kerrang! 258. September 30, 1989. The award was named in Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'s[/tpl] "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".
Following the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One". The band performed the song in an abandoned warehouse, and footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV, with the alternate performance-only version held back in the event that MTV banned the remix version. MTV accepted the remix version, and the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. It was voted number 38 in 1999 when MTV aired its "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown, and was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/add_video/series.jhtml#/ontv/dyn/add_video/series.jhtml|title=A.D.D.

===Metallica (1990–1993)===

In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with the bands such as Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and Mötley Crüe, was hired as the producer. Metallica (also known as The Black Album) was remixed three times, cost US$1 million, and ended three marriages. Although the release was stalled until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the United States during its first week. The album was responsible for bringing Metallica to the attention of the mainstream and has been certified 16 times platinum in the United States, which makes it the 25th best-selling album in the country. The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. Dubbed the Wherever We May Roam Tour, it lasted 14 months and included dates in the United States, Japan, and the UK. In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performing a three-song set. Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.McIver, Joel (2004). Justice for All: The Truth About Metallica.
On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There was confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted recalls that Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger". Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour as Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. The band's first box set was released in November 1993 called Live Shit: Binge & Purge. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.

===Load, Reload, Garage Inc., and S&M (1994–1999)===

After almost three years of touring to support Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows which included headlining Donington Park in the United Kingdom, supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent roughly one year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts, marking the band's second number one. The cover of Load was created by Andres Serrano, and was called Blood and Semen III. Serrano pressed a mixture of his own semen and bovine blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in musical direction for the band and a new image with band members receiving haircuts. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in the summer of 1996.
During early production of the album, the band had produced enough material for a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, Reload. The cover was created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted number one on the Billboard 200, and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield noted in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that some of the songs on these albums were initially thought by the band to be of average quality, and were "polished and reworked" until judged to be releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997, performing "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull.
In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by bands such as Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, and Black Sabbath. The second disc featured the original The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.
On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters", approached the band in 1991 with the idea of pairing Metallica's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.

===Napster controversy (2000)===

In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available. Legal action was initiated against Napster with Metallica filing a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
Though the lawsuit named three universities for copyright infringement, the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Indiana University, no individuals were named. Yale and Indiana complied and blocked the service from its campuses, and Metallica withdrew the universities' inclusion in the lawsuit. USC, however, had a meeting with students to decide what was going to happen with Napster. School administrators wanted it banned as its usage accounted for 40% of the bandwidth not being used for educational purposes.
Metallica hired online consulting firm NetPD to monitor the Napster service for a weekend. A list of 335,435 Napster users who were believed to be sharing Metallica's music was compiled, and the 60,000-page document was delivered to Napster's office as Metallica requested the users be banned from the service. The users were banned, and rap artist Dr. Dre joined the lawsuit against Napster, which resulted in an additional 230,142 Napster users banned.
Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site place a filter on the program in 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement was reached between Metallica and Napster when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest to purchase the rights to Napster for $94 million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. However, on June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[tpl]cite news | last=Evangelista | first=Benny | title=Napster runs out of lives – judge rules against sale | date=September 4, 2002 |work=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Napster-runs-out-of-lives-judge-rules-against-2774278.php |accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl]
At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared in a skit with host Marlon Wayans that blasted the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student sitting in his dorm room listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. On receiving Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing", Ulrich retorted that Marlon's idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking." He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost nude in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own."MTV Video Music Awards 2000.

===Newsted's departure and St. Anger (2001–2005)===

As plans were being made to enter the recording studio, Newsted left the band on January 17, 2001. His statement revealed his departure was based on "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love." During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted revealed intentions he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was against the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica" and a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way". Newsted countered his statement by saying Hetfield recorded vocals for a song in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, and appears on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[ref]

In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the next studio album. Over two years, more than 1,000 hours of footage was recorded. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab owing to "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hiatus and the band's future was in doubt. Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002, though Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day, noon to 4 pm, and spend the rest of his time with his family. The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted described his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own as "really fucking lame and weak".Some Kind of Monster feature film, Metallica, January 2004, Paramount Pictures.
For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass, both on the album and for the few live shows at which Metallica performed during that time frame. Once the record was completed, in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists that auditioned included Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse. Following three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist. As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod as part of the touring bill.
In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum, and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism. Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net commented that "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing", and Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as "an utter mess". However, Blender magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and New York Magazine called it "utterly raw and rocking". The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004, and was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.
Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival in England, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fri.dk/personlig-udvikling/lars-ulrich-fra-total-ass-til-familiefar |title=Lars Ulrich – fra 'total ass' til familiefar |publisher=FRI.DK |work=Berlingske Media |date=June 27, 2009 |author=Tonie Yde Mørch |accessdate=June 7, 2011[/tpl] and was unable to perform. Hetfield searched for volunteers at the last minute to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo, and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed the songs "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", with Jordison performing the remainder of the set.[tpl]cite web|title=Metallica's Lars Ulrich Hospitalized in Switzerland, Misses Show|publisher=Yahoo Music|date=June 7, 2004|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/metallica/news/metallicas-lars-ulrich-hospitalized-in-switzerland-misses-show--12054238|accessdate=December 9, 2006[/tpl] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rockers Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. However, for two shows on November 13, 2005, and November 15, 2005, Metallica opened for The Rolling Stones at AT&T Park in San Francisco.

Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking any legal action against the retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich made such responses to the leak as, "...We're ten days from release.

==Style and lyrical themes==

Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, and Scorpions,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/30_on_30_the_greatest_guitarists_picked_by_the_greatest_guitarists?page=0%2C7 |title=30 on 30: The Greatest Guitarists Picked by the Greatest Guitarists |publisher=guitarworld.com |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100505131334/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/30_on_30_the_greatest_guitarists_picked_by_the_greatest_guitarists?page=0,7  |archivedate=May 5, 2010[/tpl] New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands such as Venom, Motörhead, Diamond Head, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden, as well as early punk rock bands such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Misfits. Early Metallica releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumentals. Steve Huey of Allmusic said that Ride the Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers". Huey felt Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with more personal and socially conscious issues. Lyrical themes explored on Master of Puppets included religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs.
In 1991, with new producer Bob Rock, Huey felt Metallica simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to the mainstream audience. The band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range, said Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone. The change in direction proved commercially successful as Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load, an album that has been described as "an almost alternative rock" approach, the band focused on non-metal influences and changed musical direction. Moving away from lyrical themes dealing with drugs and monsters, Metallica's new lyrical approach focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza. David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash" and called Load the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed more blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.
St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound". The band used drop C tuning, and Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown noted it "reverberates with a thwong". Lyrics on the album dealt with Hetfield's stint in rehab, including references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album, Death Magnetic, the band returned to E tuning and guitar solos. A return to their thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and lyrics dealing with subtle suicide and redemption.[tpl]cite book|last=Edmondson|first=Jacqueline|title=Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-313-39348-6|page=708|url=http://books.google.mk/books?id=TQPXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA708&dq=Jacqueline+Edmondson+metallica&hl=en&sa=X&ei=osWQUuiOFfGY0AXMvYA4&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Jacqueline%20Edmondson%20metallica&f=false[/tpl]
