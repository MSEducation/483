</ref> As a result Schumacher won a very controversial championship, the first German to do so ([[Jochen Rindt]] raced under the Austrian flag).
In [tpl]F1|1995[/tpl] Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton. He now had the same Renault engine as Williams. He accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Damon Hill. With team-mate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship and became the youngest two-time world champion in Formula One history.
The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the [tpl]F1 GP|1995|British[/tpl] on lap 45 and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won nine of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the [tpl]F1 GP|1995|Belgian[/tpl], he qualified 16th, but went on to win the race.

===Ferrari (1996–2006)===

In [tpl]F1|1996[/tpl], Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in [tpl]F1|1979[/tpl] and the Constructors' Championship in [tpl]F1|1983[/tpl], for a salary of $60 million over 2 years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[tpl]cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Steve |date=August 2007 |title=McLaren dream team turns into nightmare |journal=Autosport |volume=189 |issue=6 |pages=6–8 [/tpl] A year later, ex-Benetton employees Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn, who had been Technical Director at Benetton since 1991,[tpl]cite web | title = Ross Brawn Profile | publisher=theScuderia.net | url = http://www.thescuderia.net/rossbrawn.shtml | first = Matthew | last = Bewers | accessdate=3 January 2008[/tpl] and who were one of the key members behind Schumacher's title successes with the team in 1994 and 1995, decided to join Schumacher at Ferrari. This increased Schumacher's motivation to build a more experienced and potentially championship-winning team around him.
Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as "truck", "pig", and "accident waiting to happen".[tpl]cite news | title = Switch the key to Ferrari revival | publisher=Telegraph Sport |date=20 October 2006 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/10/20/smbake20.xml&site=2&page=0 |first = Andrew |last = Baker |accessdate =29 October 2006 | location=London[/tpl] The poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke too. At the end of 1995, though the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[tpl]cite book| last =Henry| first =Alan (ed)| authorlink =Alan Henry| title =AUTOCOURSE 1996–97| publisher=Hazleton Publishing| year =1996| pages =46–48| url =| isbn = 1-874557-91-8 [/tpl] Schumacher declared the Ferrari 412T good enough to win the Championship.
Schumacher, Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne, and Jean Todt (hired in 1993), have been credited as turning this once struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[tpl]cite web | title = Schumacher confirms retirement | publisher=MSN Cars |date=11 September 2006 | url = http://crashnet.cars.msn.co.uk/news_view.asp?cid=1&id=137166 | accessdate =28 September 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Ferrari: Formula 1's Most Successful Team Enters a New Era | publisher=about.com | url = http://formula1.about.com/od/teams/p/Ferrari.htm | accessdate =12 June 2007 [/tpl] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believes the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[tpl]cite news | title = Schumacher 'made Ferrari great' |first = Andrew |last = Benson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/motorsport/formula_one/6061442.stm | accessdate =6 November 2006[/tpl] Eddie Irvine also joined the team, moving from Jordan.

====1996–1999====

Schumacher finished third in the drivers' championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the constructors' championship ahead of his old team Benetton. He won three races, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. During the initial part of the 1996 season, the car had had reliability trouble and Schumacher did not finish 6 of the 16 races. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet. In the [tpl]F1 GP|1996|French[/tpl] Schumacher qualified in pole position, but suffered engine failure on the race's formation lap.[tpl]cite news | title = GRAND PRIX RESULTS: FRENCH GP, 1996 | publisher=grandprix.com | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr590.html |first = Magny |last = Cours | accessdate =18 April 2007[/tpl] However at Spa-Francorchamps, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Following that, at Monza, Schumacher won in front of the tifosi. Schumacher's ability, combined with the improving reliability of Ferrari, enabled him to end the season putting up a challenge to eventual race and championship winner Damon Hill at the Suzuka.
Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve vied for the title in [tpl]F1|1997[/tpl]. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/race/r713fqreport.html| title = Friday Press Conference| accessdate =8 November 2006|date=10 October 2003 | publisher=GrandPrix.com[/tpl] However by mid-season, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, held at Jerez, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he may not finish the race. As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival, Schumacher attempted to provoke an accident[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/29895.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Schumacher loses championship runner-up crown|date=11 November 1997|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] but got the short end of the stick, retiring from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. Schumacher was punished for unsportsmanlike conduct for the collision and was disqualified from the Drivers' Championship.
In [tpl]F1|1998[/tpl], Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen became Schumacher's main title competition. Häkkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. Ferrari took a 1–2 finish at the [tpl]F1 GP|1998|French[/tpl], the first Ferrari 1–2 finish since 1990, and the [tpl]F1 GP|1998|Italian[/tpl], which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points, but Häkkinen won the Championship by winning the final two races. There were two controversies; at the [tpl]F1 GP|1998|British[/tpl] Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start finish line and stopped for a ten-second stop go penalty. There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid. At Spa, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. After both cars returned to the pits, Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him.
Rumours circulated that Coulthard may be replaced by Schumacher for the 1999 season and beyond and, in a previous edition of the F1 Racing magazine, Ron Dennis revealed that he had approached Schumacher to sign a deal with McLaren. However, peripheral financial issues that tied Schumacher with Ferrari, such as sponsorship agreements and payment, could not be rectified in a move to the rival team and so no deal came to fruition.
Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors title in [tpl]F1|1999[/tpl]. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the [tpl]F1 GP|1999|British[/tpl] at the high-speed Stowe Corner, his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track and resulting in a broken leg.[tpl]cite news |title = Schumacher out of action |url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02071.html |publisher=GrandPrix.com |date=12 July 1999 |accessdate =25 October 2006[/tpl] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races he made his return at the inaugural [tpl]F1 GP|1999|Malaysian[/tpl], qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, assisting team mate Eddie Irvine's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari. In the last race of the season, the [tpl]F1 GP|1999|Japanese[/tpl], Häkkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher would later say that Häkkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[tpl]cite web | title = Hall of Fame – World Champions: Mika Hakkinen | publisher=The Official Formula 1 Website |year=2006 | url = http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/40/ | accessdate =5 October 2006[/tpl]

====2000–2004: World Championship years====

During this period Schumacher won more races and championships than any other driver in the history of the sport. Schumacher won his third World Championship in [tpl]F1|2000[/tpl] after a year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Mid-way through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes,  allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings. Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the [tpl]F1 GP|2000|Italian[/tpl]. At the post race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol, Ayrton Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3605579.stm|title= A death that shocked the world|date=21 April 2004|accessdate=21 April 2007|publisher=BBC |first = Andrew |last = Benson [/tpl] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the [tpl]F1 GP|2000|Japanese[/tpl]. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the championship.
In [tpl]F1|2001[/tpl], Schumacher took his fourth drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the world championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the [tpl]F1 GP|2001|Canadian[/tpl], where Schumacher finished 2nd to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first ever 1–2 finish by brothers in Formula One;[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] and the Belgian Grand Prix in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.
In [tpl]F1|2002[/tpl], Schumacher used the Ferrari F2002 to retain his Drivers' Championship.
There was again some controversy, however, at the [tpl]F1 GP|2002|Austrian[/tpl], where his teammate, Rubens Barrichello was leading but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race. The crowd broke into outraged boos at the result and Schumacher tried to make amends by allowing Barrichello to stand on the top step of the podium. At the [tpl]F1 GP|2002|United States[/tpl] later that year, Schumacher dominated the race and was set for a close finish with Barrichello. At the end he slowed down to create a formation finish with Barrichello, but slowed too much allowing Barrichello to take the victory.
In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five world championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[tpl]cite news|title=Top 10 Michael Schumacher moments|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/10-schumacher-momments.html|work=CBC Sports|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|first=John C.|last=Molinaro|date=12 September 2006|accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning eleven times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Rubens Barrichello. This pair finished 9 of the 17 races in the first two places.
Schumacher broke Juan Manuel Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in [tpl]F1|2003[/tpl], a closely contested season. The biggest competition came once again from the McLaren Mercedes and Williams BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher ran off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[tpl]cite news | title = Coulthard takes Melbourne thriller |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2832441.stm | accessdate =3 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Raikkonen claims maiden win |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2877461.stm | accessdate =3 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Raikkonen wins chaotic race |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2922651.stm | accessdate =3 November 2006[/tpl] He fell 16 points behind Kimi Räikkönen. Schumacher won the [tpl]F1 GP|2003|San Marino[/tpl] and the next two races, and closed within two points of Räikkönen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada, and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the [tpl]F1 GP|2003|Hungarian[/tpl], Michael Schumacher led Montoya and Kimi Räikkönen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the [tpl]F1 GP|2003|Italian[/tpl]. Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the [tpl]F1 GP|2003|United States[/tpl], only Schumacher and Räikkönen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the [tpl]F1 GP|2003|Japanese[/tpl], Schumacher needed only one point whilst Räikkönen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of Räikkönen.
In [tpl]F1|2004[/tpl], Schumacher won a record twelve of the first thirteen races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Juan Pablo Montoya during a safety car period when he briefly locked his car's brakes. He clinched a record seventh drivers' title at the [tpl]F1 GP|2004|Belgian[/tpl]. He finished that season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up, teammate Rubens Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the [tpl]f1|2002[/tpl] season.

====2005–2006====

Rule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2004/10/2367.html | title = FIA announce rule changes for 2005 and 2006 | work=The Official Formula 1 Website |date=22 October 2004 | accessdate=13 April 2007 [/tpl] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[tpl]cite news |title = Michael Schumacher | url = http://www.f1complete.com/content/view/376/273/ | publisher=f1complete.com | accessdate =30 November 2007[/tpl] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting. The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind the Spanish driver.[tpl]cite news | title = Alonso holds off Schumacher surge |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4478747.stm | accessdate =3 November 2006[/tpl] Less than half-way through the season, Schumacher said "I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more.

Prior to that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the six drivers using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap.[tpl]cite news |title = Schumacher takes hollow USGP victory | url = http://www.crash.net/news_view.asp?cid=1&id=113296 | publisher=Crash.net |date = 19 June 2005 | accessdate =19 June 2007[/tpl] Schumacher retired in six of the 19 races. He finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of world champion Alonso.
[tpl]F1|2006[/tpl] became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races. His pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.
Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the [tpl]F1 GP|2006|Monaco[/tpl] and started the race at the back of the grid. This was due to his stopping his car and blocking part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to 5th place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit.
By the [tpl]F1 GP|2006|Canadian[/tpl], the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an engine failure)[tpl]cite news | title = Alonso's Renault Engine blew in spectacular fashion | publisher=Motorsport.com |date=10 September 2006 | url = http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=232358 | accessdate =1 August 2007[/tpl] and China, in which Alonso had tyre problems,[tpl]cite news | title = Alonso has trouble with his front tires |work=The Washington Post |date=1 October 2006 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100100207_2.html | accessdate =1 August 2007 | first=Salvatore | last=Zanca[/tpl] Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season. Although he and Alonso had the same point total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.
The Japanese Grand Prix was led by Schumacher with only 16 laps to go, when, for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, Schumacher's car suffered an engine failure. Alonso won the race, giving himself a ten-point championship lead. With only one race left in the season, Schumacher could only win the championship if he won the season finale and Alonso scored no points.

===2007–2009: First retirement===

While Schumacher was on the podium after winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari issued a press release stating that he would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season.[tpl]cite press release | title =Michael Schumacher will retire from race driving at the end of the 2006 World Championship. | publisher=Ferrari S.p.A. |date=10 September 2006 | url =http://www.ferrariworld.com/events/ms/pdf/monza01_en.pdf | accessdate =24 October 2006|format=PDF[/tpl] Schumacher confirmed his retirement.

====2007: Advisor at Ferrari====

He attended several Grands Prix during the season. Schumacher drove the Ferrari F2007 for the first time on 24 October at Ferrari's home track in Fiorano, Italy. He ran no more than five laps and no lap times were recorded. A Ferrari spokesman said the short drive was done for the Fiat board of directors who were holding their meeting in Maranello.[tpl]cite news | first = Biranit | last = Goren | coauthors = Lostia, Michele | title = Schumacher in the F2007 for the first time | url = http://www.autosport.com/news/grapevine.php/id/59831 | work=Autosport | publisher=Haymarket Publications | accessdate =31 January 2009 | date = 25 October 2007[/tpl]
During the [tpl]F1|2007[/tpl] season Schumacher acted as Ferrari's advisor and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.
On 13 November 2007 Schumacher, who had not driven a Formula One car since he had retired a year earlier, undertook a formal test session for the first time aboard the F2007. He returned in December 2007 to continue helping Ferrari with their development program at Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.

====2008: Car development====

In 2007, former Ferrari top manager Ross Brawn said that Schumacher was very likely and also happy to continue testing in 2008 Schumacher later explained his role further saying that he would "deal with the development of the car inside Gestione Sportiva" and as part of that "I'd like to drive, but not too often.".[tpl]cite web | title = Schumi in charge of developing cars | work=Gazzetta dello Sport via f1technical.net | date = 11 January 2008 | url = http://www.f1technical.net/news/7958?sid=46d7fcb4610cac76f4d809a27d741051 | accessdate =11 January 2008[/tpl]

===Mercedes (2010–2012)===

In December 2009 it was announced that Schumacher would be returning to Formula One in the [tpl]F1|2010[/tpl] season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8427552.stm |title=Michael Schumacher signs up for F1 return with Mercedes|date=23 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=23 December 2009[/tpl] The new Mercedes team was their first majority involvement in an F1 team since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa for Ferrari had initiated a renewed interest in F1, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/12/24/schumacher-returns-for-a-legacy-or-misery/ | title = Schumacher returns for a legacy or misery | last=Musolino | first=Adrian | date =24 December 2009| work=The Roar| accessdate =24 December 2009[/tpl] After a period of intensive training medical tests, it was confirmed that the neck injury that had prevented him driving for Ferrari the year before had fully healed. Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth £20m.
Schumacher's surprise return to F1 was compared to Niki Lauda's in 1982 aged 33 and Nigel Mansell's return in 1994 at age 41. Schumacher turned 41 in January 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with the record set by the oldest F1 champion Juan Manuel Fangio who was 46 when he won his fifth championship.

====2010: Return to Formula One====

Schumacher's first drive of the 2010 Mercedes car – the Mercedes MGP W01 – was at an official in February 2010 in Valencia. He finished sixth in the first race of the season at the [tpl]F1 GP|2010|Bahrain[/tpl]. After the Malaysian race former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher, who had finished behind his team-mate in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races, might be "past it."[tpl]cite news|title=Schumacher is 'past it' – Moss|url=http://en.espnf1.com/mercedes/motorsport/story/15453.html|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=25 August 2011|publisher=ESPN F1[/tpl] Many other respected former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned "you should never write Schumacher off."[tpl]cite news|url=http://theblackstuff.co.uk/?p=1438|title=Damon Hill: Never, Ever, Ever, Ever Write Off Schumacher|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=25 August 2011|work=The Black Stuff|publisher=The Media Halls[/tpl] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns22213.html|title=Will chassis upgrade solve Schumacher woes?|date=3 May 2010|publisher=Inside F1, inc|accessdate=27 May 2010[/tpl] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes 2010 car was designed for him, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/110072827638/schumachers-car-designed-for-me---button#ixzz17z1I3vRO|title=Schumacher's car designed for me – Button|work=WorldCarFans|publisher=Black Falcon Media Group|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=13 December 2010[/tpl]

However, he was penalised 20 seconds after the race by the race stewards dropping him to 12th. The stewards judged the pass to be in breach of the FIA's sporting code. Mercedes differing interpretation of the regulation would later lead to it being clarified by the FIA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns22278.html|title=FIA To Clarify Safety Car Regulations|date=20 May 2010|publisher=GrandPrix.com|accessdate=27 May 2010[/tpl]

==Helmet==

Schumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.jeccomposites.com/composites-news/682/Even-a-tank.html |title= Even a tank can't halt schu now |accessdate=8 November 2006 |publisher=JEC Composites[/tpl] The helmet keeps the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theprancinghorse.co.uk/news/newsfeatures/1.html |title=Michael Schumacher Helmet Profile |accessdate=10 February 2007 |publisher=theprancinghorse.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230064118/http://www.theprancinghorse.co.uk/news/newsfeatures/1.html  |archivedate=30 December 2006[/tpl]
Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his team-mate, Schumacher added 4 red diagonal strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his team-mate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[tpl]cite web | title = Michael Schumacher Biography | url = http://www.mschumacher.com/biography.html | publisher=mschumacher.com | accessdate =25 October 2006[/tpl] Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colors (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.
He sported one-off helmet designs four times. For the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he replaced the German flag with a chequered flag motif and reflective silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian Grand Prix the German flag design was replaced with an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian Grand Prix race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final Grand Prix), he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=29768 |title=Michael's winning helmet |date=21 October 2006 |accessdate=7 November 2006 |publisher=PitPass[/tpl] For the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://plus.autosport.com/free/feature/3825/behind-the-scenes-at-spa/|title=Behind the scenes at Spa|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=Autosport|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011|quote=Helmet supplier Schuberth provided him with a special 21-carat gold plated helmet, which he wore as a special one-off for the weekend.[/tpl] The helmet, very similar to his current helmet, included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven world titles. For the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 300th Grand Prix appearance he wore a special platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.

==Honours==
