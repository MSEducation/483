==Life==

John Man, English ambassador in Madrid, had called the pope a sanctimonious little monk and so Philip II replaced the priest Diego de Silva y Guzmán with Espés as ambassador to England. William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley referred to Espés as
In the Spanish Netherlands the Geuzens' Revolt began and in November 1568 the royal treasury in Seville sent five ships with 40,000 pounds of gold, with which Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba was to raise troops in the Netherlands to quell the revolt. These ships were attacked by huguenot privateers and sought protection in British waters. Espés told Elizabeth that the gold belonged to Philip's bankers and was being sent to Antwerp and asked that Elizabeth protect the ships. She agreed and most of the ships anchored in English ports. However, news then reached Elizabeth of a Spanish attack on the British colony in San Juan de Ulúa and in reprisal ordered that the ships be confiscated and their gold moved to the Tower of London.Colin Martin, Geoffrey Parker, The Spanish Armada S.61 On Espés's advice, 
Alva then seized the goods of English merchant ships anchored at Antwerp.http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/elizabeth_spain.htm
