==History==

Utility Trailer was founded in 1914 by E.W. Bennett and H.C. Bennett, and was one of the first truck trailer manufacturers in the United States. The first product was a single axle trailer designed to accommodate 60 bales of cotton. 
During World War I, Utility Trailer built cable reel trailers for the U.S. Government. The trailers allowed one person to pick up and move a large spool of wire with minimal effort. The company provided ammunition trailers and other items to the U.S. Government during World War II.
The rapid expansion of the Interstate Highway System in the U.S. helped Utility Trailer to survive the Great Depression and grow during tough economic times. Over the years, factories were built and acquired, and the company invested in developing new trailer technology.
