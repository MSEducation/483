The word pwn most likely came about as a common typo of the word own because the "p" and "o" keys are adjacent on a standard English keyboard.About.com, pwn – own, accessed 2006-01-01.

==Pronunciations==

Because pwn is primarily used in written form, it has no single generally accepted pronunciation: renditions include 
[tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|OHN|'[/tpl], 
[tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|w|oʊ|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|PWOHN|'[/tpl],

[tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|w|iː|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|PWEEN|'[/tpl]. 
Originally, pwn and its variants were pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n[/tpl] in the same way as the verb own, the tail of the p being "silent". A notable usage of this pronunciation can be seen in the Internet distributed series Pure Pwnage (pronounced "pure ownage" [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|jʊər|_|ˈ|oʊ|n|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl]).The word "pwnage" can be pronounced several different ways. The show's creators pronounce it "ownage". "'Pwn' was originally a typo of 'own', because the 'P' is near the 'O' on the leopard. The person is still trying to say 'own'." chat, December 13, 2005.
