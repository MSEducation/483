==Overview and massacre==

According to the Memorial, the villages of Malibeyli and Gushchular were attacked by Armenian irregular armed units where the houses were burned and dozens of civilians were killed. Both sides accused the other that the villages were being used as strategic gathering points, covering the artillery positions."Доклад правозащитного центра «Мемориал» о массовых нарушениях прав человека, связанных с занятием населенного пункта Ходжалы в ночь с 25 на 26 февраля 1992 г. вооружёнными формированиями." Memorial. According to several eyewitnesses, the Azerbaijani self-defense forces were mixed in with civilians as they fled.
Azerbaijani populated villages of Malibeyli and Gushchular (administratively separated as Ashaghi Gushchular and Yukhari Gushchular) of Shusha district of Azerbaijan are located in the highlands of Karabakh region, close to the regional center of Shusha. The villages had a population of nearly 4,000 people and shared the same village administration. Like Khojaly in 1988, Gushchular and Malibeyli received Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia. The figure ranged from 580 to 1500. When the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict started, the villages became one of the main targets of Armenian armed units. Since October 1991, Malibeyli was in complete blockade.

A report in the newspaper Express Chronicle asserted that on February 5, a helicopter distributed warning leaflets telling villagers they had two days to leave the village before it "would cease to exist", however, no interviews confirmed this report. By the beginning of February 1992, these villages were virtually under siege and frequently shelled by Armenians. According to Human Rights Watch, the villages had a joint self-defense unit of about 80 people, including 17 policemen serving in Gushchular. By February, the Azerbaijani self-defense had only 5 or 6 automatic rifles.[tpl]Third-party-inline|date=February 2013[/tpl] Since October 1991, the residents were confined to their villages and the only way in or out was by helicopter. The last helicopter to fly into Shusha district was shot down by Armenians on January 28. At midnight on February 10, Armenian armed units, reportedly aided by Russian troops, stormed Malibeyli village. The women and children from Malibeyli fled to Gushchular village. Villagers of both villages took positions and fought the enemy until 9 am. All roads to the nearby towns of Shusha and Khojaly were cut off. The closest village was Abdal Gulbaly of Agdam district and required passage through Armenian held villages. Most of the armed ethnic Armenians were volunteers from Syria, Lebanon, the United States, and France.[tpl]cite book |title=My brother's road |last1=Markar |first1=Melkonian|year=2008 |publisher= I.
