[[Finedon railway station]]

CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Northamptonshire

Finedon railway station was built by the Midland Railway in 1857 on its extension from Leicester to Bedford and Hitchin. 
It had one island platform. Being a mile and a half from Finedon village it was little used in later years and closed to passengers in 1940. It remained open for goods until 1964 and had quite large sidings for the local stone, with a tramway to the Excelsior and the Finedon Hill mines.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
