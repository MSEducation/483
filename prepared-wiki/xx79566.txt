Quark is a type of fresh dairy product. It is made by warming soured milk until the desired degree of coagulation (denaturation) of milk proteins is met, and then strained.also see this diagram for another manufacturing process Dictionaries usually translate it as curd cheese or cottage cheese, although most commercial varieties of cottage cheese are made with rennet, whereas traditional quark is not. It is soft, white and unaged, similar to some types of fromage blanc. It is distinct from ricotta because ricotta (Italian: "recooked") is made from scalded whey. It is similar to the Indian Chakka. Quark usually has no salt added.
In Germany, quark is sold in small plastic tubs and usually comes in three different varieties, Magerquark (lean quark, virtually fat-free), "regular" quark (20% fat in dry mass) and Sahnequark (creamy quark, 40% fat in dry mass) with added cream. While Magerquark is often used for baking and as health food, e.g. as a breakfast spread, Sahnequark also forms the basis of a large number of quark desserts. Much like yoghurts in some parts of the world, these foods mostly come with fruit flavouring (Früchtequark, fruit quark), and are often also simply referred to as quark. Because mainstream popularity of quark desserts is limited to mainly the German-speaking and eastern European countries, confusion might arise when talking about quark with people unfamiliar with cuisine from this area.

==Name==

The name comes from the Late Middle High German Quark, centuries earlier also spelled QuarckQuarck, Quarg, Quark-Käs Wörterbuch from 1711. J Rädlein, Leipzig  was also called twarc, dwarg,quarc, quargelQuargel, Quaergel, small handformed cheeses zwarg (meaning Zwerg (English dwarf) for its smaller than regular cheese size. The Greek name for cheese is recorded as Tyros, Tyr, Turo Greek names for  cheese It is also known in Lower Sorbian Slavic as tvarogtwarog in literatur (Polish twaróg, Belarusian тварог, Russian творог, and Czech and Slovak tvaroh) which also means "curd". In Austria, the name Topfen (pot cheese) is used. In Flanders, it is called plattekaas (flat cheese), while the Dutch use the name kwark. In French it is called fromage à la pie. In Denmark, it is called kvark. In Norway and Sweden, it is called kvarg. In Hungarian cuisine it is termed túró, with the word juhtúró referring to quark made from ewe's milk.
The cheese product starts out as thick milk or soured milk (from German Dicke Milch or Saure Milch/Sauermilch M.H.G surmilch), or as "white cheese" (Polish: ser biały, [tpl]lang-lt|Baltas sūris[/tpl], southern Germany: Weißkäse or weißer Käs, Hebrew: Gvina Levana גבינה לבנה, [tpl]lang-sr|beli sir[/tpl]), as opposed to any rennet-set "yellow cheese".
In Finnish, it is known as rahka, while in Estonian, as kohupiim (foamy milk). In Latvian, it is called biezpiens (thick milk). The French-language word for it is seré, but it is most commonly called fromage blanc.
Quark is possibly described  by Tacitus in his book Germania as lac concretum (thick milk), eaten by Germanic peoples.Tacitus: De origine et situ Germanorum (Germania), par. 23
In the midwestern US, quark is called simply farmer's cheese.

==Production==

Quark is a member of the acid set cheese group, meaning it is traditionally made without the aid of rennet.[tpl]cite book |last=Fox |first=Patrick F |year=2004 |title=Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology |volume=Volume 1: General Aspects |edition=3rd |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-263652-3[/tpl] In most German dairies today, it is made with rennet.In Molkereien produzierter Quark wird meist mit Lab hergestellt.(Quark produced in dairies is usually made with rennet.)

In Germany, the curd is continuously stirred to prevent it from getting hard, resulting in a thick, creamy texture. Quark is usually sold in plastic tubs with most or all of the whey. This type of quark has the firmness of sour cream but is slightly drier, resulting in a somewhat crumbly texture (like Italian ricotta), and contains in its basic form about 0.2% fat. Quark with higher fat content is made by adding cream, and is often sold flavored with herbs, spices, or fruit. It has a very smooth and creamy texture and is slightly sweet (unlike sour cream).
To make the firmer eastern European version, a small amount of rennet may be added to make the curd firmer. Some or most of the whey is removed to standardize the quark to the desired thickness. Traditionally, this is done by hanging the cheese in loosely woven cotton gauze called cheesecloth and letting the whey drip off, which gives quark its distinctive shape of a wedge with rounded edges. In industrial production, however, cheese is separated from whey in a centrifuge and later formed into blocks. The Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, Ukrainian and Austrian varieties contain less whey and are therefore drier and more solid than varieties common in other countries.
Quark consists of 60% to 80% water. Dry mass has 1% to 40% fat; most of the rest is protein (80% of which is casein), calcium, and phosphate.

==Common uses==

Various cuisines, especially cuisines of German-speaking countries and of Slavic peoples (e.g. Slovaks, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians) feature quark as an ingredient for appetizers, salads, main dishes, side dishes and desserts.
Quark is often used as an ingredient for sandwiches, salads, cheesecake (Käsekuchen or Quarkkuchen in Germany,  Quarktorte in Switzerland, Topfenkuchen in Austria, kwarktaart in the Netherlands, tvarohovník in Slovak, tvarožník in Czech, sernik in Poland, and syrnik in Ukraine) and cheese pancakes (syrniki in Russia and Ukraine). In these cakes, the quark is typically mixed with eggs, milk or cream, and sugar, and baked or fried.[ref]
