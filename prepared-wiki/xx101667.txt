The Mayor of Christchurch is the head of the municipal government of Christchurch, New Zealand, and presides over the Christchurch City Council.  The mayor is directly elected using a First Past the Post electoral system. The current mayor, Lianne Dalziel, was first elected in the October 2013 mayoral election.

==History==

===Chairmen of the Town Council===

Christchurch became a city by Royal charter on 31 July 1856; the first in New Zealand. Since 1862, chairmen were in charge of local government. Five chairmen presided in the initial years:[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/howthecouncilworks/ourhistory/chairmenmayors.aspx |title=Chairmen and mayors |publisher=Christchurch City Council |accessdate=10 February 2010 |location=Christchurch[/tpl]

===Mayors of the City Council===

The town council held a meeting on 10 June 1868 to elect its first mayor. In those days, councillors were elected for three-year terms, and once a year elected one of their group as mayor, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Canterbury Provincial District)|publisher=Cyclopedia Company Limited|location=Christchurch|year=1903|chapter=Ex Mayors|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc03Cycl-t1-body1-d3-d9.html|accessdate=16 March 2010[/tpl]
The following councillors attended the 10 June meeting: William Wilson, James Purvis Jameson, T. Tombs, George Ruddenklau, Henry Thomson, W. A. Sheppard, William Calvert[tpl]cite news |title=Christchurch City Council |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP18690904.2.2.6 |accessdate=29 October 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=4 September 1869 |volume=XV |issue=1993 |page=1[/tpl] and John Anderson, who chaired the meeting. Thomson moved that Wilson be elected as the first mayor of Christchurch, and Tombs seconded the motion. The chairman put the motion to the meeting and it was carried unanimously. With the meeting, the council had brought itself under the Municipal Corporations Act 1867.[tpl]cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18680610.2.9.1 |title=Christchurch |date=10 June 1868 |issue=24 |work=The Star |page=2 |accessdate=22 March 2010[/tpl]
Hence, the last chairman (William Wilson) became the first mayor in 1868. The first chairman (John Hall) became mayor 44 years later in 1906. There have been 45 holders of the position. The longest-serving was Sir Hamish Hay, who held the post for 15 years (5 terms). The shortest mayoralty was by Tommy Taylor in 1911, who died three months after being elected.[tpl]DNZB|Grigg|A. R.|2t16|Taylor, Thomas Edward|28 October 2013[/tpl] Wilson's term, at just over six months, was the second shortest. Vicki Buck and the current mayor, Lianne Dalziel, have been the only female mayors so far.
Initially, councillors elected one of their own as mayor towards the end of the year, and the role was usually awarded to the most senior councillor. Most elections were unanimous, and the newly elected mayor was instantly regarded as the head of the council. The system changed with the introduction of The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875, as that legislation stipulated that mayors had to be elected at large (i.e. by eligible voters).[tpl]cite web |title=Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act 1875 |url= http://www.enzs.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=2168 |publisher=University of Auckland |accessdate=20 April 2013 |date=21 October 1875[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Election Notices |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP18751203.2.2.4 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=3 December 1875 |volume=XXIV |issue=3201 |page=1[/tpl] Fred Hobbs, the incumbent, was the only candidate nominated, so he was declared elected unopposed on 17 December 1875.[tpl]cite news |title=Christchurch |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP18751218.2.13.1 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=18 December 1875 |volume=XXIV |issue=3214 |page=3[/tpl] James Gapes was the first mayor elected at large on 20 December 1876.[tpl]cite news |title=To the Electors of the City of Christchurch |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18761208.2.12.1 |accessdate=13 April 2013| newspaper=The Star| date=8 December 1876 |issue=2713 |page=2[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=Christchurch City Council |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP18761212.2.18.1 |accessdate=13 April 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=12 December 1876 |volume=XXVI |issue=3516 |page=4[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=Christchurch |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18761221.2.11.1 |accessdate=13 April 2013| newspaper=The Star| date=21 December 1876 |issue=2724 |page=2[/tpl] The newly elected person was from that point the mayor-elect, until he was sworn in; Gapes was sworn in on 2 January 1877.[tpl]cite news |title=City Council |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP18770103.2.14 |accessdate=13 April 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=3 January 1877 |volume=XXVII |issue=3584 |page=3[/tpl] Despite this, Taylor's death in 1911 resulted in councillors electing their fellow councillor John Joseph Dougall as mayor as required by the legislation for such cases.[tpl]cite news |title=City Council |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=CHP19110801.2.65 |accessdate=28 October 2013 |newspaper=The Press |date=1 August 1911 |volume=LXVII |issue=14110 |page=9[/tpl]
