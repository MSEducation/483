This species is distributed in Burma, Thailand, Vietnam and Peninsular Sumatra, Java and Bali.Lekagul and McNeely 1977[tpl]Full|date=April 2013[/tpl]Medway 1978[tpl]Full|date=April 2013[/tpl] This species is commonly found in hilly areas in Malaysia.Lim 1966[tpl]Full|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Biology and ecology==

Five adult males and five adult females were recorded. On 25 March 1997, a full-term foetus was aborted by a pregnant female  taken from Wang Pinang.  Males with enlarged testes suggested they were in a sexually active state at Taleban in March 1997, Kuala Gandah in July 1997, and Doi Suthep in May 1997.  M. sobrinus specimens that were netted were all associated with banana plants in most sites, and with flowering trees in Doi Suthep.
M. sobrinus can be isolated from M. minimus by external morphological measurements. Comparatively, M. sobranus is smaller than M. minimus in the forearm length (43.35 to 46.95 mm vs 40 to 43 mm) and head length (30.05 to 30.54 mm vs 26 to 28 mm) and heavier body weight (17 to 23 g vs 13 to 19 g).Medway 1978[tpl]Full|date=April 2013[/tpl] However, the  tail length (0-2 mm versus 0-5 mm) and hind foot (8 - 9 mm versus 15-18 mm) disagreed to that of Lekagul and McNeely (1977).[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl]
