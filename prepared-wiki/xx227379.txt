Verticordia'' sect. ''Verticordella is a section of Verticordia that describes a group of eighteen shrub species.  This description was first made in 1857 by Carl Meissner in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, but he did not indicate the reason for his choice of the name.Meissner, C.F. (1857) Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany 1: 44 (APNI) It was later included in Hooker's Journal of Botany without a description.Hooker's J. Bot. & Kew Gard. Misc. 8 (1856) 19 Verticordella is presumed to be diminutive form of Verticordia.[tpl]cite book |author1=Elizabeth A.

The section was later expanded and included within the subgenera, as Verticordia subg. Eperephes, in Alex George's 1991 arrangement of the genus. The type species for this section is  Schauer's Verticordia drumondii''. 
The species described as within this section usually have a single stem, but some have a lignotuber that will produce several stems after regrowth. The flowers are scented, slightly to very sweet smelling, a hypanthium with down-ward curving appendages, bracteoles which are shed, and sepals with fringed lobes. The flowers have petals with a fringed or toothed margin and a curved style that is hairy at the apex. The leaf margins are similar to the petals, and partly cylindrical or concave in profile.
George's arrangement came to include the following species:George, A.S. (1991) New taxa, combinations and typifications in Verticordia (Myrtaceae: Chamelaucieae). Nuytsia 7(3): 281
