The National Association of Sessional GPs NASGP (formerly the National Association of Non-Principals) is a group representing doctors in the United Kingdom.

==History and activities==

The organisation was founded 1997 by a group of Sessional GPs (independent general practitioners) with the aim of representing all fully qualified GPs working as locums, assistants, salaried GPs, and retainers.
The organisation has a chief executive officer, a business manager, and a council of seven members elected through national ballot.
The organisation publishes The Sessional GP, a bimonthly newsletter on topics relating to sessional GPs. It also acts as an umbrella organisation for approximately 65 local sessional GP groups.

==Aims and objectives==

The group represents sessional GPs at a national level, provides support for members and for local sessional GP groups. The group is involved in lobbying other medical organisations to ensure equitable representation of sessional GPs.
