William Esco (W. E.) Moerner (born June 24, 1953) is an American physical chemist and chemical physicist with current work in the biophysics and imaging of single molecules. He is credited with achieving the firstCohen, Adam E.; Fields, Alexander P.; Hou, Jennifer H.; Leslie, Sabrina R.; Shon, Min Ju (2009). "In honor of W.E.

DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-02597-6  Professor Moerner is currently the Harry S. Mosher Professor at Stanford University in the Chemistry Department, with a courtesy appointment in Applied Physics.  Areas of research and interest include: single-molecule spectroscopy and super-resolution imaging, physical chemistry, chemical physics, biophysics, nanoparticle trapping, nanophotonics, photorefractive polymers, and spectral hole-burning.  For more details, see the Moerner Laboratory homepage, or his current CV.  As of May 2014, W. E. was listed as a faculty advisor in 26 theses written by Stanford graduate students. 

==Education==

He attended Washington University in St. Louis for undergraduate studies as an Alexander S. Langsdorf Engineering Fellow, and received three degrees: a B.S. in Physics with Top Honors, a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with Top Honors, and an A.B. in Mathematics summa cum laude in 1975. This was followed by graduate study, partially supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, at Cornell University in the group of Albert J. Sievers III and he received a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1978 and 1982, respectively. His Ph.D. thesis was on vibrational relaxation dynamics of an IR-laser-excited molecular impurity mode in alkali halide lattices.Moerner, W. E. 1982.

==Personal==

W. E. Moerner was born on June 24, 1953 at Parks Air Force Base in Pleasanton, California.  He grew up in San Antonio, Texas where he attended Thomas Jefferson High School.  From birth, his family called him by his initials W. E. as a way to distinguish him from his father and grandfather who are also named William.
