Ambitious post-war development projects like the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] (1949–1972) required a large labour force that could only be sourced by diversifying Australia's migrant intake.

===Relaxation of restrictions===

Australian policy began to shift towards significantly increasing immigration. Legislative changes over the next few decades continuously opened up immigration in Australia.

===End of the White Australia Policy===

In 1966, the Holt Liberal Government  introduced the Migration Act, 1966, a watershed moment in immigration reform, it effectively dismantled the White Australia Policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the Vietnam War.In office - Harold Holt - Australia's PMs - Australia's Prime Ministers After a review of the European policy in March 1966, Immigration Minister Hubert Opperman announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia. At the same time, Harold Holt's government decided a number of "temporary resident" non-Europeans, who were not required to leave Australia, could become permanent residents and citizens after five years (the same as for Europeans).
As a result, annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054.
The legal end of the White Australia policy is usually placed in the year 1973, when the Whitlam Labor government implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law. These amendments:
The 1975 Racial Discrimination Act made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal.
It was not until the Fraser Liberal government's review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy. Currently, a large number of Australia's immigrants are from countries such as China and India, though the United Kingdom and New Zealand remain the two largest single sources of immigrants.
In 1981 the Minister for Immigration announced a Special Humanitarian Assistance Program (SHP) for Iranians to seek refuge in Australia and by 1988 some 2500 Bahá'ís and many more others had arrived in Australia through either SHP or Refugee Programs. The last selective immigration policy, offering relocation assistance to British nationals, was finally removed in 1982.[ref]

===Aftermath===

Australia's contemporary immigration program has two components: a program for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian program for refugees and asylum seekers.Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 60 - Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Program By 2010, the post-war immigration program had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21 million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries.Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

==Legacy==

In addition to the obvious demographic effect of creating a population of European, and largely Anglo-Celtic, descent, by effectively limiting the immigration of practitioners of non-Christian faiths, the White Australia policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians.[tpl]cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/australia |title=Australia |work= |publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs |accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl] See drop-down essay on "Independence and Aboriginal Policy" While non-European and non-Christian immigration has increased substantially since the dismantling of the White Australia policy, Australian society inevitably remains rooted in the demographic legacy of the 72 years of White Australia, during which time the country underwent its most substantial population growth.

===Contemporary demographics===

The 2001 Australian census results indicate that many Australians claim some European heritage: English 37%,  Irish 11%, Italian 5%, German 4.3%, Scottish 3%, Greek 2%, Former Yugoslav 1.8%, Dutch 1.5%, Polish 0.9%. Australians of some non-European origin form a significant but still relatively small part of the population: Chinese 3.2%,  Indian 0.9%, Lebanese 0.9%, Vietnamese 0.9%. About 2.2% identified themselves as Indigenous Australians. 39% of the population gave their ancestry as "Australian".  The Australian census does not classify people according to race, only ethnic ancestry. (Note that subjects were permitted to select more than one answer for this census question.)
15% of the population now speaks a language other than English at home. The most commonly spoken languages are Italian, Greek, Cantonese Chinese and Arabic.

===Political and social legacy===

The story of Australia since the Second World War - and particularly since the final relegation of the white Australia Policy -  has been one of ever-increasing ethnic and cultural diversity. Successive governments have sustained a large programmes of multiethnic immigration from all continents.
Discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity was legally sanctioned until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: "to build on our success as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future". The White Australia Policy continues to be mentioned in modern contexts, although it is generally only mentioned by politicians when denouncing their opposition. As Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988, as part of his One Australia policy, later admitting that his comments cost him his job at the time:

Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The Howard Government (1996–2007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005–06, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). in 2005–06, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996–97). This figure included around 17000 through the humanitarian programme - of whom Iraqis and Sudanese accounted for the largest portions.4102.0 - Australian Social Trends, 2007 China became Australia's biggest source of migrants, for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/china-top-source-of-immigration-20091207-kfcp.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Peter | last=Martin | title=China top source of immigration | date=8 December 2009[/tpl]
Despite the overall success and generally bipartisan support for Australia's multi-ethnic immigration programme, there remain voices of opposition to immigration within the Australian electorate. At its peak, Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party received 9% of the national vote at the 1998 Federal Election.
Hanson was widely accused of trying to take Australia back to the days of the White Australia Policy, particularly through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 Election, Hanson said:

Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 Election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 Federal Elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales State Elections.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hanson-fails-to-win-seat-in-nsw-20110412-1dbuy.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Hanson fails to win seat in NSW | date=12 April 2011[/tpl] In May 2007, Pauline Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Hanson-launches-campaign-song/2007/10/05/1191091356094.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Hanson launches campaign song | date=5 October 2007[/tpl]
Topics related to racism and immigration in Australia are still regularly connected by the media to the White Australia Policy. Some examples of issues and events where this connection has been made include:
reconciliation with Aborigines; mandatory detention and the "Pacific Solution"; the 2005 Cronulla riots, and the 2009 attacks on Indians in Australia. Former opposition Labor party leader Mark Latham, in his book The Latham Diaries, described the ANZUS alliance as a legacy of the White Australia policy.
In 2007, the Howard Government proposed an Australian Citizenship Test intended "to get that balance between diversity and integration correct in future, particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures". The draft proposal contained a pamphlet introducing Australian history, Culture and Democracy. Migrants were to be required to correctly answer at least 12 out of 20 questions on such topics in a citizenship quiz. Migrants would also be required to demonstrate an adequate level of understanding of the English language.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/citizenship-test-unveiled/2007/08/26/1188066926388.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Citizenship test unveiled | date=26 August 2007[/tpl] The Rudd Government reviewed and then implemented the proposal in 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/citizen-quiz-tests-facts-not-figures/story-e6frg6nf-1225776323109 | first=Nicola | last=Berkovic | title=Citizen quiz tests facts, not figures | date=18 September 2009 | work=The Australian[/tpl]
