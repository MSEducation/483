==Critical response==

The album was received with mixed reviews. It currently holds a 62% on Metacritic with reviews such as the Boston Globe awarding the album a 9/10 and saying "This easily ranks among the top rock records of the year". Other publications, while giving it a positive review, said it was a slight slump compared to their self-titled debut, although noting the slump was not as great as those from the Kaiser Chiefs, Bloc Party and Editors. Pitchfork Media wrote a scathing review, giving the album a low 1.8, and ending their angry review with the question "Have you no sense of decency, Bravery?".Adam Moerder, http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10263-the-sun-and-the-moon/", Pitchfork Media.com, May 31, 2007.
