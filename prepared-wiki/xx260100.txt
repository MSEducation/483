==1986 General Secretary Election Controversy==

In 1986, Macreadie stood for the post of General Secretary of the CPSA. In the elections, Macreadie initially won the ballot. However, the election was blocked and the courts ordered it to be re-run, with John Ellis receiving 42,000 votes, Macreadie receiving 31,000, and the Broad Left 84, backed by the Communist Party gaining 13,000.[tpl]cite book |last=Taaffe |first=Peter |date=November 30, 1995 |title=Rise of "Militant": Thirty Years of "Militant" | publisher=Militant Publications|pages=292–3 |isbn=978-0-906582-47-3[/tpl]
Macreadie was later elected as Deputy General Secretary of the union in 1987 and was named as one of a 'dirty half-dozen' by Ellis in an expose of the Militant-led left in the union.Article from The Sun referenced in: [tpl]cite web |last=Black |first=C. |title=Autumn 87: How Lefties Make My Union Job A Nightmare |date=15 September 1987 |url=http://www.pflcpsa.com/aut_87.htm |accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] Macreadie also served on the General Council of the TUC from 1987 to 1988.General Council report 2011 http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/GCreport2011.pdf - retrieved 24/2/2012
