The Košice public transit system operates in Košice, Slovakia. Services are managed by the Dopravný podnik mesta Košice (DPMK), or Košice Transit Company.

==History==

Košice transit company was founded in 1891 by Stefan Popper, who built the first track for a horsedrawn tramway.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] The company had the Magyar name "Kassai villamos vasút", in Slovak "Košicke pouličné drahy", or in English "Košice street roads". In 1914, all tracks were electrified, and the transit company was renamed to "Kassai villamos közúti vasút" (Slovak '"Košicke elektrické pouličné drahy" and English "Košice electric roads").
This system was destroyed in World War I and again in World War II. In 1945, at the end of hostilities, the system was again rebuilt and the company name "Dopravné podniky mesta Košice" was adopted. In 1999 was name changed again to Dopravný podnik mesta Košice.

Travellers must have a valid travel ticket. As of 2010, tickets cost 0,25 € for students and children less than 15 years, and 0,55 € for people 15 years and older. Passengers older than 70 years, handicapped people, and members of parliament travel free. Tickets are single-use and are time-limited to a particular day, week or month, though students have concessions to this requirement. Contactless smart cards issued by most slovak public transport companies are accepted. Passengers using them can obtain tickets at lowered prices upon boarding in card validators. Cards are also only way of obtaining season tickets, like for one, three and six months. Cards, which are not time-limited, are available to employees. Tickets can also be bought using SMS for 0,80 €.http://www.dpmk.sk/content/view/178/145/
