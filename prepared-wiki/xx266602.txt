==Design and development==

The Piuma was designed to be an inexpensive, easy-to-fly and easy-to-build ultralight motor glider. The first model was initially just called the Piuma, but as other models were developed it became known as the Piuma Original.

The Piuma is constructed from wood and then finished with doped aircraft fabric covering. The semi-tapered [tpl]convert|11.89|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] span wing is supported by a single lift strut on each side and has air brakes. The engine is mounted behind the cockpit. The specified engine is the KFM 107er of [tpl]convert|22|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl], but engines of [tpl]convert|15|to|22|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] can be fitted. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration and made from steel with rubber shock-absorbers, with an auxiliary tailwheel and fits wheel pants to reduce drag. The tail is a cruciform tail. Performance includes a glide ratio of 17:1 at [tpl]convert|64|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The cabin width is [tpl]convert|58|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl]
The designer estimated that it would take a builder 1000 hours to complete the aircraft from the plans. The plans cost US$220 in 1998 and included a 30 page construction manual.
