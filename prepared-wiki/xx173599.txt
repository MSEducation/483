"The Death Ramps" is an alias for British indie rock band Arctic Monkeys. They usually go under this name in collaboration with Miles Kane and fellow Sheffield artist Richard Hawley, and have released five tracks, all B-Sides to Arctic Monkeys singles.
Domino, their label, said the following about The Death Ramps:

In an interview with 'AnotherMag' in 2013, frontman Alex Turner stated:
[tpl]cquote|"We used to ride our BMXs on these little hills in the woods where we grew up in Sheffield. As six-year-olds they looked like death ramps to us – I always thought that’d be a cool name for a band. When we started using guest singers like Richard Hawley and Miles Kane on the B-side of our seven-inches we called ourselves the Death Ramps and my mate Reino Lehtonen-Riley, who owns The Great Frog, knocked up some rings. We’ve all got one."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anothermag.com/exclusives/alexturner|title=Alex Turner [tpl]![/tpl] AnOther|publisher=anothermag.com|accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
