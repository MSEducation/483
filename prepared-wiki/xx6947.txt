The Post Office Railway, also known as Mail Rail, was a [tpl]RailGauge|2ft|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge, driverless underground railway in London, built by the Post Office with assistance from the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, to move mail between sorting offices. Inspired by the Chicago Tunnel Company,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mailrail.co.uk/ |title=Speeding London's Mail |publisher=MailRail.co.uk |accessdate=19 August 2009 |last=Karslake |first=Colin [/tpl] it operated from 3 December 1927Subterranean city: beneath the streets of London.

==Geography==

It ran east–west from Paddington Head District Sorting Office in the west to the Eastern Head District Sorting Office at Whitechapel in the east, a distance of [tpl]convert|6.5|mi|km[/tpl]. It had eight stations, the largest of which was underneath Mount Pleasant, but by 2003 only three stations remained in use because the sorting offices above the other stations had been relocated.

==History==

In 1911 a plan evolved to build an underground railway [tpl]convert|6+1/2|mi|km[/tpl] longRomance of London's Underground, Ayer Publishing from Paddington to Whitechapel serving the main sorting offices along the route; road traffic congestion was causing unacceptable delays. The contract to build the tunnels was won by John Mowlem and Co.Time capsules Construction of the tunnels started in February 1915 from a series of shafts. Most of the line was constructed using the Greathead shield system, with limited amounts of hand-mining for connecting tunnels at stations.
The main line has a single [tpl]convert|9|ft|adj=on[/tpl] diameter tube with two tracks. Just before stations, tunnels diverge into two single-track [tpl]convert|7|ft|adj=on[/tpl] diameter tunnels leading to two parallel [tpl]convert|25|ft|adj=on[/tpl] diameter station tunnels. The main tube is at a depth of around [tpl]convert|70|ft[/tpl].[tpl]citation| title= Popular Mechanics| date =  March 1952| page =164|volume= 97| number= 3| issn = 0032-4558|url = http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Popular_Mechanics.html?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ| chapter = London's Post Office Railway| chapterurl  = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA164[/tpl] Stations are at a much shallower depth, with a 1-in-20 gradient into the stations. The gradients assist in slowing the trains when approaching stations, and accelerating them away. There is also less distance to lift mail from the stations to the surface. At Oxford Circus the tunnel runs close to the Bakerloo line tunnel of the London Underground.
During 1917 work was suspended due to the shortage of labour and materials. By June 1924 track laying had started. In February 1927 the first section, between Paddington and the West Central District Office, was made available for training. The line became available for the Christmas parcel post in 1927 and letters were carried from February 1928.
In 1954 plans were developed for a new Western District Office at Rathbone Place, which required a diversion, opening in 1958.[tpl]cite doi|10.1680/iicep.1960.11893[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1680/iicep.1960.11897[/tpl]  It was not until 3 August 1965 that the new station and office were opened by the Postmaster General, Anthony Wedgwood-Benn. The disused section was used as a store tunnel; some parts of it still have the track in place.

==Closure==

A Royal Mail press release in April 2003 said that the railway would be closed and mothballed at the end of May that year. Royal Mail had earlier stated that using the railway was five times more expensive than using road transport for the same task. The Communication Workers Union claimed the actual figure was closer to three times more expensive but argued that this was the result of a deliberate policy of running the railway down and using it at only one-third of its capacity. Despite a report by the Greater London Authority in support of continued use, the railway was closed in the early hours of 31 May 2003.
In April 2011 an urban exploration group called the "Consolidation Crew" published accounts of illicit access to the tunnels. Detailed photography and text revealed that the railway is still largely in good condition, despite some natural decay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.placehacking.co.uk/2011/04/24/security-breach-london-mail-rail/ |title=Security-Breach: London Mail Rail|publisher=www.placehacking.co.uk |accessdate=26 April 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.silentuk.com/ |title=The Post Office Railway (Mail Rail)|publisher=www.silentuk.com |accessdate=20 April 2011 [/tpl]

A pneumatic underground railway was used by the Post Office in London between 1863 and 1874 using individual wheeled capsules, operated by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company.
In 1910 a [tpl]convert|450|m|adj=on[/tpl] tunnel railway opened in Munich, Germany between München Hauptbahnhof and the nearby Post office.
