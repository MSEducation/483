Known to us mainly from the 28th and 29th Discourses of Dio Chrysostom,Melankomas is also mentioned in Themistius, Orationes 10 (=165 Dinsdorf) and alluded to by Eustathius. Michael B. Poliakoff, "Melankomas, ἐκ κλίμακο, and Greek Boxing", The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 108, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 511. in which that writer uses his life as a canvas for a discussion of the ideal athlete and the ideal man, Dio praises his athleticism, good looks, and brave heart. With regard to his boxing, claims for him a unique style: he would totally avoid the punches of the other boxer without throwing any himself. Dio says he never lost a match nor was struck by an opponent. Themistius reports that the emperor Titus was his lover ([tpl]lang|el|erastes[/tpl]).
Some scholars believe Melankomas to have been a real person, others that he was an invention of Dio's; there is nothing allowing a firm conclusion either way.
Melankomas was mentioned in a second-season episode of Sports Night as a contender for "Athlete of the Millennium."
