Weymouth [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|eɪ|m|ə|θ[/tpl] is a seaside town in Dorset, England, situated on a sheltered bay at the mouth of the River Wey on the English Channel coast. The town is [tpl]Convert|13|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Dorchester and [tpl]Convert|8|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of the Isle of Portland. The town's population is 52,323 (2011). The town is the largest settlement in Dorset following the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole [tpl]cite web | year = 2013 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/344863| title = Weymouth—Dorset For You | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 22 October 2013[/tpl]
Weymouth is a tourist resort, and its economy depends on its harbour and visitor attractions; the town is a gateway situated halfway along the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. Weymouth Harbour is home to cross-channel ferries, pleasure boats and private yachts, and nearby Portland Harbour is home to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, where the sailing events of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games were held.
The A354 road bridge connects Weymouth to Portland, which together form the borough of Weymouth and Portland. The history of the borough stretches back to the 12th century; including involvement in the spread of the Black Death, the settlement of the Americas, the development of Georgian architecture, and preparations for World War II.

==History==

Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole.
Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main town centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area.
King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.ma.us/history/index.asp?id=1104 | title = Weymouth History | publisher = Weymouth Town Council | accessdate = 3 July 2007[/tpl] More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking, Salem became infamous for its witch trials.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=502 | title = John Endicott and Captain Richard Clark | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 3 July 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006142716/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D502 |archivedate = 6 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.
The architect Sir Christopher Wren was the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702, and controlled nearby Portland's quarries from 1675 to 1717. When he designed St Paul's Cathedral, Wren had it built out of Portland Stone, the famous stone of Portland's quarries.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=555 | title = Sir Christopher Wren | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 12 November 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006141300/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D555 |archivedate = 6 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Sir James Thornhill was born in the White Hart public house in Melcombe Regis and became the town's MP in 1722.

In the centre of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; although it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century this has been overcome with successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=486 | title = Melcombe Regis historic buildings | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 3 July 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006141030/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D486 |archivedate = 6 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth for the first time on 26 January 1869.

==Governance==

The district of Weymouth and Portland was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and the nearby Portland urban district.

==Geography==

Weymouth is situated on the western shore of Weymouth Bay on the south coast of England, [tpl]Convert|195|km|mi|-1[/tpl] west-southwest of London, at [tpl]Coord|50|37|N|2|27|W|type:city[/tpl] (50.613, −2.457). The town is built on weak sand and clay rock which in most places along the Dorset coast, except for narrow bands at Lulworth Cove, Swanage and Durdle Door, has been eroded and transported away.[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/Field-Guides-Introduction.htm | title =  Geology of the Central South Coast of England | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 14 August 2007[/tpl] This weak rock has been protected at Weymouth by Chesil Beach and the strong limestone Isle of Portland that lies offshore, [tpl]Convert|3|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Wyke Regis. The island affects the tides of the area, producing a double low tide in Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/location_reports/s_coast/portland.htm | title =  Portland Harbour | publisher = Bristol Nomads Windsurfing Club | accessdate = 30 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast/tides/tides.shtml?date=20070730&loc=0033 | title =  Tides: Portland | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 30 July 2007[/tpl] The maximum tidal range is small, less than [tpl]Convert|2|m|ft|0[/tpl].
There are two lakes in the borough, both RSPB Nature Reserves—Radipole Lake in the town centre, and Lodmoor between the town centre and Preston. Radipole Lake, the largest nature reserve, and mouth of the River Wey before it flows into Weymouth Harbour, is an important habitat for fish and migratory birds, and over 200 species of plants. Radipole is an important tourist attraction; it and Weymouth Beach are situated very close to the main town centre.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=547 | title = Radipole Lake Visitors' Centre | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 3 July 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513110131/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D547 |archivedate = 13 May 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] There are 11 Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the borough, which cover an area of [tpl]Convert|800.87|ha|acre|0[/tpl], and there are 37 other Nature Conservation Designations.[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=332782 | title = Nature Conservation Designations – SSSIs | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 25 July 2007|quote=800.87 ha sssi for Weymouth & Portland DC[/tpl]

Weymouth is the largest town in the area, larger than the county town of Dorchester, which lies just to the north, and hence is a centre of activity for the nearby population. A steep ridge of chalk called the South Dorset Downs separates Dorchester and Weymouth; they are less agricultural than the valleys in the centre and north of Dorset, but have dairy and arable farms. The nearest villages to Weymouth are part of the built-up area, including Wyke Regis, Chickerell and Preston.
The sand and clay on which Weymouth is built is very low-lying—large areas are below sea level, which allowed the eastern areas of the town to flood during extreme low pressure storms.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=63 | title = Park District, Weymouth, Flood | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 17 June 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024070652/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp%3Fsvid%3D63 |archivedate = 24 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In the 1980s and 1990s a sea wall was built around Weymouth Harbour and along the coast road in Preston; a rip rap groyne in Greenhill and beach nourishment up to Preston have created a wide and artificially graded pebble beach, to ensure that the low-lying land around Lodmoor does not flood.[tpl]cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.scopac.org.uk/scopac%20sediment%20db/wey/wey.htm | title = Isle of Portland and Weymouth Bay | publisher = SCOPAC | accessdate = 4 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The defences at Preston, the extended ferry terminal and the widening of the Esplanade have changed the sediment regime in Weymouth Bay, narrowing the beach at Greenhill and widening the sands in Weymouth. A study conducted as part of the redevelopment of the Pavilion complex showed that the proposed marina will contribute slightly to this effect, but sand dredged out of the marina could be used to make the beach up to [tpl]Convert|40|m|ft|-1[/tpl] wider.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1587036.0.report_boosts_pavilion_site_marina_plan.php | title = Report boosts Pavilion site marina plan | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 4 August 2007[/tpl]

The mid-year population of Weymouth in 2011 was 52,323,[tpl]Ref label|estimate|A|A[/tpl] in a built-up area of [tpl]Convert|18.5|km2|acre[/tpl], giving an approximate population density of 2,800 residents per square kilometre (11 per acre), in 25,174 dwellings. The population has grown steadily since the 1970s, mainly as a result of migration. There is an above average number of residents aged 60–84 (26.9%), however this is less than the Dorset average of 30.0%, and the largest proportion of the population (29.2%) is between the ages of 18 to 44, above the Dorset average of 25.4%. The population is largely native to England—94.9% of residents are White British, slightly below the Dorset average of 95.5%, and well above the England and Wales average of 80.5%. The most common religious identity in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at 61.0%, which is slightly above the England and Wales average of 59.3%. The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at 29.3%, slightly above the average of 25.1%.
House prices in Weymouth and Portland are relatively high by UK standards, yet around average for the south of England—the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056.[tpl]Ref label|julysep|G|G[/tpl] The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is lower than that of England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), but above that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are low, particularly in summer, at 2.5% of the economically active population in July 2011, compared to the UK average of 7.7%.[tpl]cite web | year = 2011 | url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=12  | title = All releases of Labour Market Statistics | publisher = Office for National Statistics | accessdate = 14 December 2012[/tpl]

==Economy==

Tourism has been the largest industry in Weymouth for decades, though the number of people employed in the sector has declined slightly since its peak in the late 1990s.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=332866 | title = Volume and value of tourism in Dorset, 1990–2003 | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 12 November 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060827194556/http%3A//www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp%3Farticleid%3D332866 |archivedate = 27 August 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Weymouth's coast and beaches, lakes, museums, aquarium, and two shopping centres are the main attractions for visitors.

As part of the regeneration of Weymouth and Portland, it was decided in 2007 that Weymouth's esplanade will be redeveloped in time for the 2012 Olympic Games. Planned improvements include a public square around the restored statue of King George III, the restoration and extension the Art Deco pier bandstand, a Tourist information centre and café, Victorian-style shelters and seasonal kiosks, a beach rescue centre, and a sand art pavilion for the sculptures of Mark Anderson.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/docstore/planning/planningpolicy/THI/consultation/POL_20070716_Board1.pdf | title = Weymouth Esplanade: a visionary masterplan | format = PDF | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 20 July 2007[/tpl] Other alterations to the promenade were made, particularly around key areas such as the Jubilee Clock and the pier bandstand, with the introduction of new cafes and bars that connect the promenade and beach using innovative design, shaped like an upturned boat, also including a lighting scheme and seating areas with planting, fountains and trees.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/display.var.1559989.0.new_vision_for_our_seafront.php | title = New vision for our seafront | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 20 July 2007[/tpl]
Weymouth Harbour is long and narrow, and formed the estuary of the River Wey until the building of a bridge to Westham, which separated the harbour's backwaters from Radipole Lake. For centuries the harbour was a passenger terminal and trade and cargo port: goods handled included wool and spices, and in the 20th century Weymouth was a bulk importer of fertiliser and cars. The old harbourside, on both sides of the seaward end of the harbour, still hosts a large fishing fleet, with docks, unloading areas, and a cross-channel ferry terminal. Fishing and cargo trading employ fewer people in the area since their peak in earlier centuries, but local fishermen catch the largest mass of fish in England and the third largest in the United Kingdom. The inner harbour has been refurbished in two phases, in 1994–1996 and in 2002, to include a new marina with hundreds of berths for pleasure boats, cruisers and sailing boats. Local boats offer fishing and diving trips, pleasure cruises along the Jurassic Coast, and thrill-rides to the Isle of Portland.[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jurassiccoast.com/329/visiting-the-coast-31/getting-to-and-around-the-jurassic-coast-148/boat-trips-466.html | title = Jurassic Coast – Boat Trips | publisher = Jurassic Coast | accessdate = 9 July 2007[/tpl]
The main shopping centre in the area is in Melcombe Regis, consisting of two pedestrianised streets (St. Thomas's and St. Mary's Street), shops along the esplanade, and a new precinct stretching from St. Thomas's Street to the harbourside, built in the 1990s. There are shops and restaurants in the pedestrianised Hope Square and Brewers Quay, which are linked to the town centre by town bridge and a small passenger ferry service across the harbour. In 2005 the town centre had 292 shops and [tpl]Convert|37500|m2|sqft|-3[/tpl] of floorspace, and there was [tpl]Convert|0.4|km2|acre|-1[/tpl] of industrial estate in the area. The shopping catchment area, which extends for approximately 3 miles towards the north and seven miles east and west, has a population of 71,700 (mid-2001). Weymouth, Portland and Chickerell have been a Fairtrade Zone since 2007.[tpl]cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/living/community/pages/fairtrade/home.asp?svid=982 | title = Weymouth & Portland: a Fairtrade Zone | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 7 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071029080021/http%3A//www.weymouth.gov.uk/living/community/pages/fairtrade/home.asp%3Fsvid%3D982 |archivedate = 29 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Fashion company New Look has its global headquarters in Weymouth, and until 2005 the company's regional distribution centre was based at the same site.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ukbusisspark.co.uk/newlooka.htm | title = New Look | publisher = UK Business Park | accessdate = 9 July 2007[/tpl] Plans were approved in 2007 to develop the New Look site to include new headquarters, retail warehouses and industrial units, a hotel, fire station, and a medical centre with ambulance station.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1637503.0.thumbs_up_at_new_look_site.php | title = Thumbs up at New Look site | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 25 August 2007[/tpl]

==Transport==

Weymouth railway station is the terminus of a route from London Waterloo and of a route from Westbury and Bristol. There used to be a large station to handle heavy summer tourist traffic, but this traffic declined and the station was demolished in 1986. A smaller station took up part of the site, and the rest was given over to commercial development. Part of the South West Main Line west of Moreton Station to east of Dorchester South Station have been reduced from dual to single track. However, local councils have lobbied the Department for Transport, in connection with the sailing events in 2012 Olympic Games, to relay the double track and increase services to London and Bristol, and to introduce new direct services to Exeter.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=352684 | title = London 2012 Olympic Games Sailing Events | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 22 August 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060823114618/http%3A//www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp%3Farticleid%3D352684 |archivedate = 23 August 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Services to London Waterloo began running every 30 minutes from December 2007, but services through Bristol to Cardiff were reduced.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1881383.0.rail_timetable_offers_london_at_the_double.php | title = Rail timetable offers London at the double | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 5 December 2007[/tpl]
An unusual feature of the railways in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though the streets and along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at the eastern end of the harbour, to connect with ferries to mainland Europe. Due to declining business, goods traffic ceased in 1972, but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.johnrnew.demon.co.uk/quaybrch.htm | title =  Weymouth Harbour Tramway | publisher = Island Publishing | accessdate = 12 August 2007[/tpl]
Local bus services are run by First Hampshire & Dorset, which bought the local Southern National company.

The A354 road connects the town to the A35 trunk road in Dorchester, and terminates at Easton on the Isle of Portland. The A353 road runs east from Weymouth to the south of Warmwell, where it connects with the A352 to the Isle of Purbeck and Wareham. The B3157 road runs west from Weymouth to the south of Bridport where it terminates and connects to the A35. In the 1980s the town centre was bypassed by the A354 to Portland, but the government's road building policy changed before a proposed relief road could be completed. Before completion of the relief road, the A354 followed its original route through Upwey and Broadwey, where traffic problems were common at peak tourist times, particularly on event days such as the carnival.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=3463 | title = Weymouth Relief Road | publisher = Dorset County Council | accessdate = 22 June 2006[/tpl]
The relief road's construction was delayed by opposition from residents and environmental groups, including Transport 2000 and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, who objected to the route's partial destruction of a nature reserve, which is an AONB and SSSI.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/display.var.1531988.0.relief_road_protest_lodged.php | title = Relief Road Protest Lodged | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 10 July 2007[/tpl] With Weymouth and Portland scheduled to host 2012 Olympic sailing events the project reopened; the local authorities favouring a more environmentally friendly proposal than in the 1990s. On 5 April 2007, Dorset County Council granted planning permission for a modified proposal including a single carriageway running [tpl]Convert|7|km|mi|0[/tpl] north, and a 1000-space park-and-ride scheme, costing £84.5 million.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/haveyoursay/makingtheheadlines/display.var.1311799.0.0.php?act=complaint&cid=178246 | title = Green Light for Relief Road | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 23 April 2007[/tpl] Work commenced in 2008; and was completed by mid-2011, in time for the 2012 Olympic sailing events.

==Education==

The Chesil Education Partnership pyramid area operates in south Dorset, and includes five infant schools, four junior schools, twelve primary schools, four secondary schools and two special schools. 73.3% of Weymouth residents have qualifications, which is slightly below the Dorset average of 73.8%. 8.8% of residents have higher qualifications (Level 4 +), about half the Dorset average of 18.3%.
There are three secondary schools in Weymouth—All Saints' Church of England School in Wyke Regis; Budmouth College in Chickerell; and Wey Valley School and Sports College in Broadwey. Wey Valley was added to the Government's Failing Schools list in 2007 as only 27% of the students achieved 5 A* to C passes.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/3356423/Full-list-of-failing-schools.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Full list of failing schools | date=11 June 2008 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl] The fourth secondary school in the Chesil Education Partnership is Royal Manor Arts College on the Isle of Portland.

The Wessex Stadium is out of town, but until 1987 the team played at a ground near the town centre, which is now an Asda supermarket.
