The Schnütgen Museum (Museum Schnütgen in German) in Cologne (Köln), Germany is devoted to Christian religious art, mainly medieval, but some parts of the collection, such as its textiles and prints, extend from antiquity to the modern period.  In 1906, the collection of Alexander Schnütgen was donated to the city, and the collection has continued to expand, so that until the opening of a new building in 2010, only about 10% of its 13,000 items could be displayed. Now some 2,000 objects are on display in 1900 sq. metres of gallery space, with an additional 1300 sq. metres for special exhibitions.Museum website, English page, accessed May 10, 2005  Schnütgen (1843–1918) was a Catholic priest and theologian;Biography on German Wikipedia according to the museum website "Up to now people tell stories about his zealous and sometimes crafty collection tactics".Museums of Cologne Art of the Middle Ages Museum Schnütgen.

Since 1956, the museum has occupied the large Romanesque church of St. Cäcilien, founded in 881 for noble canonesses, with the present building dating from 1130–60, with murals from about 1300.  An annex built by architect Karl Band was added in the 1950s, and new buildings (part of the Kulturquartier, “Culture quarter“) opened in 2010. Highlights of the collection include a Romanesque tympanum from St Cecilia's itself, several large wooden crucifixes, including the 11th century Cross of St George's, as well as a large collection of early bronze ones, including the only other work generally attributed to Rainer of Huy apart from his Liège baptismal font.Lasko, 181  The museum has a late Carolingian evangeliary of 860–880, and a single leaf from the English St Albans Psalter.Museum highlights 2nd and 4th items - Handschriften und Einzelblätter.

Alexander Schnütgen had organised influential exhibitions of his collection while it was still private, and from the 1970s the museum (using extra exhibition spaces) organized a series of landmark exhibitions of medieval art:

Catalogues of the permanent collection of the museum are being published in several volumes.Museum website Bestandskatalog.
