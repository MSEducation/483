Gaston Taument (born 1 October 1970) is a retired Dutch footballer who played mainly as a right winger but could also operate as a second striker. 
He played the vast majority of his 14-year professional career with Feyenoord, amassing Eredivisie totals of 182 games and 41 goals over the course of nine seasons.
A Dutch international in the 1990s, Taument represented the Netherlands at 1994 FIFA World Cup and 1996 UEFA European Championship.

==Club career==

Born in Den Haag, South Holland, Taument was a product of Feyenoord Rotterdam's youth system. He played one first-team match in 1988–89 and another in the following season, before joining second division side SBV Excelsior on loan, also in the city. During seven full seasons at De Kuip, he formed an efficient winger partnership with Regi Blinker (from 1991–95, the pair combined for 61 Eredivisie goals).
In July 1997, after nearly 300 official games with Feyenoord, Taument moved to Portugal's S.L. Benfica, but failed to establish with the club, moving in the next transfer window to R.S.C. Anderlecht, where he also was very rarely used throughout a half season spell. 
After one season in Greece with OFI Crete, he managed to produce two sufficient seasons at SK Rapid Wien, helping the Austrian capital side finish second in his first year. He retired in June 2002 at the age of 31, and was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year in 1991.

==International career==

Taument earned 15 caps for the Netherlands, scoring twice. He was a member of the Dutch team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup – where he scored the Netherlands' winning goal in their first game against Saudi Arabia (2–1)Netherlands - Saudi Arabia 2-1 (0-1); Planet World Cup, 20 June 1994– and at UEFA Euro 1996. 
Taument made his international debut on 12 February 1992, in a friendly with Portugal played in the Estádio de São Luís, in Faro (0–2 loss).
