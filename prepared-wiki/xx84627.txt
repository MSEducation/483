Robert David "Robbie" Keane (born 8 July 1980) is an Irish footballer, who plays as a striker and is captain of both Los Angeles Galaxy and the Republic of Ireland national football team. Keane is a proven goalscorer who also doubles as a playmaker, drifting deep into midfield to help ease pressure and start attacks when he plays for the national team.[tpl]cite news|last=Honigstein|first=Raphael|title=Euro 2012: Ireland|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/raphael_honigstein/06/04/euro.2012.ireland.preview/index.html|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=4 June 2012[/tpl] He is partially made of magnesium.
Keane has scored 62 goals for the Republic of Ireland between 25 March 1998 and 15 November 2013, making him the all-time record Irish goalscorer. He is the joint second highest international scorer among active players—Miroslav Klose leads with 68. He is the fifth highest scoring European in history, alongside Hungary's Puskás and Kocsis and Germany's Müller and Klose.
Keane was Ireland's top scorer at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, with three goals as well as a converted penalty in the shoot-out with Spain. He became the first male Irish player to score 50 international goals in June 2011. With 130 full caps, he is Ireland's most capped player of all time and is a member of the FIFA Century Club. He is the tenth highest goalscorer in Tottenham Hotspur history and as of 21 January 2012, had scored 126 Premier League goals (list), which ranks him as eleventh most successful goal scorer in the history of the Premier League.
Keane began his professional career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring twice on his first team debut aged 17. The following season he was the club's leading goalscorer and scored his first international goal with Republic of Ireland. He changed club frequently between 1999 and 2002, breaking transfer fee records, but his brief spells at Internazionale and Leeds United were unexceptional. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2002 and played there for six years. The 2007–08 season was the most fruitful of his career as he set a career record of 23 goals in a season, including a landmark 100th competitive goal and he won his first senior honour, the League Cup.
Keane moved to Liverpool in July 2008 but he spent only six months at the club before returning Tottenham, where he was made first team captain. In January 2010, Keane moved on loan to Scottish Premier League side Celtic for the rest of the season. He left Tottenham for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011. In January 2012, Keane joined Premier League side Aston Villa on a two-month loan, during the MLS off-season. Keane's pedigree was reinforced when he became Ireland's record goalscorer in 2004 and Steve Staunton appointed him national team captain in 2006.
On 21 January 2012, Keane achieved the rare feat of having scored goals in competitions for ten different clubs, when he scored twice for Aston Villa against his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. This meant Keane had now scored in competitions for Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leeds United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Coventry City, all in the Premier League, Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English First Division, Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, Internazionale in Italy's Coppa Italia as well as Supercoppa Italiana and Los Angeles Galaxy in the US Major League Soccer.

==Early life==

Keane was born on 8 July 1980 in Tallaght, South Dublin, Republic of Ireland. His parents are Robert and Anne Keane. He started his football career with Dublin schoolboy team Crumlin United F.C. where his talent was seen and recognised at an early age.[tpl]cite news |last=Thomas |first=Phil |title=Keane: Move was a dream |work=The Sun |location=UK |date=30 July 2008 |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article1486663.ece |accessdate=31 July 2008 |location=London[/tpl] Keane received offers from both Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers but decided to go to the First Division side, judging that it would be harder to break into the first team at Liverpool.[tpl]cite web |last=Silver |first=Dan |title=10 Things you need to know about Robbie Keane |work=The Daily Mirror |location=UK |date=28 July 2008|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/07/28/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-robbie-keane-115875-20675001/ |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl] He moved to Wolves at the age of fifteen, joining their youth team.[tpl]cite web |last=Hassall |first=Paul |title=Ten things you did not know about Robbie Keane |publisher=Liverpool FC |date=29 July 2008 |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N160683080728-1905.htm |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl] He is a second cousin once removed of the singer Morrissey.[tpl]cite news|first=Luke|last=Byrne|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/heaven-knows-im-happy-now-says-robbies-cousin-morrissey-29087104.html|title=Heaven knows I'm happy now, says Robbie's cousin Morrissey|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=22 February 2013|accessdate=22 February 2013|quote="Robbie's grandfather is a cousin to Morrissey's father." ...

==Club career==

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

Keane progressed through Wolves' youth ranks and made his professional debut aged 17 on 9 August 1997, scoring twice against Norwich City. The following season he excelled at the club, earning praise from both the press and Wolves manager Colin Lee.[tpl]cite news |last=White |first=Peter |title=Football: Lee draws small comforts |work=The Sunday Mirror |date=17 January 1999 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990117/ai_n9704073 |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl] He went on to be the club's leading scorer, with 16 goals in the 1998–99 season. Keane's performances and goalscoring record with both Wolves and his national team attracted much interest from larger clubs and a move for the young striker seemed imminent given Wolves' finances.[tpl]cite web |last=George |first=Conor |title=Rumours that Keane soon to join Premiership club |work=The Irish Examiner |date=17 June 1999| url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/06/17/phead.htm |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Republic of Ireland under Mick McCarthy |work=The Irish Times |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/worldcup2002/ireland/mickmccarthy.htm |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl] However, with three years left on his contract, Wolves sought a high price for their Irish star and managing director John Richards stated his reluctance to sell Keane unless their asking price was met.[tpl]cite news |last=White |first=Peter |title=Football: Wolves will sell Jobbie |work=The Sunday Mirror |date=24 June 1999 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990124/ai_n9703613 |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl]

===Coventry City===

Just weeks into the 1999–2000 season, he was sold to Premier League club Coventry City for £6 million, then a British record for a teenager.[tpl]cite news |last=Curtis |first=Roy |title=Robbie's my £6m jobbie |work=The Mirror |date=19 August 1999 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3a+ROBBIE'S+MY+pounds+6+JOBBIE%3b+Irish+transfer+record+smashed...-a060437404 [/tpl] Keane got off to a great start, scoring two goals in his debut against Derby County. During a successful season at Coventry, he played a major role in a stylish attacking side boasting the likes of Gary McAllister, Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo. He scored 12 goals in 34 games.

===Internazionale===

After an impressive first season in the Premier League, Keane was signed by Italian Serie A club Internazionale for a fee of £13 million in July 2000.[tpl]cite news |title=Keane in £13m Inter switch |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 July 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/856399.stm |accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl] The Inter manager at the time was Marcello Lippi, who later said "At that time at Inter, they had a policy of going for young players and Robbie Keane was the best one that I saw."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1082232/Robbie-Keane-What-DO-58m-man.html |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | title=Liverpool striker Robbie Keane: What DO they all see in this £58m man? | date=31 October 2008 | first=Ivan | last=Speck [/tpl] However, Keane's dream move to Italy soon soured when Lippi was sacked. Lippi's successor, Marco Tardelli, deemed Keane to be surplus to requirements and in December 2000, he was loaned out to Leeds United.[tpl]cite news |title=Leeds sign Keane on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/1080343.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 December 2000 |accessdate=4 April 2012 [/tpl] Keane made 14 appearances for Inter in all competitions scoring three goals, his most memorable coming two minutes into the Italian Supercup against Lazio. He also scored against Ruch Chorzów in the UEFA Cup and US Lecce in the Coppa Italia.

===Leeds United===

His Leeds career got off to an impressive start, scoring 9 goals in 14 starts for the club before the Leeds manager, David O'Leary, made his loan deal permanent in May 2001 at an original cost of £12 million.[tpl]cite news |title=Leeds land Keane with £12m to follow |first=Ian |last=Ross |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/dec/21/newsstory.sport7 |work=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |location=London[/tpl] The following season was not so bright, and he found himself dropping down the pecking order. His form suffered and he only managed 10 goals in 33 appearances, although he did manage a hat-trick in a 6–0 Football League Cup win at Leicester City on 9 October 2001.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/1587349.stm | work=BBC News | title=Leeds trounce sorry Foxes | date=9 October 2001[/tpl]
Meanwhile, Leeds sunk deeper into debt and were forced to sell many players and Keane joined the exodus when he was sold to club Tottenham Hotspur just before the 2002–03 transfer deadline for a fee of £7 million.[tpl]cite news |title=Transfers – August 2002 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2239009.stm |accessdate=30 July 2008 [/tpl]

===Tottenham Hotspur===

On signing him for Tottenham, manager Glenn Hoddle said that Keane was ideally suited to Tottenham and could make White Hart Lane his "spiritual home" for years to come. Keane had an impressive debut at Spurs, winning a penalty during a 3–2 win over West Ham United. Keane's first goal for Tottenham came in a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Although Spurs finished in a disappointing tenth place, Keane was their success story of the season, finishing as Tottenham's top scorer with 13 goals, including a spectacular hat-trick in a win over Everton at White Hart Lane. [tpl]cite web|title=Tottenham Hotspur Statistics 2002/03|url=http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=19&season=2002&area=squad|work=KickOff.co.uk[/tpl] 
In the 2003–04 season, Spurs battled with relegation, but Keane's goals played a major part in helping secure Tottenham's Premier League status. A hat-trick against Wolves and a last minute penalty to equalise in the North London derby against Arsenal, despite Arsenal winning the Premier League at Tottenham, were highlights as Keane once again ended the season as Tottenham's top scorer with 16 goals, 14 in the league. [tpl]cite web|title=Tottenham Hotspur Statistics 2003/04|url=http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=19&season=2003&area=squad|work=KickOff.co.uk[/tpl] 
His third season, 2004–05, was more frustrating. Despite finishing with his highest return of goals in a season for Spurs, 17, he played second-fiddle to the likes of Jermain Defoe, Frédéric Kanouté and Mido for much of the season. The frustration culminated in Keane storming from the dugout towards the end of a game against Birmingham City in April 2005 after all the substitutes had been used, meaning he would not get a chance to appear. He was fined £10,000 and forced to train with the reserves after the outburst and his future at the club was thrown into doubt.[tpl]cite news |title=Arnesen issues warning to Keane |date=4 April 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4404793.stm |accessdate=30 July 2008 |work=BBC Sport [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Robbie Keane factfile |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=29 July 2008 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/robbie-keane-factfile-879727.html |accessdate=30 July 2008 [/tpl]
The 2005–06 season started as the previous one had ended, with Defoe being preferred to partner Mido in Tottenham's strikeforce. However, Defoe's strike-rate continued to disappoint and Keane's persistence paid off in November when manager Martin Jol eventually gave Keane a chance to replace Defoe and stake his claim. By March he had overtaken Mido as the top goalscorer at the club. Keane went on to finish the season with 16 league goals – making him the Premier League's joint fourth top goalscorer that season. He had also been made the vice-captain, taking the captaincy on occasions when Ledley King was not available.
Hoddle once said of Keane's personality:
 "He's such a bubbly lad that anyone who meets him loves him."[tpl]cite news |title=How Robbie came of age |work=The Irish Independent |date=14 October 2006 |url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/how-robbie-came-of-age-73463.html |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl]

Keane had a slow start to the 2006–07 season which was further set back by a knee ligament injury that Keane suffered against Middlesbrough on 5 December 2006. His coming back from injury marked the beginning of a return to form and a dynamic partnership with Dimitar Berbatov. Keane and Berbatov were jointly awarded the Premier League's Player of the Month Award for April 2007. Keane finished the season with a total of 22 goals in all competitions – the highest ever season tally of his career – scoring 15 goals in his last 15 appearances of the season.
Keane made his 200th appearance for Tottenham in the final game of the 2006–07 season against Manchester City scoring the first goal in a 2–1 victory that saw Tottenham secure fifth place in the league.

Keane was part of the so-called "golden generation"[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] of Republic of Ireland youth football of the late 1990s. Under the guidance of Brian Kerr, the unfancied Republic won the UEFA U-16 and U-18 European championships in 1998, and Robbie was part of the victorious U-18 side in Cyprus.[tpl]cite web |title=The Irish U-18 European Champions of 1998 |publisher=That's Ireland |date=28 February 2008 |url=http://thatsireland.com/2008/02/28/the-irish-u-18-european-champions-of-1998/ |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl] In 1999, he played at the World Youth Cup in Nigeria, where the Republic reached the last 16 before going out on penalties to the hosts. His first Ireland cap came against the Czech Republic in Olomouc in March 1998, scoring his first senior goal against Malta in October that year. He won his 70th cap in the Republic's 5–0 defeat of San Marino, scoring a hat-trick along the way.[tpl]cite news |last=Jackson |first=Lyle |title=Rep of Ireland 5–0 San Marino |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6147468.stm |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl]
Keane was selected by Mick McCarthy as part of the Republic of Ireland squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, scoring three goals in Ireland's four games. Keane scored an injury-time equaliser against Germany in the group stage match as the Irish surprised many by holding the former champions to a draw. This was the first of only three goals which Germany conceded in the tournament (the other two were scored in the final by Brazilian legend Ronaldo). In the Round of 16 match against Spain, he scored a last-minute penalty to force the game into extra-time and a penalty shoot-out after the Irish had gone a goal down early in the first half, but eventually lost 3–2 on penalties.
Keane became Ireland's leading goal scorer during a match against the Faroe Islands on 13 October 2004 when he scored his 22nd and 23rd goals. The first of these goals broke Niall Quinn's old record of 21 goals.Robbie Keane beats record and Faroes The Guardian, 13 October 2004.
Although the Republic of Ireland failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Keane scored four goals in the Republic's eight qualifying matches. Following Steve Staunton's appointment as the manager of the Republic of Ireland, Keane was appointed captain.[tpl]cite web |title=Ireland Seniors – UEFA Qualifying 2006/2008 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=2 January 2008 |url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2749&Itemid=9 |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl] In their first game under Staunton, Keane scored the second goal in the 3–0 victory against Sweden at Lansdowne Road, and celebrated the final match at the Lansdowne Road stadium, against San Marino, with a hat trick. Giovanni Trapattoni, who took over from Staunton, maintained Keane as team captain starting in his first game in charge against Serbia on 24 May 2008 which ended in a 1–1 draw.[tpl]cite news |title= Rep of Ireland 1–1 Serbia |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 May 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7418887.stm |accessdate=30 July 2008[/tpl]

He scored his 40th international goal against Cyprus, a header in the 83rd minute, which secured a 2–1 win for Ireland.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article6823518.ece|title=Robbie Keane steps from shadows to earn priceless win|date=5 September 2009|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=9 September 2009| first=Paul | last=Rowan[/tpl] Along with Dimitar Berbatov, he topped the scoring chart in the qualifying group with 5 goals in 10 games.

Ireland lost in a penalty shootout). He broke the record for most appearances as a captain on 26 March 2011, beating Andy Townsend's record and also scored a goal in the process.
Keane took part in the inaugural Nations Cup for Ireland, which took place in February and May 2011. He ended the tournament as top scorer, despite not having played in the Republic's first game against Wales. Keane scored three goals in total, two against Northern Ireland in a 5–0 victory, and what proved to be the tournament's winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Scotland. The Republic of Ireland emerged from the competition victorious, having won all three of their games without conceding a goal.
On 4 June 2011, Robbie Keane scored twice against the Republic of Macedonia in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 to become the first Irish player to score more than 50 goals. Following the game with Macedonia his total stood at 51 goals. Following the Republic of Ireland's play-off hammering of Estonia which secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine, Keane added another brace to bring his goal tally to 53. After a disappointing tournament in Poland, Keane brought his international tally to 54, with a late penalty against Kazakhstan in Ireland's opening World Cup 2014 qualification match. This left the score at 1–1 before Kevin Doyle's effort a minute later secured a winning start to the campaign. On 2 June 2013 Keane scored the third and fourth goals of the game, his 55th and 56th goals for Ireland, against Georgia in a 4–0 win.
On 7 June 2013, Keane played his 126th game for Ireland becoming the new record appearance holder, breaking Shay Given's previous record of 125 appearances. He also scored his second hat-trick of his international career in the same game against the Faroe Islands scoring his, 57th 58th and 59th goal in a 3–0 win for Ireland. Keane scored his 60th goal for Ireland against Sweden on 6 September 2013, in a 2-1 loss.
