 The Heavenly Vision

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There's light for a look at the Saviour,

And life more abundant and free!
Refrain:

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face;

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim

In the light of His glory and grace.
Thro' death into life everlasting

He pass'd, and we follow him there

Over us sin hath no more dominion

For more than conquer'rs we are!
His word shall not fail you--He promised;

Believe him and all will be well:

Then go to a world that is dying,

His perfect salvation to tell.
