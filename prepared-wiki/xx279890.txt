Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology ([tpl]lang-bn|  রাজশাহী প্রকৌশল ও প্রযুক্তি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় (Rajshahi Prokoushol o Projukti Bishshobiddalôe)[/tpl])  or RUET (Bengali : রুয়েট) formerly known as BIT  Rajshahi, is the second oldest engineering university in Bangladesh. It was founded in 1964 as a faculty of Engineering under the University of Rajshahi. It is now providing four years Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Production Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Glass and Ceramic Engineering, Urbanization & Regional Planning Architecture,Mechatronics Engineering, . It is widely reputed as one of the best engineering universities in Bangladesh. About 2400 students are enrolled in Undergraduate and Postgraduate Engineering and Science with over 200 teachers. This university has a reputation for having a very good relationship between students and teachers. RUET has continued to expand with the construction of new academic buildings, auditorium complex, halls of residence, etc.

==Location==

RUET is located on the north side of Rajshahi-Natore-Dhaka road at Kazla, 5 kilometers east of the education city of Bangladesh, Rajshahi, on [tpl]convert|152|acre|km2[/tpl] of land. Known as green campus with a large varieties of trees, the campus is laid out with a picturesque landscape by the side of famous Padma River and Rajshahi University. It's very easy to go anywhere else in the country from the city. There is a Bus Stop and a Railway Station very near to the campus. The city of Rajshahi where the campus is belonged, is one of the most urbanized cities in the Northern Bangladesh. There are many restaurants, tea stalls, coffee bars
The nightlife here at the campus is beautiful.

==Campus==

The campus presents a spectacular harmony of architecture and natural beauty. The campus area has been divided into function zones: residence for students, residential zones of faculty and other supporting staff, academic zone for academic buildings and laboratories/workshops, and cultural-cum-social and recreation zones for students. A bank branch, post office, modern cafeteria, auditorium and medical center are on the campus. In RUET there is a very big play ground and a central common room with a gymnasium for the students.
A secondary school and a college are located in RUET to teach the children of university employees.

==History==

Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology(RUET) was founded in 1964 as a faculty of engineering with Professor Ahmad Ullah as its first Principal, under the University of Rajshahi providing four-year Bachelor degrees in Civil, Electrical and Electronic and Mechanical Engineering. However, the institution could not achieve its goal because of the complicated management system: The administration was controlled by the Ministry of Education; academic curriculum by the University of Rajshahi; and the infrastructural development and maintenance by the Public Works Department. To circumvent these problems, several committees and commissions were formed since 1973. On the recommendation of these committees/commissions and having considered the practical aspects, autonomy was given to the four engineering colleges to make them centers of excellence of technology. A 15-member high-powered committee was formed, headed by Professor Dr. Wahid Uddin Ahmed, the then vice chancellor of BUET.
The consistent effort of this committee ultimately led to the establishment of four engineering colleges to Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) in July 1986. But due to limited autonomy and some constitutional inadequacies of the BIT ordinance, the expected progress of the institutions could not be achieved. This ultimately necessitates re-framing the institutes as full-fledged universities. Due to the development of Engineering Education it was the appropriate steps to convert the four BITs to engineering and technological universities. The parliament passed the university bill and that ultimately paved the way to commence the activities of university from September 1, 2002. The name of the BIT became Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET).
