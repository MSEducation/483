[[Suburra]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient city of Rome

Suburra (usually spelled Subura in antiquity) is an area of the city of Rome, Italy. In ancient Roman times, it was a crowded lower-class area that was also notorious as a red-light district. It lies in the dip between the southern end of the Viminal and the western end of the Esquiline hills. Most of its inhabitants lived in insulae, tall apartment buildings with tabernae on the ground floor.
Julius Caesar grew up in a family home (domus) in the Subura district, as the Subura had grown up around the property many years before his birth.
The district is featured in Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome, Steven Saylor's, Roman Blood, Martha Marks' Rubies of the Viper and SPQR by John Maddox Roberts.
