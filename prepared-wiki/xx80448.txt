The Gyeongui Line is a rail line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway from Munsan Station to Seoul Station and Gongdeok Station, officially defined by Korail as "subway".[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/eng/ein/ein02000/w_ein02100.jsp |title=Retainment condition and lines in service |publisher=Korail |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl] This is despite the line being substantially overground because the term "subway" in Korean is synonymous with metro.http://dic.naver.com/search.nhn?dicQuery=%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%A0&x=0&y=0&query=%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%A0&target=dic&ie=utf8&query_utf=&isOnlyViewEE= When opened in 1906 originally as a railway, it linked Seoul in what is now South Korea to P'yŏngyang and Sinŭiju in what is now North Korea. At Seoul, the line connected with the Gyeongbu Line to Busan, while at Sinŭiju, the line connected with the South Manchuria Railway, linking the Korean railway system to the rest of Asia and Europe.

==History==

Korea intended to build the Gyeongui Line with its own resources at the end of the 19th century, but the project stalled due to lack of funds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Nakano-Akira/2533 |title=Korea’s Railway Network the Key to Imperial Japan’s Control |publisher=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl] Imperial Japan, which gained to concession to build the Gyeongbu Line from Busan to Seoul, also sought to gain control of the Gyeongui Line project as its continuation further north, recognising the trunk route as a means to keep Korea under its influence. The line was also advanced for military considerations in expectation of a confrontation with Russia, which came in 1904 as the Russo-Japanese War. At the start of the war, Japan ignored Korea's declaration of neutrality and transported troops to Incheon, and forced the Korean government to sign an agreement that gave Japan's military control of railway projects if deemed necessary for military operations. Japan's military began to build the Gyeongui Line, while troop bases were established in connection with the railway, the biggest of them next to the terminus of the line, Yongsan Station in Seoul.
The first section of the Gyeongui Line opened from Yongsan in Seoul to Munsan on April 3, 1906.[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=경영원칙 > 경영공시 > 영업현황 > 영업거리현황 |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl]

===Inter-Korea border===

After the division of Korea in 1945, trains stopped operating between the north and south halves of the country, meaning that southern trains probably terminated at Kaesŏng, which is now in North Korea but was at the time part of the US-administered southern zone. Northern trains would have terminated north of Kaesŏng.
After the end of the Korean War in 1953, southern trains were cut back to around Munsan (north of Seoul), with northern trains terminating at Kaesŏng. Around the same time, North Korea renamed the P'yŏngyang-Kaesŏng section of the line as the P'yŏngbu (P'yŏngyang + Busan) Line and the P'yŏngyang-Sinŭiju section as the P'yŏngŭi (P'yŏngyang + Sinŭiju) Line. The DPRK sector is now 100% electrifed, although the double track section spans only from Pyongyang to Sunan Airport.
Since the summit between the two Koreas in 2000, an effort has slowly been underway to reconnect the Gyeongui Line.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.irail.net/webzine/krt/20071008/15356_cf_171_KRT_9.pdf |title=Trans-Korean Railway |journal=Korean Rail Technology (English) |volume=9 |pages=09–11 |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl] Southern passenger service has been extended to Dorasan on the edge of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and tracks have been built across the DMZ itself. In October 2004, the Northern connection from the DMZ to Kaesŏng was finally completed. Simultaneous test runs along the rebuilt cross-border sections of both the Gyeongui Line and the Donghae Bukbu Line were set for May 25, 2006, but North Korean military authorities cancelled the plans a day ahead of the scheduled event. However, at a meeting held in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 22, 2007, North and South Korea agreed to restart the project. On May 17, 2007, the first train, carrying North and South Korean delegations, travelled from Munsan Station in the South to Kaesong in the North.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/world/asia/18korea.html?ref=asia |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |title=North and South Send Trains Across the Korean Frontier |author=Choe Sang-hun |work=New York Times[/tpl] The first test run on the Donghae Bukbu Line took place at the same time. According to South Korean representatives, the North has agreed in principle to regular passenger and freight service along the two train lines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/16/koreas-rail-connection-markets-econ-cx_jc_1116markets03.html |title=Freight Rail Link Between Two Koreas Seems Imminent |date=2007-11-16 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl]

===Upgrade===

Meanwhile, work began to upgrade the South Korean section for high-capacity commuter services. Between Seoul and Munsan, the line is converted into an electrified, double-tracked railway in a new, straighter, 48.6 km long alignment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.krnetwork.or.kr/service/condition/RouteMapView.do?PA_MAP_ID=12419 |title=용산∼문산 복선전철 |publisher=Korea Rail Network Authority |accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] Work began in November 1999, with a budget originally estimated at 1,970 billion won.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/south-koreas-growing-network.html |title=South Korea's growing network |date=2008-09-08 |publisher=Railway Gazette International |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20121205072403/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/south-koreas-growing-network.html |archivedate=2010-08-14 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] The section from Digital Media City (DMC) to Munsan was finished on July 1, 2009. The remaining section will be mostly underground between Gajwa Station in northwestern Seoul to Yongsan Station in downtown Seoul. As of 2009, construction progress on the entire Seoul–Munsan section reached 74% of a total budget then estimated at 2,153.271 billion won. The section is to be finished by 2014[tpl]Cite web | title =수도권II 경의선 효창정거장 부지 220m 때문에 | publisher =Chosun | date =August 25, 2011 | url =http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/08/24/2011082402671.html | language = Korean | accessdate = 15 July 2012[/tpl] and the freed area on the surface is to be turned into a park.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/09/2009110900025.html |title=폐철로 위에 핀 '녹색문화공원' |language=Korean |date=2009-11-09 |publisher=The Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
The line is to be further upgraded for [tpl]convert|230|kph|mph[/tpl], as part of a government strategic plan to reduce travel times for 95% of Korea to under 2 hours by 2020, which was announced on September 1, 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925474 |title=Bullet trains coming to a town near you by 2020 |date=2010-09-02 |publisher=JoongAng Daily |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]

==Services==

===Seoul Metropolitan Subway===

The South Korean section of the Gyeongui Line was integrated with the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system with the opening of the DMC-Munsan upgrade on July 1, 2009. The northernmost subway station is Munsan, and the subway runs through Paju and Ilsan, then all the way into Seoul Station.
It's included as part of Seoul Metropolitan Subway's metro system — It is newly electrified and double tracked, uses subway cars, is shown on subway maps in Seoul, and has free transfers with Seoul Subway Line 2, Seoul Subway Line 3, Seoul Subway Line 5, Line 6, AREX and (off-platform) Line 1.
The current section from Seoul Station to Digital Media City Station is a branch line, not the main line. Most trains go from Munsan to Digital Media City and stop, while only one or two trains per hour go all the way to Seoul Station.
When the full extension to Yongsan Station is completed in December 2014, trains will run to Yongsan Station, and then continue eastward on what is currently the Jungang Line all the way to Sinwonju Station, near Gangwon-do. It is known that the two lines will directly link with each other to form one (very long) subway line, but it is not clear as to what the line will be called.

==Stations==

===Regular rail service===

Before the integration with the subway system, the most common service on the line was a Tonggeun train service between Seoul and Imjingang, with one Saemaeul-ho train. Since the line was integrated with the Seoul Subway system, Tonggeun service has been restricted to a few stations in the north, from Munsan to Imjingang, with a few continuing on to Dorasan, near the North Korean border.

===KTX===

There is a depot for Korea Train Express (KTX) trains along the Gyeongui Line at Haengsin.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lee |first=Kyung Chul |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr48/pdf/f30_Lee.pdf |title=Launch of Korean High-Speed Railway and Efforts to Innovate Future Korean Railway |journal=Japan Railway & Transport Review |issue=48 |pages=30–35 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-23[/tpl] Some KTX services thus continue beyond Seoul respective Yongsan Station and terminate at Haengsin Station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.korail.com/en/rv/pr21100/w_pr21110.jsp |title=Booking |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl]
The line may see more KTX service after the upgrade for 230 km/h considered in the government's strategic plan for 2020.
