Royal Roy: A Prince of a Boy was a short-lived bimonthly comic book title from the Marvel Comics younger readers' imprint Star Comics, created by Lennie Herman and Warren Kremer.

==Publication history==

Royal Roy began in April 1985 as an answer to the successful Harvey Comics Richie Rich series.  Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional kingdom whose name was a blend of "cash" and "Camelot."  Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury, but wasn't spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend (Crystal Cleer, a parody of Gloria Glad) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance (Lorna Loot, a parody of Mayda Munny) who vied for his affections.

===Controversy===

In late 1985 Harvey Comics sued Star Comics for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich."Harvey Sues Marvel Star Comics, Charges Copyright Infringement," The Comics Journal #105 (Feb. 1986), pp. p. 23-24. (Longtime Harvey creator Lennie Herman had created Royal Roy for Star Comics; Herman died in 1983"Harvey Veteran Lenny Herman Dies," The Comics Journal #87 (December 1983), p. 21. before the first issue of Royal Roy was published.)
Royal Roy was cancelled after six issues in March 1986, and Harvey's lawsuit was dropped.

===X-Babies===

An updated version of Royal Roy (along with Planet Terry, Top Dog and Wally the Wizard) is featured in the four-issue X-Babies miniseries published by Marvel Comics in late 2009.
