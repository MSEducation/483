As a songwriter, Gripp is best known for fake jingles, as in his 2005 solo album For Those About to Shop, We Salute You - a 51-track concept album mimicking various musical styles as product commercials. It does not have one single concept; it goes through many various concept suites, such as trucks, beer, and insomnia. He also maintains a song-of-the-week website and a YouTube channel on which he creates soundtracks to internet memesParry Gripp, the Weird Al Yankovic of YouTube as well as music videos for his own novelty songs, with titles including "Do You Like Waffles?", "Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom", "Last Train to Awesometown", "Spaghetti Cat (I weep for you)", "Hamster on a Piano (Eating Popcorn)", "I Am A Banana" and "Baby Monkey (Going Backwards On A Pig)". Gripp also performs the Being Ian, Super Hero Squad Show, and Ben 10: Omniverse theme songs.
Gripp also joined forces with MC Lars to perform some of the vocals, including the chorus, to "Guitar Hero Hero (Beating Guitar Hero Doesn't Make You Slash)" a song commenting on the notion that video games like Guitar Hero take kids away from playing in bands and actually learning their instruments.
Along with faux jingles, Gripp also creates some real advertising music, such as Beatles-inspired tunes promoting the Wawa Food Markets' Breakfast Hoagiefest,Wawa Hoagiefest website and songs for the Hallmark Cards e-characters hoops&yoyo.
