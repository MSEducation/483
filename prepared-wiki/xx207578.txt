==Career==

Rowbotham was born in Cardiff, Wales. He began his career as a junior with Plymouth Argyle, and turned professional with the club in November 1984. Three years later he joined local rivals Exeter City.[tpl]cite book |author=Matthews, Tony |title=Birmingham City: A Complete Record |year=1995 |page=121 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |isbn=978-1-85983-010-9[/tpl] A key player in Exeter winning the Fourth Division title in the 1989–90 season, his goalscoring had linked him with possible moves to top-flight football. However, he sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of football for a year, after which his career was restricted to the lower divisions of the Football League.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/exeter_city/857219.stm |title=A game of two halves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2000 |accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl]
After four years at Exeter, where he scored 58 goals in 142 games in all competitions, he joined Torquay United for a fee of £25,000. Only four months later he moved on again, following his former Exeter manager Terry Cooper to Birmingham City for a fee of £20,000.
Lack of goals for Birmingham resulted in loan spells at Mansfield Town and Hereford United before he left on a free transfer, signing for Crewe Alexandra before the 1993–94 season. He spent two years there, followed by an 18-month spell at Shrewsbury Town, before returning to Exeter in 1996. He remained at Exeter for four years, including a month on loan to Leyton Orient,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=6905 |title=Darren Rowbotham |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Racing Post |accessdate=2008-09-07[/tpl] before being released at the end of the 1999–2000 season.
