[[List of Interstate Highways]]

CATEGORIES: Interstate Highway System

Primary Interstate Highways of the United States are numbered with one- or two-digit designations. Their associated auxiliary highways have three-digit numbers.  Even route numbers are assigned to east–west routes, generally from south (e.g., I-2) to north (I-96), with coast-to-coast and other long-distance routes ending in '0'.  Similarly, odd route numbers are assigned to north–south routes, from west (I-5) to east (I-99), with border-to-border and other long distance routes ending in '5'.
Five pairs of numbers are duplicated throughout the system; the corresponding highways are separated by large distances which prevent confusion. Below, these are differentiated from each other by "West" and "East". The main list is followed by sections listing the primary Interstate highways in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  

==Primary Interstate Highways==

There are 66 primary Interstate Highways listed in the table below, and 43 of them have auxiliary routes. Listed lengths are as of October 31, 2002.
Routes ending in 0 or 5 are highlighted in  green, while unfinished or proposed routes are highlighted in grey.

==Interstate Highways outside of the mainland==

In addition to the 48 contiguous states, Interstate Highways are found in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.

===Hawaiian Interstate Highways===

The Interstate Highways in the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, Hawaii are signed with the standard Interstate Highway shield, with the letter "H-" prefixed before the number. They are fully controlled-access routes built to the same standards as the mainland Interstate Highways.

===Alaska and Puerto Rico===

The Federal Highway Administration funds four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System.  However, these routes are not required to meet the same standards as the mainland routes:

====Alaska====

Alaska's Interstate Highways are unsigned, although they all have state highway numbers that do not match the Interstate Highway numbers.

====Puerto Rico====

Like Alaska, Puerto Rico signs its Interstate Highways as territorial routes, and the numbers do not match their official Interstate Highway designations.  Many of the territory's routes are freeway-standard toll roads.
