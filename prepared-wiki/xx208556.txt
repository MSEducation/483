Port Meadow Halt was a railway station on the Varsity Line, between north Oxford and Port Meadow. The London and North Western Railway opened the halt as Summertown on 20 August 1906[tpl]sfn|Waters|1986|p=128[/tpl] and renamed it Port Meadow Halt in January 1907. It was closed between 1 January 1917 and 5 May 1919, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway permanently closed it on 30 October 1926.[tpl]sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=fig. III[/tpl] It was located on the north side of a footbridge leading from the present-day Aristotle Lane into Port Meadow, close to an occupation crossing which also gave access to the up platform.[tpl]sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=fig.

The opening of the station marked the inauguration of a rail motor car service between Oxford and Bicester. Journey time was 37 minutes and, other than Port Meadow and Bicester, the service called at [tpl]stnlnk|Wolvercote Halt[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Oxford Road Halt[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Islip[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Oddington Halt[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Charlton Halt[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|Wendlebury Halt[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Little|1930|p=223[/tpl] On the opening day the rail motor ran hot at the end of a return trip from Bicester in the early part of the morning and a 2-4-2 locomotive hauling an 8-wheel corridor coach replaced it; a step-ladder had to be provided for passengers to alight as the halts were only constructed of sleepers laid at rail level.[tpl]sfn|Little|1930|p=223[/tpl] The rail motor service was withdrawn as a wartime economy measure in 1917 and restored in 1919. It was permanently withdrawn from 1925 due to the introduction of motorised bus services around Oxford.[tpl]sfn|Little|1930|p=223[/tpl]
