Cyperus fuscus is a species of sedge known by the common name brown galingale, or brown flatsedge. This plant is native to temperate Eurasia but it is an introduced species in much of North America, where it is naturalized in some areas. This is a plant of wet areas, particularly disturbed places such as ditches and temporary ponds. It is an annual herb with paper-thin stems reaching 30 centimeters in maximum height. There may be short, flat leaves about the base of the plant. The inflorescence contains three to 15 spikelets, which are flat, oval or rectangular, and dark brown to deep purple. Each spikelet has around ten flowers enclosed in dark bracts. The fruit is a light brown achene about a millimeter long. In the UK, Cyperus fuscus is one of 101 species named as a priority for conservation by the conservation charity Plantlife. http://www.plantlife.org.uk/index.html Plantlife website
