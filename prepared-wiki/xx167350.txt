Malto [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|t|oʊ[/tpl][tpl]OED|Malto[/tpl] or Paharia [tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|h|ɑr|i|ə[/tpl][tpl]OED|Paharia[/tpl] is a Northern Dravidian language spoken primarily in East India. There are two varieties of Malto that are sometimes regarded as separate languages, Kumarbhag Paharia (Devanagari: कुमारभाग पहाड़िया) and Sauria Paharia (Devanagari: सौरिया पहाड़िया). The former is spoken in the Jharkhand and West Bengal states of India, and tiny pockets of Orissa state, and the latter in the Bihar and West Bengal states of India, and some pockets of Bangladesh. The lexical similarity between the two is estimated to be 80%.
