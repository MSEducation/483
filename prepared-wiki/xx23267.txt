Like his father, Pierre Berton worked in Klondike mining camps during his years as a history major at the University of British Columbia,[tpl]cite book|last=Parker|first=Janice|editor=Craats, Rennay|title=Writers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ncaoq19ajkC&pg=PA42|accessdate=March 2, 2011|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=Weigl Educational Publishers|isbn=978-1-896990-90-3|page=42[/tpl] where he also worked on the student paper The Ubyssey.[tpl]cite book|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|title=Writing against the wind: a mother's life history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QWtDWGwCXGAC&pg=PA27|accessdate=March 2, 2011|date=May 1999|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2783-0|page=27[/tpl] He spent his early newspaper career in Vancouver, where at 21 he was the youngest city editor on any Canadian daily, replacing editorial staff that had been called up during the Second World War.
Berton himself was conscripted into the Canadian Army under the National Resources Mobilization Act in 1942 and attended basic training in British Columbia, nominally as a reinforcement soldier intended for The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. He elected to "go Active" (the euphemism for volunteering for overseas service) and his aptitude was such that he was appointed Lance Corporal and attended NCO school, and became a basic training instructor in the rank of corporal. Due to a background in university COTC and inspired by other citizen-soldiers who had been commissioned, he sought training as an officer.
Berton spent the next several years attending a variety of military courses, becoming, in his words, the most highly trained officer in the military. He was warned for overseas duty many times, and was granted embarkation leave many times, each time finding his overseas draft being cancelled. A coveted trainee slot with the Canadian Intelligence Corps saw Berton, now a Captain, trained to act as an Intelligence Officer (IO), and after a stint as an instructor at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, he finally went overseas in March 1945. In the UK, he was told that he would have to requalify as an IO because the syllabus in the UK was different from that in the intelligence school in Canada. By the time Berton had requalified, the war in Europe had ended. He volunteered for the Canadian Army Pacific Force (CAPF), granted a final "embarkation leave", and found himself no closer to combat employment by the time the Japanese surrendered in September 1945.
In 1947 he went on an expedition to the Nahanni River with pilot Russ Baker. Berton's account for the Vancouver Sun was picked up by International News Service, making him a noted adventure-travel writer.

==Editor in Toronto==

Berton moved to Toronto in 1947. At the age of 31 he was named managing editor of Macleans. In 1957, he became a key member of the CBC's public affairs flagship program, Close-Up, and a permanent panelist on the popular television show Front Page Challenge. That same year, he also narrated the Academy Award-nominated National Film Board of Canada documentary  City of Gold, exploring life in his hometown of Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush.[tpl]cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Canadian literary landmarks|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0zbdUkJkm10C&pg=PA287|accessdate=March 2, 2011|year=1984|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=978-0-88882-073-0|page=287[/tpl] He then released an album in conjunction with Folkways Records, entitled The Story of the Klondike: Stampede for Gold – The Golden Trail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1261|title=The Story of the Klondike: Stampede for Gold – The Golden Trail – Pierre Berton|work=Smithsonian Folkways|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wtCoJc2W|archivedate=March 2, 2011[/tpl]
Berton joined the Toronto Star as associate editor of the Star Weekly and columnist for the daily paper in 1958, leaving in 1962 to commence The Pierre Berton Show, which ran until 1973. It was on this show that in 1971 Berton interviewed Bruce Lee in what was to be the famous martial artist's only surviving television interview. Berton's television career included spots as host and writer on My Country, The Great Debate, Heritage Theatre, The Secret of My Success and The National Dream.  From 1966 to 1984, Berton and long-time collaborator Charles Templeton made the daily syndicated radio debate show Dialogue.
Berton served as the Chancellor of Yukon College and, along with numerous honorary degrees, received over 30 literary awards such as the Governor General's Award for Creative Non-Fiction (three times), the Stephen Leacock Medal of Humour, and the Gabrielle Léger Award for Lifetime Achievement in Heritage Conservation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] He is a member of Canada's Walk of Fame, having been inducted in 1998. In The Greatest Canadian project, he was voted No. 31 in the list of great Canadians. Berton was named Toronto Humanist of the Year 2003 by the Humanist Association of Toronto. The honour is presented by H.A.T. to men and women who, in their actions and creative endeavours, exemplify the principles of Humanism: a commitment to reason, compassion, ethics and human dignity.[tpl]cite web|title=Humanist Association of Toronto|url=http://www.humanist.toronto.on.ca[/tpl] He was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest decoration, and was also a member of the Order of Ontario.

==Berton House Writers' Retreat==

His childhood home in Dawson City, Yukon, now called Berton House, is currently used as a retreat for professional Canadian writers. Established authors apply for a three-month long subsidized residency, adding to the area's literary community with events such as local public readings. Previously, The Berton House Writers' Retreat was administered by the Berton House Writer's Retreat Society and Elsa Franklin, Pierre Berton's long-time editor and agent. In October 2007, the deed to Berton House was passed to the Writers' Trust of Canada; the literary organization now oversees the program as part of its roster of literary support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bertonhouse.ca/home.html |title=Pierre Berton Writers' Retreat|publisher=Bertonhouse.ca|accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
