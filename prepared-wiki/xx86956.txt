The Jamie Foxx Show is an American television sitcom that aired on the WB Network from August 28, 1996 to January 14, 2001. The series stars Jamie Foxx, Garcelle Beauvais, Christopher B. Duncan, Ellia English, and Garrett Morris.

==Synopsis==

Jamie King (Jamie Foxx) is an aspiring actor from Terrell, Texas, who has come to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment. To support himself, he works in his family's hotel, the financially strapped King's Tower, which is owned by his aunt and uncle, Helen and Junior King (Ellia English and Garrett Morris).
Among his co-workers during the series' run were the beautiful and intelligent Francesca "Fancy" Monroe (played by Garcelle Beauvais) and Jamie's high-strung, stuffed-shirt, "bourgeoisie" nemesis Braxton P. Hartnabrig (portrayed by Christopher B. Duncan).
Jamie's romantic overtures toward Fancy were mostly unrequited until the final two seasons, when the two began to tentatively date and eventually became engaged. Braxton, who generally served as the brunt of Jamie's insults, was known to get in a few digs of his own as the series progressed.
