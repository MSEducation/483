Switched-On Bach is a musical album by Wendy Carlos (originally released under the name of Walter Carlos) and Benjamin Folkman, produced by Carlos and Rachel Elkind and released in March 1968 by Columbia Masterworks Records. It played a key role in popularizing classical music performed on electronic synthesizers, which had until then been relegated to experimental and "pop" music. This fostered a significant increase in interest in electronically rendered music in general, and the Moog synthesizer in particular.
Switched-On Bach was one of the first classical albums to sell 500,000 copies. Entering the top 40 of the Billboard 200 pop chart on March 1, 1969, it climbed quickly to the Top 10; it stayed in the Top 40 for 17 weeks,Joel Whitburn. Top 40 Albums. New York: Billboard Books. and in the Top 200 for more than a year. In the 1969 Grammy Awards, the album took three prizes: Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) and Best Engineered Classical Recording.

==Details==

The album consists of pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach, performed on a Moog synthesizer, a modular synthesizer system, one of which can be seen at the back of the room on the album cover. "Switched-On Bach," or "S-OB" as Carlos referred to it, was recorded on a custom-built eight-track recorder (constructed by Carlos from superseded Ampex components), using numerous takes and overdubs. This was long before the days of MIDI sequencers or polyphonic keyboards. Recording the album was a tedious and time-consuming process—each of the pieces had to be assembled one part at a time, and Carlos, Elkind and Folkman devoted many hours to experimenting with suitable synthetic sounds for each voice and part.
Due to the monophonic nature of the Moog instrument, Carlos never had the option of recording multiple notes on the same track, and in the same take. The simplest chordal constructions required multi-tracking, synchronization, and perfect timing, adding greatly to the overall time consumed by the project.Thom Holmes.

Carlos, a highly proficient musician and studio engineer and a former student of Vladimir Ussachevsky, worked closely with synthesizer designer Robert Moog throughout the recording process, testing his various components and suggesting many improvements. In 1968, not long before the album was released, Moog gave a paper at the annual Audio Engineering Society conference, where he played one of Carlos' completed recordings:

==Influence==

The album received a mixed reaction at the time of its release. Some critics reviled it for trivializing the work of one of the most revered classical composers of all time, but others were excited by the freshness of the sound and the virtuosity that went into its creation. Regardless of the negative reviews, the album caught the public attention and sold better than anyone had expected. Suddenly Moog's company found itself inundated with requests from record producers for Moog systems, and a rash of synthesizer albums were released to capitalise on the popularity of the new sound.
Some of these albums were similar to S-OB in being synthesized versions of classical pieces including:
Others capitalised on the Moog craze by creating "Switched-On" versions of contemporary artists and other genres:
Columbia Records even entered the competition by releasing an all-orchestral album with the same playlist as S-OB, with humorous liner notes:

===Covers===

The album has been released with two different covers. The most-common one shows a photograph of a man dressed as Johann Sebastian Bach standing in front of a Moog modular synthesizer. The first pressings, however, showed Bach seated.  Carlos (and producer Rachel Elkind) objected to the original cover and had it replaced, noting it "was a clownish, trivializing image of a mugging Bach, supposedly hearing some absurd sound from his earphones.  That these were plugged into the input, not output, of a 914 Filter module, which in turn was connected to nothing, assured that silence is all that would have greeted Johann Sebastian's ears."Switched-On Boxed Set liner notes

===Switched-On Bach 2000===

Carlos released Switched-On Bach 2000 in 1992 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original album's release. It is essentially a remake of the original LP — not a re-release — using state-of-the-art (as of 1992) digital synthesizers and computer-assisted recording. Although the CD contains the same track listing as the original, with the additional inclusion of a) a brief, introductory original composition styled as a birthday fanfare for the project and b) Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 at the close of the album, the new digital synth sounds, in period tunings, are radically different in feeling, prompting some criticism from disappointed fans.

===Switched-On Boxed Set===

In 1999, Carlos released the Switched-On Boxed Set, a lavishly produced 4-CD boxset comprising the following albums in their original form:
The albums have been remastered by Carlos and include some bonus tracks. The boxset also includes a 150 page booklet with photos, production notes, digital links to her website, etc.

===Remastered edition===

In 2001, Carlos released a remastered edition of Switched-On Bach. It includes a new bonus track, "Initial Experiments, demonstration".
