[[Capitulation of Irvine]]

CATEGORIES: History of Scotland

The Capitulation of Irvine was the first military stand-off of the Wars of Scottish Independence. 

==Event==

On 9 July 1297, the nobles of Scotland gathered on the banks of a loch between Irvine and Bourtreehill House. They were prepared to go into battle against the approaching English forces and had made camp on the north side of the loch. When the English arrived, they too camped on the side of the loch but on the opposite banks to the south. Both armies could see and hear each other.
The English soldiers watched on as the Scottish nobles began to fight among themselves. Robert the Bruce, Robert Wishart and various other notables were present. It was once thought that William Wallace also attended but there is no evidence one way or another.
Supposedly, the infighting and bickering became so intolerable to the English soldiers that they left the field. Another version of events is that the Scots nobles were loath to be led by Wallace, someone they considered to their 'social inferior', resulting in the Scottish lords capitulating to the English. The event has subsequently become known as "The Capitulation of Irvine".
G.W.S.Barrow points out that the Scots nobles were almost stalling by prolonging negotiations with King Edward I of England, allowing William Wallace to organise his rebellion; possibly their intention.
