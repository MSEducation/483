Storm the Streets is the second studio album by the American punk rock band the Riverdales. After a dispute with Lookout! Records, the band signed to Honest Don's Records for this release. It is the only Riverdales album still available from its original label. In the liner notes to Screeching Weasel's Thank You Very Little (2000), Ben Weasel refers to Storm the Streets as a "gem" but admits that the record sold far less than its predecessor, Riverdales (1995). The band broke up with the album's release. "I Accuse My Parents" most likely takes its title from a movie of the same name which was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show mentioned in the song "I Think About You During the Commercials" from the Riverdales' debut album.
Storm the Streets is being remastered and reissued in 2011 on Fat Wreck Chords but no further details are currently known. The album was mixed from February 24-27, 1997 by Mass Giorgini at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana.
