The GER Class 527 was a class of fifteen 2-6-0 steam tender locomotives designed by William Adams for the Great Eastern Railway. This was the last design that Adams prepared for the GER, although they did not enter service until his successor Massey Bromley had taken office and incorporated some modifications to the design. 

==Overview==

In order to haul heavier trains and compete for the coal traffic into London, the GER asked William Adams to design a locomotive capable of hauling a train of 400 long tons net (700 tons gross). 

===Prototype===

Tests were carried out with 265 class 4-4-0s to ensure that such trailing loads were feasible, followed by a prototype 2-6-0 number 527.[tpl]cite web |title=The Adams Era |at=No. 527 Class 2-6-0 1878-1879 |publisher=Great Eastern Railway Society |url=http://www.gersociety.org.uk/loco/adams.htm#527c |accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] Number 527 was the first locomotive in Britain to use the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement, and was named Mogul after the Great Moguls of Delhi,[tpl]cite book |last=Allen |first=Cecil J. |title=The Great Eastern Railway |edition=2nd |year=1956 |origyear=1955 |publisher=Ian Allan |location=Hampton Court |page=96 [/tpl] the epithet becoming the generic name for locomotives with that wheel arrangement. 

===Numbering===

As was the GER's practice for locomotives built by outside contractors, the class was referred to by the number of the first locomotive,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gersociety.org.uk/loco/leaflet1.htm |title=Locomotive Classifications |publisher=Great Eastern Railway Society |at=para. 5 |accessdate=21 March 2010 [/tpl] subsequent locos being numbered sequentially up to 541.

==Performance==

They were used on coal trains from Peterborough to London, but were found uneconomic, and so had short lives, being withdrawn between 1885 and 1887.
