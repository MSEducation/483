Black Sabbath is the eponymous debut album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath. Released on 13 February 1970 in the United Kingdom, and later on 1 June 1970 in the United States, the album reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart and has been categorised as the first major album to be credited with the development of the heavy metal genre.[tpl]cite web | url = http://rockhall.com/inductees/black-sabbath/bio/ | title = Black Sabbath Biography | accessdate = 7 September 2013 | publisher = Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[/tpl]

==Recording==

According to guitarist Tony Iommi, the album was recorded in a single day on 16 October 1969, while other sources say that 17 November 1969 was the date of recording.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Black Sabbath |titlelink= |others=Black Sabbath |year=2009 |chapter= Black Sabbath (1970) |first=David |last=Wells |type=CD Booklet |publisher=Sanctuary Records Group  |location=London, UK |ref= [/tpl] Iommi said: "We just went in the studio and did it in a day, we played our live set and that was it. We actually thought a whole day was quite a long time, then off we went the next day to play for £20 in Switzerland."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=2&storycode=1037239 | title = Black celebration: the holy grail of Black Sabbath | accessdate = 7 September 2013 | last = Black | first = Johnny | date = 14 March 2009 | publisher = Music Week | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120305025601/http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=2&storycode=1037239 | archivedate = 5 March 2012[/tpl] Aside from the bells, thunder, and rain sound effects added to the beginning of the album's opening track, there were virtually no overdubs added to the album. Iommi recalls recording live: "We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff."[tpl]Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=38[/tpl]
Iommi began recording the album with a white Fender Stratocaster, his guitar of choice at the time. A malfunctioning pickup forced him to finish recording with a Gibson SG, a new guitar he had recently purchased as a backup but had not played much yet. The SG was a right-handed model which he played upside down. Soon after recording the album, he met another guitarist who was playing a left-handed SG upside down, and the two agreed to swap guitars. Decades later, Iommi donated that original left-handed SG guitar to the Hard Rock Cafe.

==Music and lyrics==

According to Allmusic's Steve Huey, the album is "the birth of heavy metal as we now know it". Huey noted that the album "transcends its clear roots in blues-rock and psychedelia to become something more". The songs on the album's first half feature simple blues licks by Iommi and deal with themes characteristic of heavy metal, including evil, paganism, and the occult. Most of the second half has blues-rock jamming. Former Metal Maniacs magazine editor Jeff Wagner credited the album for making a distinction between rock and roll and heavy metal. He said that the album transfigured blues rock into "something uglier, found deeper gravity via mournful singing and a sinister rhythmic pulse".[tpl]cite book|last=Wagner|first=Jeff|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&pg=PA10|accessdate=25 June 2013|title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal|publisher=Bazillion Points Books|page=10|year=2010|isbn=0979616336[/tpl] Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno observed that Black Sabbath combined elements of rock, jazz and blues, with heavy distortion to create one of the most influential albums in metal history.
Musically and lyrically the album was considered quite "dark" for the time. The first song on the album is based almost entirely on a tritone interval played at slow tempo on the electric guitar.[tpl]Harvnb|Iommi & Lammers|2012|chapter 14 - The early birds catch the first songs[/tpl] The song's lyrics concern a "figure in black" which bass player Geezer Butler claims to have seen after waking up from a nightmare.
Similarly, the lyrics of the song "N.I.B." are written from the point of view of Lucifer. Contrary to popular belief, the name of that song is not an abbreviation for "Nativity in Black". Osbourne said in his autobiography that it is merely a reference to drummer Bill Ward's pointed goatee at the time, which was shaped as a pen-nib.[tpl]Harvnb|Osbourne|2010|p=99[/tpl] The lyrics of two other songs on the album were written about stories with themes from myth. "Behind the Wall of Sleep" is a reference to the H. P. Lovecraft short story Beyond the Wall of Sleep, while "The Wizard" was inspired by the character of Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.metalsludge.tv/?p=27412 | title = 20 Questions with Geezer Butler | accessdate = 7 September 2013 | last = Neeley | first = Wendell | date = 26 April 2005 | publisher = Metal Sludge[/tpl] The latter includes harmonica performed by vocalist Ozzy Osbourne.

==Artwork==

The album cover features a depiction of Mapledurham Watermill, situated on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England. Standing in front of the watermill is a figure dressed in black.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cope|first=Andrew L.|title=Black Sabbath and the rise of heavy metal music|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AfdTGdVhp7AC&pg=PA34|accessdate=26 October 2010|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6881-7|page=34|ref=harv[/tpl] The name of the woman pictured on the front cover is forgotten, though guitarist Iommi says that she once showed up backstage at a Black Sabbath show and introduced herself.
On the original release, the inner gatefold sleeve featured an inverted cross with a poem written inside of it.Black Sabbath at Black Sabbath Online Allegedly, the band were upset when they discovered this, as it fuelled allegations that they were Satanists or Occultists; however, in Osbourne's recent biography I Am Ozzy he says that to the best of his knowledge nobody was upset with the inclusion.[tpl]Harvnb|Osbourne|2010|p=103[/tpl] The album was not packaged with a gatefold cover in the US.

==Release==

The album was recorded for Fontana Records, but prior to release the record company elected to switch the band to another of their labels, Vertigo Records, which housed the company's more progressive acts.[tpl]Harvnb|Iommi & Lammers|2012|chapter 17 - Now under new management[/tpl] Released on Friday the 13th February 1970 by Vertigo Records, Black Sabbath reached number eight on the UK Album Chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search-results-album/_/Black+Sabbath#album|title=The Official Charts Company - Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath Search |date=17 September 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company[/tpl] Following its US release in June 1970 by Warner Bros.

==Critical reception==

Black Sabbath received negative reviews from contemporary music critics.[tpl]cite book|last=McIver|first=Joel|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xZvnIUXk8uwC&pg=PT119#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=21 May 2013|title=Black Sabbath: Sabbath Bloody Sabbath|publisher=Music Sales Group|page=119|isbn=085712028X|authorlink=Joel McIver[/tpl] In a review for Rolling Stone magazine, Lester Bangs said that the band was "just like Cream! But worse." He dismissed the album as "a shuck—despite the murky songtitles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/black-sabbath-19700917|title=Album reviews Black Sabbath|last=Bangs|first=Lester|authorlink=Lester Bangs|date=17 September 1970|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|accessdate=6 September 2009[/tpl] Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, panned the album as "bullshit necromancy" and gave it an "E" grade. He later gave it a "C–" and said that the album reflected "the worst of the counterculture ... bullshit necromancy, drug-impaired reaction time, long solos, everything."[tpl]cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=6408|title=Consumer Guide Album|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=24 February 2013|at=Archived from Christgau's 1990 book Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide[/tpl]
With the passage of time, reviews have become more positive.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that "Sabbath's slowed-down, murky guitar rock bludgeons the listener in an almost hallucinatory fashion, reveling in its own dazed, druggy state of consciousness", commenting that the album featured "plenty of metal classics". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic felt that "both fans of blues influenced hard rock and heavy metal of all sorts should find something they like on the album". BBC Music's Pete Marsh referred to Black Sabbath as an "album that changed the face of rock music".[tpl]cite web|last=Marsh|first=Pete|title=Black Sabbath: Black Sabbath Review|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/r3gb|publisher=BBC Music|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl]
