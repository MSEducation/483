 '''Johnstone Burgh''' are a Scottish [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Johnstone]], [[Renfrewshire]], and play in [[Scottish Junior Football Central Division One|Central Division One]] of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]], West Region.
The club were formed in 1956, in response to an article in the "Johnstone & Linwood Gazette" newspaper from a journalist that had been ordered out of the newspaper's office on the corner of Johnstone's Rankine Street by the office manager with instructions not to return until he had a story. The journalist proceeded to ask locals what they thought about forming a new football club to replace the former Scottish league side Johnstone.
Since their foundation, "The Burgh," have been based at James Y. Keanie Park (named after the builder who donated the land The club was built upon), but have much-delayed plans afoot to relocate within the next couple of years to a new ground at the more central Thomas Shanks Memorial Park less than one mile away, built in conjunction with the local council: the perpetually poor drainage at Keanie Park resulting in the regular postponement of home fixtures during the winter months has been a severe financial drain on the side.
Their most successful period was in the late fifties and sixties when they twice won junior footballs top prize - the Scottish Junior Cup.  Probably their most successful manager was Jimmy Blackburn who led them to both their Scottish Cup wins as well as West of Scotland Cup and Central League Championship wins.  One of our local lads, Bobby Dick, who hails from Elderslie, played what was then right half for the Burgh, and can boast two Scottish Cup winners medals as well as a number of other winners medals.  In those days the cup final was played at Hampden Park, which made it a day to remember.   In later years Bobby's nephew Alan Donohoe played in goal for the Burgh and was involved in their cup final of 2000.
The 1968-1969 season was Johnstone Burgh's most successful season. They won the Scottish Junior Cup, beating Glenrothes 2-1 in extra time after a 2-2 draw at Hampden in the first match. Hugh Gilshan scored the winner. The team also won the First division Championship and the Evening Times Trophy that season. 
Johnstone Burgh have a home support of around 100–150, though this tends to increase vastly when the team is doing well. An OVD Cup tie between Johnstone Burgh and Glenafton Athletic in February 2000 attracted a crowd of over 2000. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] 
In the 2000 Scottish Junior Cup Final against Whitburn, goals by Colin Lindsay, who later had a spell as manager, and John McLay took the game to penalties after a 2–2 draw. Johnstone Burgh won on penalties in their semi-final at Love Street, but failed to repeat this success in the final.
Johnstone Burgh play in red tops, white shorts and red socks. The current manager of the team is George Walker, the assistant manager is Eddie McKim. Ex players David Brolly & Alan Donohoe are also part of the coaching staff.
