==In scriptures==

In Hinduism 's many scripts have many religious stories about "Kalava" In the Mahabharata, Kunti tied a Kalava on right hand of Abhimanyu before his last day of war for divine protection. He was not defeated by many warriors as long as he wore the "Kalava" on his right hand. Lord Krishna wanted his death, as Kunti was evil in his previous life. Krishna thus sent a mouse to cut his Kalava and soon after, Abhimanyu was killed.
Another legend has it that Lord Vishnu during his incarnation as Vamana tied a red thread on the hands of King Bali to grant him immortality and to rule the netherworld.
