[[Line C (Rome Metro)]]

CATEGORIES: Rome Metro lines, Proposed public transport in Italy

Line C is the future third line of the metro system of Rome, Italy. It will be the first fully automated line in the city. The line is currently under construction. The line reuses part of the old Rome-Pantano railway, a light railroad that is the last remaining part of the old Rome-Fiuggi railway.

==Construction==

From August 2006 onwards archeological investigations took place before construction could start. The first construction sites opened in March 2007, on Piazza Roberto Malatesta, to construct Malatesta station. Lodi station followed one month later.http://www.romametropolitane.it/Notiziario%20Cantieri/master%20Linea%20C.pdf Current situation of construction works. [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
In May 2008 two Tunnel Boring Machines were set up at Giardinetti,http://www.metrocspa.it/diario_del_cantiere.asp Constructor's website [tpl]it icon[/tpl] and two months later the old Rome-Pantano railway was truncated at Giardinetti to allow restructuring part of the old surface line, which will form part of the new metro. This stretch, from (Pantano-Centocelle) to piazza Lodi, will open in 2014. http://www.metroxroma.it/2013/09/linea-c-i-dettagli-dellaccordo-date-penali-prolungamenti/ [tpl]it icon[/tpl] The part of the line that crosses the city centre, from Venezia up to Clodio-Mazzini, is currently in its planning stages.
In 2009, during the excavations in Piazza Venezia (near the Capitoline Hill) remains of what has been identified as emperor Hadrian's Athenaeum were found.
Works on the different sections of Line C are supposed to be finished according to the following schedule:http://www.metroxroma.it/2013/10/tratta-t3-avanti-tutta-fermarsi-costerebbe-180-mln/ [tpl]it icon[/tpl]

==Route==

The route is about [tpl]convert|25.5|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] long and has 30 stations. Of the whole course [tpl]convert|17.6|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] are underground, and the rest is in the open air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.romametropolitane.it/articolo.asp?CodMenu=1&CodArt=23|title=I numeri della metro|publisher=Metropolitana di Roma|accessdate=2012-09-27|language=Italian[/tpl]
Originally the two planned termini were Pantano (a frazione of the comune of Monte Compatri) in the east and Clodio-Mazzini in the north, but in March 2007, a northward extension along the Via Cassia was announced, with nine more stations up to Grottarossa. A depot has been built at Graniti. The line will cross Line A at San Giovanni and at Ottaviano-San Pietro-Musei Vaticani, and Line B at Colosseo. At Pigneto an interchange will be built with a new railway station on the FR1. At the Colosseo stop a public museum was to be constructed in the station to display archaeological material that was excavated during construction, but the project has been scrapped due to the lack of funds.http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/05/18/metro-niente-museo-alla-stazione-colosseo.rm_017.html 
The original plan featured a station, at Largo di Torre Argentina, in the city center. However, archaeological remains on the site were even more extensive than expected, and the station was cancelled.http://www.metrocspa.it/il-percorso.asp
