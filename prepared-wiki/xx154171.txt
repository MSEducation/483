[[Peep Show (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2000 albums, Goudie albums

Peep Show is the debut album by Goudie. It was recorded at Brooklyn Bridge Studio in Austin, Texas. The song Julia is a collaboration between Johnny Goudie and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's. The song When Will You Be Mine features vocals by Aimee Mann. The album was recorded twice. The initial sessions took place in Los Angeles and featured Lars Ulrich playing drums on "When Will You Be Mine." The band was not satisfied with the result of the Los Angeles sessions, considering the album too glossy and not edgy enough. They returned home to Austin, Texas where they recorded the version of the album that would be released.
