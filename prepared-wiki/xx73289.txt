Wessex 60 of Bristow Helicopters at North Denes airfield, Norfolk, in 1970 during support flights to the growing North Sea Oil industry]] 
A civilian version of the helicopter, the Wessex 60, was also manufactured and supplied to a number of civilian operators, including Bristow Helicopters, one of the biggest rotary-wing operators in the world.Harrison, Neil. "World's Biggest VTOL Carrier." Flight International, 1 May 1969, p. 725. Bristows flew them from various UK airfields and helicopter pads to support the growing North Sea Oil industry until they were withdrawn in 1982.

In April 1961, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) announced that they had selected the Westland Wessex to become the standard service helicopter from their ships and its intention to purchase roughly 30 for anti-submarine patrols, casualty evacuations, and fleet communications duties."Navy Chooses U.K. Helicopters." The Age, 21 April 1961. p. 5. The RAN formally accepted the first two of 27 Wessex helicopters in September 1963;"Helicopters for the Navy." The Age, 13 September 1963. p. 4. 817 Squadron was the first to operate the type; the Wessex and its dunking sonar array quickly proved to be the most effective anti-submarine platform as yet seen in the RAN."Navy forms Squadron of Helicopters." The Age, 13 June 1963. p. 6."817 Squadron History." navy.gov.au, Retrieved: 15 February 2014.
The Wessex was a major operational shift for the Fleet Air Arm, enabling the RAN to proceed with the conversion of the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne as an anti-submarine platform.Grey 2008, p. 229. In typical carrier operations, a Wessex would be deployed during the launch and recovery of fixed-wing aircraft as a guard helicopter; during anti-submarine patrols, routine procedure was to have one Wessex airborne to actively screen the ship while a second would be fully armed and prepared for operations, such an arrangement was used during troop transport deployments to Vietnam during the 1960s. Performing Search and Rescue sorties became another valued role of the type; in 1974, multiple Wessex helicopters participated in the relief effort in Darwin in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy.
While the Wessex proved to be too large to reasonably operate from most of the RAN's destroyers, it was found to be well suited as a troop-transport helicopter from heavy landing ships and larger vessels."723 Squadron History." navy.gov.au, Retrieved: 15 February 2014. By 1980, the Wessex was no longer being used for anti-submarine operations, having been replaced by the more advanced and capable Westland Sea King in this capacity, instead remaining Wessex helicopters were retained to perform its secondary roles as a plane guard, search and rescue platform, and as a utility transport helicopter."Helicopters: Demanding common role required." Sydney Morning Herald, 14 October 1980. p. 6.
