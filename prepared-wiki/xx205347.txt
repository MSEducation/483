==History==

===1665–1837===

The congregation was founded in 1665 despite a Massachusetts law prohibiting opposition to infant baptism. Many of the early members of the church were persecuted  and imprisoned by the state church for heresy, including the first pastor, Thomas Gould. Shortly before the founding of the church, the first Harvard College president, Henry Dunster, was forced to resign his position for refusing to baptize his infant. Dunster had been theologically influenced by Dr. John Clarke and other Rhode Island Baptists persecuted in Massachusetts.http://www.firstbaptistchurchofboston.org/history/history.html During King Philip's War, John Myles pastored the church while on hiatus from the First Baptist Church in Swansea, which was the first church in the state. "In 1679, the Boston Baptists built a meetinghouse in the North End of Boston, at the corner of Salem and Stillman Streets. ...In the early 1700s, the small building was replaced by a larger wooden one on the same site. Here the Church flourished, for 43 years (1764–1807) under the leadership of Samuel Stillman."

===1837–1882===

In 1837 the First Baptist congregation moved into a new brick church building (fourth meeting house) on the corner of Hanover Street and Union Street.

===1882–present===

The current church building (fifth meeting house) was constructed in 1872 by Henry Hobson Richardson. It opened in 1875 to serve the Unitarian congregation of the Brattle Street Church, also known as the Church in Brattle Square, which had been demolished in 1872.[tpl]cite journal|last=Detwiller|first=Frederic C.|date=Winter–Spring 1979|title=Thomas Dawes's Church in Brattle Square|journal=Old-Time New England|publisher=Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities|location=Boston|volume=69|issue=255|url=http://www.historicnewengland.org/resources/articles/pdf246.pdf[/tpl] The Unitarian congregation dissolved in 1876 soon after moving to this building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:DIV.LIB:div00001|title=Church in Brattle Square (Boston, Mass.)

Featuring ivy-covered walls and a prominent tower with distinctive carvings by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (sculptor of the Statue of Liberty) representing four sacraments, with faces of famous Bostonians (including Longfellow and Hawthorne), Abraham Lincoln, and Bartholdi's friends of that era, (including 'Garabaldi'). This building highlights many of the Richardsonian Romanesque qualities that would later be shown in the nearby Trinity Church, one of Richardson's masterpieces.  The Baptist Church's tower can clearly be seen as part of Boston's skyline when viewed from the Cambridge side of the Charles river. This church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The congregation is currently affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA.
