Madura is a small roadhouse community located on the Eyre Highway in Western Australia, on the Nullarbor Plain. It is [tpl]convert|1253|km|mi|0[/tpl] from Perth.

==History==

Madura was settled in 1876 as a place to breed quality cavalry horses for the British Indian Army for use in the Northwest Frontier region of India (now part of Pakistan). The horses were shipped from the coast at Eucla. (Cervantes, north of Perth, was also used for breeding.) The site was chosen as it was one of the few with free flowing bore water in the area.
The surrounding area is part of Madura Station currently a sheep station, but was previously used to graze cattle, horses and camels.

==Present day==

Like other locations in the Nullarbor Plain area, the area consists of little more than a roadhouse, open 6:30am to 8:30pm each day. 2 km west of Madura is a scenic lookout with sweeping views of the Madura Pass across the escarpment and the Roe Plains. Natural blowholes may also be found nearby. The area is used for pastoral purposes, mainly sheep rearing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Western-Australia/Madura/2005/02/17/1108500208266.html|title=Travel - Madura|author=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2006-10-17 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=8 February 2004[/tpl] Surrounding Madura is the Madura Shelf stretching 265 600 square kilometres of predominately sedimentary rock, part of the Bight Basin[tpl]cite web |url=http://webmap.ga.gov.au/provexplorer/provinceDetails.do?eno=27361 |title=Madura Shelf |author=Bradshaw, B.E. & Pepper, M.R. |year=2003 |publisher=Geoscience Australia |accessdate=7 November 2009 [/tpl] which has been found to contain crude oil and geothermal gradients.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/26930/prospectivity_polda.pdf |title=Polda Basin - Petroleum and Geothermal in South Australia |author= |date=2005–2008 |publisher=Primary Industries and Resources SA |accessdate=7 November 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/sa_bight.jsp |title=Bight Basin |year=2009 |publisher=Geoscience Australia |accessdate=7 November 2009 [/tpl]
