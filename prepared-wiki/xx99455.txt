The 1st Marine Division fired a total of 5,685 high-explosive 155mm artillery rounds during the battle.http://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/ocn744863322 The 3rd Marine Air Wing (aviation assets only) expended 318 precision bombs, 391 rockets and missiles, and 93,000 machine gun and cannon rounds.
Fallujah suffered extensive damage to residences, mosques, city services, and businesses. The city, once referred to as the "City of Mosques", had over 200 pre-battle mosques of which 60 or so were destroyed in the fighting. Many of these mosques had been used as arms caches and weapon strongpoints by Islamist forces. Of the roughly 50,000 buildings in Fallujah, between 7,000 and 10,000 were estimated to have been destroyed in the offensive and from half to two-thirds of the remaining buildings had notable damage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7503610/ |title=Still locked down, Fallujah slow to rebuild |publisher=MSNBC |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64292-2005Apr18.html |title=Increased Security In Fallujah Slows Efforts to Rebuild |work=The Washington Post  |date=19 April 2005 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]
While pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable, the nominal population was assumed to have been 200,000–350,000. One report claims that both offensives, Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury, created 200,000 internally displaced persons who are still living elsewhere in Iraq.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2049355,00.html |title=The legacy of Fallujah |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 May 2011 |first=Jonathan |last=Holmes |date=4 April 2007[/tpl] While damage to mosques was heavy, coalition forces reported that 66 out of the city's 133 mosques had been found to be holding significant amounts of insurgent weaponry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20041203entire.ppt|title=Telling the Fallujah Story to the World|publisher=IMEF and MNCI Effects Exploitation Team|date=3 December 2004|accessdate=28 December 2008|format=PPT[/tpl]
In mid-December, residents were allowed to return after undergoing biometric identification, provided they wear their ID cards all the time. Reconstruction progressed slowly and mainly consisted of clearing rubble from heavily-damaged areas and reestablishing basic utilities. Only 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January, and only 30% as of the end of March 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-31-voa6.cfm |title=Fallujah Four Months Later |publisher=Voice of America |date=31 March 2005 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]
Nevertheless the battle proved to be less than the decisive engagement that the U.S. military had hoped for. Some of the nonlocal insurgents were believed to have fled before the military assault along with Zarqawi, leaving mostly local militants behind. Subsequent U.S. military operations against insurgent positions were ineffective at drawing out insurgents into another open battle, and by September 2006 the situation had deteriorated to the point that the Al-Anbar province that contained Fallujah was reported to be in total insurgent control by the U.S. Marine Corps, with the exception of only pacified Fallujah, but now with an insurgent-plagued Ramadi..Situation Called Dire in West IraqUS lost control of al-Anbar province[tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl]
After the U.S. military operation of November 2004, the number of insurgent attacks gradually increased in and around the city, and although news reports were often few and far between, several reports of IED attacks on Iraqi troops were reported in the press. Most notable of these attacks was a suicide car bomb attack on 23 June 2005 on a convoy that killed 6 Marines. Thirteen other Marines were injured in the attack. However, fourteen months later insurgents were again able to operate in large numbers.
A third push was mounted from September 2006 and lasting until mid-January 2007. Tactics developed in what has been called the "Third Battle of Fallujah," when applied on a larger scale in Ramadi and the surrounding area led to what became known as "the Great Sunni Awakening." After four years of bitter fighting, Fallujah was turned over to the Iraqi Forces and Iraqi Provincial Authority during the Fall of 2007.
Al Qaeda-linked Sunni insurgents from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant subsequently took over Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in late 2013."Top Iraqi commander vows to re-capture Fallujah and Ramadi after al-Qa'ida-linked fighters take control of key cities", The Independent, 5 January 2014

==Use of white phosphorus==

On 10 November 2004, the Washington Post reported that some U.S. artillery guns fired white phosphorus rounds that created a screen of fire.[tpl]cite news|last=Spinner|first=Jackie|title=U.S. Forces Battle Into Heart of Fallujah|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35979-2004Nov9_2.html|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 November 2004[/tpl]  Insurgents reported being attacked with a substance that melted their skin, a reaction consistent with white phosphorus burns.  On 26 November 2004, Dahr Jamail also reported that white phosphorus had been used in the battle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dahrjamailiraq.com/hard_news/archives/iraq/000137.php |title=Dahr Jamail's Mideast Dispatches – |publisher=Dahrjamailiraq.com |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
On 9 November 2005 the Italian state-run broadcaster Radiotelevisione Italiana S.p.A. aired a documentary titled "Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre", alleging that the United States' used white phosphorus as a weapon in Fallujah causing insurgents and civilians to be killed or injured by chemical burns.  The filmmakers further claimed that the United States used incendiary MK-77 bombs in violation of Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.  According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, quoted in the documentary, white phosphorus is permitted for use as an illumination device and as a weapon with regard to heat energy, but not permitted as an offensive weapon with regard to its toxic chemical properties.OPCW agrees with US Military that use of white phosphorus as incendiary agent is not prohibited[tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl]
On 16 November 2005, BBC News reported that an article published in the March–April 2005 issue of Field Artillery, a U.S. Army magazine, noted that white phosphorus had been used during the battle.  According to the article written by a captain, a first lieutenant, and a sergeant, "WP Phosphorus proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes where we could not get effects on them with HE Explosives. We fired "shake and bake" missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out."[tpl]cite news|last=Reynolds |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4442988.stm |title=OPCW Spokesman Peter Kaiser elucidates the OPCW position on white phosphorus |publisher=BBC News  |date=16 November 2005 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]  BBC News noted that the article had been discovered by bloggers after the US ambassador in London, Robert Holmes Tuttle, stated that US forces do not use napalm or white phosphorus as weapons.  The United States continues to maintain that white phosphorus was not used against civilians, but has since confirmed its use as an offensive heat weapon against enemy combatants.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/11/16/phosphorus-fallujah051116.html |title=U.S. official admits phosphorus used as weapon in Iraq |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=16 November 2005 |accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl]
