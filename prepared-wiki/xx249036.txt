Skills Like This screened worldwide on the film festival circuit prior to its American theatrical release by Shadow Distribution in 2009. The film received positive reviews from publications ranging from The New York Times and Variety  to Salon.com. In her review for The New York Times, Jeanette Catsoulis wrote, "the offbeat chemistry of the cast, along with Monty Miranda's eye-catching direction...make all the difference... Drawing much of its energy from an eclectic and fully integrated soundtrack, "Skills Like This" gazes indulgently on 20-something aimlessness and the comfort of assigned roles. In Mr. Miranda's hands sloth can be more appealing than you might think."[tpl]cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20skil.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | accessdate=May 23, 2010| title=20-something Sloth and Larceny | date=March 20, 2009[/tpl] Variety further stated that the main characters of Skills Like This showed "considerable intelligence and chemistry"[tpl]cn|date=October 2012[/tpl] in addition to calling the film "deftly directed"[tpl]cn|date=October 2012[/tpl]  and from Salon Andrew O'Heir reviewed Skills Like This as "Cheerfully anarchic ... indescribably genuine."[tpl]cn|date=October 2012[/tpl]  New Video Group, reviewing the DVD, said the film "bristles with rock'n'roll energy—underscored by the sounds of Denver's music scene".[tpl]cn|date=October 2012[/tpl] The film screened in theatrical release for four months.
