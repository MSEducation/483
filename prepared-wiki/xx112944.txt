HMS ''Toronto'' was a schooner of the Royal Navy, built by John Dennis (not the Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada)) at Humber River and Bloor Street in Toronto in August 1799. Armed with four cannons, the ship was built to ferry government officials from York (Toronto) to Upper Canada's former capital of Newark (Niagara on the Lake). The ship's career was short, she was wrecked in 1811 off Hanlan's Point and was broken up.
