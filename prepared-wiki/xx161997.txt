Theological College is a national Roman Catholic diocesan seminary located in Washington, D.C. Affiliated with The Catholic University of America, the seminary is owned and administered by priests of the Society of Saint-Sulpice. It was founded in 1917.
Theological College is located near the campus of Catholic University, across from the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, and next to Capuchin College and the Dominican House of Studies.

==History==

In 1889, priests belonging to the Society of Saint Sulpice were asked to administer the divinity college of the Catholic University of America. In 1917, they began building their own seminary next to the university. The Sulpician Seminary was first run as an extension of Saint Mary Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, but became an independent institution in 1924. In 1940, the Catholic University school of theology assumed responsibility for training its seminarians, whereupon the seminary was renamed Theological College.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.theologicalcollege.org/published/about_us/mission_and_history.html#!history-of-tc/c16ok | title = Mission and History | publisher = Theological College | accessdate = February 3, 2012[/tpl]

==Academic programs==

The Order of Saint-Sulpice focuses on training priests through its seminaries. To that end, the Theological College provides priestly formation through three separate academic programs: a two-year certified pre-theology program; a theology program; and the Basselin scholars program for undergraduate-level seminarians. The latter program, named in honor of Theodore B. Basselin, is administered by the Catholic University school of philosophy.
The seminary educates and forms seminarians from the following dioceses: Arlington, Baltimore, Beaumont, Camden, Chifeng (China), Dallas, Fort Worth, Hartford, Helena, Ia≈üi (Romania), Jefferson City, Lafayette, Little Rock, Louisville, Lubbock, Madison, Nanterre (France), New York, Pittsburgh, Portland, Rapid City, Richmond, Rochester, Rockville Centre, San Francisco, Savannah, Seattle, Spokane, Syracuse, Washington, Wheeling-Charleston, Worcester, and Xi'an (China).[tpl]cite web | url = http://theologicalcollege.org/published/about_us/sending_dioceses.html | title = Sending Dioceses | publisher = Theological College | accessdate = February 3, 2012[/tpl]
