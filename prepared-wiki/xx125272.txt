Hejazi Arabic ([tpl]lang-ar|حجازي[/tpl] ḥijāzī), also known as West Arabian Arabic, is a dialect of the Arabic language spoken in the Hejaz region in Saudi Arabia. Although, strictly speaking, there are two distinct dialects spoken in the Hejaz region, one by the bedouin rural population, and another by the urban population, the term most often applies to the urban variety, spoken in cities such as Jeddah, Mecca, Yanbu, and Medina. 
Urban Hejazi appears to be most closely related to the Arabic dialects of Northern Sudan and Upper Egypt (Ingham 1971). Hejazi Arabic has many close similarities to Egyptian Arabic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001[/tpl] Hejazi Arabic dialect is also spoken by Rashaida in Eritrea and Sudan. Hejazi Arabic is used for daily communications and has no official status, instead, Modern Standard Arabic is used in official purposes, especially Eritrea where Arabic is not the lingua franca. 

==Urban Hijazi Dialect==

Also referred to as the sedentary Hijazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term "Hijazi Arabic", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Makkah, and Medina.  With respect to the axis of bedouin versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

===Sedentary Features===

Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties and has therefore shed many Classical forms and features that are still present in many bedouin dialects. These include the internal passive form (which in Hejazi, is replaced by the pattern anfa'al"/"yinfa'il), the marker for indefiniteness (tanwin), gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker -n (see Varieties of Arabic). Features that mark Hejazi Arabic as a sedentary dialect include:

Other features of Hejazi Arabic are:

===Vocabulary===

The urban Hejazi vocabulary differs in some respect from that of other dialects in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, there are fewer specialized terms related to desert life, and more terms related to seafaring and fishing.  Due to the diverse origins of the inhabitants of Hijazi cities, many borrowings from the dialects of Egypt, Syria, and Yemen exist. Five centuries of Turkish rule have also had their influence. Due to this, the Hijazi dialect is considered to be of "mixed affinities" (Ingham 1971).
Certain distinctive particles and vocabulary in Hijazi are [tpl]IPA|/ɡiːd/[/tpl] "already", [tpl]IPA|/daħħin/[/tpl] "now", and [tpl]IPA|/lessa/[/tpl] "not yet".

==Bedouin Hejazi Dialect==

The varieties of Arabic spoken by the bedouin tribes of the Hejaz region are relatively under-studied. However, the speech of some tribes shows much closer affinity to other bedouin dialects, particularly those of neighboring Nejd, than to those of the Hejazi cities.  The dialects of northern Hejazi tribes  merge into those of Jordan and Sinai, while the dialects in the south  merge with those of 'Asir and Nejd.  It is also worth noting that many large tribal confederations in Nejd and eastern Arabia are recent migrants from the Hejaz, including the tribes of Utaybah, Mutayr, Harb, and Bani Khalid.  In earlier times, many other Arab tribes also came from the Hejaz, including Kinanah, Juhayna, Banu Sulaym, and Ghatafan. Also, not all speakers of these bedouin dialects are literally nomadic bedouins; some are simply sedentary sections that live in rural areas, and thus speak dialects similar to those of their bedouin neighbors.
