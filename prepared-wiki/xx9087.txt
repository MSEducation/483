==Characteristics==

Bands associated with nu metal have derived influence from a variety of diverse styles, including electronic music, funk, glam metal, gothic rock, hardcore punk, hip hop, New Wave music, industrial metal, jazz, post-punk, symphonic rock and synthpop.[tpl]cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |pages=12–13 |chapter=How is nu-metal different from old metal?

Nu metal music is largely syncopated and based on guitar riffs. Mid-song bridges and a general lack of guitar solos contrasts it with other genres that are part of heavy metal, in which guitar solos play a major role. Another contrast with other metal genres is its emphasis on rhythm, rather than complexity or mood, tending towards groove metal in rhythm. Nu metal bassists and drummers often draw influence from funk and hip hop break beats, respectively, helping add to the rhythmic nature of the genre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Rock_File_British_Christian_NuMetal/7793/p1/ |title=Rock File: British Christian Nu-Metal |author= |date= 23 June 2003|work= |publisher=Cross Rhythms |accessdate=30 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Joel McIver|authorlink=Joel McIver|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tFDPx8IDKsoC&pg=PA42|accessdate=30 January 2014|year=2008|publisher=Outline Press, Limited|isbn=978-1-906002-20-6|page=42[/tpl] Similarities with many heavy metal sub-genres include its use of common time, distorted guitars, power chords and note structures primarily revolving around Dorian, Aeolian or Phrygian modes. thumb|right|Nu metal band Slipknot, who are known for their use of costumes and masks, performing in Buenos Aires in 2005
Many nu metal bands use seven-string guitars (which are sometimes downtuned[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lang_de&id=e_r67h7Z-cYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA4&dq=%22nu+metal%22+subgenre&ots=AXzU4gK-bm&sig=7Ky95ibRKLW1obvEdKhKnIXvD8c#v=onepage&q=nu%20metal&f=false|title=Ozzfest |last=Robinson |first=Greg |page=10 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=1-4042-1756-8 |page=48 |year=2008[/tpl] to increase heaviness) over traditional six-string guitars. This results in bass guitarists using five-string and six string instruments. DJs are also sometimes used for additional rhythmic instrumentation such as music sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds.
Nu metal is also sometimes noted for participation of women in the genre in contrast to some other metal genres,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JRIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22nu+metal%22+%22women%22&source=bl&ots=IgodFxcTZa&sig=7_D8emWH_x4p9XwZEl1qwbytJvY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oJcnUJ3rIqXYigeMyoCoAQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22nu%20metal%22%20%22women%22&f=false |title=Branded Female |work=Billboard |date=2001-12-01 |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] including bands such as Coal Chamber,DEZ FAFARA says COAL CHAMBER Is 'Not Even Discussing' Any Other Tours After SOUNDWAVE Blabbermouth.net.

Nu metal vocal styles range between singing, rapping, screaming and death growling, sometimes using multiple of these styles within one song. The lyrics of many nu metal bands focus on pain and personal alienation, similar to that of grunge,[tpl]cite book|last=Joel|first=Mclver|title=The Bloody Reign of Slayer|year=2008|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1849383863[/tpl] rather than the themes of other metal subgenres. Nu metal uses the traditional pop structure of verses, choruses and bridges, contrasting it with other metal genres such as thrash and death metal.Buts, Jeroen. "5.1". The Thematical and Stylistic Evolution of Heavy Metal Lyrics and Imagery From the 70s to Present Day. p. 80. "Also, the genre combined a low tuned guitar sound and many other thrash, industrial and death metal traits within a structure which was much more traditional and akin to Pop music (e.g. intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro)."
Trevor Baker of The Guardian wrote "Bands such as Linkin Park, Korn and even the much reviled Limp Bizkit also, incidentally, did far more to break down the artificial barriers between "urban music" and rock than any of their more critically acceptable counterparts. Their concerts also drew huge numbers of women which is much more than you could say for any old-metal band."Why it's worth celebrating nu-metal's anniversary www.guardian.co.uk.

==History==

===Early development (early-mid 1990s)===

The origins of the term are often attributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson, sometimes called "The Godfather of Nu Metal". Many of the first nu metal bands came from California,[tpl]cite book | last = Iannini | first = Tommaso | title = Nu Metal | publisher = Giunti | year = 2003 | isbn = 88-09-03051-6 | page = 11 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ILAzJcugjDsC&pg=PA130&dq=rage+against+the+machine+nu+metal&lr=&cd=30#v=onepage&q=california&f=false[/tpl] like Korn, which pioneered the nu metal sound with the release of their demo album in 1993,[tpl]cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |pages=10; 12 |chapter=How did we get to nu-metal from old metal? [/tpl] and Deftones. Other influential bands are Staind from Massachusetts, Limp Bizkit from Florida,Grierson, Tim. "Alternative Metal - What Is Alternative Metal - Alt-Metal History". About.com. The New York Times Company. Retrieved January 8, 2012. and Slipknot from Iowa. The aggressive riffs of Korn, the rapping of Limp Bizkit, and the acoustic ballads of Staind created the sonic template for nu metal.
In 1994, Korn's debut single "Blind"'s music video received airplay on MTV, exposing nu metal to a wider audience in a time when grunge dominated. Nu metal continued to achieve recognition through MTV and Ozzy Osbourne's 1995 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.Christie, p. 324 Ozzfest was integral to launching the careers of several nu metal bands, including Limp Bizkit in 1998.Christie, p. 326 The band only had experienced moderate fame, as their debut album peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200. 

===Mainstream popularity (late 1990s and early 2000s)===

In 1997, nu metal was beginning to rise in popularity when Korn released their single, "A.D.I.D.A.S." off their album Life is Peachy. Life is Peachy peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200 while the song A.D.I.D.A.S peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles.[tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=korn|chart=Hot 100[/tpl] | title=Korn – Chart History: Hot 100 | work=Billboard | publisher=Prometheus Global Media | accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl]

===Decline in popularity (mid-late 2000s)===

Regarding his band's decline in popularity, Fred Durst said "Here's the deal: say in 2000, there were 35 million people who connected to this band. Twelve years later, lots of those people have moved on. We were a moment in time and it's over."The Day Nu metal Officially Died Pedestrian TV.
Many nu metal bands experimented with other genres and sounds. While Deftones and P.O.D retained several of their nu metal traits, they had overall moved on to a more alternative metal style, with their subsequent releases having eliminated rapping in almost all of their songs. Linkin Park's third studio album Minutes to Midnight, released in 2007, was noted for its complete departure from the band's signature nu metal sound.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/788/788496p1.html |title=Linkin Park - Minutes To Midnight - IGN |publisher=Music.ign.com |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2012-08-27[/tpl] Other nu metal bands such as Disturbed,Disturbed Guitarist: Don't Call us 'Nu metal' Blabbermouth.net.Mudvayne,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r734570|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Lost and Found - Mudvayne|publisher=Allmusic[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/mudvayne-lostandfound|title=Mudvayne: Lost and Found|publisher=PopMatters|first=Adrien|last=Begrand|date=2005-07-14|accessdate=2012-04-17[/tpl] Drowning Pool, and SlipknotAll Hope is Gone Review IGN. moved onto a more standard heavy metal sound, while others, such as Staind and Papa Roach went for more lighter sounds, such as post-grunge and hard rock.[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=staind-r2259573|tab=review|pure_url=yes[/tpl]Paa Roach - Allmusic However, Korn were still experiencing popularity for a very few more years, where they had many popular hits such "Coming Undone" and "Twisted Transistor" which both peaked on the Billboard Hot 100.

==Criticism==

Nu metal is often controversial amongst fans of other metal genres, and the genres detractors have labeled nu metal derogatory terms such as "mallcore", "whinecore", "grunge for the zeros" and "sports-rock".[tpl]cite book |last = Udo |first = Tommy |title = Brave Nu World |publisher = Sanctuary Publishing |year = 2002 |page = 16 |isbn = 1-86074-415-X[/tpl] 
Gregory Heaney of Allmusic has described the genre as "one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/koi-no-yokan-mw0002426695|title=Deftones - Koi No Yokan|publisher=Allmusic|author=Heaney, Gregory|accessdate=April 29, 2013[/tpl] Jonathan Davis, the frontman of the pioneering nu metal band Korn, was in an interview and said [tpl]cquote|There's a lot of closed-minded metal purists that would hate something because it's not true to metal or whatever, but Korn has never been a metal band, dude. We're not a metal band. We've always been looked at as what they called the nu-metal thing. But we've always been the black sheep and we never fitted into that kind of thing so … We're always ever evolving, and we always piss fans off and we're gaining other fans and it is how it is.[tpl]cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/korn-jonathan-davis-were-not-a-metal-band/ |title= Korn's Jonathan Davis: 'We're Not A Metal Band' |publisher=Loud Wire |accessdate=12/8/2012[/tpl][/tpl]
Some bands considered influential to nu metal have tried to distance themselves from the genre. Regarding his band's influence on nu metal, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton said "I feel no responsibility for that, it's their mothers' fault, not mine."[tpl]Cite news| last = Weatherford | first = Mike  | title = Mr. Bungle serving up pop music from Mars | newspaper =The Las Vegas Review-Journal| pages =32J | date =15 October 1999| url = | postscript =  [/tpl] While Helmet frontman Page Hamilton has stated "It's frustrating that people write us off because we're affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating nu-metal and rap metal or whatever the fuck it is, which we sound nothing like."[tpl]cite web|author=comments policy  155  comments posted |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/helmet_were_better_than_999_of_the_other_bands_out_there.html |title=Helmet: We're Better Than 99.9% Of The Other Bands Out There | News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26[/tpl] In response to reports that Fred Durst, lead singer of nu metal band Limp Bizkit is a big fan of his band, Tool's lead singer Maynard James Keenan said "If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, you appreciate the compliment, but you’re not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://rockdirt.com/maynard-not-impressed-with-durst-compliment/164/ |title=Maynard Not Impressed With Durst Compliment |publisher=rockdirt.com |date=2001-09-29 |accessdate=2013-02-26[/tpl] Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails has also criticized the genre, saying in an interview with Kerrang! magazine [tpl]cquote|When I'm asked what do I think of a lot of the nu-metal bands that are out there, my response is that it seems really insincere to me. I've had a really shitty childhood and I'm really upset and I'm really ugly and I've put a lot of make-up on and I'm harder and faster and my voice sounds more like the cookie monster's than yours does.

Deftones' frontman Chino Moreno began to criticize the genre, especially Korn's 2003 release Take a Look in the Mirror saying "As Korn go on, it's the same things — bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=13039 |title=KORN's JONATHAN DAVIS: 'CHINO MORENO Is Bitter And Pissed Off' - June 24, 2003 |publisher=Blabbermouth |date=24 June 2003 |accessdate=11 April 2013[/tpl] Korn's frontman Jonathan Davis responded to it in an interview saying  "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood. He's bitter and pissed off. I haven't talked to him because that's some straight fucked up shit that he said. When we first came out it was cool and we were homies. Then as we came up they became bitter because we were getting more attention or some shit. It's retarded how it got like that."  Moreno also has criticized Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=13497 |title=LIMP BIZKIT's FRED DURST Addresses CHINO MORENO's 'Shit-Talking' - July 11, 2003 |publisher=Blabbermouth |date=11 July 2003 |accessdate=11 April 2013[/tpl]
