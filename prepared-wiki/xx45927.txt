[[Pseudo-anglicism]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of English, Language histories, False friends

Pseudo-anglicisms are words in languages other than English which were borrowed from English but are used in a way native English speakers would not readily recognize or understand. Pseudo-anglicisms often take the form of compound words, combining elements of multiple English words to create a new word that appears to be English but is unrecognisable to a native speaker of English. It is also common for a genuine English word to be used to mean something completely different from its original meaning.
Pseudo-anglicisms are related to false friends or false cognates. Many speakers of a language which employs pseudo-anglicisms believe that the relevant words are genuine anglicisms and can be used in English, which may cause misunderstandings.
When many English words are incorporated into many languages, language enthusiasts and purists often look down on this phenomenon, terming it (depending on the importing language) Denglisch, Franglais or similar neologisms.

Except when the English pronunciation is obviously indicated by widely known spelling rules, such as "ee", "ay", "oo", "ou" and "a+consonant+e" standing for [tpl]IPA|i[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|eɪ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|u[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|aʊ[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|eɪC[/tpl] (only in Portugal; Brazilians will pronounce the vowels near-correctly but the consonants always in the way they would pronounce them in Portuguese), instead of the expected [tpl]IPA|ej[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|aj[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|ow[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|ow[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|~ aCɨ[/tpl] (non-nasal consonant) and [tpl]IPA|~ ɐCɨ[/tpl] (nasal), all Lusophone Latin Americans and Africans and most Portuguese and Macanese will invariably use spelling pronunciations for pseudo-anglicisms as those that know proper English pronunciation and spelling rules would naturally be expected to know that those words are not real English, so that soda and tuning come out as [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈsɔðɐ|[/tpl] (roughly like "sawtha" or "soth-a") and [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈtũɲĩ|[/tpl] (roughly like "toonyeen'"), much as English-like filler (used mainly in Brazil, in the context of anime episodes not derived from the storyline of the manga from which they derive) and nylon would be [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈfileʁ|[/tpl] (roughly "feel-egh") and [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈnajlõ|[/tpl] (roughly "nye lon'") in non-affected pronunciations, though tupperware is rather similar to a native form ([tpl]IPA-pt|tɐpɐˈwɛɾ|[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|-ˈwɛʁ|[/tpl]).
Phonotactic and phonological rules of Portuguese or of certain Portuguese dialects, such as specific palatalization and vowel reduction patterns, also apply, so that while e.g. nice in São Paulo would become [tpl]IPA|ˈnajs[/tpl], a native English form, in Rio de Janeiro it would become [tpl]IPA|ˈnajsi[/tpl] (roughly "nicie") or [tpl]IPA|s̩[/tpl] ("nye, sss!"), as [tpl]IPA|s[/tpl] at the end of a syllable in the local dialect is non-existent – the local pronunciation of the archiphoneme /coda sibilant/ is palatalized [tpl]IPA|ɕ[/tpl], the hushing second consonant in Japanese sushi. Brazilians, and some Africans and rural Portuguese with archaic dialects resembling Brazilian Portuguese, are known to insert an epenthetic [tpl]IPA|i[/tpl] after virtually every final closed syllable to break them into two different open syllables, so that hippie and hip (as [tpl]IPA|i[/tpl]star and estar/está, similar to Spanish) would sound wholly or nearly homophonous as [tpl]IPA|ˈʁipi[/tpl], in the same way flirt became flerte ([tpl]IPA-pt|ˈfleʁtʃi|[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈflɛɾt(ɨ)|[/tpl] in Portugal) with time. Words that are not slang anymore tend to be adapted to Portuguese orthography.
