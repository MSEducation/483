St. Kilian's German School (Deutsche Schule) is open to students from ages 4 to 18 and offers a unique educational experience in the attractive Dublin suburb of Clonskeagh.  It recently celebrated its 60th anniversary.
From Kindergarten through to Primary School and from the Junior Certificate years to those of the Leaving Certificate, the students enjoy a very European education, with a particular emphasis on the German language and culture, while English is the main language of instruction.  The Secondary cycle also retains the traditional focus on the Junior and Leaving Certificates and is a recognised school within the Irish Department of Education and Skills.  St.Kilian's and the Department have collaborated to offer a bi-lingual Leaving Certificate, the only such opportunity, involving a European language, available in Ireland.  This certification is also recognised for entry to German universities by the German Ministry of Education.   The modern, spacious campus on Roebuck Road is shared with the Lycée Francais d'Irelande and under the umbrella of the Eurocampus the Junior Certificate students of both schools participate in yet another innovative education project.
St. Kilian's is a fee paying school, is also supported by the Irish state and is a member of the German Schools Abroad Network.

==Culture==

St. Kilian was an Irish saint who travelled widely in Europe and was revered for his scholarship and Christian generosity. 
As a co-educational, interdenominational school St. Kilian's cherishes those same values and welcomes students of all cultures, traditions and religious denominations to the Eurocampus.

==History==

St. Kilians is a product of the Save the German Children Society. The first group of children arrived in Ireland in July 1946. It is estimated that roughly 400 children were involved in this project. After three years, some of the children expressed a desire to stay with their Irish foster parents.
The origins of St. Kilians lie at the beginning of Autumn 1952 with language courses for the German boys and girls of the Save the German Children Society. The school came into being through the efforts of Dr. Hermann Katzenberger, Dr. A Kolb and approximately 15 members of the German-Irish society. It was originally named St. Kilians preparatory school. It was named after Saint Kilian (using the German language version of his name), the Irish saint who spread Christianity throughout Europe.
It has recently received an extension on the site where some of the car park was. The new extension provides 16 new class rooms for St. Kilians and the Lycee.

==Eurocampus==

Since 2002 St. Kilians has shared its campus with Lycée Française d'Irlande and has become known as the "Eurocampus''.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] An integrated junior cycle in the Secondary School has increased co operation and integration between the two schools.  The construction of a new 16 classroom extension was started in August 2007 with a completion date scheduled for September 2008.  The Eurocampus now offers its students a variety of academic paths culminating with the Irish Leaving Certificate,  a bi lingual Irish German Leaving Certificate or the French Baccalaureat.
