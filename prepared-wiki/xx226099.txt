Detective Nichols was once partnered with Captain Danny Ross (Eric Bogosian) in Anti-Crime. However, after September 11, 2001, Nichols left the police force for seven years.  Ross remarked that during this period, his only clue to Nichols' whereabouts was a postcard from Cleveland."Law & Order: Criminal Intent" episode "Rock Star"  Little is explained as to how and why Nichols returned to the NYPD.
Detective Eames began partnering with Zack Nichols after Nichols' regular partner, Megan Wheeler, went into labor and gave birth.  Together they investigate Henry Muller, a forensics scientist with the NYPD, and Nichols' suspicions of the man cause conflict between him and Ross, who comments that he himself risked being suspended almost every month while he and Nichols were partners due to the latter's behavior."Law & Order: Criminal Intent" episode "Major Case"
