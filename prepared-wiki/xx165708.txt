Driver experience courses are offered in the winter.

==History==

The railway was started at the Avon Valley Country Park in May 1999, with the first trains running on a [tpl]convert|150|ft[/tpl] demonstration track.[tpl]cite web|title=Visit to the Strawberry Line Miniature Railway, Avon Valley Country Park, Keynsham, Tuesday 6th July 2010|url=http://www.westonsmrailwaysociety.org.uk/Strawberrylinerpt.html |publisher=Weston super Mare Railway Society| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5y2x9eovu | archivedate =18 April 2011 | accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl]  A trackbed was roughed out in June and the first services ran on the new [tpl]convert|900|ft[/tpl] track in August 1999. A [tpl]convert|60|ft[/tpl] tunnel was added in 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.strawberryminirail.co.uk/TheRailway.html |title=Strawberry Line Miniature Railway - The Railway |year=2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5y2xCuQMv | archivedate =18 April 2011|accessdate=20 February 2011[/tpl]

==The railway==

An area is set aside for the coaling and preparation of steam locomotives, including a fire-dropping pit.
The whole railway was resignalled  by 2006[tpl]cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.strawberryminirail.co.uk/AboutUs.html|publisher=Strawberry Line|accessdate=16 September 2012[/tpl]  with track circuits replacing the treadle-operated signalling system. The signalling recreates the prototypical railway operational scenario, with signals not clearing unless the section ahead, or the intersecting line, is clear.

==Steam locomotives==

The line has a growing number of steam-powered locomotives. These currently include:

==Diesel locomotives==

The line also owns several locomotives modelled on diesel prototypes. These are battery-powered.
