Playing host to the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, the United Kingdom was expected to, and did, send an entry to the Contest, which was held in Wembley, London.
The national final to select the entry, A Song for Europe 1977, was held on 9 March 1977 at the New London Theatre and presented by Terry Wogan. A national strike prevented the entries from seeing the light of day on television, but A Song for Europe was aired on BBC Radio 2.

Fourteen regional juries voted on the songs: Bristol, Bangor, Leeds, Norwich, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Plymouth, Glasgow, Southampton and London.
"Rock Bottom" won the national and came 2nd in the contest.
