Miramax is an American entertainment company known for distributing independent and foreign films. Founded in 1979 by Bob and Harvey Weinstein and headquartered in New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts, Miramax was a leading independent film motion picture distribution and production company before it was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 1993. The Weinsteins operated Miramax with more creative and financial independence than any other division of Disney, until 2005 when they decided to leave the company and founded The Weinstein Company. Miramax was sold by Disney to Filmyard Holdings, a joint venture of Colony Capital, Tutor-Saliba Corporation, and Qatar Investment Authority in 2010, ending Disney's 17-year involvement with the studio.

==History==

Founded by the brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein in Buffalo, New York in 1979, the company was named by combining the first names of their parents Max and Miriam,Weinstein, Bob (April 2003). "All Thanks to Max". Vanity Fair. and was originally created to distribute independent films deemed commercially unfeasible by the major studios.
The company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer Martin Lewis and acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced of benefit shows for human rights organization Amnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the US marketplace. The resulting film The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (US Version) was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged a modus operandi that the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit US sensibilities.
Among the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s were Scandal; Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!; The Crying Game and Clerks. The company also made films such as Pulp Fiction, Flirting with Disaster, Heavenly Creatures and Shakespeare in Love.
In addition to those successes, Miramax acquired and/or produced many films that did extraordinarily well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totalling more than $100 million; its most successful title, Chicago, earned more than $300 million worldwide."Chicago". Box Office Mojo. Retrieved February 17, 2012.
The company was also exceptionally successful in securing Academy Award nominations for its releases, many of which resulted in Oscar wins.
In 1992, Miramax began a deal with Paramount Pictures for VHS and TV distribution of certain Miramax releases. Paramount would also distribute theatrically certain releases that might have commercial appeal (such as Bob Roberts, though video rights to that film were owned by Live Entertainment – which is now Lions Gate Entertainment). Paramount still owns video rights to some of these films today, while TV distribution is now with Trifecta Entertainment & Media,[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1139F935A35751C0A964958260|work=The New York Times|title=Miramax Deal On Distribution | date=February 6, 1992 | accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] while the Disney owned Miramax films are distributed by Disney-ABC Domestic Television.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Disney era===

In 1993, Miramax was purchased for $60 million by The Walt Disney Company.[tpl]cite web|last=Mason|first=Ian Garrick|title = When Harvey met Mickey|work=New Statesman |location=UK |date=October 11, 2004|url = http://www3.sympatico.ca/ian.g.mason/Harvey_Weinstein.htm|accessdate=January 11, 2007[/tpl] Harvey and Bob Weinstein continued to operate Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax independently of other Disney companies. Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax could release (see Fahrenheit 9/11, Kids and Dogma, for examples). Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment division released Miramax output.
Miramax operated, until 2005, the label Dimension Films, specializing in genre films and created the Scream and Scary Movie film franchises.
After extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution of Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore. Disney's film studio consortium, Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group assumed control of Miramax, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company called simply The Weinstein Company, and took the Dimension Films label with them. The Miramax name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax was taken over by Daniel Battsek,[tpl]cite news |title=Miramax offices close, Disney says brand continues |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Lowell Sun|date=January 29, 2010 |url=http://www.lowellsun.com/movies/ci_14294787 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] who formerly was head of Buena Vista International in the UK. Battsek refocused Miramax to produce films of high quality but low budget.

On October 3, 2009, Disney announced that the staff of Miramax was to be reduced by 70%, and the number of releases would be reduced by half to just three films per year. The label's marketing, distribution and administrative functions, which had operated independently, would be folded into the parent studio in Burbank. The move became effective in January 2010.Eller, Claudia (October 3, 2009). "Disney to slash Miramax Films staff to 20, reduce releases to 3 a year"[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl].

Though Disney Studio Chairman Dick Cook was a staunch supporter of Miramax, the brand was less of a priority for Bob Iger, whose strategy was to focus on Disney's branded mass entertainment that can be exploited across Disney's theme parks, television and consumer products. Following Disney's $4-billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010, Cook was succeeded by Rich Ross.Eller, Claudia. (September 24, 2009).

Harvey Weinstein has been criticized for editing films he acquires or develops, such as Asian films like Princess Mononoke. Weinstein has always insisted that such editing was done in the interest of creating the most financially viable film. "I'm not cutting for fun", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview.
