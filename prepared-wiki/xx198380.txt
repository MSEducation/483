[[Non-status Indian]]

CATEGORIES: First Nations history

In Canada, a Non-Status Indian is a legal term referring to any First Nations individual who for whatever reason is not registered with the Federal government, and/or is not registered to a band which signed a Treaty with the Crown.
For several decades, Canadian First Nations women automatically became non-status if they married non-First Nations men.
Prior to 1955, a status Indian may lose their status and become non-status through enfranchisement (voluntarily giving up status, usually for a minimal cash payment), by obtaining a college degree or becoming an ordained minister.
The 2013 Federal Court case Daniels v. Canada established that non-Status Indians (and MÃ©tis) have the same Aboriginal rights as status people, in that they are encompassed in the 1867 constitution's language about "Indians".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Court+decision+ends+ambiguity+status+Indians+Metis+officially+Indians/7789924/story.html |title= Court decision ends ambiguity for non-status Indians and Metis, now officially 'Indians' |first= Kim |last= Pemberton |work= Vancouver Sun |date= January 8, 2013[/tpl]
