The word Birâdrî (Persian: برادري) means "brotherhood", originating from the word Birâdar, which means "brother" in Persian. In Pakistan and India it is used to denote a number of social strata among Muslims.
The taxonomy 'Iraqui Biradri ([tpl]lang-ur|عراقی برادری[/tpl]) does not refer to an ethic group presently living in Iraq, but to one in Pakistan and India.

==Theory of origin==

The Iraqi Biradri are Sunni Muslims and are an Urdu-speaking community, though the better educated also speak Persian and some religiously oriented families also speak Arabic. The name "Iraqi" is an ethnonym. In Persian and Urdu, the terminal i is what is called in Arabic morphology "yâ' an-nisba" (ياء النسبة) meaning "the letter yâ of association". Though most Iraqis of the Indian subcontinent speak Urdu, gravestones from as far back as the 1800s found as far east as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are branded with both Persian and liturgical Arabic. Though they are very few, some genetic tests have substantiated their Iraqui ancestry by yielding Haplogroups found primarily in Iran and Iraq.Iraqi Biradri is a very rich community because many of the people are associated with leather industries of Kanpur and Kolkata.They are mainly tannery owners or servicemen. Iraqi Biradri is a highly educated community.
