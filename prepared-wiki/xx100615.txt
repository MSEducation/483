Jean Baptiste Abbeloos (15 January 1836â€“25 February 1906) was a Belgian orientalist and Rector of the University of Leuven. 

==Life==

He was born 15 January 1836, at Gooik, Belgium. He was educated in the seminary of Mechelen, 1849 to 1860. After his ordination to the priesthood, 22 September 1860, he studied at Leuven and Rome, devoting himself especially to Syriac language and literature. He received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Leuven, 15 July 1867, and spent the following winter in London. 
On his return to Belgium, he was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture in the seminary of Mechelen. Failing health obliged him to abandon the work of teaching, and he became, in 1876, pastor at Duffel. He was appointed in 1883 vicar-general under Cardinal Deschamps and held that position until 10 February 1887, when he was appointed Rector of the University of Leuven. 
During his administration the University grew rapidly in equipment and organization. He retired in 1900, and died 25 February 1906.
