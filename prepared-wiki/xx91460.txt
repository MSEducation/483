Evolver is the seventh studio album by 311 and the second recorded in 311's recording studio The Hive in North Hollywood, California. Despite the success of the single "Creatures (For a While)" (which reached #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart) and positive reaction from their fanbase, Evolver became the first 311 album to not receive an RIAA certification.
Evolver is an "Enhanced CD" containing a featurette on the making of the album cover.
