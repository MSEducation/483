[[La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Olivier Messiaen, 1969 compositions

La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ ("The Transfiguration of Our Lord Jesus Christ") is a work written between 1965 and 1969 by Olivier Messiaen. It is based on the account found in the synoptic gospels of Jesus' transfiguration. The writing is on a very large scale; the work requires around 200 performers.  The forces required include a mixed choir, seven instrumental soloists and a large orchestra.

==Background==

On hearing "an old priest deliver a sermon on the light and the filiation",Olivier Messiaen: Music and Color: Conversations with Claude Samuel, Eng Trans., Portland, Oregon, 1994 Messiaen started to think about the transfiguration story in the 1940s. By the time he began to write the music, he hadn't composed music for voices for 17 years, since his solo choral work Cinq rechants.  Warmer tonal harmonies reappeared in this work, in contrast to the harmonies he had been using for other works of the period.

==Performance history==

The first public performance was on June 7, 1969, in Lisbon. The United States premier was on March 27–30, 1972 in Washington, DC with the National Symphony Orchestra and the Westminster Choir; Antal Dorati was the conductor. The U.S. West coast premièrehttp://www.berkeleysymphony.org/about/history/ was in 1981 in San Francisco, with the Berkeley Symphony and the Contra Costa Chorale under the direction of Kent Nagano.  Preparation for this performance was supervised by Maître Messaiën.

==Structure==

The music is divided into 14 movements, grouped into two septénaires (sets of seven).  It lasts for about one and a half hours.  The texts are largely derived from the Bible, particularly Matthew's account of the Transfiguration.  Also included are some parts of Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica.
