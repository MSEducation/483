Agis ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|dʒ|ɪ|s[/tpl]; Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἄγις[/tpl], gen.: Ἄγιδος) was an Ancient Greek poet from Argos, and a contemporary of Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied on his Asiatic expedition.[tpl]Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agis (5)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 73–74  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0082.html [/tpl]  CurtiusCurtius, viii. 5 as well as ArrianArrian, Anabasis Alexandri iv. 9 and PlutarchPlutarch, De adulat. et amic. discrim. p. 60 describe him as a sycophant, one of the basest flatterers of the king.  Curtius calls him "the composer of the worst poems after Choerilus" ("pessimorum carminum post Choerilum conditor"), which probably refers rather to their obsequious, flattering character than to their worth as poetry.  The Greek Anthology contains an epigram which is probably the work of this flatterer.Greek Anthology, vi. 152Jacobs, Anthol. iii. p, 836Zimmermann, Zeitschrift fur die Alterth.'' 1841, p. 164
