==Career==

Milne began his career at Arbroath before moving to Cardiff City in 1957. By the end of his first season at the club he had established himself in the side. He was a vital part of the Cardiff squad at the time, being ever present in the 1958–59 and 1961–62 seasons, scoring his only league goal in a 3-2 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the latter. Soon after he began to suffer from numerous minor injuries and played his last game for Cardiff in August 1964 against Plymouth Argyle. He was allowed to leave the club soon after and finished his career at Barry Town before emigrating to Canada.
