Her Highness Ruth Luka Keanolani Kauanahoahoa Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani (February 9, 1826–1883), was a member of the Kamehameha family, the founding dynasty of the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. She served as Royal Governor of the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. As primary heir to the Kamehameha family, Ruth became a landholder of what would become the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate funding the Kamehameha Schools. Unlike most of the rest of the royal family, Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani retained traditional Hawaiian cultural practices. 
Her name Keʻelikōlani means leaf bud of heaven.[tpl]cite book |last1= Cracroft |first1= Sophia |last2= Franklin |first2= Jane |authorlink2= Jane Franklin |last3= Queen Emma |first3= |authorlink3= Queen Emma of Hawai‘i |editor-last= Korn |editor-first= Alfons L. |title= The Victorian visitors: an account of the Hawaiian Kingdom, 1861-1866, including the journal letters of Sophia Cracroft: extracts from the journals of Lady Franklin, and diaries and letters of Queen Emma of Hawaii |publisher= The University Press of Hawaii |year= 1958 |isbn= 978-0-87022-421-8 |page= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4YsrAQAAIAAJ [/tpl][tpl]rp|303[/tpl]

==Family==

Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikolani's mother was High Chiefess Kalani Pauahi (1804–1826), daughter of High Chief Pauli Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōleiokū and his first wife High Chiefess Keoua-wahine.[tpl]cite web |title= HH Princess Ruth Keelikolani |author= Henry Soszynski |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~royalty/hawaii/i10.html#I10  |work= web page on "Rootsweb" |accessdate=2009-12-15 [/tpl] Her mother died giving birth to her on February 9, 1826, after her mother had married on November 28, 1825 to her natural father, Mataio Kekūanāo[tpl]okina[/tpl]a (1793–1868). She was considered to have two fathers, called a po[tpl]okina[/tpl]olua ancestry (meaning roughly "two heads of the family"). High Chief Kahalai[tpl]okina[/tpl]a Luanu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u (died 1826), Governor of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island also claimed her as his daughter. Kahalai[tpl]okina[/tpl]a was a nephew of King Kamehameha I, the son of the king's half-brother Kalaʻimamahu and High Chiefess Kahakuha[tpl]okina[/tpl]akoi Wahinepio from Maui.[tpl]cite web |author= Rubellite Kawena Johnson |work= Biography Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i: Five Lives, A Series of Public Rememberences |url= http://www.hawaii.edu/biograph/biohi/ruthguide.pdf |title= Princess  Ruth Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani Po[tpl]okina[/tpl]olua Child |accessdate= 2009-12-15  [/tpl]
Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikolani's traditional but now unorthodox birth was one reason she was regarded outside the legitimate birth of Christian Hawaiian nobility. Her claims to be a Kamehameha descendant cannot be questioned since her mother was granddaughter of King Kamehameha. However, King Kamehameha III established in the Constitution of 1840 that eligibility to be monarch required a Christian-style legitimate birth. Ruth was adopted and raised by Kamehameha's most powerful queen, Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu, who acted as regent under kings Kamehameha II and III.
Although her paternity was questionable, Mataio Kekūanāo[tpl]okina[/tpl]a claimed her as his own natural child. He took her into his household after Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu's death and included her in his will and inheritance. This made her the half-sister of King Kamehameha IV and King Kamehameha V and Princess Victoria Kamāmalu.
Her first husband, from 1841, was William Pitt Leleiohoku I (1821–1848), Governor of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, former husband of Princess Harriet Nahi[tpl]okina[/tpl]ena[tpl]okina[/tpl]ena, and son of High Chief William Pitt Kalanimoku the Prime Minister of Kamehameha I, and Chiefess Kiliwehi.
Soon after she married Leleiohoku, her 27-year-old husband died in a measles epidemic.
In June 2, 1856, she married her second husband, Isaac Young Davis (c. 1826–1882), son of George Hueu Davis and his wife Kaha[tpl]okina[/tpl]anapilo Papa (therefore grandson of Isaac Davis).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.kekoolani.org/Pages/9053%20Kekoolani%20Genealogy%20Database/pafg12.htm#312 |title= Hawaiian Genealogy: George Hueu Davis Sr |work=Keko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Ohana (Family) Web Site |author=Dean Keko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani |accessdate=2009-12-15 [/tpl] Standing at 6 ft 2 in, he was considered rather handsome by many including foreign visitors such as Lady Franklin and her niece Sophia Cracroft.[tpl]cite book |title= The Victorian visitors: an account of the Hawaiian Kingdom, 1861-1866, including the journal letters of Sophia Cracroft: extracts from the journals of Lady Franklin, and diaries and letters of Queen Emma of Hawaii |editor= Alfons L.

Their marriage was an unhappy one, and they divorced in 1868. The early loss of their son did not help.[tpl]rp|24[/tpl]

===Sons===

She bore two sons, who both died young. John William Pitt Kīna[tpl]okina[/tpl]u, son of Leleiohoku, was born on December 21, 1842. He was taken away at an early age to attended the Royal School in Honolulu, and died September 9, 1859. Keolaokalani Davis, son of Isaac Young Davis was born in February 1862 and hānai (adopted) against his father's wishes to Bernice Pauahi Bishop. He died on August 29, 1863, aged one year and 6 months.[tpl]rp|34[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= Pauahi: the Kamehameha legacy |author= George Kanahele |publisher= Kamehameha Schools Press |year= 2002 |origyear=1986 |isbn= 0-87336-005-2 |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=pauahi&l=en |page= [/tpl][tpl]rp|105[/tpl]
Her adopted son, called Leleiohoku II after her first husband, was born January 10, 1854, became Crown Prince of Hawaii, but died April 9, 1877, when only 23 years old. On the death of her adopted son, she demanded that Kalākaua and his family relinquish all rights to the estates she had bequeathed their brother, and that they be returned to her by deed. Her relations with King Kalākaua were distant, although she had close friendships with his sister, Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, and their mother, Keohokalole.[tpl]cite web |author= Kalena Silva |work= Biography Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i: Five Lives, A Series of Public Rememberences |url= http://www.hawaii.edu/biograph/biohi/ruthguide.pdf |title= Princess  Ruth Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani Hawaiian Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i |accessdate= 2009-12-15  [/tpl]

===Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani===

She was godmother to Princess Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani. At Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani's baptism, Ruth gifted [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2[/tpl] of her land in Waikīkī where Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani's father Archibald Cleghorn built the ʻĀinahau Estate. Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani gave Ruth the pen name of Mama Nui meaning "great mother". Ruth insisted that the princess be raised to one day be fit to sit on the Hawaiian throne. Ruth's death in 1883 was the first of many deaths that Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani would witness in her short life.

==Defender of Tradition==

Ruth was a staunch defender of ancient Hawaiian traditions and customs. While the kingdom became Christianized, Anglicized, and urbanized, she preferred to live as a noble woman of antiquity. While her royal estates were filled with elegant palaces and mansions built for her family, she chose to live in a large traditional stone-raised grass house. While she understood English and spoke it well, she used the Hawaiian language exclusively, requiring English-speakers to use a translator. Although trained in the Christian religion and given a Christian name, she honored practices considered pagan, such as patronage of chanters and hula dancers.
She continued to worship the traditional gods and various aumakua, or ancestral spirits. When Mauna Loa erupted in 1880, threatening the city of Hilo with a lava flow, her intercession with the goddess Pele was credited by Hawaiians with saving the city. When the ruling monarchs asked her to pose for official photographs, she often refused. Only a dozen photographs of Ruth are known to exist.

==Appearance==

Considered a beauty in her youth, she gained weight as she grew older, and a surgery for nasal infection disfigured her nose, although rumors circulated that it was her second husband Davis who had broken her nose in one of their many fights.[tpl]cite book| author=Kristin Zambucka |title=The High Chiefess: Ruth Keelikolani |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZNpEIgcNHAC |year=1977 |publisher=Mana Pub. Co. |isbn= |page= [/tpl][tpl]rp|5[/tpl][tpl]cite book| author=Rosaly M. C. Lopes, Rosaly Lopes |title=The Volcano Adventure Guide |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eRqrEwvIvKoC |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press Books |isbn= 0-521-55453-5 |pages=86–88[/tpl]
She came to adopt some modern ways, such as Victorian fashions in hairstyle and dresses. Christian missionaries caused Hawaiian royal women to become self-conscious about their Hawaiian looks. They were uncomfortable with their dark skin and large bodies which had been considered signs of nobility for centuries. No matter how Westernized their manners, they were seen as a "Hawaiian squaw." By the last half of the 19th century, Hawaiian women were going in two different directions. Many European men married Hawaiian women they found exotic, favoring those who were thin and had pale complexions.[tpl]cite book |title= Pacific Diaspora: Island Peoples in the United States and Across the Pacific |chapter= Colonialism's Daughters |author= Karina Kahananui Green |editors= Paul R. Spickard, Joanne L. Rondilla, Debbie Hippolite Wright |pages= 242–248 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year=2002 |isbn= 0-8248-2619-1 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=lnIYIXyIP8QC [/tpl]
Ruth defied this ideal, weighing [tpl]convert|440|lbs[/tpl] and over [tpl]convert|6|ft[/tpl] tall. Her broad features were accentuated by a nose flattened by surgery for an infection. To add on to her stature, listeners described Princess Ruth's voice as a "distant rumble of thunder." The U.S. minister to Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i dismissed the princess as a "woman of no intelligence or ability." In addition to her giant size, she rejected English and the Christian faith. Her clear defense of the old ways caused Westerners to think she was backward and stupid.

==Government and business==

On the contrary, as Governor of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Island and heir to the vast Kamehameha estate, she had more power and wealth than most women in other parts of the world. For example, American women could not even vote at the time. Ruth's assertiveness were characteristic of her ancestors. She hired businessmen  such as Sam Parker and Rufus Anderson Lyman who were descended from Americans to help her adapt to the new rules for land ownership. Instead of selling the land, she offered long-term leases, which encouraged settlers to start successful family farms, and gave her a secure income.[tpl]cite book |title= Hawaiian Investigation: Report of Subcommittee on Pacific Islands and Porto Rico on General Conditions in Hawaii |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=gQqh6sTKMA8C&vq=lyman&pg=PA367#v=onepage&q=&f=false |author= United States Senate |publisher= Government Printing Office |year=1903 |page= 367 [/tpl] She was a shrewd businesswoman. In a notorious case, she sold Claus Spreckels her claims to the Crown Lands for $10,000. The lands were worth $750,000, but she knew her claims to them were worthless, since it had been decided in previous court cases that the lands were only entitled to whoever held the office of monarch.
In 1847 she was appointed to the Privy Council of Kamehameha III, and served from 1855 through 1857 in the House of Nobles. January 15, 1855 she was appointed to be the Royal Governor of the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, where she served until March 2, 1874.[tpl]cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0122/2bb8c61f.dir/Keelikolani,%20Ruth%20Princess.jpg |title= Keelikolani, Ruth Princess office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2009-12-15  [/tpl]
When her last half-brother Kamehameha V died in 1872 leaving no heir to the throne, her controversial family background prevented her from being a serious contender to be monarch herself. Although she was considered a member of the royal family, along with Queen Emma and the king's father. In 1874, King Lunalilo then died, and the legislature elected Kalākaua as king, the first to be not descended from Kamehameha I. Keʻelikōlani was not declared as a member of the royal family, merely as a high chiefess by the new king. The young William Pitt Leleiohoku was named Crown prince, and history might have been very different if he had lived past 1877 and became a wealthy king. Instead, the increased reliance of the royal family on the treasury and governmental pensions to fund their lavish expenses is generally considered one factor that led to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893.
She died at Huliheʻe Palace, Kailua Kona, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Island, May 15, 1883. Her body was shipped back to Honolulu for a royal funeral, and she was buried in the Kamehameha Crypt of the Royal Mausoleum, Mauna [tpl]okina[/tpl]Ala, in Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Valley, Oahu. Her will had only one major bequest: to Princess Pauahi the elaborate mansion, Keōua Hale on Emma Street in Honolulu, as well as approximately [tpl]convert|353000|acre|km2[/tpl] of Kamehameha lands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kapalama.ksbe.edu/archives/historical/wills/ruth.php |title= Will of Ruth Keelikolani |work= Kamehameha Schools Archives |publisher= Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate |accessdate=2009-12-15 [/tpl] This totaled nearly nine percent of the land in the Hawaiian Islands.

==Legacy==

During her life, Ruth was the greatest and richest woman in Hawaii. She owned most of the land passed down by her Kamehameha relatives including estates once owned by Queen Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu and Ruth's first husband Leleiohoku I. Her estate became the endowment of the Kamehameha Schools. On these lands downtown Honolulu, Hickam Air Force Base, part of Honolulu International Airport, Moana Hotel, Princess Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani Hotel, Royal Hawaiian Hotel, among others, were built.
A documentary film was made of her life in 2004. As a tribute to her traditionalism, a version of the film was produced in the Hawaiian language.[tpl]cite news |date= May 30, 2004 |url= http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/30/features/story1.html |title= Getting to know Ruth: The princess defied Western ways and paid for it by being ignored by historians until now |author= John Berger |newspaper= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |accessdate=2009-12-17 [/tpl]
