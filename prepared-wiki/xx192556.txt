==Life==

James Williams was the son of John Williams, the rector of Llanddeusant church, St Caffo's Church, Llangaffo, and St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy (all parishes on the island of Anglesey, North Wales).  John Williams was the younger brother of Thomas Williams, the Welsh copper industrialist.  James Williams was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, matriculating in 1807, and obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1810.  He was a Fellow of Jesus College from 1813 to 1822, and was awarded a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1820.  After being ordained, he was appointed curate of St Mary's Church, Llanfairpwllgwyngyll and St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd (both on Anglesey) in 1814.  He left these parishes in 1821 to succeed his father in his parish positions on his father's retirement.  He became chancellor of Bangor Cathedral in 1851.[tpl]cite web |url= http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WILL-JAM-1790.html |title= Williams, James (1790–1872), cleric | last=Jenkins|first=Robert Thomas |work=Welsh Biography Online |authorlink=Robert Thomas Jenkins|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]
Williams helped to establish the Anglesey Association of the Preservation of Lives from Shipwreck, in the wake of a storm that caused a boat to sink with 140 deaths.  The association later became part of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.[tpl]cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|page=89|isbn=1-84527-089-4|publisher=Gwasg Carreg Gwalch|last=Jones|first=Geraint I.

Williams was a magistrate and also had an interest in agriculture, contributing some notes to a book on cattle breeding in 1869.  He was an enthusiastic supporter of the National Eisteddfod.  He was also instrumental, with Morris Williams, in the introduction of John Rhys, who at that time was teaching in Anglesey, to Charles Williams, Principal of Jesus College, which led to Rhys obtaining a scholarship to study at the college.  Rhys went on to become the first Jesus Professor of Celtic at the University of Oxford and Principal of Jesus College itself.
