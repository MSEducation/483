Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks was a boxing match which took place on Monday June 27, 1988. Both men were undefeated and each had a claim to being the legitimate heavyweight champion. At the time, Tyson held the belts of all three of the major sanctioning organizations (World Boxing Council, World Boxing Association, and International Boxing Federation) while Spinks was the Ring champion and was considered the lineal champion.[tpl]cite news | date=2004-04-25| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3640083.stm | title=He who would be king | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Sanjeev | last=Shetty[/tpl]

==History==

Michael Spinks became a professional boxer shortly after he won the gold medal at middleweight in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Initially Spinks was more concerned with assisting his brother Leon's rise to the heavyweight championship, but was later convinced to turn pro himself. In 1981 Spinks fought Eddie Mustafa Muhammad for the WBA light heavyweight championship and defeated him by decision to win his first world title. The next year Spinks won the lineal championship from Mustafa Wassaja and then took the WBC title from Dwight Braxton the year after that. In 1984, Spinks won the IBF title to become the undisputed champion of the division. In 1985, after having defended his titles a combined total of ten times, Spinks moved up to the heavyweight class to challenge reigning IBF, Ring, and lineal champion Larry Holmes, who had been champion since 1978, in September of 1985. Spinks defeated Holmes in a fifteen round decision to become the first reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight championship.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-22| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvAaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cUcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6667,6430875 | title=Tyson, Spinks set to battle | publisher=Daily News | accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] Spinks defeated Holmes again in a rematch and then successfully defended his title against Steffen Tangstad. Instead of defending his IBF title against top contender Tony Tucker, Spinks elected to sign a fight with former contender Gerry Cooney, who had fought a total of three times in the five years since he lost a title shot against Holmes, in June 1987. The IBF responded by stripping Spinks of the title, but he was still in possession of the lineal and Ring titles and was considered by many to still be the rightful champion.[tpl]cite news | date=1987-10-18| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/sports/sports-of-the-times-not-really-the-undisputed-champion.html | title=Not Really the Undisputed Champion | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-23| url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-06-23/sports/26268483_1_tyson-and-spinks-heavyweight-unification-series-title-belts | title=Magazine Deals A Blow To Tyson | publisher=Philly.com | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl]
Mike Tyson turned professional in 1985 and won his first 19 fights by knockout, quickly garnering media attention and establishing an "aura of invincibility".[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=147[/tpl] In November 1986 Tyson knocked out Trevor Berbick to win the WBC heavyweight title; at 20 years old, Tyson was the youngest heavyweight champion in history. In his very next fight Tyson faced James "Bonecrusher" Smith, who had won the WBA title in an upset over Tim Witherspoon earlier in 1986, and defeated him by unanimous decision. Tyson then took a tuneup fight against former world champion Pinklon Thomas after defeating Smith and knocked him out in six rounds, then waited for the result of a fight between Tucker and Buster Douglas for the vacant IBF title that had been stripped from Spinks. Tyson faced Tucker, the winner, in August 1987 in a title unification bout and became the first fighter to unify all three major titles by winning a decision. Tyson then defended his unified title three times, by knocking out Olympic gold medalist Tyrell Biggs in October 1987 in seven rounds, facing a returning Larry Holmes in January 1988 and knocking him out by flooring him three times in the fourth round, and finally by knocking out Tony Tubbs two months after Holmes in two rounds. By 1988 Tyson had become "the most talked about – and marketable – heavyweight champion since Muhammad Ali".

==Build up==

Interest in a showdown between Tyson and Spinks grew to settle the issue of who the real champion was, but negotiations were protracted because Tyson's co-managers Bill Cayton and Jimmy Jacobs and Spinks' manager Butch Lewis struggled to agree on terms.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-02-04| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/sports/tyson-spinks-accord-reached.html | title=Tyson-Spinks Accord Reached | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl] Negotiations temporarily broke down when Lewis insisted on a $15 million guarantee for his fighter.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=245[/tpl] Annoyed at constantly being asked about the fight, Tyson eventually demanded that his managers reach an agreement with Lewis.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=247[/tpl]
By April an agreement had been reached, although another problem arose when the IBF threatened to strip Tyson of their title if the fight was not scheduled for 15 rounds. IBF president Bob Lee then relented, not wanting his organisation to be absent from the biggest fight of the year, and agreed to a 12 round limit.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=258[/tpl] Donald Trump bid a record site fee of $11 million to stage the fight at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, adjacent to his own Trump Plaza.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-02-25| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/sports/sp-45056_1_las-vegas | title=Trump Pays $11 Million for Tyson vs. Spinks Bout | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Earl | last=Gustkey[/tpl] Tyson would earn between $18 million and $22 million depending on fight revenues,[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-28| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/sports/tyson-knocks-out-spinks-at-1-31-of-round-1.html| title=Tyson Knocks Out Spinks at 1:31 of Round 1 | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl] the highest purse received by a boxer until James 'Buster' Douglas made $25 million for fighting Evander Holyfield in 1990.[tpl]cite news | date=1990-02-22| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-22/sports/sp-1747_1_buster-douglas | title=Douglas Signs for Mirage Fight | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Earl | last=Gustkey[/tpl] Spinks earned a flat $13.5 million, more than all his other fight purses combined.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-07-28| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/28/sports/gracious-spinks-calls-its-quits.html | title=Gracious Spinks Calls it Quits | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl]
Billed as "Once and for All", the fight was highly anticipated and earned comparisons with the 1971 Fight of the Century between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, who were also undefeated heavyweight champions when they met to decide the undisputed title.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-27| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-spinks-will-foil-tyson.html | title=Spinks Will Foil Tyson | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Dave | last=Anderson[/tpl] Reports of Tyson's controversial personal life also increased interest in the bout.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-24| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19880624&id=s3ghAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DokFAAAAIBAJ&pg=930,6382060 | title=Spinks-Tyson may be biggest grossing event in history of boxing | publisher=Schenectady Gazette | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] In the days leading up to the fight, one or both men featured on the cover of TIME,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19880627,00.html | title=Mike Tyson |work=time.com | accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] People,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/issue/0,,7566880627,00.html | title=The Champ and the Vamp |work=people.com | accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl] Sports Illustrated[tpl]cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9122/index.htm | title=June 20, 1988 |work=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] and Ring Magazine.[tpl]cite web | url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine_Covers:_1988 | title=The Ring Magazine Covers: 1988 |work=Boxrec | accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] Celebrities such as Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Sean Penn, Madonna, Warren Beatty, Oprah Winfrey, Billy Crystal, George Steinbrenner, Carl Weathers, Jesse Jackson and Chuck Norris would all be in attendance.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=2[/tpl][tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-28| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MrMmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zAEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=1263,8388952 | title=This time, George takes a back seat | publisher=The Miami News | accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] A ringside ticket would cost a record $1,500.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=248[/tpl] Co-promoter Shelly Finkel predicted that the bout would surpass Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard and become the highest grossing fight in boxing history.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-20| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/20/sports/tension-takes-the-limelight.html| title=Tension takes the limelight | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl]
The bout represented a contrast of styles, with Tyson's "speed and devastating power" up against "the unorthodox style of Spinks... who rarely looks impressive but has always found a way to win." Opinions on the fight were mixed, although in general more pundits favoured Tyson. Larry Holmes, the only man to have faced both fighters, predicted a Tyson win.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=263[/tpl] Former world champions Jake LaMotta and Billy Conn and trainers Gil Clancy, Angelo Dundee and Richie Giachetti all picked Tyson to win by knockout, as did Gerry Cooney and Dan Duva.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-27| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/27/sports/the-experts-say-tyson-is-a-cinch.html | title=The Experts Say Tyson Is a Cinch | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl] Ray Arcel thought Tyson would win on points.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-02-04| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/sports/experts-are-strong-for-tyson.html | title=Experts Are Strong for Tyson | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Phil | last=Berger[/tpl] James Smith, who had lost a decision to Tyson the previous year, said that for Spinks to win he would "need to take me in the ring with him." Another former heavyweight champion, George Foreman, also predicted a Tyson win.
Muhammad Ali, former middleweight champion Tony Zale and sportswriter Bert Sugar all backed Spinks to out-box Tyson.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-28| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-he-rules-the-planet.html?scp=2&sq=tyson+spinks+ali&st=nyt | title=He Rules The Planet | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Ira | last=Berkow[/tpl] Dave Anderson of the New York Times wrote that Spinks would win, "probably in a 12-round decision. But possibly in a late-round knockout." Reigning WBA welterweight champion Marlon Starling, veteran announcer Don Dunphy and Tyson's former trainer Teddy Atlas also favoured Spinks. 1940s middleweight champion Rocky Graziano predicted Spinks would "psych out Tyson, then knock the hell out of him."[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-29| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-29/sports/sp-4800_1_mike-tyson | title=Irish Lines Can Cause Smiling | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] Floyd Patterson, who like Tyson had been trained by Cus D'Amato, said "I originally picked him Tyson, and I still do, but now I give Spinks a chance."[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-27| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967765-8,00.html |title=Boxing's Allure | publisher=Time Magazine | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] Spinks entered the ring as a 4–1 underdog.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-27| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067467/index.htm | title=The Big Showdown | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl]

==The fight==

Minutes before the fighters were due to enter the ring, there was a commotion in Tyson's dressing room when Butch Lewis noticed a bump in Tyson's gloves and demanded his hands be re-wrapped. The commotion continued with Lewis insistent that he would not let the fight start until the bump was smoothed out. The matter was only resolved when Spinks' trainer Eddie Futch was called in, and he accepted that Tyson's gloves were fine.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=3[/tpl] Though he was trying to protect his fighter's interests, Lewis later admitted that he had also seen a chance to "pull a little psyche" on Tyson.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=2[/tpl] Instead, Tyson had just been angered by the delay. When Lewis had left and Tyson once again prepared to leave his dressing room, he told his trainer Kevin Rooney: "you know, I'm gonna hurt this guy."
Tyson attacked Spinks from the opening bell, landing a solid left hook in the first ten seconds and forcing Spinks to cover up. Spinks clinched and was driven back to the ropes by another Tyson attack. He moved off the ropes but Tyson trapped him again; a left uppercut and a right hand to the body forced Spinks to take a knee after a minute, the first time Spinks had been knocked down in his professional career.[tpl]cite book | author=Heller | title=Bad Intentions| year=1995| page=268[/tpl] Spinks took a count of four before rising. As the two men moved towards each other Tyson turned away from a Spinks right hand and responded with a left-right combination to the head which put Spinks down again. This time he was unable to rise and referee Frank Cappuccino counted him out. The fight was over after 91 seconds, presently the sixth shortest heavyweight title fight in history.[tpl]cite news | date=2005-05-23| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-23/sports/0505230020_1_lamon-brewster-prefight-heavyweight-main-event | title=Brewster looks to unify division | publisher=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Michael | last=Hirsley[/tpl] Just ten punches were landed, eight by Tyson, two by Spinks.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-28| url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=106719798 | title=Tyson breezes to victory | publisher=Aiken Standard | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] The round was named round of the year for 1988 by Ring Magazine.
Afterwards Spinks said: "I came to fight like I said I would. I just tried to do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he abandoned his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-28| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/sports/spinks-didn-t-fight-according-to-plan.html | title=Spinks Didn't Fight According to Plan | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Dave | last=Anderson[/tpl] Spinks later conceded that "fear was knocking at my door big time."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0002/one.htm | title=The Real Iron Mike |work=Boxing Monthly | accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] Tyson said "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit.

==Aftermath==

Tyson vs. Spinks was the richest fight in boxing history up to that point, grossing around $70 million, $10 million more than the previous record holder, the Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard bout in 1987. 600,000 households bought the fight on pay per view,[tpl]cite news | date=1988-11-14| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/14/business/the-media-business-pay-per-view-television-is-ready-for-takeoff.html | title=Pay-Per-View Television Is Ready for Takeoff | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22 | first=Andrew L. | last=Yarrow[/tpl] generating $21 million.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-07-11| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067517/index.htm | title=Get Out Your Checkbook | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] A further $12.3 million came from the 21,785 live gate, almost double the previous live gate record of $6.8 million set by Hagler vs. Leonard.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-04-09| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-04-09/sports/8803070636_1_world-boxing-association-welterweight-mark-stevenson-shopping-center | title=Rod Strickland has returned to class at De Paul | publisher=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] The fight also surpassed the 1987 Super Bowl as the highest-grossing single day sporting event in history.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-06-22| url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-06-22/sports/0050070103_1_spinks-tyson-trump-plaza | title=Tyson-spinks Fight Revenues May Reach $100 Million | publisher=Orlando Sentinel | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] It is estimated to have generated $344 million in gambling revenues in Atlantic City, over $100 million more than a typical four day weekend in June.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-07-04| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067484/2/index.htm | title=Scorecard | publisher=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=2011-09-22 [/tpl] The Trump Plaza casino achieved a record drop of $11.5 million on the day of the fight.
Spinks never boxed again and announced his retirement from the sport a month later. The Tyson fight was the only loss of his professional career. Tyson also spoke of retiring, hinting that "this may be my last fight." The win over Spinks has been described as the pinnacle of Tyson's boxing career. It was also his last fight under longtime trainer Kevin Rooney, who was dismissed by Tyson in December.[tpl]cite news | date=1988-12-10| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/10/sports/tyson-trainer-is-dismissed.html | title=Tyson Trainer Is Dismissed | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] Tyson made two more successful title defences before losing to James 'Buster' Douglas in a major upset in 1990. He continued fighting until 2005, but was unable to replicate his earlier achievements. Tyson and Spinks have both been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.
