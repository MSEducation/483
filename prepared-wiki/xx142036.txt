Parthiban (Srikanth) is a recent college grad, still young and undeterred by the pressures of the real world to hold down any one job for a long period of time. He falls in love with a girl (Sneha) he sees on the bus when loitering about with his friends. He finds that her tastes matches his perfectly. His parents, fed up with his ways, force him into an arranged marriage. Parthiban is surprised to learn that the girl he has been set up with is the same one he fell in love with. Unfortunately, he realizes that Sathya (Sneha), the girl he has married is a different woman, and that he actually loves a free-spirited, look-alike, Janani (Sneha again).
He begins to hate his wife, who is demure and quiet. He avoids her, and rebukes her kind actions and words. After some miscommunication, he reveals that he has fallen in love with his wife.
