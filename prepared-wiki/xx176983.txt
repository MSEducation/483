Not all the reviews were positive, though. In a more mixed review, Popmatters' Matt Fiander criticized the second half of the album, writing, "The second half of the record settles into a more monotone kind of space rock that is as big as the better first half, but gives us no recognizably distinct songs or catchy melodies."Fiander, Matt.
