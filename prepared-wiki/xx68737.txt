[[Rawlings Gold Glove Award]]

CATEGORIES: Gold Glove Award

The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/11/13/al_goldgloves_ap/|title=A-Rod breaks Vizquel's streak; AL West earns eight of nine|date=November 13, 2002|work=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=May 26, 2009[/tpl] Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players. Additionally, a sabermetric component provided by Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote.[tpl]cite press release|title=Rawlings Gold Glove Award Finalists Announced|date=October 25, 2013|publisher=Rawlings|url=http://www.rawlings.com/newsdetaillanding.aspx?id=1561|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MUOQLhRF|archivedate=January 8, 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position. The award was created from a glove made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/about/about_the_award|title=About the Award|publisher=Rawlings|accessdate=June 4, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Initially, only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in Major League Baseball;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/about/press_releases/rawlings_to_unveil_ballot|title=Rawlings to Unveil Ballot|date=February 13, 2007|publisher=Rawlings|accessdate=June 4, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205220701/http://rawlingsgoldglove.com/about/press_releases/rawlings_to_unveil_ballot|archivedate=February 5, 2009|quote="Members of the original 1957 Rawlings Gold Glove Team: Willie Mays, CF (New York Giants); Al Kaline, RF (Detroit Tigers); Minnie Minoso, LF (Chicago White Sox); Frank Malzone, 3B (Boston Red Sox); Nellie Fox, 2B (Chicago White Sox); Gil Hodges, 1B (Dodgers); Roy McMillan, SS (Cincinnati Reds); Sherm Lollar C (Chicago White Sox); and Bobby Shantz, P (New York Yankees)."[/tpl] however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml|title=National League Gold Glove Award Winners|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml|title=American League Gold Glove Award Winners|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 4, 2009[/tpl]
For the first four seasons of the award (1957 to 1960), individual awards were presented to left fielders, center fielders, and right fielders. From 1961 through 2010, the phrase "at each position" was no longer strictly accurate, since the prize was presented to three outfielders irrespective of their specific position.[tpl]cite book|last1=Gillette|first1=Gary|last2=Palmer|first2=Pete|last3=Gammons|first3=Peter|title=The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia, Fourth Edition|page=1770|year=2007|publisher=Sterling Publishing|isbn=978-1-4027-4771-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=62ntg9bMH4AC&lpg=PP1&dq=editions%3AMH3T-5VaKBIC&pg=PT1791#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl] Any combination of outfielders, often three center fielders, could win the award in the same year. Critics called for awarding a single Gold Glove for each individual outfield position, arguing that the three outfield positions are not equivalent defensively.[tpl]cite book|last=Kurkjian|first=Tim|title=Is this a Great Game, Or What?|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|pages=218–219|isbn=0-312-36223-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kYs4CrZrdmAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA218,M1[/tpl] Starting in 2011, separate awards for each outfield position were once again presented.[tpl]cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Orioles' Markakis and Wieters win Gold Gloves|date=November 1, 2011|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://www.herald-mail.com/sports/bal-orioles-markakis-wieters-gold-glove-1101,0,3175934.story|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62uhDlOE0|archivedate=November 3, 2011[/tpl] In the 1985 American League voting, a tie for third place resulted in the presentation of Gold Glove Awards to four outfielders (Dwayne Murphy, Gary Pettis, Dwight Evans and Dave Winfield); this scenario was repeated in the National League in 2007 (Andruw Jones, Carlos Beltrán, Aaron Rowand, and Jeff Francoeur).
The Boston Globe writer Peter Abraham said the Fielding Bible Awards "are far more accurate (and accountable)" than the Gold Glove awards since statistics are used along with the opinions of an expert panel. The Gold Gloves are selected by managers and coaches that may have seen a player as few as six times during the season.[tpl]cite news|title=Yadier Molina leads fifth annual "Fielding Bible Awards"|first=Peter|last=Abraham|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2010/11/so_much_for_run.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010|quote=These awards are far more accurate (and accountable) than the Gold Gloves in that statistics are employed along with the opinions of a large panel of experts.[/tpl] Bill Chuck of Comcast SportsNet New England wrote that Gold Glove voters frequently counted only errors to determine winners.[tpl]cite news|last=Chuck|first=Bill|title=Nation STATion: Playing the field|date=August 8, 2011|work=CSNNE.com|publisher=New England Cable News|url=http://www.necn.com/pages/print_landing?blockID=546784&feedID=3352&|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60yY2BCUY|archivedate=August 16, 2011[/tpl] Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times said the votes for the Gold Gloves rely largely on a player's past reputation.[tpl]cite news|title=Mariners eye Durham, Datz for coaching positions; Ichiro wins Fielding Bible Award|first=Geoff|last=Baker|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/marinersblog/2013319280_mariners_eye_durham_datz_for_c.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010|quote=Unlike the Gold Glove awards, chosen by coaches and based largely on reputation, the Fielding Bible Awards are picked by a panel of experts relying heavily on new-wave statistical analysis for defense.[/tpl] The Associated Press wrote that "some fans have viewed the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity contest, even suggesting that a player's performance at the plate helped draw extra attention to his glove."[tpl]cite news|title=AL Gold Glove winners named|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5784846|work=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010|quote=For years, some fans have viewed the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity contest, even suggesting that a player's performance at the plate helped draw extra attention to his glove.[/tpl] After winning the AL Gold Glove at first base in both 1997 and 1998, Rafael Palmeiro won again in 1999 with the Texas Rangers while only appearing in 28 games as a first baseman; he played in 128 games as a designated hitter that season, resulting in a controversy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/baseball/mlb/09/17/beat_goldgloves/|title=Baseball's rubber stamp|last=Luft|first=Jacob|date=September 17, 2003|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Dierker|first=Larry|title=My Team|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|page=13|isbn=0-7432-7513-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_3zz4DNifaQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA13,M1|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=McKelvey|first=G.

In 2011, Rawlings added a Platinum Glove Award for each league, voted on by the fans.[tpl]cite web|title=Platinum Glove Award|publisher=BaseballAlmanac |date=March 25, 2013|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/Platinum_Glove_Award.shtml |accessdate=2013-11-04[/tpl]

==All-time Gold Glove Team==

==Teammates==

===Middle infield duos===

In the history of the Gold Glove Award, there have been ten double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders,[tpl]cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2009|edition=3|page=268|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wq5yeipLolUC&pg=PA268&dq=double+play+baseball | isbn=978-0-393-06681-4[/tpl] that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the majority of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out.[tpl]cite book|author=Curran, Mike; Newman, Ross; and Lopez, Andy|title=Coaching Baseball Successfully|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|page=109|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OzzGJPQPfm8C&pg=PA109&dq=common+double+play+baseball | isbn=978-0-7360-6520-7[/tpl] Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó, who won with the New York Yankees in 2010.

===Batteries===

Since 1957, there have been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, are the only two players on the field involved in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm.[tpl]cite book|last=Stallings|first=Jack|author2=Bennett, Bob|others=American Baseball Coaches Association|title=Baseball strategies: American Baseball Coaches Association|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2003|page=19|isbn=0-7360-4218-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1s7TpKpGWPMC&pg=PA19&dq=pitcher+catcher+running+game#v=onepage&q=pitcher%20catcher%20running%20game&f=false[/tpl] The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.
