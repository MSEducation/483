[tpl]Britten operas[/tpl]The Burning Fiery Furnace is one of the three Parables for Church Performances composed by Benjamin Britten, dating from 1966, and is his Opus 77.  The other two 'church parables' are Curlew River (1964) and The Prodigal Son (1968).  William Plomer was the librettist.  
The work was premiered at Orford Church, Suffolk, England, on 9 June 1966 by the English Opera Group.John Warrack, "First Performances: Britten's The Burning Fiery Furnace.  Tempo, No. 78, pp. 22-23 (1966). Set designs were by Annena Stubbs.  Colin Graham was the stage director of this first production.Alan Blyth, Obituary for Colin Graham.  The Guardian, 10 April 2007.
The scale and manner of instrumentation are similar to those in Curlew River, but one notable difference is the use of the alto trombone.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/4/3/178 | last=Thomas | first=Christopher J. | title=The Church Parables | journal=The Opera Quarterly | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=178â€“184 | year=1986 | accessdate=2008-05-01 | doi=10.1093/oq/4.3.178[/tpl]
Clifford Hindley has commented on a reading of a subtext sympathetic to homosexuality on the part of both Britten and Plomer in their treatment of the story.Clifford Hindley, "Homosexual Self-Affirmation and Self-Oppression in Two Britten Operas".  The Musical Quarterly, 76(2), pp. 143-168 (Summer 1992).

==Synopsis==

The Burning Fiery Furnace tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar  (the historical Nebuchadnezzar II) and the three Israelites, Ananias, Misael and Asarias (corresponding Babylonian names: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego), who were thrown into a furnace for their refusal to worship Nebuchadnezzar's image of gold.  However, God saves them from death, as the voice of an angel joins the Israelites in a 'Benedicte'.
