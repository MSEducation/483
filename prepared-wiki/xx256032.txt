Personality is a popular song with lyrics by Johnny Burke and music by Jimmy Van Heusen. It was written for the 1946 film Road to Utopia, and Dorothy Lamour performed it in the movie.
In a slightly longer version, the song became a number one Billboard hit for Johnny Mercer in 1946. Dinah Shore also recorded it around that time. Lamour was between record contracts at the time of the film's release, so she did not record the song herself until years later.
The lyrics are humorous (and slightly suggestive for the 1940s), employing the word "personality" as an obvious euphemism for a woman's voluptuous figure.
Al Hirt released a version on his 1964 album, Beauty and the Beard.Al Hirt, Beauty and the Beard Retrieved April 10, 2013.
Rewritten versions of the song have been used as commercial jingles. The most notable was "Wessonality," an advertisement for Wesson cooking oil sung by Florence Henderson.
