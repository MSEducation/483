==Early life==

Jenkins was born in Indio, California on September 27, 1964. He grew up in Palo Alto, California and attended Henry M. Gunn Senior High School. Stephan started his musical career early in life. He recalls banging out original works at the age of five, pulling out pots and pans on the floor of his kitchen at home in northern California. When he was 13, his family relocated to Madison, Wisconsin to support his father's career, but the Jenkins family returned to the Bay Area two years later. In 1987 he graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in English Literature,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/04/20/PK64418.DTL&type=entertainment|title=He can see clearly now|author=Julian Guthrie|date=2003-04-20|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl] despite suffering from both ADHD and dyslexia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-11-28/entertainment/17705845_1_stephan-jenkins-blind-songs|title=Blind Ambition|author=Joel Selvin|date=1999-11-28|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl]

==Music career==

===Earliest Projects===

Jenkins began musical work as a drummer.  During high school, he performed with Fast Forward, consisting of Jenkins on drums with Nick Dement (Guitar), Ben Austin (Bass), and Greg Magel (Guitar).  Though the precocious Jenkins was still in high school, the other three were students at neighboring Stanford University.  With the breakup of Fast Forward, Austin and Magel departed; Jenkins and Dement added a new bassist and formed the trio Splash.

===Puck and Natty===

Jenkins then formed Puck and Natty (the name originating from the Shakespeare characters), a 'funky rap masta' group, with Detroit rapper Herman Chunn in 1992. Puck and Natty was short lived; however, their track, "Just Wanna Be Your Friend" landed on a soundtrack album of the hit TV show Beverly Hills, 90210 in 1992.

===Third Eye Blind===

Jenkins formed Third Eye Blind in 1993 with Kevin Cadogan. They played small gigs around the bay for years and were, for the most part, unknown until they were signed in 1996 by Elektra Records which was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for an unsigned artist. Jenkins has written or co-written every song on the band's four studio albums and one extended play album. He has seemed to favor the Gibson Explorer guitars over most other electric models in his career, particularly during live performances.
Jenkins has either sued or been sued by many associated with Third Eye Blind, although several of those lawsuits have been settled out of court. Jenkins won two California Music Awards for best songwriter along with bandmate Cadogan, was nominated three years in a row as best vocalist, and won artist of the year.

===As a producer===

Jenkins produced Vanessa Carlton's second album Harmonium (2004) and co-wrote four tracks, including the lead single "White Houses". He co-produced Heroes & Thieves, Carlton's third album, with Irv Gotti, 7 Aurelius, and Rick Rubin.

==Acting career==

Jenkins made his acting debut with a cameo in the film Rock Star (2001) playing Bradley, the lead singer of the fictional band Black Babylon. He has also appeared in the former Nickelodeon series All That, and he appeared on the MTV candid camera show Punk'd when Vanessa Carlton was the subject of one of Ashton Kutcher's practical jokes. In perhaps his biggest acting stint, he starred in Art of Revenge (2003), in which he played the lead role Matthew Kane.

==Personal life==

Jenkins ended a three-year relationship with actress Charlize Theron in October 2001. Some of Third Eye Blind's third album, Out of the Vein, appears to explore the emotions he experienced as a result of that breakup. From 2002 to 2007, Jenkins dated Vanessa Carlton."Interview: Vanessa Carlton". Slant Magazine. October 4, 2007. Retrieved April 9, 2011.
Jenkins currently lives in San Francisco, California.[tpl]cite web|author=Shaheem Reid|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1546650/11272006/gotti_irv.jhtml#/news/articles/1546650/11272006/gotti_irv.jhtml |title=Irv Gotti Maps Out Inc.

Yeah, I guess. I also get to live in North Beach and go to a pub and drink my pint and go to a caf√© and drink my coffee. 
I carry groceries home on the tank of my motorcycle. I find pleasure in things that are simple. Is that a rock star's life? It is for me." According to Jenkins, he never drinks before a show and always drinks after a show.
