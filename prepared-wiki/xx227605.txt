==Tojeiro==

In 1985 John Tojeiro, the original designer of the AC Ace chassis became a director of the company and the car was renamed the Dax Tojeiro. The Tojeiro has undergone continuous development and in 2003 was available with a choice of rear and patented front suspension and can accommodate most American V8 and Jaguar engines including the V12. Automatic or manual transmission can be used and power steering is another option. A leather trimmed interior kit is available.
becaus of a falling out with the Tojeiro family due to not paying fees, the Tojeio is now called the 427

==Rush==

The company also produce the Rush, a Lotus 7 type car. The main kit is based around the Ford Sierra and can even use the four wheel drive system from the Sierra 4x4. For extreme performance large V8 engines can also be fitted. The Rush MC is a lightweight version designed to accept motor cycle engines.
Because the main engineers left Dax and there was nobody left that could make a rush, Dax decided to sell the rush to Fenton Motorsport
