A sausage roll is a savoury pastry popular in the United Kingdom and other countries. In addition to being sold at retail outlets, they are also available from bakeries as a take-away food item. A miniature version is popular as a buffet or party food.

==Composition==

The basic composition of a sausage roll is generally a sheet or sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk before being baked.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sausage-roll-recipe/index.html | title=Sausage Roll Recipe | publisher=Food Network | accessdate=2009-10-28[/tpl] They can be served either hot or cold.
Historically, during the 18th century they were made using shortcrust pastry instead of puff pastry.[tpl]cite journal|title=Our New Cook-Book|journal=Peterson's Magazine|date=July 1866|volume=15|pages=438|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4iHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA438&dq=sausage+roll&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UOhwT-22O8nG0QWDytWNAg&ved=0CGYQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=sausage%20roll&f=false|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]
