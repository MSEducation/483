Heinrich Carl Knopf (b. 1839 - d.1875) was an illustrious German Bogenmacher  / Bowmaker.
He came from a dynasty of great makers. Studied bow making in Markneukirchen under Christian Knopf (his uncle).
Spent his journeyman's years in Leipzig working for Ludwig Bausch. Upon his father's (Karl Wilhelm's) death returned to Markneukirchen where he became his successor.*Deutsche Bogenmacher-German Bow Makers  Klaus Grunke 2000
He also supplied bows to many German shops such as Bausch, R. Weichold and the Russian Nicolaus Kittel. 
"The bows (he) made for Kittel are quite different in style from the ones he supplied to the German shops."*VSA 14 #2 1995 Nicolaus Kittel: The Russian Tourte by Kenway Lee 183- Kenway Lee
"His bows are exquisite, showing  mastery in technical as well as stylistic  aspects. His son  Heinrich Richard gen. Knopf (1860-1939)  (known as Henry) became an excellent bow & violin maker who  established what was to become a very important and successful shop in New York City (from 1879 -1931)."Filimonov Fine Violins Gennady Filimonov (2007)
