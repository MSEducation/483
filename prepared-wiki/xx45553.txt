[[Motorola 68012]]

CATEGORIES: 68k microprocessors

The Motorola MC68012 processor is a 16/32-bit microprocessor from the early 1980s. It is an 84-pin PGAMotorola 68012 (MC68012) microprocessor family version of the Motorola MC68010. The memory space was extended to 2GB and an RMCRead-Modify-write Cycle indicator, same as used on the MC68020 for multiprocessing support pin was added, in order to help the design of multiprocessor systems with virtual memory.DatasheetArchive :: Datasheet and Specsheet for MC68012RC12[ref]Avtar, Singh. 16-Bit and 32-Bit Microprocessors: Architecture, Software, and Interfacing Techniques.

The expansion of the memory space caused an issue for any programs that used the high byte of an address to store data, a programming trick that was successful with those processors that only have a 24-bit address bus (68000 and 68010). A similar problem affected the 68020.
