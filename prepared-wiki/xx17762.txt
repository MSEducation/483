The Iranian Green Movement refers to a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office. Green was initially used as the symbol of Mir Hossein Mousavi's campaign, but after the election it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nowpublic.com/world/green-movement-during-irans-presidential-election|title=Green movement during Iran's Presidential Election[/tpl] Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi are recognized as political leaders of the Green Movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://asemandailynews.com/?p=2417| title= دعوتنامه برگزارکنندگان مراسم ۱۸ تیر از ميرحسين موسوی و مهدی کروبی و محمد خاتمی|accessdate=5 July 2009|date=5 July 2009|work=Aseman Daily News |language=Persian[/tpl] Hossein-Ali Montazeri was also mentioned as spiritual leader of the movement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.radiofarda.com/content/F11_Iran_Postelection_Makhmalbaf_Montazeri/1889417.html|title= مخملباف "آزادی آفرینش" را به آیت‌الله منتظری تقدیم کرد|work=Radio Farda|date=15 June 2009[/tpl]

==Outcome of 2009-2010 Iranian election protests==

The election was held on June 12, 2009. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning by a landslide, though Mousavi and others believed the results were fraudulent. They suggested that the Interior Minister, Sadegh Mahsouli, an ally of Ahmadinejad, had interfered with the election and distorted the votes to keep Ahmadinejad in power.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/12/AR2009061200916_2.html|title=Iran Election In Dispute as 2 Candidates Claim Victory|publisher=Washington Post|date=13 June 2009| first=Thomas | last=Erdbrink | accessdate=2010-05-04[/tpl] Mousavi then claimed victory, and called for his supporters to celebrate it which led to the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests.

===Protests===

Clashes broke out between police and groups protesting the election results from early morning on Saturday onward. Initially, the protests were largely peaceful. However, as time passed, they became increasingly violent. Some protesters began to get violent after the results of the election were announced. Angry crowds in Tehran broke into shops, tore down signs, and smashed windows.[tpl]cite news | title = Iran election protests turn violent | publisher = CNN | date = 13 June 2009 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/13/iran.election/index.html | accessdate = 13 June 2009[/tpl] Civil unrest took place as protesters set fire to tyres outside the Interior Ministry building and others formed a human chain of around 300 people to close off a major Tehran street.[tpl]cite news|first=Ian|last=Black|publisher=Guardian|title=Ahmadinejad wins surprise Iran landslide victory|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/13/iran-election-ahmadinejad-wins-president|date=13 June 2009|accessdate=15 June 2009 | location=London[/tpl]

====The Green Path of Hope====

Mousavi and other reformist leaders are now working in peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition named "The Green Path of Hope". Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the Interior Ministry. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate nor is likely to receive permission; so, the movement was named a "path" in order to bypass this law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2009/08/092369.php |title=زييات "راه سبز اميد" از زبان عليرضا بهشتی: خاتمی و کروبی عضو شورای مرکزی |publisher=Gooya News |accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl]
The Green Path of Hope claims it seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad's presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:

According to organization officials, the movement functions encompasses numerous political parties, NGO's and social networks.  Mousavi emphasized that existent, autonomous social networks in the community are part of this movement:[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71086|title=Green path of hope, Mousavi's new organization |accessdate=2009-08-18[/tpl]

The "Green Path" has six main members of the central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body will be ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner.
