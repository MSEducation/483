Stephen Farber, of The Hollywood Reporter, said that even though "Liberty Kid" is a small film, much of it is deeply poignant; it enhances our compassion for all the ghosts of Sept. 11. Its cautiously optimistic conclusion also strikes a welcome note without falling into sentimentality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=9464 |title=Liberty Kid |accessdate=2010-01-08 |last=Barber |first=Stephen |date=2007-07-06 |work=The Hollywood Reporter [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Bilge Ebiri, of The Nerve, said that a lesser director would have played this story for cheap emotions. But to her eternal credit, Chaiken keeps her movie grounded in her characters, allowing Thompson and Savinon's true-to-life performances to carry us through what is, on paper, an elaborate plot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/filmlounge/review/thelibertykid/index.aspx |title=Liberty Kid |accessdate=2010-01-08 |last=Eberi |first=Bilge |work=The Nerve [/tpl] Don Willmot, of Film Critic, said that Thompson and Savinon are a terrific pair and deserve big parts in bigger films.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Liberty-Kid |title=Liberty Kid |accessdate=2010-01-08 |last=Willmott |first=Don |year=2008 |work=Film Critic [/tpl]
