The Everyman Theatre, founded in 1990 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, by artistic director Vincent M. Lancisi, an Equity theatre with a professional repertory company of artists from the Baltimore/Washington area, dedicated to presenting quality theatre that is accessible and affordable to everyone.
The Everyman Theatre is highly regarded as the leading resident theater company in Baltimore.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Its critically acclaimed productions have earned nine Greater Baltimore Theater Awards (more than any other company) and overwhelming support from theater goers in Baltimore.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
In November 2006, Everyman Theatre made the official announcement that it had received a gift of a new home by the Bank of America and The Dawson Company:  The Town Theatre, located at 315 West Fayette Street on the West Side of Baltimore City.  The building, valued at $1.5 million, will be renovated over the next 3 years to offer sufficient scene shops, costume and props facilities, education space, and a 250-300 seat state of the art theatre with more room to grow in future years. Everyman Theatre plans to open its 2009-10 Season in its permanent home.
Everyman Theatre and Baltimore's other important theater, Center Stage, lead a burgeoning, if somewhat inconsistent, Maryland Theatre scene.
