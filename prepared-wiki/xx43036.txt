SciFri was created when the National Science Foundation agreed to fund a weekly science talk-show on NPR.  After the Gulf War in 1991, NPR created a daily talk show called Talk of the Nation, and incorporated Science Friday into it. Science Friday is not produced "in-house" at NPR but is licensed from ScienceFriday, Inc.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
