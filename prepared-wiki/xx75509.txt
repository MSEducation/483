The Nazarenes were a sect of 4th-century Christianity first mentioned by Epiphanius of Salamis, who considered them heretics.David C. Sim The Gospel of Matthew and Christian Judaism 1998 p182 "The Nazarenes are first mentioned by Epiphanius who records that they upheld the Torah, including the practice of circumcision and sabbath observance (Panarion 29:5.4; 7:2, 5; 8:1-7), read the Hebrew scriptures in the original Hebrew" The group was later mentioned by Jerome and Augustine of Hippo.Petri Luomanen "Nazarenes" in A companion to second-century Christian "heretics" pp279Memoirs of Dr. Joseph Priestley - Page 670 The term Ebionites occurs in Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and Eusebius but none of them make any mention of Nazarenes ; and yet it cannot be denied, that they must have been even more considerable in the time of these writers,
Epiphanius, and other writers such as Jerome, distinguished the 4th Century Nazarenes from the earlier use of "Sect of the Nazarenes" (ἡ τῶν Ναζωραίων αἵρεσις) applied to the New Testament Church in Acts 24:5, where Paul the Apostle is accused before Felix at Caesarea (the capital of Roman Judaea) by Tertullus of being "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."Edward Hare The principal doctrines of Christianity defended 1837 p318 "The Nazarenes of ecclesiastical history adhered to the law of their fathers ; whereas when Tertullus accused Paul as "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes," he accused him as one who despised the law, and " had gone about to the temple," Acts xxiv, 5, 6. " 

==Nazarene (title)==

The title "Nazarene" is first found in the Greek texts of the New Testament as an adjective, nazarenos, used as an adjectival form of the phrase apo Nazaret "from Nazareth."Frank Ely Gaebelein, James Dixon Douglas The Expositor's Bible commentary: with the New International Version 1984 "Matthew certainly used Nazoraios as an adjectival form of apo Nazaret ("from Nazareth" or "Nazarene"), even though the more acceptable adjective is Nazarenos'' (cf. Bonnard, Brown, Albright and Mann, Soares Prabhu)."

==The Sect of the Nazarenes (1st century)==

The name Nazaraios is the standard Greek spelling in the New Testament for a man from Nazareth; the plural Nazaraioi means "men from Nazareth" (see Nazarene (title)).[tpl]Citation | contribution = G3480 | url = http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3480&t=KJV | publisher = Strong | title = Lexicon[/tpl]. The title Nazarenes, "men from Nazareth," is first applied to the Christians by Tertullus ([tpl]Bibleverse ||Acts|24:5[/tpl]), though Herod Agrippa II ([tpl]Bibleverse ||Acts|26:28[/tpl]) uses the term "Christians" which had first been used at Antioch ([tpl]Bibleverse ||Acts|11:26[/tpl]). The name used by Tertullus survives into Rabbinic and modern Hebrew as notzrim (נוצרים) a standard Hebrew term for "Christian", and also into the Quran and modern Arabic as nasara (plural of nasrani "Christians"). The Arabic word nasara (نَصارى) comes from the Arabic root "n s r" (ن ص ر).
Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 220, [tpl]Citation | title = Against Marcion | at = 4:8[/tpl]) records that the Jews called Christians "Nazarenes" from Jesus being a man of Nazareth, though he also makes the connection with Nazarites in [tpl]Bibleverse ||Lamentations|4:7[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | title = Birkat haMinim: Jews and Christians in conflict in the ancient world | page = 52 | first1 = Yaakov Y | last1 = Teppler | first2 = Susan | last2 = Weingarten | year = 2007 |  quote = This presumption is strengthened by the statement of Tertullian: The Christ of the Creator had to be called a Nazarene...

==The Nazarenes (4th century)==

According to Epiphanius in his Panarion, the 4th-century Nazarenes were originally Jewish converts of the ApostlesPanarion 29.5.6 who fled Jerusalem because of Jesus' prophecy on its coming siege (during the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD).  They fled to Pella, Peraea (northeast of Jerusalem), and eventually spread outwards to Beroea and Bashanitis, where they permanently settled (Panarion 29.3.3).
The Nazarenes were similar to the Ebionites, in that they considered themselves Jews, maintained an adherence to the Law of Moses, and used only the Aramaic Gospel of the Hebrews, rejecting all the Canonical gospels.  However, unlike half of the Ebionites, they accepted the Virgin Birth.[tpl]Cite document|last = Krauss | first =Samuel| author-link = Samuel Krauss|title=Nazarenes |url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=140&letter=N&search=nazarenes | accessdate =2007-08-23 | publisher = Jewish Encyclopedia[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hegg, Tim | title = The Virgin Birth – An Inquiry into the Biblical Doctrine | publisher = TorahResource| year = 2007|url = http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/VirginBirth.pdf | accessdate = 2007-08-13 | format = PDF[/tpl]
As late as the eleventh century, Cardinal Humbert of Mourmoutiers still referred to the Nazarene sect as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time.[tpl]Citation | last = Strong | title = Cyclopedia | place = New York | year = 1874 | volume = I | page = 660[/tpl]. Modern scholars believe it is the Pasagini or Pasagians who are referenced by Cardinal Humbert, suggesting the Nazarene sect existed well into the eleventh century and beyond (the Catholic writings of Bonacursus entitled "Against the Heretics"). It is believed that Gregorius of Bergamo, about 1250 CE, also wrote concerning the Nazarenes as the Pasagians.

===Gospel of the Nazarenes===

The Gospel of the Nazarenes is the title given to fragments of one of the lost Jewish-Christian Gospels of Matthew partially reconstructed from the writings of Jerome.

===Patristic references to "Nazarenes"===

In the 4th century, Jerome also refers to Nazarenes as those "...who accept Messiah in such a way that they do not cease to observe the old Law." In his Epistle 79, to Augustine, he said:
[tpl]quote |What shall I say of the Ebionites who pretend to be Christians? To-day there still exists among the Jews in all the synagogues of the East a heresy which is called that of the Minæans, and which is still condemned by the Pharisees; followers are ordinarily called 'Nasarenes'; they believe that Christ, the son of God, was born of the Virgin Mary, and they hold him to be the one who suffered under Pontius Pilate and ascended to heaven, and in whom we also believe. But while they pretend to be both Jews and Christians, they are neither.[tpl]cite web |url= http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=140&letter=N&search=nazarenes#402 |title=Jewish Encyclopedia | contribution = Jerome's Account[/tpl][/tpl]
Jerome viewed a distinction between Nazarenes and Ebionites, a different Jewish sect, but does not comment on whether Nazarene Jews considered themselves to be "Christian" or not or how they viewed themselves as fitting into the descriptions he uses. He clearly equates them with Filaster's Nazarei.Filaster (ca. 397 AD) was a bishop who wrote the "Book of Diverse Heresies" (lived about the time of Epiphanius).  [tpl]Citation | quote = The sect of Filaster (Nazorei/Nazarei) derives somehow from the Nazirites and accepts the Law and prophets | at =p. 73 ft.12 | title = Nazarene Jewish Christianity: from the end of the New Testament period until its disappearance in the fourth century | first = Ray | last = Pritz[/tpl]. His criticism of the Nazarenes is noticeably more direct and critical than that of Epiphanius.
This following creed is from a church at Constantinople at the same period:
[tpl]quote |I renounce all customs, rites, legalisms, unleavened breads & sacrifices of lambs of the Hebrews, and all other feasts of the Hebrews, sacrifices, prayers, aspersions, purifications, sanctifications and propitiations and fasts, and new moons, and Sabbaths, and superstitions, and hymns and chants and observances and Synagogues, and the food and drink of the Hebrews; in one word, I renounce everything Jewish, every law, rite and custom and if afterwards I shall wish to deny and return to Jewish superstition, or shall be found eating with the Jews, or feasting with them, or secretly conversing and condemning the Christian religion instead of openly confuting them and condemning their vain faith, then let the trembling of Gehazi cleave to me, as well as the legal punishments to which I acknowledge myself liable. And may I be anathema in the world to come, and may my soul be set down with Satan and the devils."[tpl]Citation | last = Parks | first = James | title = The Conflict of The Church and The Synagogue | publisher = Atheneum | place = New York | year = 1974 | pages = 397–98[/tpl].[/tpl]
"Nazarenes" are referenced past the fourth century AD as well.  Jacobus de Voragine (1230–98) described James as a "Nazarene" in The Golden Legend, vol 7.  Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) quotes Augustine of Hippo, who was given an apocryphal book called Hieremias by a "Hebrew of the Nazarene Sect", in Catena Aurea — Gospel of Matthew, chapter 27.  So this terminology seems to have remained at least through the 13th century in European discussions.

===Nazarene beliefs===

The beliefs of the Nazarene sect or sects are described through various church fathers and heresiologists.

==Modern "Nazarene" churches==

A number of modern churches use the word "Nazarene" or variants in their name or beliefs:
