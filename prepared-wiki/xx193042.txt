The exterior façade Wells Fargo Center is composed of a six-sided, steel-framed tower that features a combination of tinted continuous double-glazed glass and polished spring rose granite panels. As is common with buildings in Downtown Seattle, the Wells Fargo Center rests on a slope.   The Eastern entrance facing Third Avenue is slightly more than two stories higher than the Western side facing Second Avenue.  On the west side, the building has a public hill climb on two flights of outdoor escalators that were encased in clear tubes until 2006 when they were updated with a simpler, yet more modern glass roof.  The building has three levels of outdoor plazas.
