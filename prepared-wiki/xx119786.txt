The cutting bisects the village into the older part on the east side and the more recent west side. However, there are two main road bridges and four others for pedestrians, some for minor traffic and farm vehicles. The line dates from 1838 and was electrified in the 1960s. It now carries 125 mph trains.
The cutting is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) listed by English Nature.English Nature site with details of Roade cutting
A station serving Roade was situated at the southern end of the village and the cutting, but closed in 1964. The four lines split at the north end of the cutting with the two eastern lines forming the slower Northampton loop, and the other two fast lines heading directly for Rugby. There was a campaign in the 1990s to have the station re-opened for commuter traffic to London, Milton Keynes and Northampton but there are no current plans to add additional stops on the line.

===1969 rail accident===

An accident occurred at the northern end of the cutting, at the junction, on 31 December 1969 when a northbound goods train on the slow lines derailed. A southbound passenger train from Northampton was passing at the time at about 75 mph and collided with the derailed wagons and was partly de-railed itself. The driver of the passenger train was killed.Report on the Derailment and subsequent Collision that occurred on 31st December 1969 near Roade Junction - official report of the accident, accessed 23 July 2011 The cause of the derailment was the failure of a main bearing spring on an empty 16-ton mineral wagon and very similar to a previous incident on the Northampton loop in 1967.
