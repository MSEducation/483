The New River is a 2.2 mile long (3.6 km)New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system stream in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is a tributary of the Ellis River, part of the Saco River watershed flowing to the Atlantic Ocean in Maine.
The New River rises in the Gulf of Slides, a small glacial cirque at the foot of Boott Spur, a southern extension of Mount Washington.  Flowing northeast, the stream drops rapidly down the western slopes of Pinkham Notch, joining the Ellis River in the floor of the notch at the Route 16 crossing, just south of the notch's height of land.
