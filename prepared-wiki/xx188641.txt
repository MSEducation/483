Approximately 450 maquis fighters were enrolled, organised, trained and armed in anticipation of the allied landings.
Within the framework of the Mouvements unis de la Résistance, the Maquis de Vabre became the ''Corps franc de la libération no. 10, before joining the French forces of the interior.
The Maquis de Vabre were structured as three companies, including the compagnie Marc Haguenau which was mainly composed of Jewish fugitive fighters from Tarn. The Jewish scouting organisation Éclaireurs israëlites de France, created by Robert Gamzon, joined the Protestant scouting organisation Éclaireurs unionistes to form this mountain maquis who participated in the liberation of Castres under the banner of the French forces of the interior, taking 4,500 German prisoners. They then joined the French First Army of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny.
