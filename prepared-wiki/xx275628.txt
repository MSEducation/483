[[List of pusher aircraft by configuration]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft configurations, Pusher aircraft

A pusher aircraft is a type of aircraft using propellers placed behind the engines. 

Pushers may be classified according to technical characteristics:
Push-pull configuration

==Conventional layout==

The conventional layout of an aircraft has wings placed ahead of a separated tailplane, but Pusher aircraft address several issues with this model:

===Propeller close to the engine (direct drive)===

====Prop ahead of the tail====

====Propeller behind the tail====

====Engines and props on wings====

====Engines and props on lateral pods====

====Engines and props behind the pilot====

===Engine to propeller transmission by drive shaft, belt or chain===

This class usually has a single engine.

====Propeller ahead of the tail====

====Propeller inside the tail====

====Propeller behind the tail====

====Propeller above fuselage====

==Three surface layout : foreplane, wing(s) and tailplane==

The foreplane or "canard" serves as control or lifting surface or both.

==Canard and tandem layouts==

In a canard layout, there is a smaller wing ahead of the main wing. A tandem layout has both front and aft wings of similar dimensions.

As for conventional layout, the propeller to ground clearance at takeoff is a design issue, so aircraft of this type may include either taller main gear, a skid or ventral fin, a high thrust line, or a reduced propeller diameter.
Direct drive from the engine is the most common form:

===Single engine===

===Two engines===

==Joined wing layout==

==Tailless aircraft and flying wing==

Tailless aircraft lack a horizontal stabilizer, flying wings lack a distinct fuselage, with crew engines, payload etc. contained within the wing structure.

==Rotorcraft, autogyro, gyrodyne==
