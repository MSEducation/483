==History==

Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Mayan times.[tpl]cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink =  | title = Eat this! Enchiladas, Mexican comfort food  | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc.  | date = 2010-11-10 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/11/10/eat-this-enchiladas-mexican-comfort-food/ | accessdate = 2011-05-18 [/tpl] The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was tlaxcalli; the Spanish give it the name tortilla.) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is chīllapītzalli [tpl]IPA-nah|t͡ʃiːlːapiːˈt͡salːi|[/tpl] which is formed of the Nahuatl word for "chili", chīlli [tpl]IPA-nah|ˈt͡ʃiːlːi|[/tpl] and the Nahuatl word for "flute", tlapītzalli [tpl]IPA-nah|t͡ɬapiːˈt͡salːi|[/tpl].Karttunen, F. (1983). An analytical dictionary of Nahuatl. University of Texas Press: USA. page 52 ISBN 0-8061-2421-0 In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, El cocinero mexicano ("The Mexican Chef"), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's Diccionario de Cocina, published in 1845.[tpl]cite journal |last=Pilcher |first=Jeffrey |date=Winter 2008 |title=Was the Taco Invented in Southern California? |journal=Gastronomica |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–38 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |doi=10.1525/gfc.2008.8.1.26[/tpl] An early mention, in English, is a 1914 recipe found in California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook, by Bertha Haffner Ginger.[tpl]cite book | title=California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook| last= Ginger | first= Bertha Haffner  | year= 1914 (2008) | publisher= Applewood Books | volume =  | location= Bedford, Massachusetts (USA) | isbn= 978-1-4290-1256-0 | pages= 49–50 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=lTMmULvFha8C&pg=PA121&dq=California+Mexican-Spanish+Cookbook#v=onepage&q=California%20Mexican-Spanish%20Cookbook&f=false | accessdate = 10 June 2012 [/tpl]

==Varieties==

In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. enchilada tapatia would be a recipe from Jalisco.[tpl]cite web|title=Recipe for Enchiladas Tapatias|url=http://www.mexicanrecipes.me/enchiladastapatias2.htm|accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl]
