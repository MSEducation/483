==Name==

Formerly known as Rudo Polje (Рудо Поље), Karanovac (Карановац) and Rankovićevo (Ранковићево), Kraljevo received its present name, meaning "the King's Town", from King Milan I of Serbia.

==History and sights==

By far its most interesting feature is the Coronation church belonging to Žiča monastery. Here seven kings are said to have been crowned (seven crowns on coat of arms represents seven kings). The church is Byzantine in style, and has been partially restored; but the main tower dates from the year 1210, when it was founded by Saint Sava, the patron saint of Serbia.
The famous monastery of Studenica, [tpl]convert|39|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south by west of Kraljevo, stands high up among the south-western mountains, overlooking the Studenica, a tributary of the Ibar. It consists of a group of old-fashioned timber and plaster buildings, a tall belfry, and a diminutive church of white marble, founded in 1190 by King Stefan Nemanja, who himself turned monk and was canonized as Saint Simeon. The carvings round the north, south and west doors have been partially defaced by the Turks. The inner walls are decorated with Byzantine frescoes, among which only a painting of the Last Supper, and the portraits of five saints, remain un-restored. The dome and narthex are modern additions. Besides the silver shrine of Saint Simeon, many gold and silver ornaments, church vessels and old manuscripts, there are a set of vestments and a reliquary, believed by the monks to have been the property of Saint Sava who founded the first hospital in Studenica in 13th century.
