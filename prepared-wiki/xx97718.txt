Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery  written by Blue Balliett and illustrated by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting is stolen while they are on the way to their art gallery, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, and the rest of Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.
The novel was written for Balliett's classroom intended to deal with real-world issues. Balliett values children's ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that. Chasing Vermeer has won several awards, including the Edgar and the Agatha. In 2006, the sequel entitled The Wright 3 was published, followed by The Calder Game in 2008.

==Inspiration and origins==

Chasing Vermeer is Blue Balliett's first published book. Its original purpose was a book to read to her class for fun.[tpl]cite web|first=Blue|last=Balliett|url=http://www.blueballiettbooks.com/vermeer.html|title=Behind the Scenes|publisher=Blue Balliett Official Site|accessdate=January 12, 2011[/tpl] She realized that a mystery about "real" art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and desired to write what she wished to read.[tpl]cite web|first=Liza|last=Szabla|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3998|title=What Makes Chasing Vermeer So Special?|publisher=Scholastic Teachers|date=May 2004|accessdate=November 29, 2010[/tpl] Chasing Vermeer took about five years to complete, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/authorsandbooks/events/balliett/transcript.htm|title=Author Chat: Blue Balliet|publisher=Scholastic Teachers|date=November 8, 2005|accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl] She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first wrote mainly about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than she had thought it would be.[tpl]cite web|first=Linda M.|last=Castelitto|url=http://www.bookpage.com/0406bp/blue_balliett.html|title=Mystery at the Museum|publisher=BookPage|date=June 2004|accessdate=December 11, 2010[/tpl] rawr [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Balliett used art and blank plates as inspiration for the characters' names. Calder Pillay is derived from the artist Alexander Calder and Petra Andalee was inspired by the architecture in Petra, Jordan.[tpl]cite book|last=Balliett|first=Blue|title=Chasing Vermeer with Afterwords by Leslie Budnick|chapter=Author Q&A|year=2004|publisher=Scholastic|isbn=0-439-37294-1[/tpl] The names were meant to be different, which Balliett considered "fun for a child."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/10/AR2006041001358.html|title=Doing What's Wright|work=The Washington Post|date=April 11, 2006|accessdate=January 13, 2011[/tpl] Balliett felt that she could capture the attention of reluctant readers if they related to characters who enjoyed writing and math.[tpl]cite web|first=Blue|last=Baliett|url=http://www.blueballiettbooks.com/media-awards-reviews/roker.html|title=Blue Balliett on Al Roker|format=Video|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=January 13, 2011[/tpl] Calder and Petra's teacher, Ms. Hussey, was inspired by an old name on Nantucket Island and the old-fashioned word hussy. Balliett compares herself to Ms. Hussey, stating that "we think a lot alike." Some of Ms. Hussey's assignments and dialogue even came from Balliett's classroom. She chose the setting of Hyde Park, Chicago, where she currently lives, because she considered it full of secrets that children could discover.[tpl]cite web|first=Felicia|last=R.

==Plot summary==

The book begins with a mysterious letter that is delivered to three unknown recipients, two women and one man. The letter tells them they are of great need to the sender, but begs them not to tell the police.
Sixth-graders Calder Pillay, who enjoys puzzles and pentominoes, and Petra Andalee, who aspires to be a writer, are classmates at the Middle School in Hyde Park, Chicago. Their young teacher, Ms. Hussey, is very interested in art and teaches them in a creative way. Through her pressing questions, they discover the artist Johannes Vermeer and his paintings, especially A Lady Writing and The Geographer. Petra also finds a used book called Lo!, written by Charles Fort, at the local Powell's Books, owned by a man named Mr. Watch. They also meet an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Sharpe, who is also a fan of Vermeer and Fort. Calder receives letters from his best friend Tommy Segovia, who is currently living in New York City with a new stepfather.
The children learn that A Lady Writing was traveling from The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. to Hyde Park. The next day there is a story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared. A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he will not give back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings were truly painted by him. This sparks worldwide uproar. Calder and Petra investigate as their friendship grows. Mrs. Sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and Ms. Hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief's letter. Calder and Petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local Delia Dell Hall, and they sneak out and find it. They barely escape from the thief, who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police. They learn that the man is Xavier Glitts,also knowned as glitter man,who was posing as Tommy's stepfather under the name Fred Steadman. A known art thief, he was asked to steal the painting and sell it for sixty million dollars. The other recipient of the letter is revealed to be Mr. Watch.

===Code===

As stated in the preface, there is a code hidden in the paintings throughout the book. This was an idea of Brett Helquist and Balliett's editor, Tracy Mack.[tpl]cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Devereaux|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20040628/22730-spring-2004-flying-starts.html|title=Spring 2004 Flying Starts|work=Publishers Weekly|date=June 28, 2004|accessdate=January 12, 2011[/tpl] The code involves images of pentominoes and a frog, which is a recurring theme in the book. To decode the code, one must count the number of frogs in every other illustration, as well as find the hidden pentomino. Once these facts are collected, the same code presented in the story that Calder and Tommy use in their letters in the book can be used to decode the message. When decoded, the message reads "The Lady Lives."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/blueballiett/pdfs/chasingvermeer_challenge_solution.pdf|title=Reader's Challenge Solution|publisher=Scholastic.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010[/tpl]

==Genre==

Chasing Vermeer is classified in the mystery genre, although it was described by Liz Szabla of Scholastic as "a puzzle, wrapped in a mystery, disguised as an adventure, and delivered as a work of art." Scholastic's teaching website additionally added suspense due to the surprise ending.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/collateral.jsp?id=31524|title=Chasing Vermeer Lesson Plan|publisher=Scholastic Teachers|accessdate=January 14, 2011[/tpl]

==Themes==

Some of Balliett's "real-world ideas" in Chasing Vermeer were "Do coincidences mean anything?" and "What is art and what makes it valuable?"[tpl]cite web|first=Blue|last=Balliett|url=http://www.blueballiettbooks.com/bio.html|title=Blue Balliett: Bio|publisher=Blue Balliett official site|accessdate=January 13, 2011[/tpl] Balliett says her "central message" is "kids are powerful thinkers, and their ideas are valuable, and that adults don't have all the answers."[tpl]cite web|first=Karen|last=Springen|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2008/04/10/going-mobile-with-blue-balliett.html|title=Talking with Blue Balliett|work=Newsweek|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=December 12, 2010[/tpl]
A book by Rita Soltan entitled Reading Raps: A Book Club Guide for Librarians, Kids, and Families analyzed Chasing Vermeer's themes as follows:
 Deception and problem solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players use a variety of ways to hide the truth while the children employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together the clues to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.[tpl]cite book|first=Rita|last=Soltan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAg5b4Ofj4MC&pg=PA19&dq=chasing+vermeer+coinciden#v=onepage&q=chasing%20vermeer%20&f=false|title=Reading Raps: A Book Club Guide for Librarians, Kids, and Families|chapter=Chasing Vermeer|pages=20|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59158-234-2[/tpl] 
As the thief gains publicity by challenging the community to figure out which paintings claimed to be Vermeer's were indeed painted by him, everyone starts to look at the depth in art. Sondra Eklund, who writes a book review blog, noted that the reader was left with the impression to study Vermeer's paintings and art more closely.[tpl]cite web|first=Sondra|last=Eklund|url=http://www.sonderbooks.com/ChildrensFiction/chasingvermeer.html|title=Sonderbooks Book Review of Chasing Vermeer|publisher=Sonderbooks|date=October 1, 2004|accessdate=January 14, 2011[/tpl] In the book, Ms. Hussey challenges  her class to the question, "What is art?"
Other themes include chance and coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the children to list and pay attention to coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.

 "It’s been fascinating, watching this whole process, because Plan B did a wonderful job. They went through two screenwriters, and they’ve gone through two directors. It’s sort of like a house of cards. I have rights again. If they get it all together again, they’ll jump on it. But they don’t have exclusive rights anymore."[tpl]cite web|first=Karen|last=Springen|url=http://www.blueballiettbooks.com/media-awards-reviews/PWQ&A_Danger%20Box.pdf|title=Q&A with Blue Balliett|work=Publishers Weekly|date=August 19, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011[/tpl]
