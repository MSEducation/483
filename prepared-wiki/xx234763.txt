TOTP@Play is a music television programme, that was broadcast on UKTV-owned digital youth entertainment television channel, Play UK. The programme ran daily on weekday afternoons from October 2000 until 2001.
It was a spin off of the long-running BBC music programme, Top of the Pops, and was one of several Play UK programmes to utilise the TOTP brand. These programmes were able to use the BBC-owned TOTP brand commercially as BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, held (and still holds) a 50% stake in the UKTV group of channels. BBC Worldwide also publishes the TOTP magazine.
The programme was broadcast for three hours each weekday afternoon as a live music and entertainment magazine programme, featuring interviews with celebrities, interactive phone-in elements (such as music video requests), competitions and magazine features. It was similar in style to the rival programme MTV Select, which aired in a similar afternoon timeslot on MTV UK & Ireland.
TOTP@Play utilised a number of presenters during its run, including Josie d'Arby, Vernon Kay, Joe Mace and Dermot O'Leary.
