[[Flag of the Arab League]]

CATEGORIES: International flags, Arab League, Flags of organizations

The flag of the League of Arab States comprises a green banner bearing the seal of the League of Arab States. The twenty-two links in the chain represent the twenty-two members of the League at the time of the flag's adoption. The script gives the name of the organization: "League of Arab States".
There are also several flags for the Arab League, usually seen at Arab League summits - one with an inverted Arab League flag with a white background for the President of the summit, clearly seen in the Arab League Summit in Beirut (2002).
Older Arab League flags have the chains in red or black, the Arabic script in black or gold with green or white crescents, usually adopted through the 1950s and 1970s.
