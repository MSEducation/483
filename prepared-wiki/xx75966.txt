[[Skyline]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural terminology, City, Landscape art, Skyscrapers

A skyline is  the artificial horizon that a city's overall structure creates.  Skylines serve as a kind of fingerprint of a city, as no two skylines are alike.  For this reason news and sports programs, television shows, and movies often display the skyline of a city to set location.
The Sky Line of New York City was a new term in 1896, when it was the title of a color lithograph by Charles Graham for the color supplement of the New-York Journal.New York Public Library: "Moving Uptown": "When Charles Graham's view of New York was published, the new term used in the title, "sky line," caught on immediately." 
Paul D. Spreiregen, FAIA, has called a skyline "a physical representation a city's facts of life ... a potential work of art ... its collective vista."
