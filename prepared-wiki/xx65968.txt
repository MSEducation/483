[[Old Hungarian alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: History of Hungary, Hungarian language, Runiform scripts, Unicode proposals

The Old Hungarian script is an alphabetic writing system used by the Hungarians in the Middle Ages.
The Hungarians settled the Carpathian Basin in 896. After the establishment of the Christian Hungarian kingdom, the script fell into disuse because Latin alphabet was adopted. In remote regions of Transylvania, however, the script remained in marginal use by the Székely Magyars at least until the 17th century, giving its Hungarian name székely rovásírás.
The Old Hungarian script has also been described as "runic" or "runiform" because it is superficially reminiscent of the Germanic runic alphabet.Everson & Szelp (2012) The English name in ISO 15924 is Old Hungarian (Hungarian Runic).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/codechanges.html|publisher=ISO 15924|title=ISO 15924/RA Notice of Changes[/tpl]Code request for the Rovas script in ISO 15924 (2012-10-20)

==Name==

In modern Hungarian, the script is known formally as [tpl]lang|hu|székely írás[/tpl] 'Szekler script'.[tpl]audio|Szekely_rovasiras.ogg|listen[/tpl] The writing system also called as  [tpl]lang|hu|rovásírás[/tpl], [tpl]lang|hu|székely rovásírás[/tpl], and [tpl]lang|hu|székely-magyar írás[/tpl] (or simply [tpl]lang|hu|rovás[/tpl] 'notch, score').From the verb [tpl]lang|hu|ró[/tpl] 'to carve', 'to score' since the letters were usually carved on wood or sticks. 

==History==

===Origins===

The Hungarian Runes are derived from the Old Turkic script,Róna-Tas (1987, 1988) itself recorded in inscriptions dating from c. AD 720.
The Old Turkic script was presumably derived from Asian scripts such as the Pahlavi and Sogdian alphabets, or possibly from Karosthi, all of which are in turn remotely derived from the Aramaic script.András Róna-Tas: On the Development and Origin of the East Turkic "Runic" Script (In: Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungariae XLI (1987), p. 7-14
Speakers of Proto-Hungarian would have come into contact with Turkic peoples during the 7th or 8th century, in the context of the Turkic expansion, as is also evidenced by numerous Turkic loanwords in Proto-Hungarian.
All the letters but one for sounds which were shared by Turkic and Ancient Hungarian can be related to their Old Turkic counterparts. Most of the missing characters were derived by script internal extensions, rather than borrowings, but a small number of characters seem to derive from Greek, such as 15px|eF 'eF'.Új Magyar Lexikon (New Hungarian Encyclopaedia) - Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1962. (Volume 5) ISBN 963-05-2808-8 
The modern Hungarian term for this special script (coined in the 19th century) rovás derives from the verb róni ('to score') which is derived from old Uralic, general Hungarian terminology describing the technique of writing (írni 'to write', betű 'letter', bicska 'knife (also: for carving letters)') derive from Turkic,András Róna-Tas A magyar írásbeliség török eredetéhez (In: Klára Sándor (ed.) Rovás és Rovásírás p.9-14 — Szeged, 1992, ISBN 963-481-885-4) which further supports transmission via Turkic alphabets.

===Medieval Hungary===

Epigraphic evidence for the use of the Old Hungarian script in medieval Hungary dates to the 10th century,   for example, from HomokmégyIstván Fodor - György Diószegi - László Legeza: Őseink nyomában. (On the scent of our ancestors) -  Magyar Könyvklub-Helikon Kiadó, Budapest, 1996. ISBN 963-208-400-4 (Page 82)  The latter inscription was found on a fragment of a quiver made of bone. Although there have been several attempts to interpret it, the meaning of it is still unclear.
In 1000, with the coronation of Stephen I of Hungary, Hungary (previously an alliance of mostly nomadic tribes) became a Kingdom. The Latin alphabet was adopted as official script, however Old Hungarian continued to be used in the vernacular.
The runic script was first mentioned in the 13th century Chronicle of Simon of Kéza,Dóra Tóth-Károly Bera: Honfoglalás és őstörténet. Aquila, Budapest, 1996. ISBN 963-8276-96-7 where he stated that the Székelys may use the script of the Vlachs,Drăgoescu, Anton. Istoria României: Transilvania. Vol. I, Ch. 4,p. 34Adolf Armbruster. Romanitatea Românilor: The History of an Idea. Editura Enciclopedică. Ch1.3. This is further strengthened by the quote by Keza: Blackis, qui ipsorum (Romanorum) fuere pastores et coloni, remanentibus sponte in Pannonia. possibly making a confusion between the runes and Cyrillic script (as the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet was used to write the Romanian language till 1860–1862 and remained in occasional use until ca. 1920): "... non tamen in plano Panonie, sed cum Blackis in montibus confinii sortem habuerunt, unde Blakis commixti litteris ipsorum uti perhibentur" (="...although not on the Pannonian Plain but among the borderland mountains along with the Vlachs where they mixed up with them and so allegedly they use their letters").Simon Keza, Endlicher, p. 100 The earliest surviving copy of the actual alphabet was found is an incunabulum from 1483, found at the library of the castle of Nikolsburg, now Mikulov in Moravia, hand-written onto the endpaper of the printed book. This alphabet lists 35 letters and 15 ligatures with Latin transcriptions.

===Early Modern period===

The Old Hungarian script became part of folk art in several areas during this period.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
In Royal Hungary, Old Hungarian script was used less, although there are relics from this territory, too.
There is another copy  – similar to the Nikolsburg Alphabet – of the Old Hungarian alphabet, dated 1609. The inscription from Énlaka, dated 1668, is an example of the "folk art use".
There are a number of inscriptions ranging from the 17th to the early 19th[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] centuries, including examples from   Kibéd, Csejd, Makfalva, Szolokma, Marosvásárhely, Csíkrákos, Mezőkeresztes, Nagybánya, Torda, Felsőszemeréd http://www.felvidek.ma/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7929, Kecskemét and Kiskunhalas.

Pp. 366-368. was first described in late Humanist/Baroque scholarship, in 1598 by János Telegdi in his primer, "Rudimenta Priscae Hunnorum Linguae", where he presents his understanding of the script. It also contains Hungarian texts written with runes, for example, the Lord's Prayer.
In the 19th century scholars began to research the rules and the other features of the Old Hungarian script. From this time the name rovásírás 'runic writing' began to enter popular consciousness in Hungary, and script historians in other countries began to use the terms "Old Hungarian", "Altungarisch", and so on. Because the Old Hungarian script had been replaced by Latin, linguistic researchers in the 20th century had to reconstruct the alphabet from historic sources. Gyula Sebestyén, ethnographer, folklorist and Gyula (Julius) Németh, philologist, linguist, turcologist did the lion's share of this work. Sebestyén's publications, Rovás és rovásírás (Runes and runic writing, Budapest, 1909) and A magyar rovásírás hiteles emlékei (The authentic relics of Hungarian runic writing, Budapest, 1915) contain valuable information on the topic.

===Popular revival===

Beginning with Adorján Magyar in 1915, the script has been promulgated as a means for writing modern Hungarian. These groups approached the question of representation of the vowels of modern Hungarian in different ways. Adorján Magyar made use of characters to distinguish a/á and e/é but did not distinguish the other vowels by length. A school led by Sándor Forrai from 1974 onward did also distinguish i/í, o/ó, ö/ő, u/ú, and ü/ű. The revival has become part of significant ideological nationalist subculture not only in Hungary (largely centered in Budapest), but also amongst the Hungarian diaspora, particularly in the United States and Canada.Maxwell, Alexander (2004). "Contemporary Hungarian Rune-Writing: Ideological Linguistic Nationalism within a Homogenous Nation", Anthropos, 99: 2004, pp. 161-175
Old Hungarian has seen other usages in the modern period, sometimes in association with or referencing Hungarian neopaganism,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] similar to the way in which Norse neopagans have taken up the Germanic runes, and Celtic neopagans have taken up Ogham script for various purposes. The use of the script sometimes has a political undertone, as they can be found from time to time in graffiti with a variety of content.

==Epigraphy==

The inscription corpus includes:

==Characters==

The runic alphabet includes 42 letters. As in the Old Turkic script, some consonants have two forms, to be used with back vowels (a, á, o, ó, u, ú) and front vowels (e, ë, é, i, í, ö, ő, ü, ű) respectively. The alphabet does not contain the letters for the phonemes dz, dzs of modern Hungarian, since these are relative recent developments in the language's history. Nor does it have letters for Latin q, w, x and y.
For more information about the transliteration's pronunciation, see Hungarian alphabet.

The Hungarian runes also include some non-alphabetical runes which are not ligatures but separate signs. These are called [tpl]lang|la|capita dictionum[/tpl]. Further research is needed to define their origin and traditional usage. Some examples:

==Features==

Old Hungarian letters were usually written from right to left on sticks. Later, in Transylvania, they appeared on several media. Writings on walls also were right to left and not boustrophedon style (alternating direction right to left and then left to right).
The numbers are almost the same as the Roman, Etruscan, and Chuvash numerals. Numbers of livestock were carved on tally sticks and the sticks were then cut in two lengthwise to avoid later disputes.

==Unicode==

Old Hungarian has been provisionally assigned the Unicode range U+10C80..10CFF. A number of proposals for encoding the script, which differed in some regards from one another, were taken into consideration when the assignment was made. The most recent ballot for the script is based on Everson & Szelp 2012 (Consolidated proposal for encoding the Old Hungarian script in the UCS).

==Pre-Unicode encodings==

A set of closely related 8-bit code pages exist, devised in the 1990s by Gabor Hosszú. These were mapped to Latin-1 or Latin-2 character set fonts. After installing one of them and applying their formatting to the document – because of the lack of capital letters – runic characters could be entered in the following way: those letters which are unique letters in today's Hungarian orthography are virtually lowercase ones, and can be written by simply pressing the specific key; and since the modern digraphs equal to separate rovás letters, they were encoded as 'uppercase' letters, i.e. in the space originally restricted for capitals. Thus, typing a lowercase g will produce the rovas character for the sound marked with Latin script g, but entering an uppercase G will amount to a rovás sign equivalent to a digraph gy in Latin-based Hungarian orthography.
