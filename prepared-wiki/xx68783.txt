</ref> It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.<ref>[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf#page=8 Nuclear proliferation through coal burning] â€” Gordon J. Aubrecht, II, Ohio State University</ref> In addition, fossil fuel waste causes [[global warming]], which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes, flooding, and other weather events. The [[World Nuclear Association]] provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced (in UK and USA) from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear.<ref name="wna">[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.html|title=Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors[/tpl]</ref>

==Footprint by country==

The world-average ecological footprint in 2007 was 2.7 global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic situation.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The GHG footprint differs from the ecological footprint in that the former is expressed in units of GHG warming potential (GGWP) and is generated by products or services, whereas the latter is expressed in units of land area and is generated by whole societies.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
