SoundHound (known as Midomi until December 2009) is a mobile device service that allows users to identify music by humming, singing or playing a recorded track. The service was launched by Melodis Corporation (now SoundHound Inc), under Chief Executive Keyvan Mohajer in 2007 and has received funding from Global Catalyst Partners, TransLink Capital and Walden Venture Capital.

==Features==

SoundHound is a music search engine available on the Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Phone Store, and on June 5, 2013, was available on the BlackBerry 10 platform. It enables users to identify music by playing, singing or humming a piece. It is also possible to speak or type the name of the artist, composer, song and piece. Unlike competitor Shazam, SoundHound can recognise tracks from singing, humming, speaking, or typing, as well as from a recording.[tpl]cite news|last=Dolcourt|first=Jessica|title=First Look video: Shazam for iPhone|url=http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-9992639-12.html|accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=16 July 2008[/tpl] Sound matching is achieved through the company's 'Sound2Sound' technology, which  can match even poorly-hummed performances to professional recordings.
The app then returns the lyrics (if any), links to videos on YouTube, links to iTunes, ringtones, the ability to launch Pandora Radio,[tpl]cite news | url=http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/05/26/soundhounds-new-voice-app-hound-wants-to-change-the-way-we-search/ | title=SoundHound’s new voice app "Hound" wants to change the way we search | date=26 May 2011 | accessdate=2 October 2012 | last=Boyd Myers | first=Courtney | newspaper=The Next Web[/tpl] as well as recommendations for other music.[tpl]cite news|last=Dolcourt|first=Jessica|title=SoundHound for iPhone channels iTunes, recommends beats|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20037798-233.html|accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=2 March 2011[/tpl] A feature called LiveLyrics displays a song's lyrics in time with the music, if they are available. Double-tapping on those lyrics moves the music to that point in the song.[tpl]cite news|last=Cabebe|first=Jaymar|title=SoundHound adds LiveLyrics|url=http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20081243-12/soundhound-adds-livelyrics/|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=20 July 2011[/tpl] It is also possible for users to play music from their iPhone's iPod library through the app. If lyrics are available for a song, it will show them as it plays.
There are three versions of the app: SoundHound, SoundHound Infinity and Hound. SoundHound is free but has banner ads, while SoundHound Infinity (styled SoundHound ∞), priced at £4.99 in the UK or $6.99 in the US, is the premium offering and has the same functionality but without banner ads. Hound only allows users to search for artists or songs by speaking into it. Similar to the SoundHound app, Hound then returns a song preview, lyrics, album art and videos as well as artist bios and tour dates.
