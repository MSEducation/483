Crotalus lannomi is a venomous pit viper species found in Mexico in Jalisco. No subspecies is recognized.[tpl]ITIS |id=585826 |taxon=Crotalus lannomi |accessdate=1 August 2007[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The specific name, lannomi, is in honor of Joseph R. Lannom, Jr., who collected the type specimen.

==Description==

This species was described from a single specimen, a female [tpl]convert|63.8|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, presumed to have been an adult. The presence of some larger scales on top of its head and a longer tail are the traits Tanner (1966) suggested are primitive. Mostly on this basis, his opinion was this species is most closely related to C. stejnegeri, though its head and body are not as slender as those of C. stejnegeri.

==Geographic range==

C. lannomi is found in western Mexico in Jalisco and Colima. The type locality is "1.8 miles west of the pass, Puerto Los Mazos, or 22 miles west by road from the Río Tuxcacuesco, a branch of the Río América on Mexican Highway No. 80, Jalisco, Mexico".

==Conservation status==

This species is classified as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2001).[tpl]Redlist species|no=64320|genus=Crotalus|species=lannomi|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl] Species] are listed as such when information is inadequate to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. It may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this category indicates more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show a threatened classification is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified. The population trend was unknown when assessed in 2007.[tpl]Redlist CC2001|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl]

==Rediscovery==

In July 2008, this rattlesnake was rediscovered in foothills of Colima, Mexico.Rediscovery of the Rare Autlán Long-Tailed Rattlesnake, Crotalus lannomi - Over the course of several weeks in July 2008, five additional specimens of long-tailed rattlesnakes were found in the foothills of Colima, México. Based on features of lepidosis, this new material is referred to Crotalus lannomi. The snakes were found approximately 50 km SW of the type locality.
