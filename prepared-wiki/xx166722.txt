==History==

Mousesports was formed in 2002 in Berlin, Germany as a Counter-Strike team under the same given name. The team began to compete in small tournaments, which gradually lead to their progression in larger ones, as well. By 2006, when G7 Teams was created, Mousesports was one of the greatest gaming organizations in Europe, consisting of Counter-Strike, Warcraft III, Quake 4 and Unreal Tournament divisions.
On May 13, 2007, Mousesports announced that it had acquired Nihilum, the officially-recognized premiere worldwide World of Warcraft organization, with Nihilum recognized as a subsidiary of Mousesports.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2010-10-22|url=http://www.fnatic.com/scene/4381/Nihilum-Joins-Mousesports.html|title=Nihilum Joins Mousesports |publisher=Fnatic|date=2007-05-14|author=Vandevorst, Nicolas[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/news/archive-news2007.html |title=Blizzard Exhibition Match between #1 guild and #1 PvP team |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment [/tpl] The guild was remade into a community called "Nihilum: Mousesports MMO".

In March 2012, Mousesports announced that it would be ending its support of its Counter-Strike division, citing the organization's perception of the lack of market, considering the rising prominence of Dota 2 and League of Legends.[tpl]cite web| last = Tasha | first=Lol | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/52378-mousesports_part_ways_with_CS_16 | title = mousesports part ways with CS 1.6 | publisher = SK Gaming | date = 2012-03-17 [/tpl] As of October, Mousesports has announced that they have mutually parted ways with their Dota 2 team.
