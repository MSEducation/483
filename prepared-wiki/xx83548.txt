Ramon Pichot Gironès ([tpl]IPA-ca|rəˈmom piˈtʃɔt[/tpl]) (1872 - 1 March 1925) was a Catalan and Spanish artist. He painted in an impressionist style.
He was a good friend of Pablo Picasso and an early mentor to young Salvador Dalí. Salvador Dalí met Ramon Pichot Gironès in Cadaqués, Spain when Salvador was only 10 years old. Ramon also made many trips to France. Once in a while, Salvador Dalí and his family would go on a trip with Ramon Pichot and his family.
He married Germaine Pichot, a well-known artist's model, in 1906. Together, they had a restaurant near the Bateau Lavoir, called La maison rose. Pichot left Paris after World War I but returned often to buy books, as he had turned into a bibliophile. On such a trip, he suddenly died on May 1, 1925. Picasso was so shaken by this that he included Ramon's figure in the painting Three Dancers on which he was working at the time.John Richardson A Life of Picasso I: 139
