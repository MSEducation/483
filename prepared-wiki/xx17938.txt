Species with different numbers of receptor cell types would have color vision requiring a different number of primaries.  For example, for species known as tetrachromats, with four different color receptors, one would use four primary colors.  Since humans can only see to 380 nanometers (violet), but tetrachromats can see into the ultraviolet to about 300 nanometers, this fourth primary color for tetrachromats is located in the shorter-wavelength range.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Timothy H. |date=July 2006 |title=What Birds See |journal=Scientific American |volume=295 |pages=68–75 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0706-68 |url=http://www.csulb.edu/web/labs/bcl/elab/avian%20vision_intro.pdf[/tpl]
Many birds and marsupials are tetrachromats, and it has been suggested that some human females are tetrachromats as well,Backhaus, Kliegl & Werner "Color vision, perspectives from different disciplines" (De Gruyter, 1998), pp.115–116, section 5.5.Pr.

Most placental mammals other than primates have only two types of color receptors and are therefore dichromats; to them, there are only two primary colors.
It would be incorrect to assume that the world "looks tinted" to an animal (or human) with anything other than the human standard of three color receptors.  To an animal (or human) born that way, the world would look normal to it, but the animal's ability to detect and discriminate colors would be different from that of a human with normal color vision.  If a human and an animal both look at a natural color, they see it as natural; however, if both look at a color reproduced via primary colors, such as on a color television screen, the human may see it as matching the natural color, while the animal does not, since the primary colors have been chosen to suit human capabilities.

==Additive primaries==

Media that combine emitted lights to create the sensation of a range of colors are using the additive color system. Typically, the primary colors used are red, green, and blue.[ref]

</ref>
Television and other computer and video displays are a common example of the use of additive primaries and the RGB color model. The exact colors chosen for the primaries are a technological compromise between the available phosphors (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large color triangle to allow a large gamut of colors. The ITU-R BT.709-5/sRGB primaries are typical.
Additive mixing of red and green light produces shades of yellow, orange, or brown."Some Experiments on Color", Nature 111, 1871, in [tpl]cite book |title=Scientific Papers |author=John William Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) |year=1899 |publisher=University Press |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KWMSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA84&dq=date:0-1923+light+red+green+yellow-or-orange [/tpl]  Mixing green and blue produces shades of cyan, and mixing red and blue produces shades of purple, including magenta. Mixing nominally equal proportions of the additive primaries results in shades of grey or white; the color space that is generated is called an RGB color space.
The CIE 1931 color space defines monochromatic primary colors with wavelengths of 435.8 nm (violet), 546.1 nm (green) and 700 nm (red).  The corners of the color triangle are therefore on the spectral locus, and the triangle is about as big as it can be.  No real display device uses such primaries, as the extreme wavelengths used for violet and red result in a very low luminous efficiency.

===Recent developments in primary colors===

Color practice technology is usefully contrasted with color theory science because science assumes perfect conditions, whereas commercially available products must deliver impressive results at affordable prices.  Some recent TV and computer displays are starting to add a fourth "primary" of yellow, often in a four point square pixel area, to get brighter pure yellows and larger color gamut.[tpl]cite web |title=Sharp four primary color TVs enable over one trillion colors |first=Jude |last=Garvey |publisher=gizmag.com |date=2010-01-20 |url=http://www.gizmag.com/sharp-4-primary-color-tvs-enables-trillion-colors/13823/ [/tpl]
Even the four-primary technology does not yet reach the range of colors the human eye is theoretically capable of perceiving (as defined by the sample-based estimate called the Pointer Gamut[ref]

</ref>), with 4-primary LED prototypes providing typically about 87% and 5-primary prototypes about 95%.  Several firms, including Samsung and Mitsubishi, have demonstrated LED displays with five or six "primaries", or color  LED point light sources per pixel.<ref>

</ref>  A recent academic literature review claims a gamut of 99% can be achieved with 5-primary LED technology.<ref>

</ref>
While technology for achieving a wider gamut appears to be within reach, other issues remain, for example affordability, dynamic range, brilliance. An even bigger problem is that there exists hardly any source material recorded in this wider gamut, nor is it possible to somehow recover this information in existing pictures, as it was never stored. Regardless, industry is still exploring a wide variety of "primary" active light sources (per pixel) with the goal of matching the capability of human color perception within a broadly affordable price. One example of a potentially affordable, but yet unproven active light hybrid places a LED screen over a plasma light screen, each with different "primaries". Because both LED and plasma technologies are many decades old (plasma pixels going back to the 1960s) and because sales are verging on a billion, both have become so affordable that they could be combined.

==Subtractive primaries==

Media that use reflected light and colorants to produce colors are using the subtractive color method of color mixing.

===CMYK color model, or four-color printing===

In the printing industry, to produce the varying colors the subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow are applied together in varying amounts.  Before the color names cyan and magenta were in common use, these primaries were often known as blue-green and purple, or in some circles as blue and red, respectively, and their exact color has changed over time with access to new pigments and technologies.[tpl]cite book |title=General Physics and Its Application to Industry and Everyday Life |author=Ervin Sidney Ferry |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1921 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3rYXAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA621&dq=date:0-1923+additive+color+mixing+primary [/tpl]
Mixing yellow and cyan produces green colors; mixing yellow with magenta produces reds, and mixing magenta with cyan produces blues. In theory, mixing equal amounts of all three pigments should produce grey, resulting in black when all three are applied in sufficient density, but in practice they tend to produce muddy brown colors. For this reason, and to save ink and decrease drying times, a fourth pigment, black, is often used in addition to cyan, magenta, and yellow.
The resulting model is the so-called CMYK color model. The abbreviation stands for cyan, magenta, yellow, and key—black is referred to as the key color, a shorthand for the key printing plate that impressed the artistic detail of an image, usually in black ink.[tpl]cite book |title=Printing for School and Shop: A Textbook for Printers' Apprentices, Continuation Classes, and for General use in Schools |author=Frank S. Henry |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1917 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UAAvAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA292&dq=black+date:0-1923+key-plate+printing+color [/tpl]
In practice, colorant mixtures in actual materials such as paint tend to be more complex. Brighter or more saturated colors can be created using natural pigments instead of mixing, and natural properties of pigments can interfere with the mixing. For example, mixing magenta and green in acrylic creates a dark cyan—something which would not happen if the mixing process were perfectly subtractive.
In the subtractive model, adding white to a color, whether by using less colorant or by mixing in a reflective white pigment such as zinc oxide, does not change the color's hue but does reduce its saturation.  Subtractive color printing works best when the surface or paper is white, or close to it.
A system of subtractive color does not have a simple chromaticity gamut analogous to the RGB color triangle, but a gamut that must be described in three dimensions.  There are many ways to visualize such models, using various 2D chromaticity spaces or in 3D color spaces.See the google image results for "cmyk gamut" for examples.

==History==

===RYB color model===

RYB (red, yellow, and blue) is a historical set of subtractive primary colors. It is primarily used in art and art education, particularly painting.[tpl]cite book |title=Designer's Color Manual: The Complete Guide to Color Theory and Application |author=Tom Fraser and Adam Banks |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2004 |isbn=0-8118-4210-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WXZNPaX-LvcC&pg=PA27&dq=red-yellow-blue+color+mixing [/tpl] It predates modern scientific color theory.
RYB make up the primary colors in a painter's color wheel; the secondary colors VOG (violet, orange, and green) make up another triad.  Triads are formed by 3 equidistant colors on a particular color wheel; neither RYB nor VOG is equidistant on a perceptually uniform color wheel, but rather have been defined to be equidistant in the RYB wheel.[tpl]cite book |title=Color Choices |author=Stephen Quiller |publisher=Watson–Guptill |year=2002 |isbn=0-8230-0697-2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jiUTZQj_v5QC&pg=PA12&dq=what-is-a-color-wheel+spaced+red+yellow+blue [/tpl]
Painters have long used more than three "primary" colors in their palettes—and at one point considered red, yellow, blue, and green to be the four primaries.For instance Leonardo da Vinci wrote of these four simple colors in his notebook circa 1500. See Rolf Kuenhi. "Development of the Idea of Simple Colors in the 16th and Early 17th Centuries". Color Research and Application.  Volume 32, Number 2, April 2007. Red, yellow, blue, and green are still widely considered the four psychological primary colors,[tpl]cite book |title=Basic Photographic Materials and Processes |author=Resultby Leslie D.

During the 18th century, as theorists became aware of Isaac Newton's scientific experiments with light and prisms, red, yellow, and blue became the canonical primary colors—supposedly the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes.  This theory became dogma, despite abundant evidence that red, yellow, and blue primaries cannot mix all other colors, and has survived in color theory to the present day.Bruce MacEvoy.  "Do 'Primary' Colors Exist?" (Material Trichromacy section).  Handprint.  Accessed 10 August 2007.
Using red, yellow, and blue as primaries yields a relatively small gamut, in which, among other problems, colorful greens, cyans, and magentas are impossible to mix, because red, yellow, and blue are not well-spaced around a perceptually uniform color wheel.  For this reason, modern three- or four-color printing processes, as well as color photography, use cyan, yellow, and magenta as primaries instead."Development of the Idea of Simple Colors in the 16th and Early 17th Centuries". Color Research and Application.  Volume 32, Number 2, April 2007.  Most painters include colors in their palettes which cannot be mixed from yellow, red, and blue paints, and thus do not fit within the RYB color model.  Some who do use a three-color palette opt for the more evenly spaced cyan, yellow, and magenta used by printers, and others paint with 6 or more colors to widen their gamuts.Bruce MacEvoy.  "Secondary Palette."  Handprint.  Accessed 14 August 2007.  For general discussion see Bruce MacEvoy.  "Mixing With a Color Wheel" (Saturation Costs section).  Handprint.  Accessed 14 August 2007. The cyan, magenta, and yellow used in printing are sometimes known as "process blue," "process red," and "process yellow."Cheap Brochure Printing – Process Blue / Process Red / Process Yellow / Process Black

==Psychological primaries==

The opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cones and rods in an antagonistic manner.  The three types of cones have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels: red versus green, blue versus yellow, and black versus white.[tpl]cite book |title=A Text-book of physiology |author=Michael Foster |publisher=Lea Bros. & Co |year=1891 |page=921 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Swn8ztLFTdkC&pg=RA1-PA921&dq=hering+red-green+yellow-blue+young-helmholtz+date:0-1923 [/tpl] Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those of the other color. The particular colors considered by an observer to be uniquely representative of the concepts red, yellow, green, blue, white, and black might be called "psychological primary colors", because any other color can be described in terms of some combination of these.
