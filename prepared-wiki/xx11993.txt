[[Writers of the Future]]

CATEGORIES: L. Ron Hubbard, Science fiction awards, Scientology organizations, Creative writing programs

Writers of the Future (WOTF) is a science fiction and fantasy story contest that was established by L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1980s. A sister contest, Illustrators of the Future, presents awards for science fiction art.  Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of "giving back" to the field that had defined his professional writing life.  The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers.  Notable past winners of WOTF include Stephen Baxter, Karen Joy Fowler, James Alan Gardner, Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Jay Lake, Michael H. Payne, Patrick Rothfuss, Robert Reed, Dean Wesley Smith, Sean Williams, Dave Wolverton, Nancy Farmer, and David Zindell. 
The winning stories are published in the yearly anthology L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of Future.[ref]
