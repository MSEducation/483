An electricity meter or energy meter is a device that measures the amount of electric energy consumed by a residence, business, or an electrically powered device.
Electricity meters are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the kilowatt hour kWh. Periodic readings of electricity meters establishes billing cycles and energy used during a cycle.
In settings when energy savings during certain periods are desired, meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. "Time of day" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for demand response load shedding during peak load periods.E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System, accessed 22 August 2009.

==History==

===Direct current (DC)===

As commercial use of electric energy spread in the 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers for the cost of energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a DC electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed, weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers. 
An early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter.  This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter.  As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column.  Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere-hours.  Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit.  It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply. 
In 1885 Ferranti offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.Graeme Gooday The morals of measurement: accuracy, irony,and trust in late Victorian electrical practice, Cambridge University Press, 2004 ISBN 0-521-43098-4, p 232-241
The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a DC meter by Dr Hermann Aron, who patented it in 1883. Hugo Hirst of the British General Electric Company introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888. Unlike their AC counterparts, DC meters did not measure energy.  Instead they measured charge in ampere-hours.  Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed.  For example: if a meter recorded that 100 ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200 volt supply, then 20 kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied.  Aron's meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials.

===Alternating current (AC)===

The first specimen of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced on the basis of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy's patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory at the end of the same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters.[tpl]cite web|author=Eugenii Katz |url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/blathy.html |title=Blathy |publisher=People.clarkson.edu |accessdate=2009-08-04| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625015707/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/blathy.html| archivedate = June 25, 2008[/tpl] The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy's original invention.[ref]Ricks, G.W.D.

Also around 1889, Elihu Thomson of the  American General Electric company developed a  recording watt meter (watt-hour meter) based on an ironless commutator motor. This meter overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.W.

In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation applied the induction principle previously used U.S. Patent 388003 only in AC ampere-hour meters to produce a watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit.Stephen A.

Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.

==Unit of measurement==

The most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the kilowatt hour kWh, which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI megajoule instead.
Demand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter or half hour.
Reactive power is measured in "thousands of volt-ampere reactive-hours", (kvarh). By convention, a "lagging" or inductive load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power.  A "leading", or capacitive load, will have negative reactive power.IEEE Recommended practice for industrial and commercial power systems analysis Standard 399-1997, IEEE, ISBN 1-55937-968-5 page 47
Volt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual.  This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes.
Distortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways.  Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real power) to volt-amperes.  A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form.  For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements.  This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.

===Other units of measurement===

In addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available.
Meters which measured the amount of charge (coulombs) used, known as ampere-hour meters, were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies.
Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These were only suited for constant-load applications.
Neither type is likely to be used today.
