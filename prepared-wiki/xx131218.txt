==Career==

After receiving his Masters degree in agribusiness Baldwin worked as a meat packer in Ohio. He took advice from a friend and moved to Chicago with the knowledge about trading he had obtained from a few courses taken at graduate school. With the U.S. experiencing high inflation in the early 1980s, treasury bonds became a preferred market for hedgers and speculators, resulting in high volume and trading activity. These bonds became Baldwin's favourite instrument to trade, and he leased a seat on the exchange.
As a full member director of the CBOT, Baldwin has been a part of its executive committee, Commodity Pool Operator/Commodity Trading Advisor committee among many other executive positions at the exchange. He currently serves as Chairman of Baldwin Group Ltd., the parent company of several investment and financial services. Companies in the group include: Baldwin Commodities Corp., a Treasury Bond Futures proprietary trading company, and Baldwin Managed Futures, a CTA. Baldwin is also the current owner of Granot Loma, the great American castle on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Marquette County, Michigan.
