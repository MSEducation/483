A central tone in the lyrics is the search for "God", or faith. This search, for God and spiritual truth or direction, is conveyed in song lyrics such as "Fated One hold me down ..., Do I know you? What keeps us free if you believe? Please allow me to say hello to you."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/quasar-lyrics-smashing-pumpkins.html | title=Smashing Pumpkins Lyrics | accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

"Quasar" received mostly positive reviews. Joseph Viney of Sputnikmusic described the song as "a rambunctious, wailing beast of a song with a number of different speeds and moods."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/50334/The-Smashing-Pumpkins-Oceania/ | title=Smashing Pumpkins - Oceania (Staff review) | publisher=Sputnikmusic | date=June 17, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Viney, Joseph[/tpl] Rick Florino of Artistdirect praised the song, declaring that it is "one of the band's heaviest and most hypnotic gems ever." He also eulogized drumming parts of Mike Byrne, Nicole Fiorentino's basslines and Jeff Schroeder's fuzzed-out guitar work, along with Billy Corgan's vocal style.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/the-smashing-pumpkins-oceania-album-review-5-out-of-5-stars/10124920 | title=The Smashing Pumpkins "Oceania" Album Review — 5 out of 5 stars| publisher=Artistdirect | date=Jun 13, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Florino, Rick[/tpl] The guitar work of the song was also compared to those of Television by Thomas Conner of The Chicago Sun.

Many critics noted the resemblances between "Quasar" and previous Smashing Pumpkins songs. Jayson Greene of Pitchfork Media compared the songs introductory riff to those of "Cherub Rock".[tpl]cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16742-oceania/ | title=The Smashing Pumpkins - Oceania | publisher=Pitchfork | date=June 19, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Greene, Jason[/tpl] The same comparison was also made by Michael Nelson of Stereogum, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club and Rob Harvilla of Spin.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1063892/premature-evaluation-the-smashing-pumpkins-oceania/franchises/premature-evaluation/ | title=Premature Evaluation: The Smashing Pumpkins Oceania | publisher=Stereogum | date=Jun 13, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Nelson, Michael[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-smashing-pumpkins-oceania,81402/ | title=Smashing Pumpkins Oceania | publisher=The A.V.

Enio Chiola of PopMatters described the song as a "psychedelic approach to hard rock" and "a God-themed anthem", while inferring from the song that the album "seems like nothing new from the overwrought percussion heavy loudness that was Zeitgeist".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/159892-the-smashing-pumpkins-oceania/ | title=The Smashing Pumpkins: Oceania (take 1) | publisher=PopMatters | date=June 18, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Chiola, Ennio[/tpl] Dan Martin of NME referred to the song as "something approaching QOTSA channelling Zep's 'Whole Lotta Love[tpl]' "[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/smashing-pumpkins/13312/ | title=Smashing Pumpkins - 'Oceania' | publisher=NME | date=June 12, 2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2013 | author=Martin, Dan[/tpl]
