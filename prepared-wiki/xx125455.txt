Following the city's new music venue the Engine Shed's construction - which has enabled big name, established bands to visit the city, the Drill Hall has become the first-choice venue for up and coming bands from across Britain when they are in Lincoln. As well as bands, the Drill Hall hosts theatre, literature talks, films, classical music, the Red Herring Comedy Club among other comedy nights, workshops and business meetings.[tpl]cite web|title=Comedy news|url=http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/comedy-news|publisher=Lincolnshire Echo|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]
