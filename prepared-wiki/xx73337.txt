Standing [tpl]convert|540.1|m[/tpl] tall, Ostankino was designed by Nikolai Nikitin. It is currently the tallest freestanding structure in Europe and eighth  tallest in the world. The tower was the first free-standing structure to exceed [tpl]convert|500|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in height. Ostankino was built to mark the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. It is named after the Ostankino district of Moscow in which it is located.Fire at television tower offers new evidence of Russia's decay, Associated Press (reprinted by the Independent), August 28, 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/history/30-09-2009/109599-ostankino_tower-0|title=Russia's Tallest TV Tower Was Created as Symbol of USSR's Power|accessdate=2009-10-05 |date=2009-09-21 |publisher=Pravda.ru[/tpl] 
Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1967. Extensive use of prestressed concrete resulted in a simple and sturdy structure. It surpassed the Empire State Building and was a masterpiece of Soviet engineering in the time period it was built, to become the tallest free-standing structure in the world.

The Ostankino Tower has remained the tallest structure in Europe for 46 years.
A 1994 plan to increase the tower's height to 561 metres by adding an antenna was not implemented for lack of funding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=111722 |title=Ostankino Tower |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Emporis Research[/tpl]

==Incidents and accidents==

The tower caught fire on 27 August 2000, killing four people. Three firefighters died in the attempt to extinguish the fire, and one female lift operator died when her cabin crashed to the ground level due to the fire. In addition, television and radio signals were disrupted around Moscow. The fire broke out at a height of about [tpl]convert|458|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl], or approximately [tpl]convert|98|m[/tpl] above the observation platform and the Seventh Heaven restaurant, after a short-circuit in wiring belonging to a paging company. The fire necessitated an evacuation of all visitors and staff from those locations. According to Russian news agencies, the evacuation was complete 90 minutes after the start of the fire. The loss was substantial due to the age and poor maintenance of the electronic equipment, much of which was installed in the 1960s. In addition, the tower had become increasingly packed with equipment.Russian TV knocked out as fire rages through 1,800ft tower by Barry Renfrew, The Independent, August 28, 2000 
The failure of the fire suppression systems allowed the fire to destroy most of the tower's interior. Although more than 300 firefighters and other emergency workers were called in, firemen were forced to haul heavy equipment, including chemical fire extinguishers, by hand up the tower to halt the fire.

The fire knocked out virtually all television broadcasts in Moscow and the surrounding regions. The only television station unaffected was the private NTV station, but the government decreed that state channels took priority, and as such, the RTR TV channel began transmitting to several Moscow districts.Bodies recovered from Moscow TV tower fire.

The fire caused the tower's upper spire to tilt slightly, triggering fears the tower might collapse. Subsequent inspection determined that although the structure sustained heavy damage, the tower was not in danger of collapse. Immediately, efforts began to rebuild the Ostankino, which proved to be a long and expensive task.Russia tower fire 'under control', CNN.com, August 28, 2000.Four feared trapped in burning Moscow tower, CNN.com, August 28, 2000.
The fire was the third disaster in Russia in a month, following an explosion in a Moscow underground passage that killed 12 people and the sinking of submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea, in which 118 died. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that "This latest accident shows the shape of our vital installations and the overall state of our country. We should not fail to see major problems in the country behind this accident, and we should not forget the economy. Whether or not such accidents happen again in the future will depend on how we work in this vital direction."Fire in 1,800ft TV tower adds to Russians' feeling of doom by Helen Womackin, The Independent, August 29, 2000.August, the Cruelest Month by Yuri Zarakhovich, CNN.com.
