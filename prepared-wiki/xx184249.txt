Before the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton production was limited to coastal plain areas of South Carolina and Georgia, and, on a smaller scale, along the lower Mississippi River.[tpl]cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W.

By the middle of the 19th century, the Cotton Belt extended from Maryland to East Texas. The most intensive cotton production occurred in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, together with parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas. High productivity depended on the plantation system and slavery combined with fertile soils and a favorable climate.Cotton Belt, Research Machines plc 2004 After the Civil War, sharecropping replaced slavery as the primary source of labor. Cotton production in the region declined in the 20th century due to soil depletion, the boll weevil, and social changes in the region. Cotton is still grown in parts of the region, but agricultural land in the region is now used primarily for crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, and peanuts; livestock; and commercial timber production.  Rice has also become a very valuable agricultural crop in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.
