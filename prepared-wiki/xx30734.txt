CATEGORIES: Sorting algorithms, Comparison sorts

Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can either be seen as a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other and progressively reducing the gap between them. Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959.[ref]
