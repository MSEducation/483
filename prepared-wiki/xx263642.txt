Legislative elections were held in Russia on 4 December 2011.[tpl]cite news |title=Russian political parties to kick off pre-election debates |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111108/168513644.html |agency=RIA Novosti |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] At stake were the 450 seats in the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia (the legislature). United Russia won the elections with 49.32% of the vote, taking 238 seats or 52.88% of the Duma seats.
This result was down from 64.30% of the vote and 70% of the seats in the 2007 elections. 
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation received 19.19% of the vote and 92 seats, while A Just Russia received 13.24% and 64 seats, with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia getting 56 seats with 11.67% of the vote. Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause did not cross the 7% election threshold. The list of parties represented in the parliament did not change.
United Russia lost the two-thirds constitutional majority it had held prior to the election, but it still won a majority of seats in the Duma, even though it had less than 50% of the popular vote. The Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia all gained new seats compared to the previous 2007 elections.
The election received various assessments from abroad: positive from the Commonwealth of Independent States observers, mixed from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and critical from some European Union representatives and the United States. Reports of election fraud and voter discontent with the current government have led to major protests particularly in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The government and United Russia were in their turn supported by rallies of the youth organizations Nashi and Young Guard. Later, the actions of anti-government protesters sparked the fear of a colour revolution in Russian society, and a number of the "anti-Orange" protests were set upАнтиоранжевый митинг проходит на Поклонной горе RIAN [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] (the name alludes to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the most widely known color revolution to Russians) including one on the Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow, the largest protest action of all the protests so far according to the police.Митинг на Поклонной горе Interfax [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Померились цифрами vz.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Как митинг на Поклонной собрал около 140 000 человек politonline.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
The Central Electoral Commission issued a report on 3 February 2012, in which it said that it received a total of 1686 reports on irregularities, of which only 195 (11.5%) were confirmed true after investigation, a third (584) actually contained questions about the unclear points of electoral law, and only 60 complaints claimed falsifications of the elections results. On 4 February 2012 the Investigation Committee of the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation announced that the majority of videos allegedly showing falsifications at polling stations were in fact falsified themselves.СКР объявил ролики с нарушениями на выборах смонтированными Lenta.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]

==Electoral system==

The threshold for eligibility to win seats is 7.0 percent. In addition, a party which receives between 5.0 and 6.0 percent will get 1 seat in the Duma and those which receive between 6.0 and 7.0 percent will get 2 seats.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] FEDERAL LAW ON THE ELECTION OF DEPUTIES OF THE STATE DUMA FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION –  Article 82.1. Point 2 and 3
Two new voting technologies were used during the elections: The first was a ballot scanning system called “KOIB”, introduced in 2004. The second was an electronic voting system called "KEG", initially used in 2006. The second consisted of a touch screen to cast the vote and of an embedded printer to give voters the possibility to verify their choice whilst voting. The ballot scanners were used in 4,800 polling stations and 326 polling stations were equipped with the touch screen voting systems."Elections to the State Duma, 4 December 2011 OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission Final Report"

==Political parties==

All seven registered political parties were approved to participate in the elections. Parties which were present in the State Duma (United Russia, Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia) were automatically eligible to participate in the elections. Other parties needed to present at least 150,000 signatures (with a maximum of 5000 signatures per region) to the Central Electoral Commission before 19 October.[tpl]cite news |title="Яблоко" сдало на проверку в Центризбирком 150 тысяч подписей |url=http://ria.ru/politics/20111017/462206310.html |agency=RIA Novosti |language=Russian |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]«ЯБЛОКО» сдало в ЦИК подписи для регистрации на выборах –  NSNews

==Campaign==

There was relatively little sign of campaign activity on the ground: few posters, few street agitators, and few people gathering at non-United Russia campaign rallies. Candidates debates were often brief and aired at odd times of day (such as 7 a.m. on First Channel) and typically featured strange pairings of parties and not always the top figures on their party lists.

===United Russia===

The main parliamentary party, the ruling United Russia headed by Vladimir Putin (he is not a member of the party, yet he is its de facto leader), went into the next elections with a renewed platform. Putin announced the creation of a pre-election People’s Front to allow non-party candidates (up to 25%) to win election on the United Russia ticket. At the party conference which nominated Putin to the presidency and Medvedev to head the party list leader, the pre-election program was published, with 8 basic guidelines:[tpl]cite web|author=Sras.Org |url=http://www.sras.org/united_russia_program_address |title=United Russia: Election Program, 2011 |publisher=Sras.org |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]  
This program was reportedly constructed from excerpts taken from speeches previously given by Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev.
United Russia Party Chairman Putin and party list leader Medvedev did not participate in them at all. Television campaign ads were not frequently aired, and what ads that ran tended to be of strikingly low production value.Euroasian Review, Putin Machine Sputters: First Impressions Of 2011 Duma Election Campaign, Accessed on March 3, 2012 The list contained 165 acting MPs, 8 members of the federal government, 54 governors and a large number of representatives of regional and local administrations. Moreover it contained numerous names which symbolized national achievements and patriotism, such as those of athletes or cosmonauts. The number of representatives of the pro-Kremlin youth movements had increased. However, the Nashi movement had been replaced by an organization called Youth Guard of United Russia.

===A Just Russia===

A Just Russia (Russian: Spravedlivaya Rossia) hoped that being  “persecuted by the authorities” will give it a more useful oppositional image. The party managed to turn itself into a credible receptacle for anti-United Russia votes through an aggressive campaign attacking the party. While some of its critical ads were blocked, it still managed to air others that blasted official corruption and declared that “swindlers and thieves” (a clear implicit reference to United Russia) were not needed.ad broadcast on First Channel, November 29, 2011, 07:25, after a debate and before the popular morning pro- gram “Dobroe Utro Rossii.”

===The Communist Party===

In its programme entitled "The majority is destined to win. Return the Motherland stolen from us!", the CPRF promoted a stronger role of the state in the political and social sphere and the nationalization of mineral resources and other raw materials. It called for a re-appraisal of Russia’s foreign policy posture, the creation of a ‘Union of Brotherhood’ on the territory of the former Soviet Union, a stronger role for the United Nations and the dissolution of NATO. The CPRF demanded ‘genuine democratisation’ of the Russian political system including a stronger role for the parliament, the restoration of regional elections, and the confiscation of property acquired through corruption. It tasked itself with representing the ‘patriotic majority’ of the population in the parliament and with making sure that executive power is being exercised for the sake of the common good.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iss.europa.eu/fr/publications/detail-page/article/state-duma-elections-2011-and-the-marginal-role-of-russian-parties-part-2/ |title=State Duma elections 2011 and the marginal role of Russian parties. Part 2 |publisher=Iss.europa.eu |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]

===The Liberal Democratic party===

In the run-up to this election, the party had been highlighting the need to defend the interests of ethnic Russians, although it had generally been careful not to cross the line into openly nationalist rhetoric.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15939801 |title="Russia parliament elections: How the parties line up", BBC, December 2, 2012 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]

===Alleged foreign involvement===

In the pre-election campaign period the GOLOS Association watchdog was the largest organization independent from participating parties that reported on campaign violations. The online service it set up to collect reports recorded 5,300 complaints regarding violations of electoral law.[tpl]cite news|title=Russians vote in Duma poll seen as referendum on Putin|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16020632|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Putin's party lagging in Russian election|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/12/04/russia-duma-elections.html|newspaper=CBC News|date=4 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Russia's ruling party wary about polls|url=http://www.usatoday.com/USCP/PNI/NEWS/2011-12-04-PNI1204wir-Russia-Vote_ST_U.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 December 2011[/tpl] Most of the violations were linked to United Russia and about a third of the complaints were from state employees and students who said they were pressured by their employers/professors to vote for United Russia.[tpl]cite news|title=Head of Russian Election Watchdog Detained|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2101421,00.html|newspaper=Time (magazine)|date=3 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Head of Russian election watchdog detained|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2016921373_apeurussiaelection.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=3 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Russia’s ruling party wary as nation votes; media websites attacked during polls|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/mob/en/180723.html|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=4 December 2011[/tpl]
On 1 December 2011 prosecutors in Moscow served GOLOS with papers alleging that the organisation had portrayed an unnamed political party in a bad light. The unnamed party has been identified as being United Russia.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] On 2 November a Moscow court fined GOLOS 30 000 roubles (about 1000 USD) for violations of the electoral law of Russia.[tpl]clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl]Суд оштрафовал ассоциацию "Голос" Lenta.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
On 8 December the Life News[tpl]who|date=December 2011[/tpl] portal claimed it had received access to 60 Mb of correspondence between GOLOS administration and USAID (a federal government agency of the United States), and correspondence between GOLOS administration and its activists. The correspondence showed reports to USAID on how USAID funds received by GOLOS were spent. Also, the correspondence showed that activists received money for working on[tpl]clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl] every report about a violation.Life News публикует тайную переписку «Голоса» с Госдепом США [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
Earlier, on 2 December, NTV[tpl]who|date=December 2011[/tpl] showed an investigative documentary film, "Голос ниоткуда" (Golos niotkuda, translated as "Voice from nowhere" or "Vote from nowhere"), accusing GOLOS of making propaganda paid for by foreign money, in particular from the United States.

===Irregularities===

During and after the election international media and local independent websites reported serious irregularities during the election, including ballot stuffing, misuse of state resources, media bias and lack of impartiality by the election commission.[tpl]cite news|title=Monitors find Russian elections flawed|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/monitors-find-russian-elections-flawed/2011/12/05/gIQAzrhqXO_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 December 2011|author=Kathy Lally|author2=Will Englund[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Election fraud in Russia caught on video: ballot-stuffing, erasable ink and more|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20111206-russia-election-fraud-caught-video-ballot-stuffing-erasable-ink-putin-protests|newspaper=France 24|date=6 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Violence as Putin party suffers poll setback|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2011/12/2011124173124116260.html|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=5 December 2011[/tpl] The Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported more than 1,100 official complaints filed of election irregularities across the country, including vote fraud, obstruction of observers and illegal campaigning.

====Reports by participating parties====

Members of the A Just Russia, Yabloko and Communist parties reported that certain voters were shuttled between polling stations, casting several ballots. The Yabloko and Liberal Democratic parties reported that some of their observers had been banned from witnessing the sealing of the ballot boxes and from gathering video footage, and others groundlessly expelled from polling stations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20111204/169324746.html|title='Catch a fraudster' game – carousels, threats and illegal campaigning at Russian Duma polls|last=Ankov|first=Vitali|date=4 December 2011|work=English edition|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=5 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Schwirtz|first=Michael|coauthors=David M.

====Reports by independent groups and observers====

At a number of polling stations throughout the country, observers reported that final results published by the Central Election Commission differed drastically from results recorded by observers, with the "official" numbers sometimes showing the United Russia vote inflated by a factor of two or three.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2011/12/05/n_2123322.shtml|title=Наблюдатели заметили расхождение данных протоколов и сайта Мосгоризбиркома: это уже наглость|language=Russian[/tpl][tpl]ru icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/vlast/77204-vybory-2011-kollektsiya-narushenii|title=Выборы-2011: коллекция нарушений|work=Forbes|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl]Ioffe, Julia, "Russian Elections: Faking It", The New Yorker blogpost, December 5, 2011. Attempting to monitor balloting at polling station #2390, an old school in Yasenevo, Russian-borne American journalist Ioffe encountered clear indications of ballot-box stuffing. She saw "neat stacks of ballots, perfectly and evenly folded, that slipped out from between the sea of ballots spilling out of each box as it was cracked open". Another person Ioffe observed first-hand managed to grab a stack of ballots: she "carefully unfolded the ballots, and said, 'They’re all for United Russia! Of course! Who else stuffs the ballot boxes?'" Ioffe also noted particularly "the level of anger in the Russia Yasenevo election commission -- the sneering, the barking; the scoffing, yelling, and smirking. I left the precinct with shaking hands." Retrieved 2011-12-06. Carousel voting was also observed in many areas.
In Moscow, the opposition activist group Citizen Observer estimated that United Russia had stolen 17% of the popular vote from other parties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://echo.msk.ru/news/836980-echo.html|title=По предварительным подсчетам данных проекта "Гражданин-наблюдатель", в Москве "Едина Россия" приписала себе около 17 процентов голосов|language=Russian[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nabludatel.org/content/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-7-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2|title=Пресс-конференция 7 декабря - первые итоги выборов[/tpl]
In Saint Petersburg, independent activist group Right to Elect ("Право выбора") attempted to register all differences between observers' protocols and the data of the Central Election Commission. They found that comparable shares of differences in votes were in favour not only of the United Russia, but of CPRF and LDPR parties as well (2.68%, 1.49% and 2.67% respectively as of the data on 13 December).Право выбора [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Данные о нарушениях на избирательных участках Петербурга будут собираться на сайте «Держи вора» Ekho Moskvy in Saint Petersburg [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]

====Reports by international observers====

International observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) documented numerous violations of electoral law.[tpl]cite news|title=Russia election: OSCE sees 'numerous violations'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16037975|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=OSCE says Russian election slanted in favour of Vladimir Putin's party|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8935338/OSCE-says-Russian-election-slanted-in-favour-of-Vladimir-Putins-party.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=5 December 2011[/tpl] They found that whilst the preparations for the elections were technically well administered, they were marked by a "convergence of the State and the governing party".[tpl]cite news|title=INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVATION Russian Federation, State Duma Elections – 4 December 2011 - STATEMENT OF PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/85757|newspaper=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe[/tpl] They said they witnessed "undue interference of state authorities", "partiality of most media" and "lack of independence of the election administration". Denying registration to some political parties narrowed political competition, according to the OSCE. The OCSE concluded that "This...did not provide the necessary conditions for fair electoral competition." However, international observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States reported that the elections "were held legally and without serious violations."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/118171/|title=CIS observers: Duma elections held legally|date=4 December 2011[/tpl] Yet given government's control over the Central Electoral Commission and the exclusion of many independent observers from participation in monitoring voting and vote tabulation, it is exceedingly difficult to assess the degree of falsification in the election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Russia-Elections-Vladimir-Putin-Democracy-Derailed-Steve-Fish.php |title=Russia's Parliamentary Elections: Democracy Derailed, by M.

====Official reaction to the reports on irregularities====

According to Vladimir Putin's Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, the known accumulated volume of all reports on falsifications affects no more than 0.5% of total votes, and so this could not be a basis to reconsider the results of the elections.Песков: объем нарушений на выборах в Госдуму не превысил 0,5% голосов [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev called for an investigation of all reports on irregularities, but voiced his disagreement with slogans and calls by the protesters on the post-election meetings.
Yury Chaika, the Prosecutor General of Russia, said that the data on falsifications will be analyzed, but said also that violations were local and didn't affect the overall result, and that therefore there is no reason to cancel the results of the elections.

====Other irregularities====

Various Russian liberal news websites reported experiencing denial of service attacks on the day of the election.Russian protests: live, Telegraph, retrieved 10/12/2011 United Russia was able to score 99.48% in the Chechen Republic and got to a lesser degree similar results in the neighbouring republics, a curiosity which was picked up by many international newspapers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/society/20111205/169358392.html |title=United Russia gets over 99 percent of votes in Chechnya |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/12/22/uk-russia-chechnya-elections-idUKTRE7BK1BU20111222 |title=Russia's Chechnya: How did Putin's party win 99 percent? |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl]

===Investigation of the reports on irregularities===

====Official reports to the Central Electoral Commission====

The Central Electoral Commission issued a report on 3 February 2012, in which it said that it received the total of 1686 reports on irregularities, of which only 195 (11,5%) were confirmed true after investigation. About a third of reports (584) actually contained questions about the unclear points of electoral law rather than reports of irregularities, and there were only 60 complaints claiming falsifications of the elections results.ЦИК признал несостоятельными 90 процентов жалоб на думские выборы Lenta.ru

====Investigation of videos====

On 4 February 2012 the Investigation Committee of the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation announced that the majority of videos allegedly showing falsifications at polling stations were in fact falsified and originally distributed from a single server in California. However, others (such as GOLOS) pointed out firstly, that 'falsification' was deemed to be 'editing' ('монтаж') - something unavoidable in fitting potentially hours of footage into a short internet clip, and secondly that "the server in California" might actually just be Youtube.СКР ищет авторов "роликов из США" о выборах Думы, BBC, retrieved 6/2/2012

==Results==

United Russia won the elections with a 49.32% share of votes (238 seats; 52.88% of Duma seats), down from 64.30% (70% of seats) in the 2007 elections.

==Analysis==

===Comparison with exit polls and forecasts===

It is not possible to compare exit polls to the numbers reported by the election commission because no nation-wide exit polls were conducted outside of the government. The only nation-wide exit polls were conducted by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTSIOM) - the government-run polling organization controlled by the Labor Ministry. Therefore, there were no independent nation-wide exit polls that took place during the elections. The final result for United Russia, 49.32%, which almost coincided with the finding of an exit-poll by the Central Election Commission itself, which was 48.5%, and was within the interval of 46-53% forecasted by sociologists prior to the elections. However, the latter forecast has no legitimate reference source since the news agency infox.ru cited unknown "sociologists' forecasts" without any specific reference to the organization that conducted this public opinion poll.
The Election Commission reported that United Russia was also the leader in Moscow, with 46.5% of the vote. However, one early exit poll indicated that the share of United Russia was only 27%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.aif.ru/society/news/102856|title=Результаты ЕР по Москве почти вдвое превышают результаты exit poll|language=Russian[/tpl] The difference was attributed by some journalists to election fraud.[tpl]cite news|url=http://svpressa.ru/society/article/50726/|title=Сурков – среднему классу: Хватит вопить!|language=Russian[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/1444489/nash_durdom_golosuet_za|title=Наш дурдом голосует "за"|language=Russian[/tpl] The organization that provided the 27% figure subsequently withdrew its estimate, citing its low accuracy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.ru.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=160008084 | title=ФОМ объяснил, почему убрал с сайта exit poll по округам и Москве[/tpl]Barry, Ellen, and David M. Herszenhorn, "Billionaire and Ex-Minister to Oppose Putin in Russian Presidential Election" (limited no-charge access), The New York Times, December 12, 2011. The "elections ... were condemned as fraudulent by international and local monitors, and protested by a vehement swath of middle-class Russians". Retrieved 2011-12-12.
A large number of violations captured on observers' mobile phones suggest that the numbers provided by the election commission were fraudulent. In one report from Moscow, a Yabloko observer captured the pre-filled final tabulation in the regional election commission showing 515 (75.8%) votes for United Russia for his election station #6, while the records of the station #6 showed mere 128 (18.9%) votes for United Russia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://vyrodok.livejournal.com/1600.html|title=Как все было на самом деле.

Analysis by the physicist Sergey Shpilkin published by Gazeta.ru,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/10_a_3922390.shtml|title=Статистика исследовала выборы|language=Russian[/tpl] Lenta.Ru,[tpl]cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/06/elections/|title=Истина в цифрах: Как математики ищут следы фальсификаций на выборах|language=Russian[/tpl] Troitsky Variant[tpl]cite web|url=http://trv-science.ru/2011/12/20/ |title=S.

Unlike elections in some other countries with a similar voting system, voter turnout does not display a normal distribution, and has distinct peaks appearing at multiples of 5%. Voter turnout exhibits a nearly linear relationship with the portion voting for United Russia, thus implying ballot stuffing in favor of UR. The distribution of percent voting for each party is not close to normal for United Russia either, unlike other parties. Similarly, percentages cast for United Russia have characteristic spikes at the round values of 50%, 60%, 70%, etc. Critics say, such a distribution might be a result of mass-scale fraud when local election commissions struggle to meet a certain objective, e.g. "60% for United Russia".  Similar spikes also occurred in the 2007 Russian elections, and the political scientists Mikhail Myagkov, Peter Ordeshook and researcher Dmitri Shakin wrote that they are "consistent with the hypothesis that turnout numbers were manufactured artificially, with simple rounded numbers entered into official protocols." A team from Imperial College in London analysed the results and announced in May 2012 that they too suspected extensive fraud.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9275527/Study-shows-Putins-election-victory-doesnt-add-up.html | title=Study shows Putin's election victory doesn't add up | publisher=Telegraph | accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl]
The Wall Street Journal, working with political scientists from the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago, published their own analysis of the election results, and pointed out a number of features which they believe indicate fraud.  They estimate that as many as 14 million of the 65.7 million votes may be fraudulent.
An article published in Polit Online[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politonline.ru/comments/10036.html|title=В Леваде не верят в график 'Гаусса против Чурова', а математики его опровергают|language=Russian[/tpl] looked at criticisms of the analysis. The supposition of Gaussian distribution was criticized by sociologist Aleksey Grazhdankin, a Deputy Director of Levada Center (top independent non-governmental polling and sociological research organization in Russia). Grazhdankin cites regional differences and the existence of the so-called "electoral enclaves" in Russia, which vote very differently from the surrounding areas, often because the recent rise of the quality of life in such enclaves is associated with the actions of the authorities. Grazhdankin says he does not believe the graphs with non-Gaussian distributions indicate vote fraud.
Still, in his comment[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/1456510/pereschet_golosov|title="Единая Россия" набрала в Москве не более 32% на думских выборах / United Russia (actually) got 32% in Moscow[/tpl] to Vedomosti, Grazhdankin claimed that the most likely explanation to abnormal results observed in Moscow is fraud.
Statistician Mikhail Simkin has also argued that the vote distribution should not be necessarily normal.[tpl]cite web|author=Author: Mikhail Simkin |url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1435463/US-elections-are-as-non-normal-as-Russian-elections.html |title=US elections are as 'non-normal' as Russian elections - Web Exclusive Article |publisher=Significance Magazine |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl]
