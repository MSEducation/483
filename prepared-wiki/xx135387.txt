Manchester High School is a public high school in Manchester, Ohio, USA. It is part of the Manchester Local School District in Adams County, Ohio.

==Background==

The current Manchester High School building was completed in August 1997, along with three other public high schools in Adams County, North Adams, Peebles and West Union High School. All four schools used the same layout and appear almost identical from the air.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3O0CAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=Manchester,+North+Adams,+Peebles,+West+Union+identical+buildings&source=bl&ots=1TiHMd20Dr&sig=E6g0E2tcxHjfu5gxLaetlCEVn2o&hl=en&ei=PxMpS-zMNsv_nAfPtdmcDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=In God's Country|accessdate=16 December 2009|publisher=Cincinnati Magazine March 2001|author=Linda Vaccariello[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The four regular public high schools in Adams County were built at the same time and all four featured a large granite tablet outside the school carved with the Ten Commandments. The tablets were removed after a lengthy four-year legal battle over the placement of the tablets on public property.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/10/loc_commandments10.html|title=Commandments removed amid protests |accessdate=16 December 2009|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer, 10 June 2003|author=Marie McCain and Dan Horn[/tpl]
