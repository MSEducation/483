[[Phosphorylation]]

CATEGORIES: Cell biology, Cell signaling, Phosphorus, Posttranslational modification

Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate (PO43−) group to a protein or other organic molecule (see also: organophosphate). Phosphorylation turns many protein enzymes on and off, thereby altering their function and activity. Protein phosphorylation is one type of post-translational modification.
Protein phosphorylation in particular plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes. Its prominent role in biochemistry is the subject of a very large body of research (as of March 2012, the Medline database returns nearly 200,000 articles on the subject, largely on protein phosphorylation).

===History===

In 1906, Phoebus Levene at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research identified phosphate in the protein vitellin (phosvitin),[tpl]cite journal | title = The cleavage products of vitellin | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–133 | year = 1906 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/2/1/127.pdf | author1 = Levene PA | author2 = Alsberg CL | author-separator = , [/tpl] and by 1933 had detected phosphoserine in casein, with Fritz Lipmann.[tpl]cite journal | title = Serinephosphoric acid obtained on hydrolysis of vitellinic acid | journal = J.

Kennedy described the first ‘enzymatic phosphorylation of proteins’.[tpl]cite journal | title = The enzymatic phosphorylation of proteins | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 211 | issue = 2 | pages = 969–80 |date=December 1954 | pmid = 13221602 | doi = | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/211/2/969.pdf| author1 = Burnett G | author2 = Kennedy EP | author-separator = , [/tpl]

===Function===

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is an important regulatory mechanism that occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cozzone AJ | title = Protein phosphorylation in prokaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 97–125 | year = 1988 | pmid = 2849375 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.42.100188.000525 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Protein phosphorylation and regulation of adaptive responses in bacteria | journal = Microbiol. Rev. | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–90 |date=December 1989 | pmid = 2556636 | pmc = 372749 | doi = | url = | author1 = Stock JB | author2 = Ninfa AJ | author3 = Stock AM | author-separator = , [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = The Two-Component System . Regulation of Diverse Signaling Pathways in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes | journal = Plant Physiol. | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 723–31 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9662515 | pmc = 1539182 | doi = 10.1104/PPSOE.117.3.723| url = | author1 = Chang C | author2 = Stewart RC | author-separator = , | doi_brokendate = 2014-03-22 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = The structure and mechanism of protein phosphatases: insights into catalysis and regulation | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 133–64 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9646865 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.27.1.133 | url = | author1 = Barford D | author2 = Das AK | author3 = Egloff MP | author-separator = , [/tpl]
Kinases phosphorylate proteins and phosphatases dephosphorylate proteins. Many enzymes and receptors are switched "on" or "off" by phosphorylation  and dephosphorylation. Reversible phosphorylation results in a conformational change in the structure in many enzymes and receptors, causing them to become activated or deactivated. Phosphorylation usually occurs on serine, threonine, tyrosine and histidine residues in eukaryotic proteins. Histidine phosphorylation of eukaryotic proteins appears to be much more frequent than tyrosine phosphorylation.[tpl]cite journal | title = Phosphorylation of basic amino acid residues in proteins: important but easily missed | journal = Acta Biochim Pol | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–47 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21623415 | author1 = Ciesla J | author2 = Fraczyk T | author3 = Rode W | author-separator = , [/tpl] In prokaryotic proteins phosphorylation occurs on the serine, threonine, tyrosine, histidine or arginine or lysine residues.[tpl]cite doi|10.1159/000089641[/tpl] The addition of a phosphate (PO4) molecule to a polar R group of an amino acid residue can turn a hydrophobic portion of a protein into a polar and extremely hydrophilic portion of molecule. In this way it can introduce a conformational change in the structure of the protein via interaction with other hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the protein.
One such example of the regulatory role that phosphorylation plays is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The p53 protein is heavily regulated[tpl]cite journal | title = Regulation of p53 Function and Stability by Phosphorylation | journal = Mol. Cell. Biol. | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 1751–8 |date=March 1999 | pmid = 10022862 | pmc = 83968 | doi = | url = | author1 = Ashcroft M | author2 = Kubbutat MH | author3 = Vousden KH | author-separator = , [/tpl] and contains more than 18 different phosphorylation sites. Activation of p53 can lead to cell cycle arrest, which can be reversed under some circumstances, or apoptotic cell death.[tpl]cite journal | title = p53 in signaling checkpoint arrest or apoptosis | journal = Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–8 |date=February 1996 | pmid = 8791489 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(96)90004-0| url = | author1 = Bates S | author2 = Vousden KH | author-separator = , [/tpl] This activity occurs only in situations wherein the cell is damaged or physiology is disturbed in normal healthy individuals.
Upon the deactivating signal, the protein becomes dephosphorylated again and stops working. This is the mechanism in many forms of signal transduction, for example the way in which incoming light is processed in the light-sensitive cells of the retina.

===Signaling networks===

Elucidating complex signaling pathway phosphorylation events can be difficult. In cellular signaling pathways, protein A phosphorylates protein B, and B phosphorylates C. However, in another signaling pathway, protein D phosphorylates A, or phosphorylates protein C. Global approaches such as phosphoproteomics, the study of phosphorylated proteins, which is a sub-branch of proteomics, combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics, have been utilised to identify and quantify dynamic changes in phosphorylated proteins over time. These techniques are becoming increasingly important for the systematic analysis of complex phosphorylation networks.[tpl]cite journal | title = Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks | journal = Cell | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 635–48 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 17081983 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.026 | url = | author1 = Olsen JV | author2 = Blagoev B | author3 = Gnad F | author4 = Macek B | author5 = Kumar C | author6 = Mortensen P | author7 = Mann M | author-separator = , [/tpl] They have been successfully used to identify  dynamic changes in the phosphorylation status of more than 6000 sites after stimulation with epidermal growth factor.[tpl]cite journal | year = 2007 | title = Phosphoproteomics for the discovery of kinases as cancer biomarkers and drug targets | journal = Proteomics – Clinical Applications | volume = 1 | issue = 9 | pages = 1042–1057 | publisher = | pmc = | doi = 10.1002/prca.200700102 | author1 = Li-Rong Y | author2 = Issaq HJ | author3 = Veenstra TD | author-separator = , | pmid = 21136756 [/tpl]
Another approach for understanding Phosphorylation Network, is by measuring the genetic interactions between multiple phosphorylating proteins and their targets. This reveals interesting recurring patterns of interactions – network motifs.[tpl]cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Functional Organization of the S. cerevisiae Phosphorylation Network | journal = Cell | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 952–963 | publisher = | pmc = 2856666| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.12.039 | author1 = Fiedler D | author2 = Braberg H| author3 = Mehta M | author4 = Chechik G |author-separator = , | pmid=19269370 | last5 = Cagney | first5 = Gerard | last6 = Mukherjee | first6 = Paromita | last7 = Silva | first7 = Andrea C. | last8 = Shales | first8 = Michael | last9 = Collins | first9 = Sean R.| last10 = Van Wageningen| first10 = Sake| last11 = Kemmeren| first11 = Patrick| last12 = Holstege| first12 = Frank C.P.| last13 = Weissman| first13 = Jonathan S.| last14 = Keogh| first14 = Michael-Christopher| last15 = Koller| first15 = Daphne| last16 = Shokat| first16 = Kevan M.| last17 = Krogan| first17 = Nevan J.| display-authors = 8[/tpl]

===Protein phosphorylation sites===

There are thousands of distinct phosphorylation sites in a given cell since:
1) There are thousands of different kinds of proteins in any particular cell (such as a lymphocyte).
2) It is estimated that 1/10 to 1/2 of proteins are phosphorylated (in some cellular state).
3) One study indicates that 30% of proteins in the human genome can be phosphorylated, and abnormal phosphorylation is now recognized as a cause of human disease.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/ncb0502-e127[/tpl]
4) Phosphorylation often occurs on multiple distinct sites on a given protein.
Since phosphorylation of any site on a given protein can change the function or localization of that protein, understanding the "state" of a cell requires knowing the phosphorylation state of its proteins.  For example, if amino acid Serine-473 ("S473") in the protein AKT is phosphorylated, AKT is, in general, functionally active as a kinase.  If not, it is an inactive kinase.

===Types of phosphorylation===

See also kinases for more details on the different types of phosphorylation
Within a protein, phosphorylation can occur on several amino acids. Phosphorylation on serine is the most common, followed by threonine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is relatively rare but is at the origin of protein phosphorylation signaling pathways in most of the eukaryotes. However, since tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are relatively easy to purify using antibodies, tyrosine phosphorylation sites are relatively well understood. Histidine and aspartate phosphorylation occurs in prokaryotes as part of two-component signaling and in some cases in eukaryotes in some signal transduction pathways.[tpl]cite journal | title = Eukaryotic signal transduction via histidine-aspartate phosphorelay | journal = J. Cell. Sci. | volume = 113 | issue = 18| pages = 3141–50 |date=September 2000 | pmid = 10954413 | doi = | url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/113/18/3141.pdf| author1 = Thomason P | author2 = Kay R | author-separator = , [/tpl]

===Detection and characterization===

Antibodies can be used as powerful tools to detect whether a protein is phosphorylated at a particular site. Antibodies bind to and detect phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in the protein. Such antibodies are called phospho-specific antibodies; hundreds of such antibodies are now available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.exactantigen.com/review/phospho-antibody.html |title=phospho antibody |accessdate=2009-01-22 |work=exactantigen.com[/tpl] They are becoming critical reagents both for basic research and for clinical diagnosis.
thumb|Example of posttranslational modification detected on a 2D gel (spot boundaries delimited by analysis software, identification by mass spectrometry, P46462 is the protein ID in Expasy)PTM (Posttranslational Modification) isoforms are easily detected on 2D gels. Indeed, phosphorylation replaces neutral hydroxyl groups on serines, threonines, or tyrosines with negatively charged phosphates with pKs near 1.2 and 6.5. Thus, below pH 5.5, phosphates add a single negative charge; near pH 6.5, they add 1.5 negative charges; above pH 7.5, they add 2 negative charges. The relative amount of each isoform can also easily and rapidly be determined from staining intensity on 2D gels.
In some very specific cases, the detection of the phosphorylation as a shift in the protein's electrophoretic mobility is possible on simple 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, as it's described for instance for a transcriptional coactivator by Kovacs et al.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kovacs KA |first=Steinmann M |authorlink= |coauthors=Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR |date=Sep 2003 |title=CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members recruit the coactivator CREB-binding protein and trigger its phosphorylation |journal=J Biol. Chem. |volume=278 |issue=38 |pages=36959–65 |publisher= |location = UNITED STATES| issn = 0021-9258| pmid = 12857754 | bibcode = | url = | accessdate =| doi = 10.1074/jbc.M303147200 [/tpl] Strong phosphorylation-related conformational changes (that persist in detergent-containing solutions) are thought to underlie this phenomenon. Most of the phosphorylation sites for which such a mobility shift has been described fall in the category of SP and TP sites (i.e. a proline residue follows the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue).
More recently large-scale mass spectrometry analyses have been used to determine sites of protein phosphorylation. Over the last 4 years, dozens of studies have been published, each identifying thousands of sites, many of which were previously undescribed.[tpl]cite journal | title = Qualitative and quantitative analyses of protein phosphorylation in naive and stimulated mouse synaptosomal preparations | journal = Mol. Cell Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–93 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17114649 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M600046-MCP200 | url = | issn = | author1 = Munton RP | author2 = Tweedie-Cullen R | author3 = Livingstone-Zatchej M | author4 = Weinandy F | author5 = Waidelich M | author6 = Longo D | author7 = Gehrig P | author8 = Potthast F | author9 = Rutishauser D | author-separator = , | display-authors = 8 | last10 = Gerrits | first10 = B. | last11 = Panse | first11 = C. | last12 = Schlapbach | first12 = R. | last13 = Mansuy | first13 = I.

Cell Proteomics | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 684–96 |date=April 2008 | pmid = 18056256 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M700170-MCP200 | url = | issn = | author1 = Trinidad JC | author2 = Thalhammer A | author3 = Specht CG | author4 = Lynn AJ | author5 = Baker PR | author6 = Schoepfer R | author7 = Burlingame AL | author-separator = , [/tpl] Mass spectrometry is ideally suited for such analyses using HCD or ETD fragmentation, as the addition of phosphorylation results in an increase in the mass of the protein and the phosphorylated residue. Advanced, highly accurate mass spectrometers are needed for these studies, limiting the technology to labs with high-end mass spectrometers. However, the analysis of phosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry is still not as straightforward as for “regular”, unmodified peptides. Recently, EThcD has been developed combining electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation. Compared to the usual fragmentation methods, EThcD scheme provides more informative MS/MS spectra for unambiguous phosphosite localization.[tpl]cite journal|last=Frese|first=Christian|coauthors=Houjiang Zhou, Thomas Taus, A.

==Other kinds==

ATP, the "high-energy" exchange medium in the cell, is synthesized in the mitochondrion by addition of a third phosphate group to ADP in a process referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is also synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis.
ATP is synthesized at the expense of solar energy by photophosphorylation in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
Phosphorylation of sugars is often the first stage of their catabolism. It allows cells to  accumulate sugars because the phosphate group prevents the molecules from diffusing back across their transporter.
