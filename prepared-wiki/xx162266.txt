[[Edmonton municipal election, 1898]]

CATEGORIES: Municipal elections in Edmonton, 1898 elections in Canada

The 1898 municipal election was held December 12, 1898.  In previous elections, an entire town council had been elected at once for a one year term; 1898 marked the beginning of staggered aldermanic terms, such that half of the six aldermen would be elected each year to two year terms.  The mayor continued to be elected annually.
Because in the previous election all six aldermen had been elected to a one year term, it was still necessary to elect six aldermen.  However, in order to set up the staggered terms, three were to be elected to one year terms and three to two year terms.
In addition to the city council, five public school trustees and four private school trustees were elected.
