He wrote. Über die Palpen der Rhopalocera. Ein Beitrag zur Erkenntnis der verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen unter den Tagfaltern. Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae, Helsingfors, 22 (1): I-XVI, 1-577 (1896) an important work on the classificaation of lepidoptera in which some higher level taxa are erected.
Reuter was a cytologist and student of Phylogenetics.His collection is conserved in the Natural History Museum of Helsinki.
Reuter was a correspondent with and admirer of the German Darwinist Ernst Haeckel"In 1868 Haeckel had given his first edition of the natural history of creation and this work, more than any other, made Darwinism to a generally accepted world view… Reuter’s dissertation carries a label of its time. It is a typical phylogenetic handling, inspired by Haeckel’s spirit that at the close of the century totally dominated the biological research."(Federley H., 1951)
