==Function==

The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that belongs to the AP-1/ATF superfamily of transcription factors. The leucine zipper of this protein mediates dimerization with members of the Jun family of proteins. This protein is thought to be a negative regulator of AP-1/ATF transcriptional events.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: BATF basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10538| accessdate = [/tpl]
Mice without the BATF gene (BATF knockout mice) lacked a type of inflammatory immune cell (Th17) and were resistant to conditions that normally induces an autoimmune condition similar to multiple sclerosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schraml BU, Hildner K, Ise W, Lee WL, Smith WA, Solomon B, Sahota G, Sim J, Mukasa R, Cemerski S, Hatton RD, Stormo GD, Weaver CT, Russell JH, Murphy TL, Murphy KM | title = The AP-1 transcription factor Batf controls TH17 differentiation | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7253 | pages = 405–9 |date=July 2009 | pmid = 19578362 | doi = 10.1038/nature08114 | laysummary = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-07/wuso-gri071609.php | laysource = eurekalert.org |laydate =  2009-07-16 | pmc = 2716014 [/tpl]
