[[Hyperbola]]

CATEGORIES: Conic sections, Analytic geometry, Curves

In mathematics, a hyperbola (plural hyperbolas or hyperbolae) is a type of smooth curve, lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows.  The hyperbola is one of the four kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.  (The other conic sections are the parabola, the ellipse, and the circle; the circle is a special case of the ellipse). If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones then the conic is a hyperbola.
Hyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids ("wastebaskets"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry used in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).

==History==

The word "hyperbola" derives from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ὑπερβολή[/tpl], meaning "over-thrown" or "excessive", from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones.[tpl]citation|title=Apollonius of Perga: Treatise on Conic Sections with Introductions Including an Essay on Earlier History on the Subject|first=Sir Thomas Little|last=Heath|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1896|contribution=Chapter I.

The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–c. 190 BC) in his definitive work on the conic sections, the Conics.[tpl]citation|title=A History of Mathematics|first=Carl B.|last=Boyer|first2=Uta C.|last2=Merzbach|publisher=Wiley|year=2011|isbn=9780470630563|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bR9HAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PT73|page=73|quote= It was Apollonius (possibly following up a suggestion of Archimedes) who introduced the names "ellipse" and "hyperbola" in connection with these curves.[/tpl] For comparison, the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for "deficient" and "comparable"; these terms may refer to the eccentricity of these curves, which is greater than one (hyperbola), less than one (ellipse) and exactly one (parabola).
