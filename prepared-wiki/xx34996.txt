==History==

While traveling south with his troops in 1813, General Andrew Jackson camped along a river in the area. General Jackson carved his name in a locust tree, naming the area Locust Fork. In the early 1800s Nick Hudson built a public inn in what is now Locust Fork. He erected barns to shelter the horses and hogs of the Tennessee farmers who drove them to the deeper South for a more profitable market.
Locust Fork was incorporated January 18, 1977.

==Transportation and growth==

Locust Fork straddles Alabama State Route 79, which is a north-south highway running from Birmingham [tpl]convert|31|mi[/tpl] to the south and Scottsboro [tpl]convert|65|mi[/tpl] to the northeast. Blount County Road 13 runs northwestward to connect to Alabama Highway 160 between the communities of Hayden and Nectar. Blount County Road 15 intersects Alabama 79 just north of Locust Fork and provides a connection to the county seat of Oneonta, [tpl]convert|14|mi[/tpl] to the east. Also located along County Road 15 is the Limestone Springs Golf Course and residential development, [tpl]convert|4|mi|0[/tpl] southeast of town. The nearest interstate highways are Interstate 65 located some [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] west of Locust Fork and Interstate 59 located some [tpl]convert|25|mi[/tpl] east of Locust Fork. Air travel is handled primarily from the Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport located some [tpl]convert|30|mi[/tpl] southwest of Locust Fork. Locust Fork is located along one of the two major Alabama state highways that run northeast from Birmingham to the Sand Mountain area of Guntersville, Albertville, and Boaz. It is an alternate route from Birmingham to Huntsville and Chattanooga.
The Locust Fork area has and continues to see strong residential growth mainly due to outflow from Jefferson County as residents there seek a more rural environment as well as a lower tax structure. As a result of this growth, enrollment in schools has risen substantially. Also, traffic along the main Highway 79 artery has risen, and the road has become increasingly dangerous between the termination of a four-lane divided highway just north of Pinson and Locust Fork. There has been some discussion of upgrading the road to four-lane status, but such work is still considered several years away. Locust Fork will also be impacted by the eventual construction of the Northern Beltline, which is slated to cross Highway 79 just north of Pinson. This controlled-access highway (officially designated as Interstate 422) will provide much quicker access for Locust Fork residents traveling east to Trussville or westward to Gardendale, Graysville, and Tuscaloosa. However, this route is still 10–15 years away from completion.

Locust Fork is an incorporated town and has a mayor and town council elected by the citizens.  The mayor and council are elected for four-year terms.
