The Louisville Bats, which play in Louisville, Kentucky, are the Triple-A minor league baseball affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. The team, formerly known as the Louisville RiverBats, plays in the International League. The Bats play their home games at Louisville Slugger Field; the naming rights for the stadium were purchased by Hillerich & Bradsby, makers of the famous Louisville Slugger baseball bat.http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t416

==History==

In 1982, the St. Louis Cardinals switched their Triple-A team of the American Association, the Redbirds, from Springfield, Illinois to Louisville. During the 1982 season, the Louisville Redbirds broke the minor league attendance record by drawing over 800,000. In 1983, the Redbirds were the first minor league team to draw over one million fans in a single season. The Redbirds' success during the 1980s led to some speculation that Louisville could be a potential market for Major League Baseball expansion;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121016/2/index.htm however this did not come to pass. In 1998, the American Association folded and the teams moved to either the International League or the Pacific Coast League. The league changed and expanded to Memphis and Durham, and the Cardinals shifted their Triple-A affiliation to Memphis, Tennessee and the new Memphis Redbirds not-for-profit franchise. In 1998 and 1999, Louisville was affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers and since 2000 with the Cincinnati Reds.http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?city=Louisville&state=KY&country=UShttp://baseball.about.com/od/internationalleague/p/louisville.htm

In 1999, when the Redbirds became affiliated with the Brewers,  they took the name Louisville RiverBats. In 2000 the team moved to Louisville Slugger Field a new stadium in downtown Louisville, seating 14,000 with a more intimate baseball setting than at Cardinal Stadium. Spectators enter the stadium through the restored "train shed" building, which was formerly the Brinly-Hardy Co. warehouse.http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20051215&content_id=47157186&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t416&sid=t416 In 2002 the team dropped the word "River" from its name and became simply known as the Louisville Bats. While the logo and mascot consist of the winged mammal, the bat is also synonymous with the Louisville Slugger baseball bat.http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20051215&content_id=47157186&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t416&sid=t416
The team's attendance was about 685,000 in the first season of Louisville Slugger Field and 663,961 the following year.http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2011/09/08/louisville-bats-finish-no-2-in-minor.html Traditionally one of the top-drawing minor league teams, the Bats' attendance in 2011 was second of all minor league teams with an average of 8,716 per game.http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/09/lehigh-valley-leads-minors-in-attendance.html

===Titles===

The Bats have once won the Governors' Cup—the championship of the IL—and twice played in the championship series.
Note:  The Bats were ahead 1-0 in the championship series when the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred. The league canceled the rest of the series and declared the Bats the champions, thus the series was reduced to being a championship 'game'.
Under Jim Fregosi's leadership from 1983 to 1986, the Redbirds won the American Association title in 1984 and 1985, and were the league runner up in 1983, when they won the Eastern Division.  The team later won another AA championship in 1995.
