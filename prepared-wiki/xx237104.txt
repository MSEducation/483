[[List of compositions by Johann Joachim Quantz]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of compositions by composer

The list of compositions by Johann Joachim Quantz was established by Horst Augsbach.H. Augsbach, Johann Joachim Quantz: Thematisch-systematisch Werkverzeichnis, (Stuttgart, Carus-Verlag, 1997) QV stands for "Quantz Verzeichnis", and Anh. for "Anhang" (supplement) when the authenticity of the works is spurious.

==Flute sonatas==

The numbering follows the catalogue Catalogue des solos pour Sans Souci started in 1763 and continued in 1769 by the Catalogue des solos pour le Nouveau Palais that contains works of both Quantz and his student Frederick II, King of Prussia. These two catalogues start at number 88. The previous catalogue Catalogue des solos pour Potsdam containing sonatas Nos. 1–87 was lost. The sonatas by Quantz are numbered as follows: 88–105, 142, 219–254 & 265–361. The 121 sonatas by Frederick II are: 106–141, 143–218 & 255–264. The sonatas with a Roman numeral numbering are part of the collection Sonata a flauto traverso solo e cembalo da Gio: Gioacchino Quantz.

==Trio sonatas==

The variable instrumentation of the trio sonatas in indicated in parentheses. Some of the trio sonatas call for two instruments only with the harpsichord playing one dessus and the continuo. For example, 'Sonata for flute, (violin) & harpsichord (continuo)' means that it can be played by flute, violin and continuo or flute and harpsichord.

==Flute Solos==

The third group of compositions gathers works for 1 to 3 flutes without continuo.

==Flute concertos==

Like the flute sonatas, the concertos are numbered according to the catalogues contemporary to Quantz, especially the Catalogue des concertos pour le Nouveau Palais. Quantz composed the concertos Nos. 1, 4–78, 80–85, 89 and 92–300. Frederick II composed only four concertos, Nos. 87, 88, 90 and 91. The concerto No. 2 is by Carl Heinrich Graun. As for the concertos Nos. 3, 79 and 86, the composer remains unknown.
The flute concertos are listed in two categories, whether or not a viola part is included in the string accompaniment.

===Flute concertos without viola part===

Instrumentation: Flute, solo; 2 violins and basso continuo.

===Flute concertos with viola part===

Instrumentation: Flute, solo; 2 violins, viola and basso continuo.
