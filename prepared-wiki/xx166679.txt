The Aure river has relatively high turbidity and its brownish water is moderate in velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse, although the narrow channel in locations like Bayeux centre engenders higher surface velocities; pH levels have been measured at 8.35 in the centre of Bayeux near the Bayeux Tapestry MuseumHogan, C. Michael, Water quality of freshwater bodies in France, Lumina Tech. Press, Aberdeen, Scotland (2006) and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 37 micro-siemens per centimetre. Turbidity has been measured at 13 centimetres by the Secchi disc method.  At this reference location of Bayeux, summer flows are typically in the range of [tpl]convert|50|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl].
