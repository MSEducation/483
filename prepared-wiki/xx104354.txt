==History==

Science originally launched as the Discovery Science Network in October 1996 as a part Discovery's new suite of four digital channels that were rolled out simultaneously.[tpl]cite news|title=Discovery channels energy into expansion|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 28, 1996[/tpl] Plans for the new networks were announced in November 1994. Back then, the channel's working name was "Quark!", but that was changed before launch.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16467630.html|title=Discovery plans launch of four newly created nets|publisher=Multichannel News|date=November 21, 1994[/tpl]
The channel has since had various rebranding exercises throughout its history. The channel was renamed to the Discovery Science Channel in 1998, and then to The Science Channel in 2002, however international versions of the channel continue to use the "Discovery Science" name. The channel later shortened its name to just Science Channel in 2007 with a new logo based on the periodic table, and then again to Science in 2011, while at the same time launching a new logo created by Imaginary Forces.Science Channel Rebranding As Science Broadcasting & Cable April 5, 2011
