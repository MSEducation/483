==Location and ownership==

The Fynbos Corridor is jointly owned by the City of Cape Town and a private owner. The Diep River runs south into the Rietvlei Wetland Reserve and the corridor extends north-west towards the Blaauwberg Conservation Area (BCA). The corridor runs  through the parklands and Sunningdale developments that are managed by ASKA Property.http://www.askaproperty.com/

==Vision==

The Fynbos Corridor extends from the Diep River in the South to the BCA to the north. Approximately seven kilometers in length, it is interrupted by five east-west routes and two south-north routes. The total extent of the corridor, including the satellite areas to the east and west, takes up large portions of privately owned land including the Garden Cities and the Milnerton Estates. It is the intention of the owners of this land to cede the necessary land portions to the local authorities as development proceeds.MLH architects & planners, 2007.
