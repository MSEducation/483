Joan Alexandra Molinsky[tpl]cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rivers-joan|title=Joan Rivers|last=Goldman|first=Shalom|work=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=24 March 2014[/tpl] (born June 8, 1933), known by her stage name Joan Rivers, is an American actress and comedian.
Rivers came to prominence as a host in The Tonight Show, first of the late-night chat programs with interviews and comedy, pioneered by Johnny Carson, whom she acknowledges as her mentor. The show established her particular comic style, poking fun at celebrities, but also at herself, often joking about her extensive plastic surgery. When she launched a rival program, The Late Show, without warning Carson, he never spoke to her again. She went on to host a successful daytime slot, The Joan Rivers Show, which won her a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host.
Rivers is the author of many books of memoirs, as well as comic material for stage and TV. She lives in Malibu, California, with her daughter and grandson.

==Career==

===Early career===

During the late 1950s, Rivers appeared in a short-run play, Driftwood, playing a lesbian with a crush on a character played by a then-unknown Barbra Streisand. The play ran for six weeks.Enter Talking, p. 85-96 and last photo insert page before p. 183 Rivers performed in numerous comedy clubs in the Greenwich Village area of New York City in the early 1960s, including The Bitter End and The Gaslight Cafe,Enter Talking, p. 230 before making her first appearances as a guest on the TV program The Tonight Show originating from New York, hosted at the time by Jack Paar.Enter Talking, p. 233-239
By 1965, Rivers had a stint on Candid Camera as a gag writer and participant; she was "the bait" to lure people into ridiculous situations for the show. She also made her first appearance on The Tonight Show with new host Johnny Carson, on February 17, 1965.Enter Talking, p. 359-373 During the same decade, Rivers made other appearances on The Tonight Show as well as The Ed Sullivan Show, while hosting the first of several talk shows. She wrote material for the puppet Topo Gigio. She had a brief role in The Swimmer (1968), starring Burt Lancaster. A year later, she had a short-lived syndicated daytime talk show, That Show with Joan Rivers; Johnny Carson was her first guest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124948/ |title=The Joan Rivers Show |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29[/tpl] In the middle of the 1960s, she released at least two comedy albums, The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album[tpl]cite web|title=The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album |publisher= |date= |accessdate=[/tpl] and Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis & Other Funny Stories.[tpl]cite web|title=Joan Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis & Other Funny Stories|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29[/tpl]
By the 1970s, Rivers was appearing on various television comedy and variety shows, including The Carol Burnett Show and a semi-regular stint on Hollywood Squares. From 1972 to 1976, she narrated The Adventures of Letterman, an animated segment for The Electric Company. In 1973, Rivers wrote the TV movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy starring Stockard Channing. In 1978, Rivers wrote and directed the film Rabbit Test, starring her friend Billy Crystal. During the same decade, she was the opening act for singers Helen Reddy, Robert Goulet, Mac Davis and Sergio Franchi on the Las Vegas Strip.

===1980s–1990s===

Rivers has spoken of her primary Tonight Show life as having been Johnny Carson's daughter, a reference to his longtime mentoring of her and, during the 1980s, establishing her as his regular guest host by August 1983. It was not her only work, however. On April 9, 1983, she hosted Saturday Night Live.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0695000/ |title=Saturday Night Live |publisher=IMDB |date=1983-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-29[/tpl] In the same period, she released a best-selling comedy album on Geffen Records, What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most? The album reached No. 22 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1984-grammy-awards.html |title=Grammy Awards |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date=1984-02-28 |accessdate=2009-04-29[/tpl]
Also in 1984, Rivers published a best-selling humor book, The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abramowitz, a mock memoir of her brassy, loose comedy character. A television special based on the character, a mock tribute called Joan Rivers and Friends Salute Heidi Abramowitz, was not successful with the public.
The decade was controversial for Rivers. She sued female impersonator Frank Marino for $5,000,000 in 1986, after discovering he was using her real stand-up material in the impersonation of her that he included in his popular Las Vegas act. The two comics reconciled, even appearing together on television in later years.Frank Marino discusses law suit
Also in 1986 came the move that cost Rivers her longtime friendship with Carson, who had first hired her as a Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network announced that it was giving her a late night talk show, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.King, Norman (1993). Arsenio Hall. New York: William Morrow & Co., pp. 47–48 The new network planned to broadcast the show 11:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers herself. In the documentary Johnny Carson: King of Late Night, Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it, and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the Tonight Show, a decision respected by Carson's first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's manager Harry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, against Rivers' prior knowledge. https://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/joan-rivers-johnny-carson-henry-bushkin-edgar-fox-nbc_b98593Rivers did not appear on the Tonight Show again until February 17, 2014, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon's first episode.[tpl]cite news|title=Joan Rivers Returns To ‘Tonight Show’ After Decades-Long Ban|url=http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/joan-rivers-returns-to-tonight-show-after-decades-long-ban-1201109889/|accessdate=February 19, 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=February 17, 2014[/tpl] On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned for an interview.
Shortly after Carson's death in 2005, Rivers said that he never spoke to her again. In 2008, during an interview with Dr. Pamela Connolly on television's Shrink Rap, Rivers claimed she did call Carson, but he hung up on her at once and repeated the gesture when she called again.
The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers turned out to be flecked by tragedy. When Rivers challenged Fox executives, who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's producer, the network fired them both. On May 15, 1987, three months later, Rosenberg committed suicide in Philadelphia; Rivers blamed the tragedy on his "humiliation" by Fox.Joanne Kaufman, Alan Carter, http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116863,00.html "Rocked by Tragedy and Failure, Joan Rivers Comes Back with a New Show and a New Life", People, February 19, 1990 Fox attempted to continue the show with a new name (The Late Show) and rotating guest hosts.
