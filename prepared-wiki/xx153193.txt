The Striped Owl (Pseudoscops clamator) is a medium-sized owl with large ear tufts and a brownish-white facial disk rimmed with black.  Its beak is black, and it has cinnamon-colored eyes. It has shorter, rounder wings than most of its close relatives. The upperparts are cinnamon with fine black vermiculation and heavy stripes. The underparts are pale tawny with dusky streaks. It is native to South America, and parts of Central America.
Its systematic placement is not resolved. Different authorities place it either in Asio, in Pseudoscops together with the Jamaican Owl, or more rarely into the monotypic genus Rhinoptynx.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Striped Owl is native to much of South and Central America. Its range is not well known, perhaps because it is nocturnal and not easily seen, but it is known from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. It uses a variety of habitats, including riparian woodlands, marshes, savannahs, grassy open areas, and tropical rainforests. It can be found from sea level to 1600 meters (5,250Â ft.) and above.

==Status==

The Striped Owl has a very large range and its population is believed to be stable. It faces no particular threats, and as a result, the IUCN has listed it as being of "Least Concern".
