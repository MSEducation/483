Ketamine is a drug used in human and veterinary medicine, mainly for starting and maintaining general anesthesia. Other uses include sedation in intensive care, as a pain killer (particularly in emergency medicine and patients with potentially compromised respiration and/or allergies to opiate and barbiturate analgesics), and treatment of bronchospasm. This drug is sometimes used recreationally. Like other drugs in its class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine is classified as a dissociative agent.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Bergman |first=S.

Its hydrochloride salt is sold as Ketanest, Ketaset, and Ketalar. Pharmacologically, ketamine is classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist but does have some activity at other receptors..[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=N. L. |last2=Simmonds |first2=M.

==Medical use==

Uses as an anaesthetic:
In medical settings, ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lankenau SE, Sanders B, Bloom JJ, et al. |title=First injection of ketamine among young injection drug users (IDUs) in three U.S. cities |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=87 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–93 |date=March 2007 |pmid=16979848 |pmc=1852477 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.08.015[/tpl]
Since it suppresses breathing much less than most other available anaesthetics,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Heshmati F, Zeinali MB, Noroozinia H, Abbacivash R, Mahoori A |title=Use of ketamine in severe status asthmaticus in intensive care unit |journal=Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=175–80 |date=December 2003 |pmid=17301376 |doi=[/tpl] ketamine is still used in human medicine as an anesthetic; however, due to the hallucinations it may cause, it is not typically used as a primary anesthetic, although it is the anaesthetic of choice when reliable ventilation equipment is not available. 
Ketamine is frequently used in severely injured patients.  It is the drug of choice for patients in traumatic shock who are at risk of hypotension. [tpl]cite web | url=http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/rapid-sequence-induction-of-the-shock-patient/ | title=Intubation, Hypotension and Shock | work=Critical Care Compendium | publisher=Life in the Fastlane | date=2013-08-07 | accessdate=2014-04-10 | quote=ketamine is the induction agent of choice in the shock patient [/tpl] Hypotension is extremely dangerous in patients with severe head injury[tpl]cite pmid|11585502[/tpl] and ketamine is anaesthetic agent least likely to precipitate hypotension, often even able to prevent it.[tpl]cite pmid|1763596[/tpl]  For years medical myth has held that ketamine was dangerous in patients with head injury over concerns that it might transiently increase the pressure inside the skull.  This small transient effect is completely outweighed by the devastation caused by hypotension in severely head injured patients. Air medical services and paramedics are using this drug with increasing frequency.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Ketamine tends to increase heart rate and blood pressure. Because it tends to increase or maintain cardiac output, it is sometimes used in anesthesia for emergency surgery when the patient's fluid volume status is unknown (e.g., from traffic accidents). Ketamine can be used in podiatry and other minor surgery, and occasionally for the treatment of migraine. Research is ongoing in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia and the US into the drug's usefulness in pain therapy, depression,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Zarate CA Jr, et al |title=Replication of Ketamine's Antidepressant Efficacy in Bipolar Depression: A Randomized Controlled Add-On Trial |journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=939–46 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22297150 |pmc=3343177|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.010|first2=Nancy E.|first3=Lobna|first4=Jose|first5=Nancy|first6=Anibal|first7=Jessica|first8=Craig A.|first9=Victoria|first10=David A.[/tpl] and for the treatment of alcoholism[tpl]Cite journal|author=Krystal JH, Madonick S, Perry E, et al. |title=Potentiation of low dose ketamine effects by naltrexone: potential implications for the pharmacotherapy of alcoholism |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1793–800 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16395307 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300994[/tpl] and heroin addiction.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Jovaisa T, Laurinenas G, Vosylius S, Sipylaite J, Badaras R, Ivaskevicius J |title=Effects of ketamine on precipitated opiate withdrawal |journal=Medicina |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=625–34 |year=2006 |pmid=16963828 |url=http://medicina.kmu.lt/0608/0608-03e.htm[/tpl]
Ketamine may be used in small doses (0.1–0.5 mg/kg·h) as a local anesthetic, particularly for the treatment of pain associated with movement and neuropathic pain.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lynch ME, Clark AJ, Sawynok J, Sullivan MJ |title=Topical amitriptyline and ketamine in neuropathic pain syndromes: an open-label study |journal=The Journal of Pain |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=644–9 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16202956 |doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2005.04.008[/tpl] It may also be used as an intravenous coanalgesic with opiates to manage otherwise intractable pain, particularly if this pain is neuropathic (pain due to vascular insufficiency or shingles are good examples). It has the added benefit of counteracting spinal sensitization or wind-up phenomena experienced with chronic pain. At these doses, the psychotropic side effects are less apparent and well managed with benzodiazepines.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Elia N, Tramèr MR |title=Ketamine and postoperative pain--a quantitative systematic review of randomised trials |journal=Pain |volume=113 |issue=1–2 |pages=61–70 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15621365 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2004.09.036[/tpl] Ketamine is a coanalgesic, so is most effective when used alongside a low-dose opioid; while it does have analgesic effects by itself, the higher doses required can cause disorienting side effects. The combination of ketamine with an opioid is, however, particularly useful for pain caused by cancer.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Saito O, Aoe T, Kozikowski A, Sarva J, Neale JH, Yamamoto T |title=Ketamine and N-acetylaspartylglutamate peptidase inhibitor exert analgesia in bone cancer pain |journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=891–8 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16960267|doi=10.1007/BF03022832[/tpl]
The effect of ketamine on the respiratory and circulatory systems is different from that of other anesthetics. When used at anesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Adams HA |title=Circulatory interactions during total intravenous anesthesia and analgesia-sedation |language=German |journal=Der Anaesthesist |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1081–7 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9451493 |doi=10.1007/s001010050510[/tpl] It is sometimes possible to perform ketamine anesthesia without protective measures to the airways. Ketamine is also a potent analgesic and can be used in subanesthetic doses to relieve acute pain; however, its psychotropic properties must be taken into account. Patients have reported vivid hallucinations, "going into other worlds" or "seeing God" while anesthetized, and these unwanted psychological side effects have reduced the use of ketamine in human medicine. They can, however, usually be avoided by concomitant application of a sedative such as a benzodiazepine.
Low-dose ketamine is recognized for its potential effectiveness in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).[tpl]Cite journal|author=Correll GE, Maleki J, Gracely EJ, Muir JJ, Harbut RE |title=Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy: a retrospective analysis of a novel therapeutic approach to complex regional pain syndrome |journal=Pain Medicine |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=263–75 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15367304 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2004.04043.x[/tpl] Although low-dose ketamine therapy is established as a generally safe procedure, reported side effects in some patients have included hallucinations, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea. Therefore, nurses administering ketamine to patients with CRPS should do so only in a setting where a trained physician is available if needed to assess potential adverse effects on patients.[tpl]cite press release |title=Severe Pain Relief may be Possible with a Common Anesthetic Drug |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=1 October 2004 |url=http://blackwellpublishing.com/press/pressitem.asp?ref=180 |accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl]
In some neurological intensive care units, ketamine has been used in cases of prolonged seizures. Some evidence indicates the NMDA-blocking effect of the drug protects neurons from glutamatergic damage during prolonged seizures.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Fujikawa DG |title=Neuroprotective Effect of Ketamine Administered After Status Epilepticus Onset |journal=Epilepsia |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=186–195 |year=1995 |pmid=7821277 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1995.tb00979.x[/tpl]
As part of a cream, gel, or liquid (only available from compounding pharmacies as it is not a branded product, specific formulation and ratios are specified by the prescribing physician) for topical application for nerve pain — the most common mixture is 10% ketoprofen, 5% lidocaine, and 10% ketamine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] Other ingredients found useful by pain specialists and their patients, as well as the compounding pharmacists who make the topical mixtures, include amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, clonidine, tramadol, gabapentin, baclofen, and mepivacaine and other longer-acting local anaesthetics (e.g. tetracaine, procaine).
Ketamine is a "core" medicine in the World Health Organization's "Essential Drugs List", a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system.

===Pain===

The dissociative anesthetic effects of ketamine have also been applied for postoperative pain management. Low doses of ketamine have been found to significantly reduce morphine consumption, as well as reports of nausea following abdominal surgery.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lundberg GD |title=Postoperative Ketamine Can Reduce Morphine Consumption and Nausea |journal=The Medscape Journal of Medicine |volume=10 |issue=10 |page=234 |year=2008 |pmc=2605142|pmid=[/tpl]

====Oral ketamine====

Ketamine can be started using the oral route, or people may be changed from a subcutaneous infusion once pain is controlled.  Bioavailability of oral ketamine hydrochloride is approximately 20%

====Converting from a 24-hour subcutaneous ketamine infusion to oral ketamine====

==Recreational use==

Unlike the other well-known dissociatives PCP and DXM, ketamine is very short-acting.  It takes effect within approximately 10 minutes,[tpl]cite web|url=https://knowledgex.camh.net/amhspecialists/resources_families/Pages/ketamine_dyk.aspx |title=Do you know...

Emergence reactions manifest as vivid dreams, hallucinations, and delirium and occur in 12% of patients. 
These reactions are much less common in patients 65 years old and when administered intramuscularly. Emergence reactions can occur up to 24 hours postoperatively. The chance of this 
occuring can be reduced by minimizing stimulation to the patient during recovery and pretreating 
with a benzodiazepine. If given a benzodiazepine, a lower dose of ketamine than normal should be 
given. Patients who experience severe reactions may require treatment with a small dose of a 
short or ultra-short acting barbiturate.[tpl]cite web|title=Ketamine|url=http://online.lexi.com.proxy1.lib.tju.edu/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/7135?hl=6420|work=Lexi-Comp Online|publisher=Lexi-Comp, Inc|accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl] 
Tonic-clonic movements are reported at higher anesthetic doses in greater than 10% of patients.
As discussed below, current research suggests that acute ketamine exposure does not cause significant neurotoxicity.

===Long term===

Because ketamine is not administered chronically in a typical clinical setting, long-term effects are primarily reported and investigated in recreational ketamine users and in animal models.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Celia J.

The first large-scale, longitudinal study of ketamine users found that current frequent ketamine users (at least 4 days/week, averaging 20 days/month) had increased depression and impaired memory by several measures, including verbal, short-term memory and visual memory. However, current infrequent (1–4 days/month, averaging 3.25 days/month) ketamine users and former ketamine users were not found to differ from controls in memory, attention and psychological well-being tests. This suggests the infrequent use of ketamine does not cause cognitive deficits, and that any deficits that might occur may be reversible when ketamine use is discontinued. However, abstinent, frequent, and infrequent users all scored higher than controls on a test of delusional symptoms.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02761.x |pmid=19919593 |title=Consequences of chronic ketamine self-administration upon neurocognitive function and psychological wellbeing: a 1-year longitudinal study |year=2009 |last1=Morgan |first1=Celia J.

Short-term exposure of cultures of GABAergic neurons to ketamine at high concentrations led to a significant loss of differentiated cells in one study, and non-cell-death-inducing concentrations of ketamine (10 μg/ml) may still initiate long-term alterations of dendritic arbor in differentiated neurons. The same study also demonstrated chronic (>24 h) administration of ketamine at concentrations as low as 0.01 μg/ml can interfere with the maintenance of dendritic arbor architecture. These results raise the possibility that chronic exposure to low, subanesthetic concentrations of ketamine, while not affecting cell survival, could still impair neuronal maintenance and development.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17418473 | doi=10.1016/j.tox.2007.03.004 | volume=234 | issue=3 | title=Low concentrations of ketamine initiate dendritic atrophy of differentiated GABAergic neurons in culture |date=May 2007 | journal=Toxicology | pages=216–26 | author=Vutskits L, Gascon E, Potter G, Tassonyi E, Kiss JZ[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Hargreaves RJ, Hill RG, Iversen LL |title=Neuroprotective NMDA antagonists: the controversy over their potential for adverse effects on cortical neuronal morphology |journal=Acta Neurochirurgica.

Some neonatal experts do not recommend the use of ketamine as an anesthetic agent in human neonates because of the potential adverse effects that it may have on the developing brain.

====Urinary tract effects====

According to a recent systematic review, 110 documented reports of irritative urinary tract symptoms from ketamine dependence exist.[tpl]cite journal|last=Middela|first=S.|coauthors=Pearce, I.|title=Ketamine-induced vesicopathy: a literature review|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=1 January 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=27–30|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02502.x|pmid=21155941[/tpl] Urinary tract symptoms have been collectively referred as "ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis" or "ketamine-induced vesicopathy", and they include urge incontinence, decreased bladder compliance, decreased bladder volume, detrusor overactivity, and painful haematuria (blood in urine). Bilateral hydronephrosis and renal papillary necrosis have also been reported in some cases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Celia J. A.|coauthors=Curran, H. Valerie|title=Ketamine use: a review|journal=Addiction|date=1 January 2012|volume=107|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03576.x|pmid=21777321[/tpl] The pathogenesis of papillary necrosis has been investigated in mice, and mononuclear inflammatory infiltration in the renal papilla resulting from ketamine dependence has been suggested as a possible mechanism.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yeung|first=LY|coauthors=Rudd, JA, Lam, WP, Mak, YT, Yew, DT|title=Mice are prone to kidney pathology after prolonged ketamine addiction|journal=Toxicology letters|date=2009-12-15|volume=191|issue=2–3|pages=275–8|pmid=19766175|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.09.006[/tpl]
The time of onset of lower urinary tract symptoms varies depending, in part, on the severity and chronicity of ketamine use; however, it is unclear whether the severity and chronicity of ketamine use corresponds linearly to the presentation of these symptoms. All reported cases where the user consumed greater than 5 grams per day reported symptoms of the lower urinary tract. Urinary tract symptoms appear to be most common in daily ketamine abusers who have abused the drug for an extended period of time. These symptoms have presented in only one case of medical use of ketamine. However, following dose reduction, the symptoms remitted.
Management of these symptoms primarily involves ketamine cessation, for which compliance is low. Other treatments have been used, including antibiotics, NSAIDs, steroids, anticholinergics, and cystodistension. Both hyaluronic acid instillation and combined pentosan polysulfate and ketamine cessation have been shown to provide relief in some patients, but in the latter case, it is unclear whether relief resulted from ketamine cessation, administration of pentosan polysulfate, or both. Further follow-up is required to fully assess the efficacy of these treatments.

====Case reports of hepatotoxicity in chronic pain management====

In case reports of three patients treated with (S)-(+)-ketamine for relief of chronic pain, liver enzyme abnormalities occurred following repeat treatment with ketamine infusions, with the liver enzyme values returning below the upper reference limit of normal range on cessation of the drug. The result suggests liver enzymes must be monitored during such treatment.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.pain.2011.04.031 |title=Ketamine hepato-toxicity in chronic pain management: Another example of unexpected toxicity or a predicted result from previous clinical and pre-clinical data?| journal = Pain | volume = 152 | issue = 9| year = 2011 | pages= 1946–7|last=Sear|first=JW | pmid=21555186 [/tpl]

==Interactions==

Other drugs which increase blood pressure may interact with ketamine in having an additive effect on blood pressure including: stimulants, SNRI anti-depressants, MAOIs. Increase blood pressure, increased heart rate, palpitations and arrhythmias may be potential effects.  Ketamine alone additionally increases intracranial pressure (ICP)
Ketamine may increase the effects of other sedatives, including but not limited to: benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates/opioids, anesthetics, and alcoholic beverages.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Mechanism of action==

===Central nervous system===

Ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist. It appears to inhibit the receptor by binding both in the open channel and at an allosteric site.Orser BA, Pennefather PS, MacDonald JF. (1997) "Multiple mechanisms of ketamine blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors".Anesthesiology. 86 (4) PMID 9105235 The S(+) and R(-) stereoisomers bind with different affinities: Ki = 3200 and 1100 nM, respectively.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hirota|first=K|coauthors=Lambert, DG|title=Ketamine: its mechanism(s) of action and unusual clinical uses|journal=British journal of anaesthesia|date=October 1996|volume=77|issue=4|pages=441–4|pmid=8942324|doi=10.1093/bja/77.4.441[/tpl] NMDAR antagonism results in analgesia by preventing central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons; in other words, ketamine's actions interfere with pain transmission in the spinal cord.[tpl]cite journal|last=Quibell|first=Rachel|coauthors=Prommer, Eric E., Mihalyo, Mary, Twycross, Robert, Wilcock, Andrew|title=Ketamine*|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=1 March 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=640–649|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.01.001|pmid=21419322[/tpl] Ketamine also inhibits nitric oxide synthase, inhibiting production of nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter involved in pain perception, and hence further contributing to analgesia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Aroni|first=F|coauthors=Iacovidou, N, Dontas, I, Pourzitaki, C, Xanthos, T|title=Pharmacological aspects and potential new clinical applications of ketamine: reevaluation of an old drug|journal=Journal of clinical pharmacology|date=August 2009|volume=49|issue=8|pages=957–64|pmid=19546251|doi=10.1177/0091270009337941[/tpl] It also interacts with sigma and opioid receptors, but with lower affinity and without significantly contributing to analgesia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rowland|first=LM|title=Subanesthetic ketamine: how it alters physiology and behavior in humans|journal=Aviation, space, and environmental medicine|date=July 2005|volume=76|issue=7 Suppl|pages=C52–8|pmid=16018330[/tpl]
Ketamine also interacts with a host of other receptors to effect analgesia. It blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels and depresses sodium channels, attenuating hyperalgesia; it alters cholinergic neurotransmission, which is implicated in pain mechanisms; and it acts as a noradrenaline and serotonin uptake inhibitor, which are involved in descending antinociceptive pathways.[tpl]cite journal|last=Meller|first=ST|title=Ketamine: relief from chronic pain through actions at the NMDA receptor?|journal=Pain|date=December 1996|volume=68|issue=2–3|pages=435–6|pmid=9121834|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(96)03167-3[/tpl]

===Peripheral systems===

Ketamine affects catecholaminergic transmission as noted above, producing measurable changes in peripheral organ systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems:

==Chemical structure==

Ketamine is a chiral compound. Most pharmaceutical preparations of ketamine are racemic; however, some brands reportedly have (mostly undocumented) differences in their enantiomeric proportions. The more active enantiomer, (S)-ketamine, is also available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Krüger |first1=A.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===

Ketamine is absorbable via intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to both its water and lipid solubilities.[tpl]cite journal|last=Aroni|first=F.|coauthors=Iacovidou, N., Dontas, I., Pourzitaki, C., Xanthos, T.|title=Pharmacological Aspects and Potential New Clinical Applications of Ketamine: Reevaluation of an Old Drug|journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=22 June 2009|volume=49|issue=8|pages=957–964|doi=10.1177/0091270009337941|pmid=19546251[/tpl] When administered orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, where it is biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through N-demethylation) and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into 5-hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Li|first=Jih-Heng|coauthors=Kasinather, Vickna, Cheung, Zhou, Nurhidayat, Jarlais, Des, Schottenfeld, Richard|title=To use or not to use: an update on licit and illicit ketamine use|journal=Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation|date=1 March 2011|page=11|doi=10.2147/SAR.S15458[/tpl] As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent anesthetically, and plasma levels of this metabolite are three times higher than ketamine following oral administration.

==Synthesis==

Ketamine is synthesized from 2-chlorobenzonitrile, which reacts with the Grignard reagent cyclopentylmagnesium bromide to give 1-(2-chlorobenzoyl)cyclopentane.C.L. Stevens, [tpl]US Patent|3254124[/tpl] (1966)C.L. Stevens, [tpl]Cite patent|BE|634208[/tpl] (1963 The next step is bromination using bromine to the corresponding bromoketone, which upon reaction with an aqueous solution of methylamine forms the methylimino derivative. During this reaction, a simultaneous hydrolysis of the tertiary bromine atom occurs. On heating the reaction product in decalin, a ring-expansion rearrangement occurs, forming ketamine.

==History==

===Medical use===

Ketamine was originally developed in 1962 as a derivative of phencyclidine (PCP), which was synthesized in 1926, a feat made possible by the discovery of a new organic Grignard reaction by Parke-Davis scientist Harold Maddox.[tpl]cite journal|last=Domino|first=EF|title=Taming the ketamine tiger. 1965|journal=Anesthesiology|date=September 2010|volume=113|issue=3|pages=678–84|pmid=20693870|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181ed09a2[/tpl] Initially known as CI-581, ketamine was first synthesized by Parke-Davis scientist Calvin Stevens. Pharmacological investigations in human subjects began in 1964. These investigations demonstrated that ketamine's shorter duration of action and lesser psychotomimetic profile made it favorable over PCP as a "dissociative" anesthetic.[tpl]cite journal|last=Corssen|first=G|coauthors=Domino, EF|title=Dissociative anesthesia: further pharmacologic studies and first clinical experience with the phencyclidine derivative CI-581|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Jan–Feb 1966|volume=45|issue=1|pages=29–40|pmid=5325977[/tpl] Following FDA approval in 1970, ketamine anesthesia was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War.[tpl]cite web|title=Ketamine|url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/ketamine.asp|publisher=University of Maryland Center for Substance Abuse Research|accessdate=23 February 2014[/tpl]

===Nonmedical use===

Nonmedical use of ketamine began on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1970s. Early use was documented in underground literature such as The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

====Human studies====

Research on the antidepressant effects of ketamine infusions at subanaesthetic doses has consistently shown rapid (4 to 72 hours) responses from single doses, with substantial improvement in mood in the majority of patients and remission in some. However, these effects are often short-lived, and attempts to prolong the antidepressant effect with repeated doses and extended ("maintenance") treatment have resulted in only modest success.[tpl]cite journal |title=Ketamine as a new treatment for depression: a review of its efficacy and adverse effects |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=47 |pages=710–27 |date=Aug 2013 |pmid=23661785 |doi=10.1177/0004867413486842 |author=Katalinic N, Lai R, Somogyi A, Mitchell PB, Glue P, Loo CK. |issue=8[/tpl]
When treating patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with a low-dose (subanesthetic) ketamine infusion, some patients were observed in the early 2000s to make a significant recovery from depression. This recovery was not formally documented, as the primary concern was pain management and it was not possible to quantify to what degree depression recovery was secondary to the patient's recovery from CRPS.  This led the investigators to conduct a study in two patients with severe depression, with the dose carefully monitored to prevent hallucinogenic side effects.

In a recently published study, 59 detoxified inpatients with heroin dependence received a ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KPT) session prior to their discharge from an addiction treatment hospital, and were then randomized into two treatment groups.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Participants in the first group received two addiction counseling sessions followed by two KPT sessions (with a single IM injection of 2 mg/kg ketamine), with sessions scheduled on a monthly interval (multiple KPT group). Participants in the second group received two addiction counseling sessions on a monthly interval, but no additional ketamine therapy sessions (single KPT group). At one-year follow-up, survival analysis demonstrated a significantly higher rate of abstinence in the multiple KPT group. Thirteen of 26 subjects (50%) in the multiple KPT group remained abstinent, compared to 6 of 27 subjects (22.2%) in the single KPT group (p Krupitsky and Kolp summarized their work to date in 2007.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Krupitsky |last2=Kolp |chapter=Ketamine Psychedelic Psychotherapy |title=Psychedelic Medicine: New Evidence for Hallucinogens as Treatments |editor=Michael J.

===Complex regional pain syndrome===

Ketamine is being used as an experimental and controversial treatment for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). CRPS/RSD is a severe chronic pain condition characterized by sensory, autonomic, motor, and dystrophic signs and symptoms. The pain in CRPS is continuous, worsens over time, and is usually disproportionate to the severity and duration of the inciting event. The hypothesis is that ketamine manipulates NMDA receptors which might reboot aberrant brain activity. One treatment modality is a low-dose ketamine infusion of between 25 and 90 mg per day, over five days, either in hospital or as an outpatient, called the awake technique.
Open label, prospective, pain journal evaluation of a 10-day infusion of intravenous ketamine (awake technique) in the CRPS patient concluded, "A four-hour ketamine infusion escalated from 40–80 mg over a 10-day period can result in a significant reduction of pain with increased mobility and a tendency to decreased autonomic dysregulation".[tpl]Cite journal|author=Goldberg ME, Domsky R, Scaringe D, et al. |title=Multi-day low dose ketamine infusion for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome |journal=Pain Physician |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=175–9 |date=April 2005 |pmid=16850072 |url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159&vol=8&page=175[/tpl]
Case notes of 33 patients whose CRPS pain was treated by the inpatient administration of a continuous subanesthetic intravenous infusion of ketamine were reviewed at Mackay Base Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 33 patients with diagnoses of CRPS who had undergone ketamine treatment at least once were identified. Due to relapse, 12 of 33 patients received a second course of therapy, and two of 33 patients received a third. There was complete pain relief in 25 (76%), partial relief in six (18%), and no relief in two (6%) patients.
The degree of relief obtained following repeat therapy (N=12) appeared even better, as all 12 patients who received second courses of treatment experienced complete relief of their CRPS pain. The duration of relief was also impressive, as was the difference between the duration of relief obtained after the first and after the second courses of therapy. In this respect, following the first course of therapy, 54% of 33 individuals remained pain-free for three months or more and 31% remained pain free for six months or more. After the second infusion, 58% of 12 patients experienced relief for a year or more, while almost 33% remained pain free for over three years. The most frequent side effect observed in patients receiving this treatment was a feeling of inebriation. Hallucinations occurred in six patients. Less-frequent side effects also included complaints of light-headedness, dizziness, and nausea. In four patients, an alteration in hepatic enzyme profile was noted; the infusion was terminated and the abnormality resolved thereafter. No long-term side effects were noted. This procedure has only recently been allowed in the United States for the treatment of CRPS.
A second treatment modality consists of putting the patient into a medically induced coma and giving an extremely high dosage of ketamine, typically between 600 and 900 mg.CNN report on ketamine therapy for CRPS/RSD 1 September 2006 This version, previously done in Germany and Mexico, is now currently only preformed in the United States.http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/80/1_MeetingAbstracts/P02.011[tpl]full|date=December 2013[/tpl] According to Dr Schwartzman, 14 of 41 patients in the coma-induced ketamine experiments were completely cured. "We haven't cured the original injury", he says, "but we have cured the RSD or kept it in remission. The RSD pain is gone." He added, "No one ever cured it before... In 40 years, I have never seen anything like it. These are people who were disabled and in horrible pain. Most were completely incapacitated. They go back to work, back to school, and are doing everything they used to do. Most are on no medications at all. I have taken morphine pumps out of people. You turn off the pain and reset the whole system."
In Tuebingen, Germany, Dr Kiefer treated a patient who presented with a rapidly progressing contiguous spread of CRPS from a severe ligamentous wrist injury. Standard pharmacological and interventional therapy successively failed to halt the spread of CRPS from the wrist to the entire right arm. Her pain was unmanageable with all standard therapies. As a last treatment option, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and treated on a compassionate care basis with anesthetic doses of ketamine in gradually increasing (3–5 mg/kg·h) doses in conjunction with midazolam over a period of five days. On the second day, edema and discoloration began to resolve and increased spontaneous movement was noted. On day six, symptoms completely resolved and infusions were tapered. The patient emerged from anesthesia completely free of pain and associated CRPS signs and symptoms. The patient has maintained this complete remission from CRPS for eight years now. The psychiatric side effects of ketamine were successfully managed with the concomitant use of midazolam and resolved within a month of treatment.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kiefer RT, Rohr P, Ploppa A, Altemeyer KH, Schwartzman RJ |title=Complete recovery from intractable complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS-type I, following anesthetic ketamine and midazolam |journal=Pain Practice |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=147–50 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17559485 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2007.00123.x[/tpl]

===Fear of harm===

According to a recent report on NPR,http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/03/25/174928768/how-an-unlikely-drug-helps-some-children-consumed-by-fear[tpl]full|date=December 2013[/tpl] Demitri Papolos uses ketamine to treat children with "fear of harm" profile, a condition characterized by: sleep disturbances including frequent and terrifying nightmares; an extreme reaction when anyone tries to control their behavior; and overheating, especially at night. Although "fear of harm" profile has been lumped in with bipolar disorder over the recent decades that understanding is emerging about these concerns, "fear of harm" may be related to an overly-sensitive "flight-or-fight" reaction, which classical bipolar disorder is not.

==Veterinary medicine==

In veterinary anesthesia, ketamine is often used for its anesthetic and analgesic effects on cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, and other small animals. It is an important part of the "rodent cocktail" a mixture of drugs used for anesthetizing rodents.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Veterinarians often use ketamine with sedative drugs to produce balanced anesthesia and analgesia, and as a constant-rate infusion to help prevent pain wind-up. Ketamine is used to manage pain among large animals, though it has less effect on bovines.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] It is the primary intravenous anesthetic agent used in equine surgery, often in conjunction with detomidine and thiopental, or sometimes guaifenesin.

==Use in Modern Culture==

Ketamine was referenced in several episodes of the television show House. It was first mentioned in the finale of the second season, No Reason,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787373/|title="House M.D." No Reason (TV Episode)|accessdate=April 30, 2014[/tpl] and was responsible for temporarily relieving House's leg pain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/tv-review-house-season-finale-no/|title=TV Review: House Season Finale - No Reason|accessdate=April 30, 2014[/tpl]
