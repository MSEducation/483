Simone Holcomb, a specialist soldier in the Colorado National Guard, and her husband Vaughn were both sent to Iraq. While serving there, they left their seven children in the care of Vaughn's mother. At one point during the tour the latter had to return to Ohio to look after her own father, leaving the children to be looked after by other family members.  
In the meantime, Vaughn's ex-wife had filed suit to obtain custody for the two children from their previous marriage. Vaughn and Simone were granted compassionate leave; and Simone refused to return to Iraq at its end, in order to care for her children.
After some media coverage, Simone was reassigned to Fort Carson.
