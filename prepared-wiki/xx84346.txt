The Associação Académica de Coimbra – Organismo Autónomo de Futebol (A.A.C. – O.A.F.), also referred to as Académica de Coimbra ([tpl]IPA-pt|ɐkɐˈðɛmikɐ ðɨ kuˈĩbɾɐ[/tpl]) or simply Académica, is an autonomous and professional football organization based in Coimbra, Portugal.
The team was created inside of the students' union of the University of Coimbra – the Associação Académica de Coimbra, during a period of changing in the 1970s and 1980s, when football was professionalized in Portugal. But its foundation as a students amateur sports association backs to 1876, so it is effectively one of the oldest sports institutions in Portugal. The club is claimed by its fans to be the fourth in number of supporters (after Benfica, Sporting Clube de Portugal and FC Porto). It is a sports club emotionally and historically related to the university life, so through generations, many students, even those born in farther regions, became lifelong supporters of the team. In general, much of the city's population identifies itself as Académicas' fans or sympathisers. The main football team uses the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (specially rebuilt and modernized for the UEFA Euro 2004) with 30,000 seats. The Associação Académica de Coimbra, the mother institution of the professionalized A.A.C. – O.A.F. autonomous football organisation, has several sports branches performing under the same AAC logo and using the same black colors, being effectively one of the largest sports clubs of Portugal. The Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. has also a futsal department (Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. (futsal)). In 1938–39, the football team won their first Portuguese Football Cup, the first under the tournament's current name and a feat they would repeat in 2011–12. In 1966–67, they achieved their highest position of runner-up in the Primeira Liga table. In the 2012–2013 season, Académica qualified for the group stage of the Europa League for the first time.

==History and tradition==

Being today the most important sports club of Coimbra, Académica was founded by students of the University of Coimbra in 1876, when Clube Atlético de Coimbra (founded in 1861) and Academia Dramática (founded in 1837) merged. The equipment used is black shirt, shorts and socks, due to the relation to and origin in the local and famous University of Coimbra where students wear a typical all-black suit. In the beginning, Académica's footballers were all mostly university students, and very talented players were discovered in the pitch. This was the rule during many decades until the 1970s. Académica used to be a constant team in the Portuguese main division before 1974. After the 25 de Abril Revolution (1974) in Portugal, many changes took place in Portuguese society and the team experienced many changes. Between 1974–75 and 1983–84 football seasons, Académica was present in national competitions as C.A.C. – Clube Académico de Coimbra and after a period of uncertainty and several relegations to the Second Division, the Académica's football team and staff, were gradually professionalized aiming to achieve a stronger position in the modern times of fierce professional competition (although a small number of its modern players continue being students, and among them, a few at the University of Coimbra).

==Training and youth facilities==

Founded in 2007, the Centro de Estágios da Académica is Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.'s training center and youth academy. In addition, the club has a multiuse sports arena – the Pavilhão Jorge Anjinho. The club also uses the stadium facilities which are the tracks around the football pitch for fitness and running tests.

==Coimbra Stadium==

The Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (Coimbra City Stadium) is the home ground of Académica de Coimbra football team, and belongs to Coimbra's municipality. The stadium has 30,210 seats, two-thirds of which are covered and offers several amenities and services. Until 2003, it used to be called Estádio Municipal de Coimbra (Coimbra's Municipality Stadium) or Estádio do Calhabé (Stadium of Calhabé), after the name of its location in Coimbra. It had a capacity of 15,000, all seated, but just one small covered area. Then it was rebuilt, expanded and modernized to host some UEFA Euro 2004 matches. The Estádio Cidade de Coimbra was inaugurated with a Rolling Stones concert on 27 September 2003, attended by over 50,000 people. On 29 October 2003, Académica de Coimbra played at home to Benfica, in the first official match in the remodelled stadium.
