WTMX (101.9 FM "The Mix") is an Adult Top 40 radio station licensed to Skokie, IL in the Chicago market. It is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting.  WTMX has studios at One Prudential Plaza and its transmitter co-located atop Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower).

==History==

The station currently known as WTMX began as WCLR in December 1970; prior to that, its call sign was WRSV (for Radio Skokie Valley). The station ran a "beautiful music" format for years. The station played easy listening renditions of pop standards/other songs along with a few vocalists and AC artists. The station dropped the instrumentals in the late 1970s and became a very Soft AC station still known as MOR playing a blend of easy listening vocals and soft pop songs from the 1950s to 1970s.

===The 1980s===

By the early 1980s, the station evolved to a straight-ahead AC format with studios located at 8833 Gross Point Road in Skokie, Illinois. WCLR was "Chicago's Lite Rock" from about 1982 until 1989. The station was best known for its soft rock and lite rock starsets in the 1980s and their Saturday night all-request oldies program.
In 1989, WCLR moved to a hot AC format, changed its call letters to WTMX, and became known as "The Mix". By 1995, WTMX had moved its studios to the Prudential Building in downtown Chicago and began leaning more toward modern rock. By 1996, the format was modern AC, basically modern rock without any hard rock. They played more female vocalists and 1980s retro music than most modern rock stations and were hot AC in tempo and presentation.

===The 1990s and the debut of the Eric & Kathy Morning Show===

In September 1996, The Mix debuted the "Eric & Kathy Morning Show" fronted by Chicago natives Eric Ferguson and Kathy Hart. They have boasted strong listenership among advertiser-coveted 25-to-54-year-old females for most of their tenure at the station. The key to the success of this entertainment based, lifestyle driven show has been its ability to keep the content edgy enough to engage grownups. On any given week, The Eric & Kathy Show will feature interviews with top Hollywood celebrities, including Josh Duhamel, Melissa McCarthy, Will Ferrell, Maria Menounos, Jenny McCarthy, Jeff Garlin and others. In addition to celebrated guests, the show has played host to live performances from platinum selling, chart topping artists like Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Bruno Mars, Bon Jovi, Kelly Clarkson, Train and others.

===The 2000s===

In February 2006, WTMX began broadcasting in HD Radio. WTMX's HD-2 format originally featured music from independent, unsigned bands called "iChannel". WTMX-HD2 then aired an all-80's format called "Totally '80s" until January 7, 2014, when the HD-2 format flipped to Smooth Jazz, relaying the stream of former WNUA/WLFM-LP programmer Rick O'Dell's SmoothJazzChicago.net.  "Totally '80s" is now available on the HD-2 stream of sister station WILV."WTMX adds Smooth on HD2", RBR.com, 07 January 2014.
Also in 2006, WTMX evolved toward an Adult Top 40 format with the addition of pop-crossover music by artists such as Rihanna, Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, while still retaining many of the modern AC artists they have been playing since 1996.
