[[Freeway Series]]

CATEGORIES: Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, Interleague play, Major League Baseball rivalries

The term Freeway Series refers to a series of baseball games played between Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim  of the American League and Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5.  The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams. The term "Freeway Series" also inspired the official name of the regions' NHL rivalry: the Freeway Face-Off.[tpl]cite news|title=No controversy, just champions|date=December 14, 2007|first=Peter|last=Yoon|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=D3|quote=Now that we have the Freeway Faceoff between the Kings and Ducks to go along with the Freeway Series between the Dodgers and Angels, we need a name for this. It might be difficult to incorporate 'freeway' into it, though, since they share the same building. Maybe we could call it the 'We took the same freeway as you did to get here tipoff.' Or, 'The showdown at the intersection of the 10 and 110 freeways.'[/tpl]

==Background==

The rise of Southern California as a major region of the United States brought about a significant economic rivalry between neighboring Los Angeles and Orange counties.  
To many living outside of Southern California, the entire region is often simply referred to as "LA", associating Los Angeles and Orange counties with the same stereotypes and preconceptions. However, the two counties differ sharply in  political ideology, socioeconomic status, and demographics. Los Angeles County is more liberal, and is represented by a more ethnically diverse population, while Orange County remains one of the most conservative areas in the state.[tpl]cite news|title=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml[/tpl]  This divide led to the Los Angeles/Orange county line to be colloquially referred to as the Orange Curtain. This can be somewhat misleading, though, because the older, more urban, cities of northern and central Orange County (Anaheim, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Buena Park etc.) are much more in tune with Los Angeles county cities than their southern Orange County counterparts. These older Orange County cities are much more diverse and less homogenous than the south, and the income levels and demographics represent this.

==History==

The first exhibition game between the two clubs (won by the Angels) was played in 1962 in Palm Springs, at the time the spring training home of the Angels. The first pre-season series was played at Dodger Stadium, at the time the home ballpark of both teams  April 6–7, 1963.  The Angels won both of the two games played. After the Angels added Los Angeles to their official name in 2005, the rivalry took on renewed interest, as the series took on a more intracity atmosphere.
Throughout the 2005 season, Dodger Stadium listed the Angels as "ANA" on its out-of-town scoreboard and team schedules, as it was prior to Angels' name change. However, the Dodgers now post "LAA" on both their scoreboard and schedules. Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully refers to the team as just the Angels when mentioning them on the air.  Dodgers tickets still refer to the Angels as the "Anaheim Angels." As of the 2011 season, however, the Angels' out-of-town scoreboard in right field still lists the Dodgers by their pre-2005 "LA" abbreviation instead of "LAD".  The Angels' name change was largely opposed by the Dodgers organization, city and county of Los Angeles, Anaheim, every other city in Orange County, and fans on both sides.  The prevailing argument was that the Angels did not play within Los Angeles county limits, and that adding LA to the name inaccurately represented the location and background of the team's fans.  The Angels' ownership countered that bringing the Los Angeles name to the American League was beneficial to the entire region and organization.[tpl]cite news|title=http://laist.com/2008/06/16/la_angels_name_change_hearing_postp.php[/tpl] The adding of the "Los Angeles" to the Angels name still causes some resentment in the minds of both Angel and Dodger fans today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] 
Regular- and post-season games between the two teams take place at either Angel Stadium of Anaheim or Dodger Stadium. The two stadiums are located approximately [tpl]Convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] apart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=1000+Elysian+Park+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&daddr=2000+Gene+Autry+Way,+Anaheim,+CA+92806&ie=UTF8&z=11&om=1|title=Driving directions to 2000 E Gene Autry Way, Anaheim, CA 92806|work=Google Maps[/tpl]
At one point, both teams were owned by major media conglomerates: the Angels had been owned by the Walt Disney Company, and the Dodgers were owned by News Corporation (both companies each own one of the MLB broadcast partners, with News Corporation changing its name to 21st Century Fox in 2013). Both teams have been sold in recent years.
During the 2002 World Series, there was a moment of peace in the rivalry as a result of the nightmares the Dodgers and their fans were facing because the Angels played the San Francisco Giants, the fierce in-state rivals of the Dodgers.[tpl]cite news|quote=Dodgers fans look to the Angels coaching staff—former Dodgers Mike Scioscia, Mickey Hatcher, Ron Roenicke and Alfredo Griffin—as another reason to like the Angels...The Southern California connection, as well as the north-south divide, also plays a role...Most true-blue Dodgers fans are looking beyond Mickey Mouse and are hoping the Angels reduce the Giants to gnats.|title=Many Dodgers fans wearing a halo|date=October 21, 2002|first=Richard|last=Chang|newspaper=Orange County Register|page=Angels[/tpl][tpl]cite news|quote=The way Angel Manager Mike Scioscia figures it, Dodger fans will be rooting for the Angels during the World Series, if only as the lesser of two evils.
