[[The Presence of the Lord Is Here]]

CATEGORIES: Gospel songs

"The Presence of the Lord Is Here" is a contemporary worship song, written by gospel musician, Kurt Carr, that was originally recorded by Byron Cage on the Live at New Birth Cathedral CD.  Since its release in 2003, it has become a common praise & worship  song. The presence of the Lord was very much felt by the Israelites in the Exodus. The Lord was with them throughout the journey to guide and provide their needs.
Kurt Carr also adapted the song for his own recording of "My Time For God's Favor (The Presence of the Lord Remix)", on his 2004 One Church CD.
