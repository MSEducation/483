==History==

Snowcem began manufacturing exterior paints and coatings for the Indian market in 1959, having been established in Mumbai in that year by George Lillington. Snowcem launched the Sandtex brand in 1970, which had strong sales in the European market. In 2002–3 the company was the largest manufacturer of cement paint in India, enjoying between 25–30 per cent of the national market share in this type of powder paint to which water is added, and had attracted the acquisitive attentions of Asian Paints and Berger Paints India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/businessline/2002/10/10/stories/2002101002480100.htm |title=The Hindu Business Line : Berger to buy Snowcem paints business  Due diligence process to be taken up soon |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2010-09-27[/tpl] By 2008, however, the company had retained its independence and launched new products to augment its traditional reliance upon cement paint, including external acrylic emulsions and other liquid paints.
