==History==

LVUSD was founded by English immigrant Arthur Edward Wright (1888–1978), a plasterer by trade with only an elementary education. A.E. Wright Middle School is named after him.
When the district was created, its offices were located on the grounds of the Round Meadow Elementary School in Calabasas.[tpl]cite news | last = Smith | first = Sharon D. | title = District moves to new site; Las Virgenes school board in Calabasas | work = Los Angeles Daily News | date = 1990-05-21 | page = T1[/tpl] They were then moved in 1974 to 30961 West Agoura Road in Westlake Village, and again in 1990 to a two-story building at 4111 North Las Virgenes Road, next to the A.E. Wright Middle School.
The district formed a school foundation, the Las Virgenes School Foundation, in the early 1980s to find alternative sources of money. While it raised nearly a million dollars, the foundation died out in the mid-1980s.
The Las Virgenes Educational Foundation was created in the 1980s. During those early years, the LVEF helped promote new technology in the classroom. In 2003, the Foundation stepped forward to help close the district's budget gap caused by cutbacks in California state funding, through a regional fundraising effort. Additionally, the Foundation took over operations of the district's accelerated summer school program, previously operated by a for-profit third party. The Board of the LVEF is designed to be representative of the community, and made up of individuals who can bring unique perspectives and advantages to the organization.
