Benburb Football Club are a Scottish football club, based in Govan, Glasgow. Formed in 1885 they are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association and currently compete in the SJFA Central Division One.
They have struggled somewhat in recent years, although they did win the Central League title in 2000. Playing in the vicinity of Rangers they struggle to maintain a decent level of support.
The origins of the club name are somewhat hazy, although it has been suggested that it has its roots in Northern Ireland, with a village of the same name being located there. The suggestion is that they were formed by Northern Irish immigrants to Glasgow.
Until March 2014, Benburb were based at Tinto Park in Glasgow's Govan district. Plans for a new ground - to be built close to Tinto Park - have been announced.
The club colours are blue and white. They recently employed a new physiotherapist, Amin Hussain, who is set to stay and assist the team.
The final match at Tinto Park ended in a 2-1 victory to Benburb against Johnstone Burgh in a Central League Division 1 game, on Saturday 29th March 2014.
