==History==

Known in Crusader times as Deirelcobebe, the ruins of the ancient Canaanite city of Lachish lay adjacent to the village,[tpl]sfn|Stillman| 1979| p=57[/tpl] which was subject to extensive archaeological excavations by the British Mandatory authorities in Palestine, and by Israeli authorities subsequent to its capture during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.[tpl]Cite web|title=Welcome to Al-Qubayba|publisher=Palestine Remembered|accessdate=2007-12-06|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Hebron/al-Qubayba/index.html[/tpl]
In 1596 Al-Qubayba  was a village in the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza under the liwa' (district) of Gaza, with a population of 182.  It  paid taxes on  wheat, barley, sesame, and fruit trees, as well as goats and beehives.[tpl]sfn|Hütteroth|Abdulfattah|1977|p=146[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Khalidi|1992|p=220[/tpl]
In the late 19th century,   Al-Qubayba  was described as a large village built of adobe brick, situated on rolling hills near a plain, surrounded by a barren and stony area.[tpl]sfn|Khalidi|1992|p=220[/tpl]
The population was Muslim, and the village had a school, a mosque, and a number of small shops. Two wells located northwest and  southwest of it provided drinking water. By 1944/45 11,912 dunums of land belonged to the village, of which 8,109 dunums were allotted to cereals.[tpl]sfn|Khalidi|1992|p=220[/tpl]

==1948, and after==

Al-Qubayba was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan.[tpl]Cite web|title=Map of UN Partition Plan|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2009-03-22|url=http://domino.un.org/maps/m0103_1b.gif| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090318185550/http://domino.un.org/maps/m0103_1b.gif| archivedate= 18 March 2009 |ref=harv[/tpl]
The village was first attacked during Operation Barak.
Though defended by Egyptian forces, al-Qubayba was taken by Israeli forces in the final stages of Operation Yoav on 28 October 1948. The population had fled and the village was destroyed
In 1955 the settlement of Lakhish was established to the southwest of the site on village lands.[tpl]sfn|Khalidi|1992| p= 221[/tpl]
Of the village mosque, an elementary school, and more than 141 houses that made up al-Qubayba, Walid Khalidi notes that all that remains to mark the site in contemporary times are cactuses and a handful of olive trees.

==Culture==

A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves), from Qubeiba dated to about 1910 forms part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is a collage of different fabrics, textures and colors. The front and the upper half of the back are of black cotton. The chest panel, the side panels and the lower back of the skirt are handwoven indigo linen. Colorful silk cross-stitch embroidery, in red, violet, orange, yellow, green and black, create an effect described as "particularly gay, twinkling"[tpl]sfn|Stillman| 1979| p=57[/tpl] The qabbeh (square chest panel) is embroidered with the qurunful ("clove") motif, and it has vertical rows of eight-pointed stars, called qamr ("moons"), and a row of the mushut ("combs") pattern. There are eight embroidered columns on each side panel of the dress. The patterns which are used are fanajin qahweh ("coffee cups"), khem-el-basha ("the pashas tent"), irq el-ward ("rose branch"), and miftah Khalil ("key of Hebron"). There is also a pattern (with flowers, moons, trees, tents and tiles) not seen anywhere else in the MOMA collection. Finally, there is also some embroidery at the wrists.[tpl]sfn|Stillman| 1979| p=57[/tpl]
