It was established as a mission of Immaculate Conception Church in Amenia in 1870, and elevated to parish status in 1889. The first pastor was E.M. Byrne. During his administration a former Baptist church building was purchased in Bangall and refitted as the Church of the Immaculate Conception. It was served by priests from St. Joseph's, as was the mission at Oak Summit.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X.
