The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish.
A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colorful carp (Carassius auratus) native to east Asia. It was first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).

==History and evolution==

===History===

Starting in ancient China, various species of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) have been domesticated and reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oceanpark.com.hk/html/en/learning/facts/goldfish.html |title=Goldfish |publisher=Ocean Park |accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Roots|first=Clive|title=Domestication|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport|isbn=978-0-313-33987-5|pages=20–21[/tpl]
During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. On special occasions at which guests were expected they would be moved to a much smaller container for display.[ref]

By the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the domestication of goldfish was firmly established.[tpl]cite book|last=Smartt|first=Joseph|title=Goldfish varieties and genetics: A handbook for breeders|year=2001|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-85238-265-3|page=21[/tpl] In 1162, the empress of the Song Dynasty ordered the construction of a pond to collect the red and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being the imperial color. This is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed.[tpl]cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090901050610/http://www.wetpetz.com/goldfish.htm | title=goldfish | accessdate=2013-02-28[/tpl]
During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), goldfish also began to be raised indoors, which led to the selection for mutations that would not be able to survive in ponds. The occurrence of other colors (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276. The first occurrence of fancy-tailed goldfish was recorded in the Ming Dynasty. In 1603, goldfish were introduced to Japan, where the Ryukin and Tosakin varieties were developed. In 1611, goldfish were introduced to Portugal and from there to other parts of Europe.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/info/info.htm | title=Background information about goldfish | publisher=Bristol Aquarists' Society | accessdate=2006-07-28[/tpl]
During the 1620s, goldfish were highly regarded in southern Europe because of their metallic scales, and symbolized good luck and fortune. It became tradition for married men to give their wives a goldfish on their one-year anniversary, as a symbol for the prosperous years to come. This tradition quickly died, as goldfish became more available, losing their status.  Goldfish were first introduced to North America around 1850 and quickly became popular in the United States.[tpl]cite book | last = Brunner | first = Bernd | title = The Ocean at Home | publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year=  2003| location = New York | isbn = 1-56898-502-9 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Mulertt |first=Hugo |title=The Goldfish And Its Systematic Culture With A View To Profit |year=1883|url=http://www.archive.org/details/goldfishitssyste00mule |accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl]

===Related species===

Goldfish were bred from Prussian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) in China, and they remain the closest wild relative of the goldfish.[tpl]cite journal|last=Komiyama |first=Tomoyoshi |coauthors=Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Yoshio Tateno, Hidetoshi Inoko, Takashi Gojobori, Kazuho Ikeo |title=An evolutionary origin and selection process of goldfish |journal=Gene |date=February 2009 |volume=430 |issue=1–2|pmid=19027055 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2008.10.019|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T39-4TVTJKP-5/2/cb35c47220bf1552372c4df41aa6e58e|accessdate=2010-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Common Gold Fish | work=Aquarticles | author=Les Pearce | url=http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/ponds/Pearce_Common_Goldfishhtml.htm | accessdate=20 June 2006 [/tpl] Previously, some sources claimed the  Crucian carp  (Carassius carassius) as the wild version of the goldfish. However, they are differentiated by several characteristics. C. auratus have a more pointed snout while the snout of a C. carassius is well rounded. C. gibelio often has a grey/greenish color, while crucian carps are always golden bronze. Juvenile crucian carp have a black spot on the base of the tail which disappears with age. In C. auratus this tail spot is never present. C. auratus have fewer than 31 scales along the lateral line while crucian carp have 33 scales or more.
When found in nature, C. auratus gibelio are olive green. Introduction of goldfish into the wild can cause problems for native species. Goldfish can hybridize with certain other species of carp. Within three breeding generations, the vast majority of the hybrid spawn revert to their natural olive color. The mutation that gave rise to the domestic goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Koi may also interbreed with the goldfish to produce a sterile hybrid fish.
There are many different varieties of domesticated goldfish. Fancy goldfish are unlikely to survive in the wild because of their bright colors and long fins; however the hardier varieties such as the Shubunkin or Comet may survive long enough to breed with wild cousins. Common and comet goldfish can survive, and even thrive, in any climate that can support a pond.

==Biology==

===Size===

As of April 2008, the largest goldfish in the world was believed by the BBC to measure [tpl]convert|19|in|cm[/tpl], and be living in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7352909.stm |title=Giant goldfish 'simply amazing' |publisher=BBC News |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl] At the time, a goldfish named "Goldie", kept as a pet in a tank in Folkestone, England, was measured as [tpl]convert|15|in|cm[/tpl] and over [tpl]convert|2|lb|kg[/tpl], and named as the second largest in the world behind the Netherlands fish. The secretary of the Federation of British Aquatic Societies (FBAS) stated of Goldie's size that "I would think there are probably a few bigger goldfish that people don't think of as record holders, perhaps in ornamental lakes". In July 2010, a goldfish measuring [tpl]convert|16|in|cm[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|5|lb|kg[/tpl] was caught in a pond in Poole, England, thought to have been abandoned there after outgrowing a tank.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-10649008 |title=Surrey schoolboy catches 5lb goldfish in Dorset lake |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl]

===Feeding===

In the wild, the diet of goldfish consists of crustaceans, insects, and various plant matter. Like most fish, they are opportunistic feeders and do not stop eating on their own accord. Overfeeding can be deleterious to their health, typically by blocking the intestines. This happens most often with selectively bred goldfish, which have a convoluted intestinal tract. When excess food is available, they produce more waste and faeces, partly due to incomplete protein digestion. Overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca.
Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.

===Vision===

Goldfish vision is among the most studied of all vision in fishes.[tpl]cite book |title=Sensory Processing in Aquatic Environments |last=Neumeyer |first=C.|editor=Collin, S.P. and Marshall, N.J. |chapter=Color Vision in Fishes and Its Neural Basis |coauthors= |year=2003|publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=|page=223|quote=In goldfish, as the best investigated fish species...[/tpl] Goldfish have four kinds of cone cells, which are respectively sensitive to different colors: red, green, blue and ultraviolet. The ability to distinguish between four different primary colors classifies them as tetrachromats.[tpl]cite book| last = Neumeyer| first = Christa  | title = Das Farbensehen des Goldfisches: Eine verhaltensphysiologische Analyse|year = 1988| publisher = G. Thieme| isbn = 313718701X[/tpl]

===Varieties of domesticated goldfish===

Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the "golden" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish live only in aquariums—they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the "wild" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. Currently, there are about 300 breeds recognized in China. The vast majority of goldfish breeds today originated from China. Some of the main varieties are:

====Chinese goldfish classification====

Chinese tradition classifies goldfish into four main types. These classifications are not commonly used in the West.

===Reproduction===

Goldfish may only grow to sexual maturity with enough water and the right nutrition. Most goldfish breed in captivity, particularly in pond settings. Breeding usually happens after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase gravid female goldfish (females carrying eggs), and prompt them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them.
Goldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation, typically dense plants such as Cabomba or Elodea or a spawning mop. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours.
Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish color; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish (or other fish and insects) in their environment.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://thefishvet.com.au/pdf/Care_Gf_byRL.pdf|title=Goldfish (Carassius auratus)|first=Richmond|last=Loh|publisher=The Fish Vet.com|accessdate=December 31, 2013[/tpl]
Some highly bred goldfish can no longer breed naturally due to their altered shape. The artificial breeding method called "hand stripping" can assist nature, but can harm the fish if not done correctly. In captivity, adults may also eat young that they encounter.

==Behavior and Intelligence==

===Behavior===

Behavior can vary widely both because goldfish live in a variety of environments, and because their behavior can be conditioned by their owners.
Goldfish have strong associative learning abilities, as well as social learning skills. In addition, their visual acuity allows them to distinguish between individual humans. Owners may notice that fish react favorably to them (swimming to the front of the glass, swimming rapidly around the tank, and going to the surface mouthing for food) while hiding when other people approach the tank. Over time, goldfish learn to associate their owners and other humans with food, often "begging" for food whenever their owners approach.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
Goldfish are gregarious, displaying schooling behavior, as well as displaying the same types of feeding behaviors. Goldfish may display similar behaviors when responding to their reflections in a mirror.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
Goldfish that have constant visual contact with humans also stop considering them to be a threat. After being kept in a tank for several weeks, sometimes months, it becomes possible to feed a goldfish by hand without it shying away.
Goldfish have learned behaviors, both as groups and as individuals, that stem from native carp behavior. They are a generalist species with varied feeding, breeding, and predator avoidance behaviors that contribute to their success. As fish they can be described as "friendly" towards each other. Very rarely does a goldfish harm another goldfish, nor do the males harm the females during breeding. The only real threat that goldfish present to each other is competing for food. Commons, comets, and other faster varieties can easily eat all the food during a feeding before fancy varieties can reach it. This can lead to stunted growth or possible starvation of fancier varieties when they are kept in a pond with their single-tailed brethren. As a result, care should be taken to combine only breeds with similar body type and swim characteristics.

===Intelligence===

Goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes, colors and sounds.[ref]
Research by the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth in 2003. Goldfish were trained to push a lever to earn a food reward; when the lever was fixed to work only for an hour a day, the fish soon learned to activate it at the correct time.[/ref][ref]
The Discovery Channel's show Mythbusters tested the contemporary legend that goldfish only had a memory span of 3 seconds and were able to prove that goldfish had a longer memory span than commonly believed. The experiment involved training the fish to navigate a maze. It was evident that they were able to remember the correct path of the maze after more than a month. Mythbuster Results: A goldfish’s memory lasts only three seconds[/ref]  By using positive reinforcement, goldfish can be trained to recognize and to react to light signals of different colors[ref]Demonstrated in a 1994 public experiment at the Palais de la Découverte science museum. The experimental details and results are described in: 
[/ref] or to perform tricks. Fish respond to certain colors most evidently in relation to feeding.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Fish learn to anticipate feedings provided they occur at around the same time every day.

==Domestication==

===In ponds===

Goldfish are popular pond fish, since they are small, inexpensive, colorful and very hardy. In an outdoor pond or water garden, they may even survive for brief periods if ice forms on the surface, as long as there is enough oxygen remaining in the water and the pond does not freeze solid. Common goldfish, London and Bristol shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet and some hardier fantail goldfish can be kept in a pond all year round in temperate and subtropical climates. Moor, veiltail, oranda and lionhead can be kept safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere.
Ponds small and large are fine in warmer areas (although it ought to be noted that goldfish can "overheat" in small volumes of water in summer in tropical climates). In frosty climes the depth should be at least [tpl]convert|80|cm|in|sp=us[/tpl] to preclude freezing. During winter, goldfish become sluggish, stop eating and often stay on the bottom of the pond. This is normal; they become active again in the spring. Unless the pond is large enough to maintain its own ecosystem without interference from humans, a filter is important to clear waste and keep the pond clean. Plants are essential as they act as part of the filtration system, as well as a food source for the fish. Plants are further beneficial since they raise oxygen levels in the water.
Compatible fish include rudd, tench, orfe and koi, but the latter require specialized care. Ramshorn snails are helpful by eating any algae that grows in the pond. Without some form of animal population control, goldfish ponds can easily become overstocked. Fish such as orfe consume goldfish eggs.

===Mosquito control===

Like some other popular aquarium fish, such as the guppy, goldfish and other carp are frequently added to stagnant bodies of water to reduce mosquito populations. They are used to prevent the spread of West Nile Virus, which relies on mosquitoes to migrate. However, introducing goldfish has often had negative consequences for local ecosystems.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lNkwt3gX-2cC&pg=PA154&dq=goldfish+released+into+the+wild#v=onepage&q=goldfish%20released%20into%20the%20wild&f=false|title=Biotechnology Deskbook|author1=William L. Arnold|author2=William L. Anderson|page=154|year=2001|publisher=Environmental Law Institute|isbn=1-58576-029-3[/tpl]

===In aquaria===

Like most carp, goldfish produce a large amount of waste both in their faeces and through their gills, releasing harmful chemicals into the water. Build-up of this waste to toxic levels can occur in a relatively short period of time, and can easily cause a goldfish's death. For common and comet varieties, each goldfish should have about [tpl]convert|20|usgal[/tpl] of water. Fancy goldfish (which are smaller) should have about [tpl]convert|10|usgal[/tpl] per goldfish. The water surface area determines how much oxygen diffuses and dissolves into the water. A general rule is have [tpl]convert|1|sqft[/tpl]. Active aeration by way of a water pump, filter or fountain effectively increases the surface area.
The goldfish is classified as a coldwater fish, and can live in unheated aquaria at a temperature comfortable for humans. However, rapid changes in temperature (for example in an office building in winter when the heat is turned off at night) can kill them, especially if the tank is small. Care must also be taken when adding water, as the new water may be of a different temperature. Temperatures under about [tpl]convert|10|C|F[/tpl] are dangerous to fancy varieties, though commons and comets can survive slightly lower temperatures. Extremely high temperatures (over [tpl]convert|30|C|F[/tpl] can also harm goldfish. However, higher temperatures may help fight protozoan infestations by accelerating the parasite's life-cycle—thus eliminating it more quickly. The optimum temperature for goldfish is between [tpl]convert|20|C|F[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|22|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mypets.net.au/flex/goldfish/528/1 |title=Goldfish |publisher=Mypets.net.au |accessdate=2011-11-19[/tpl]
Like all fish, goldfish do not like to be petted. In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/goldfish |title=Goldfish |publisher=Experiencefestival.com |accessdate=2011-11-19[/tpl] The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.
If left in the dark for a period of time, goldfish gradually change color until they are almost gray.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Goldfish produce pigment in response to light, in a similar manner to how human skin becomes tanned in the sun. Fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light, and give the fish coloration. The color of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in the cells, how many pigment molecules there are, and whether the pigment is grouped inside the cell or is spaced throughout the cytoplasm.
Because goldfish eat live plants, their presence in a planted aquarium can be problematic. Only a few aquarium plant species for example Cryptocoryne and Anubias, can survive around goldfish, but they require special attention so that they are not uprooted. Plastic plants are often more durable, but the branches can irritate or harm a fish that touches one.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

==Controversy over proper treatment==

Some countries ban the sale of traditional fishbowls under animal welfare legislation due to the risk of stunting, deoxygenation and ammonia/nitrite poisoning in such a small environment. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Because of their large oxygen needs and high waste output, such bowls are no longer considered appropriate housing for goldfish.[tpl]cite web |url=http://goldfishcareguide.com/2008/03/05/5-reasons-not-to-use-goldfish-bowls/|title=5 reasons not to use goldfish bowls |accessdate=2009-02-01|date=2008-03-05|publisher=Goldfish Care Guide[/tpl]
In many countries, carnival and fair operators commonly give goldfish away in plastic bags as prizes. In late 2005 Rome banned the use of goldfish and other animals as carnival prizes. Rome has also banned the use of "goldfish bowls", on animal cruelty grounds.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-1844070,00.html | title=Rome bans goldfish bowls, orders dog owners on walks – World – Times Online | accessdate=2006-07-21 | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Sam | last1=Knight | date=2005-10-26[/tpl] In the United Kingdom, the government proposed banning this practice as part of its Animal Welfare Bill,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/bill/index.htm | title=Defra, UK – Animal Health and Welfare – Animal Welfare – Animal Welfare Bill | accessdate=2006-07-21[/tpl][ref]

In Japan, during summer festivals and religious holidays (ennichi), a traditional game called goldfish scooping is played, in which a player scoops goldfish from a basin with a special scooper. Sometimes bouncy balls are substituted for goldfish.
Although edible, goldfish are rarely eaten. A fad among American college students for many years was swallowing goldfish as a stunt and as a fraternity initiation process. The first recorded instance was in 1939 at Harvard University.[tpl]cite web | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/3205/SwalG.html | title=Swallowing Goldfish | accessdate=2006-07-21[/tpl] The practice gradually fell out of popularity over the course of several decades and is rarely practiced today.
