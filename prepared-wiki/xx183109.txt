Richard Austin (c. 1765–1830) was an English punchcutter. He was the original cutter of typefaces Bell, Scotch Roman, and Porson.[tpl]cite book |author=Bringhurst, Robert. |title=The Elements of Typographic Style |year=2004 |publisher=Hartley and Marks|pages=333 |isbn=978-0-88179-206-5[/tpl]  Born in London, he studied wood engraving under Thomas Bewick before joining John Bell's British Letter Foundry in 1788 as a punch-cutter, where he worked until the foundry closed in 1798.  He then worked for William Miller's foundry in Edinburgh before founded his own Imperial Letter Foundry in London.  Stanley Morison calls his Bell the first British example of a Didone or Modern Typeface, though more recent opinion holds that his Scotch Roman was the first truly Modern British face.Macmillsn, Niel.An A-Z of Type Designers.
