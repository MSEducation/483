Fiennes is an eighth cousin of the Prince of Wales, and a third cousin of adventurer Ranulph Fiennes and author William Fiennes.

==Career==

Fiennes trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art between 1983 and 1985. He began his career at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park and also at the National Theatre before achieving prominence at the Royal Shakespeare Company.  Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights opposite Juliette Binoche.
1993 was his "breakout year". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of Mâcon with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win the Oscar, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role. His portrayal as Göth also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Movie Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards.[tpl]cite web|last=Cagle |first=Jess |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301253,00.html |title=It's Pronounced 'Rafe Fines' |publisher=Ew.com |date=1994-03-04 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]
Fiennes later claimed that playing the role had a profoundly disturbing effect on him.[tpl]cite web|author=09:00 – 09:45 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/5e0bc1e5#p00941wp |title=Desert Island Discs – Castaway: Ralph Fiennes |publisher=BBC |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=7 March 2012[/tpl] In a subsequent interview, Fiennes recalled,
 Evil is cumulative. It happens. People believe that they've got to do a job, they've got to take on an ideology, that they've got a life to lead; they've got to survive, a job to do, it's every day inch by inch, little compromises, little ways of telling yourself this is how you should lead your life and suddenly then these things can happen. I mean, I could make a judgment myself privately, this is a terrible, evil, horrific man. But the job was to portray the man, the human being. There’s a sort of banality, that everydayness, that I think was important. And it was in the screenplay. In fact, one of the first scenes with Oskar Schindler, with Liam Neeson, was a scene where I'm saying, "You don't understand how hard it is, I have to order so many-so many meters of barbed wire and so many fencing posts and I have to get so many people from A to B." And, you know, he's sort of letting off steam about the difficulties of the job.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20100304 |title=Voices on Antisemitism | Transcript |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl]

The situation affected the cast and crew to the extent that they set up the Constant Gardener Trust to provide basic education for children of these villages. Fiennes is a patron of the charity.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.constantgardenertrust.org/html/patrons.htm| title=Constant Gardener Trust – Patrons | publisher=UNICEF | accessdate=10 April 2008[/tpl]
