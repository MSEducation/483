WGMC is a listener-supported station in Rochester, New York, USA, broadcasting on 90.1 MHz FM and streaming on the Internet at www.jazz901.org. On air, the station is identified as "Jazz 90.1" in reference to its FM frequency. WGMC specializes in all styles of jazz, but is also an important outlet for music and voices that do not make it onto commercial radio. WGMC's longest-running show is Polka Bandstand. The Lithuanian-language Dainos Aidas, a Turkish-language show and The Latin Essence, a four-hour program of Latin music broadcast in Spanish, also have their home on the station.
The station also hosts a blues show (Muskie's Juke Joint) on Sunday evenings, a soul jazz program (The Soul Jazz Spectrum) on Friday nights, a program of avant-garde jazz (Northstar Sounds) on Tuesday nights and other specialty shows featuring sub-genres of jazz.
On June 6, 2009, WGMC added its first call-in talk show, Sound Bytes, which had previously been broadcast on WHAM and WXXI.
The WGMC studio is located in the Greece Olympia High School media center.
