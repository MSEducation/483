[[Walker affair]]

CATEGORIES: History of Nicaragua

The Walker affair was an episode in Nicarguan history when an American named William Walker briefly invaded Nicaragua in 1855 with a small army and seized control of the newly independent country in the following year.

==Background==

Nicaragua’s independence from Spain, Mexico and then from the United Provinces of Central America in 1838[tpl]cite web|first=Christopher|last=Minster|title=The Federal Republic of Central America (1823-1840)|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/historyofcentralamerica/a/09republicofCA_2.htm|work=Latin American History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2013-11-05[/tpl] did not free it from foreign interferences.  One of the most prominent countries that would intervene in Nicaraguan affairs would be the United States. The 1840s Gold Rush made many in the United States interested in finding a quicker route to the American west. However, Great Britain had always been present in the coast of Nicaragua, this created tension between the two countries. To diffuse the potential conflict between the two nations the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was signed in 1850, in which both sides "agreed that neither would claim exclusive power over a future canal in Central America nor gain exclusive control over any part of the region."
Many Nicaraguans originally welcomed this treaty because of the financial benefits a canal might bring to the country once it was finished. The United States further involved themselves in Nicaraguan affair with the Walker affair. The Walker affair came about after Nicaraguan independence after a continuous conflict over power by the strong cities of León and Granada, and their political parties (León housed the liberal and Granada the conservatives).

==Walker's invasion==

The liberal elite of León was losing the struggle to unseat the conservative elite of Granada and turned for help to a San Francisco-based soldier named William Walker. Walker was known as an adventurer who sought to take control of Latin American countries with the purpose of making them a part of the United States.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Walker sailed in June 1855 from California to Nicaragua with a small band of armed Californians. After some initial military setbacks, he and his liberal allies took Granada in October and set up a coalition government.
By 1856, Walker declared himself president, re-instituted slavery, and made English the official language. This proved the notion that he wanted to annex Nicaragua to the United States to be true. It is said that Walker wanted the annexation to the Americas south in order to protect the slavery re-institution he had created in Nicaragua.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Walker was quickly disliked due to his overwhelming power and control of the Nicaraguan army.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
This caused a movement to expel Walker and his army from Nicaragua which proved to be a long and costly process. Costa Rica, Honduras and other Central American countries united to drive Walker out of Nicaragua in 1857.[tpl]cite book|last=Walker|first=W|title=The War in Nicaragua|publisher=S.H.

The final battle of what Nicaraguans called the "National War" (1856–57) took place in the spring of 1857 in the town of Rivas, near the Costa Rican border. Walker beat off the attacks of the Central Americans, but the strength and morale of his forces were declining, and it would be only a matter of time until he would be overwhelmed.
The National War ironically made for the cooperation between the Liberal and Conservative parties, which were the parties that first brought Walker to Nicaragua.
