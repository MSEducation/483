He was mayor of Båtsfjord from 2007 until his election to the Stortinget from Finnmark in 2009.

==Mayor==

Bakke-Jensen was elected mayor in 2007, despite the Arbeiderpartiet winning 54.7 percent of the vote, and nine of the fifteen representatives in the municipality. After the elections for mayor saw many Ap split from the party, and when the elections saw two of the breakaway group elected. One of the breakaway group did not attend the nomination meeting, and the other did not vote with his party. Therefore, Bakke-Jensen was elected with Høyre's four votes, Fremskrittspartiet's two representatives deciding not to support the Arbeiderpartiet. As mayor, Bakke-Jensen decided that Båtsfjord should have its own high school within the municipality.
