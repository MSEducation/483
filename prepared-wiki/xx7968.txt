==History==

They were owned by Offshore Heavy Transport of Oslo, Norway, from their construction, in April 2000 and November 1999 respectively, until 6 July 2001, when they were purchased by Dockwise. The U.S. Navy hired Blue Marlin from Offshore Heavy Transport to move the destroyer [tpl]USS|Cole|DDG-67|6[/tpl] back to the United States after the warship was damaged by Al-Qaeda linked [tpl]cite news | author=Brian Whitaker | title=Attack on the USS Cole: The Bin Laden connection' | url=http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/cole8.htm | work=The Guardian | date=15 October 2001 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/15/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker | accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] suicide bombers while anchored in the port of Aden, Yemen.  During the latter part of 2003, work done on Blue Marlin boosted its capacity and added two retractable propulsors to improve maneuverability. The ship re-entered service in January 2004.  Following these improvements, Blue Marlin delivered the oil platform Thunder Horse PDQ, weighing 60,000 tons, to Corpus Christi, Texas, for completion.
In July 2005 Blue Marlin moved the gas refinery Snøhvit from its construction site in Cádiz to Hammerfest, an 11 day trip.[tpl]cite news | author=Nina Berglund | title='Snow White' gets her heart | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1078339.ece | work=Aftenposten | date=11 July 2005 | accessdate=5 March 2011[/tpl] This transport was filmed for the TV show Extreme Engineering on the Discovery Channel, and also the TV show Mega Movers on the History Channel.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
