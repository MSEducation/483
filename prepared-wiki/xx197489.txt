This Habit is the first album by Indie pop/rock band Code Pie, released on April 8, 2005.   The album was self-produced and recorded for $700.  All songs on This Habit were recorded in the auditorium of drummer Vince Varanoâ€™s former high school, as well as other locations around Montreal http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2006/02/1702.cfm.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/40469/montreal-buzz-code-pie-have-new-recipe-for-next-album | publisher=Chart | title=Montreal Buzz: Code Pie Have New Recipe For Next Album | date=2006-02-17 | accessdate=2009-08-07 | first=Lorraine | last=Carpenter [/tpl]  Vocal and overdub work continued in the months that followed, while the band worked to get a satisfactory sound on their shoestring budget. Wary of labels and unsure of how to proceed once the album was complete, Code Pie released This Habit on their own label, Flagless Records. http://media.www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2007/10/02/CreamOfThePop2007/Code-Pie.Indie.For.Real.Yo-3004041.shtml Once completed, the album received favourable reviews http://www.exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid1=71&csid2=850&fid1=18473 and garnered comparisons to other notable Canadian indie bands, http://www.earshot-online.com/features/2005/June/inbox_1.cfm Flagless eventually signed a distribution deal with the now-defunct PHD Canada, http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/040507/music5.html a company formerly based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
