==Football career==

Born in San Sebastián, Prieto made his La Liga debut with hometown's Real Sociedad on 8 October 2003 in a 1–0 home win over Navarrese neighbours CA Osasuna, going on to collect a further eight substitute appearances – seven of them late in the game – during that season. However, on 23 May of the following year, as the league's outcome was already decided, he profitted from his second start to score twice against Real Madrid in a 4–1 away win, one of the goals coming from the penalty spot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/151474?cc=5739|title=Real Madrid 1–4 Real Sociedad|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=23 May 2004|accessdate=22 August 2012[/tpl]
Subsequently Prieto was definitely promoted to the first squad and, in 2005–06, participated in all 38 games and netted nine times, six of them being penalties. In the following season he was also everpresent, but the Basque dropped down to the second division.
Prieto played in 35 matches in the 2009–10 campaign, totalling exactly 3,000 minutes and contributing with seven goals as Real Sociedad returned to the top level after three years. In the first game of the following season, at home against Villarreal CF, he scored the game's only goal, after a backheel pass from newly signed Joseba Llorente.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/301877?cc=5739|title=Sociedad make winning return|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=14 February 2011[/tpl]
On 6 January 2013 Prieto netted the first hat-trick of his professional career, but in a 3–4 loss at Real Madrid: he scored once through a penalty and twice after one-on-one situations against Iker Casillas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/348350/report.html?soccernet=true&cc=5739|title=Casillas benched again but Madrid win|publisher=ESPN FC|date=6 January 2013|accessdate=7 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/01/06/futbol/equipos/real_sociedad/1357495080.html|title=Xabi Prieto, un triplete sin premio|trans_title=Xabi Prieto, hat-trick without prize|publisher=Marca|language=Spanish|date=6 January 2013|accessdate=7 January 2013[/tpl]
