[[Celtic languages]]

CATEGORIES: Indo-European languages, Celtic languages

The Celtic languages (usually pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en||ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k[/tpl] but sometimes [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k[/tpl])[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celtic|title=American Heritage Dictionary. Celtic: kel-tik, sel |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] are descended from Proto-Celtic, or "Common Celtic"; a branch of the greater Indo-European language family. The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707.Cunliffe, Barry W. 2003. The Celts: a very short introduction. pg.48
Modern Celtic languages are mostly spoken on the north-western edge of Europe, notably in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man, and can be found spoken on Cape Breton Island. There are also a substantial number of Welsh speakers in the Patagonia area of Argentina. Some people speak Celtic languages in the other Celtic diaspora areas of the United States,"Language by State – Scottish Gaelic" on Modern Language Association website.

Retrieved 5 August 2008 In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at revitalization. Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as "endangered" by UNESCO.
During the 1st millennium BC, they were spoken across much of Europe, in the Iberian Peninsula, from the Atlantic and North Sea coastlines, up to the Rhine valley and down the Danube valley to the Black Sea, the northern Balkan Peninsula and in central Asia Minor. The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times. Celtic languages, particularly Irish, were spoken in Australia before federation in 1901 and are still used there to some extent.G.

==Living languages==

SIL Ethnologue lists six "living" Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are the Goidelic Irish (Gaeilge) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) descended from Old Irish, and the Brythonic Welsh and Breton descended from the British language.
The other two, Cornish and Manx, were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages.[tpl]cite book|last=Koch|first=John T.|title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|pages=34, 365–366, 529, 973, 1053|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celtic+Culture:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=A brief history of the Cornish language|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|publisher=Maga Kernow[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Beresford Ellis|first=Peter|title=The Story of the Cornish Language|year=1990, 1998, 2005|publisher=Tor Mark Press|isbn=0-85025-371-3|pages=20–22[/tpl] For both these languages, however, revitalization movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.[tpl]cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/manx-language/Fockle-ny-ghaa-schoolchildren-take.3901786.jp|title=Fockle ny ghaa: schoolchildren take charge|publisher=Iomtoday.co.im|accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title='South West:TeachingEnglish:British Council:BBC|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|accessdate=9 February 2010|publisher=BBC|year=2010|work=BBC/British Council website[/tpl]
Taken together, there were roughly one million native speakers of Celtic languages as of the 2000s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1164-16|title=Celtic Languages|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=9 March 2010[/tpl] In 2010, there were more than 1.4 million speakers of Celtic languages.[tpl]cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-73650-3[/tpl]

==Classification==

Proto-Celtic divided into four sub-families:
Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic, putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.
The Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter,[tpl]Cite book|last=Barbour and Carmichael|first=Stephen and Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=56|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Breton+Gaulish+words&q=Breton%20Gaulish%20words|isbn=978-0-19-823671-9[/tpl] having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers.
In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brittonic is seen as being late.
The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02029|last=Gray and Atkinson|first1=RD|last2=Atkinson|first2=QD|title=Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6965|pages=435–439|year=2003|pmid=14647380|bibcode=2003Natur.426..435G[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2003.tb00299.x|last=Rexova|first=K.|coauthors= Frynta, D and Zrzavy, J.|year=2003|title=Cladistic analysis of languages: Indo-European classification based on lexicostatistical data|journal=Cladistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=120–127[/tpl] but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth[tpl]Cite journal|last=Forster|first=Peter |author2=Toth, Alfred |year=2003|title=Toward a phylogenetic chronology of ancient Gaulish, Celtic, and Indo-European|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences[/tpl] included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological Urnfield culture, the Hallstatt culture, and the La Tène culture, though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.[tpl]cite book|last1=Renfrew|first1=Colin|title=Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins|year=1987|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|isbn=0224024957[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=James|first1=Simon|title=The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention?|year=1999|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0714121657[/tpl]
[tpl]anchor|P-Celtic[/tpl][tpl]anchor|Q-Celtic[/tpl][tpl]anchor|P-Celtic and Q-Celtic[/tpl]There are two main competing schemata of categorization. The older schema, argued for by Schmidt (1988) among others, links Gaulish with Brittonic in a P-Celtic node, originally leaving just Goidelic as Q-Celtic. The difference between P and Q languages is the treatment of Proto-Celtic *kʷ, which became *p in the P-Celtic languages but *k in Goidelic. An example is the Proto-Celtic verb root *kʷrin- "to buy", which became pryn- in Welsh but cren- in Old Irish. However, a classification based on a single feature is seen as risky by its critics, particularly as the sound change occurs in other language groups (especially the Osco-Umbrian and Greek).
The other schema, defended for example by McCone (1996), links Goidelic and Brittonic together as an Insular Celtic branch, while Gaulish and Celtiberian are referred to as Continental Celtic. According to this theory, the "P-Celtic" sound change of [tpl]IPA|kʷ[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|p[/tpl] occurred independently or areally. The proponents of the Insular Celtic hypothesis point to other shared innovations among Insular Celtic languages, including inflected prepositions, VSO word order, and the lenition of intervocalic [tpl]IPA|m[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|β̃[/tpl], a nasalised voiced bilabial fricative (an extremely rare sound[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]). There is, however, no assumption that the Continental Celtic languages descend from a common "Proto-Continental Celtic" ancestor. Rather, in the Insular/Continental schema, Celtiberian is usually considered to be the first branch to split from Proto-Celtic, and the remaining group would later have split into Gaulish and Insular Celtic.
There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation -nm- > -nu (Gaelic ainm / Gaulish anuana, Old Welsh enuein "names"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a Gallo-Brittonic dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).
The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis.[tpl]cite book|last1=Schumacher|first1=Stefan|last2=Schulze-Thulin|first2=Britta|last3=aan de Wiel|first3=Caroline|title=Die keltischen Primärverben. Ein vergleichendes, etymologisches und morphologisches Lexikon|year=2004|publisher=Institut für Sprachen und Kulturen der Universität Innsbruck|location=Innsbruck|isbn=3-85124-692-6|pages=84–87|language=German[/tpl] Stifter affirms that the Gallo-Brittonic view is "out of favour" in the scholarly community as of  2008 and the Insular Celtic hypothesis "widely accepted".[tpl]cite book|last=Stifter|first=David|title=Old Celtic Languages|year=2008|pages=11|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/download/Stifter/oldcelt2008_1_general.pdf[/tpl]
When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, "Q-Celtic" is equivalent to "Goidelic" and "P-Celtic" is equivalent to "Brittonic".
Within the Indo-European family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the Italic languages in a common Italo-Celtic subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of language contact between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.
How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:
Insular/Continental hypothesis
P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis

==Characteristics of Celtic languages==

Although there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances. While none of these characteristics are necessarily unique to the Celtic languages, there are few if any other languages which possess them all. They include:
Examples: 
(Irish) Ná bac le mac an bhacaigh is ní bhacfaidh mac an bhacaigh leat. 
(Literal translation) Don't bother with son the beggar's and not will-bother son the beggar's with-you.
(Welsh) pedwar ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain 
(literally) four on fifteen and four twenties
