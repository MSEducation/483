</ref> While there, he was placed under house arrest for his role in the [[Eggnog Riot]] during Christmas 1826. Whiskey was smuggled into the academy for the purpose of making eggnog, and more than one-third of the cadets were involved. In June 1828 he graduated 23rd in a class of 33.<ref>U.S. Military Academy, ''Register of Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy from March 16 to January 1, 1850''. Compiled by Capt. George W. Cullum. West Point, N.Y.: 1850, p. 148.</ref> Following graduation, Second Lieutenant Davis was assigned to the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Infantry Regiment]] and was stationed at [[Fort Crawford]], [[Prairie du Chien]], [[Wisconsin Territory]]. [[Zachary Taylor]] had recently been placed in command of the fort when Davis arrived in early 1829. In March 1832, Davis returned to Mississippi on furlough, having had no leave since he first arrived at Fort Crawford. He was still in Mississippi during the [[Black Hawk War]] but returned to the fort in August. At the conclusion of the war, Colonel Taylor assigned him to escort [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] to prison. Davis made an effort to shield Black Hawk from curiosity seekers, and the chief noted in his autobiography that Davis treated him "with much kindness" and showed empathy for Black Hawk's situation as a prisoner.<ref>Strode 1955, p. 76.

==First marriage and early career==

Davis fell in love with his commanding officer's daughter Sarah Knox Taylor. Both Sarah and Jefferson sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have a difficult life as a military wife on frontier army posts.Cooper 2000, p. 65. Davis' own experience led him to appreciate the basis for Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835.Strode 1955, pp. 86–94. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave;Davis 1996, pp. 70–71. he had made no mention to Taylor of his intention to resign.Davis 1996, p. 69. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky.Davis 1996, pp. 69, 72. His resignation became effective June 30.Davis 1996, p. 72.
Davis' older brother Joseph had been very successful and owned Hurricane Plantation and [tpl]convert|1800|acre[/tpl]Strode 1955, p. 94. of adjoining land along the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The adjoining land was known as Brierfield since it was largely covered with brush and briers. Joseph desired to have his youngest brother and his wife nearby and gave Brierfield to Jefferson, who eventually developed Brierfield Plantation there.Cooper 2000, pp. 75–79.
In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah traveled south to his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the home was known as Locust Grove. Their goal was to spend the hot summer months in the countryside and away from the flat river land, for their health, but both of them contracted malaria.Cooper 2000, pp. 70–71. After three months of marriage, Sarah died at the age of 21 on September 15, 1835.Davis 1996, 74–75.[ref]
</ref> Davis was also severely ill,<ref>Davis 1996, pp. 74–75.</ref> and his family feared for his life as well.<ref name="Davis75">Davis 1996, p. 75.</ref> In the month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.<ref name="Davis75"/>
In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to help restore his health. He was accompanied by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time.Davis 1996, pp. 75–76. There Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that he was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Being bored, and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones, and soon returned to Mississippi with Pemberton.Davis 1996, p. 76. Strode 1955, p. 108–109. For several years following Sarah's death, Davis was reclusive and honored her memory. He spent time clearing Brierfield and developing his plantation, studied government and history, and had private political discussions with his brother Joseph.Strode 1955, pp. 105, 109–111. By early 1836, Davis had purchased 16 slaves; he held 40 slaves by 1840, and 74 by 1845. Pemberton served as Davis' overseer, an unusual position for a slave in Mississippi.Cooper 2000, pp. 75–79. Davis 1996, p. 89.
In 1840 Davis first became involved in politics when he attended a Democratic meeting in Vicksburg and, to his surprise, was chosen as a delegate to the party's state convention in Jackson. In 1842, he attended the Democratic convention, and in 1843 became a Warren County Whig candidate for the state House of Representatives but lost his first election. In 1844, Davis was sent to the party convention for a third time, and his interest in politics deepened. He was selected as one of six presidential electors for the 1844 presidential election and campaigned effectively throughout Mississippi for the Democratic candidate, James K. Polk.Strode 1955, pp. 136–137.Cooper 2000, pp. 84–88, 98–100.

==Second marriage and family==

In 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 17 years old, whom his brother Joseph had invited for the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.Strode 1955, pp. 125, 136.
During this time Davis was persuaded to become a candidate for the United States House of Representatives and began canvassing for the election. In early October 1845 he traveled to Woodville to give a speech and arrived a day early to visit his mother there, only to find that she had died the day before. After the funeral he rode the [tpl]convert|40|miles[/tpl] back to Natchez to deliver the news, then returned to Woodville again to deliver his speech. He won the election.Strode 1955, pp. 140–141.
Jefferson and Varina had six children; three died before reaching adulthood. Samuel Emory, born July 30, 1852, was named after his grandfather; he died June 30, 1854, of an undiagnosed disease.Strode 1955, pp. 242, 268. Margaret Howell was born February 25, 1855,Strode 1955, p. 273. and was the only child to marry and raise a family. She married Joel Addison Hayes, Jr. (1848–1919), and they had five children.[ref]
