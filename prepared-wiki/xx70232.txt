Proposition 54 was a California ballot proposition on the October 7, 2003 gubernatorial recall election ballot.  It failed to pass with 3,144,145 (36.1%) votes in favor and 5,541,314 (63.9%) against. It was placed on the ballot through the initiative process.
Proposition 54 would have amended the Constitution of California to prohibit the state government and local governments from using racial classifications in most of its business. Its official title was Racial Privacy Initiative. Supporters of the measure said it was the first step towards a "colorblind" society, while opponents felt that it would make it more difficult for the state to provide services and identify and correct racial disparities.
This issue might normally have been more contentious had it not been overshadowed by the recall election of Governor Gray Davis on the same ballot.
