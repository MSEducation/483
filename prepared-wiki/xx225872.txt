St. Joseph's was a minor seminary of the Holy Name Province of the Order of Friars Minor (OFM), the original Franciscan order of priests and brothers founded by St. Francis of Assisi.  The Holy Name province covered the eastern states from Maine to Florida.  Students entered St. Joseph's in the 9th grade and remained until the completion of two years of college.  The curriculum was classical, with Greek and Latin as core subjects.  Upon completion of the six-year program at Callicoon, the seminarians would advance to other venues to continue their study for the Roman Catholic priesthood.  Universities operated by the Franciscans of the Holy Name Province included St. Bonaventure University and Siena College.
