Rising in northern Douglas County about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] north of Drain, the river flows generally west in a winding course through the mountains, passing through the Siuslaw National Forest for about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] in its lower course. It joins the Umpqua from the north across from Reedsport, about [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] from the mouth of the Umpqua on the Pacific Ocean.
The river is named for Jedediah Smith, who in 1828 led a party of explorers from Utah overland to northern California and southern Oregon. From California, they traveled north to the Umpqua River, camping along its banks near the mouth of the Smith River on July 13. An attack by Native Americans on July 14 killed 15 of Smith's party. One man escaped by heading north to Tillamook and then Fort Vancouver. Smith and two others who were not in camp at the time of the attack fled east toward the Willamette Valley and survived. Smith River in California is also named for Smith.
