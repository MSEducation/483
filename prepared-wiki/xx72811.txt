==History==

Originally founded by the Gauls, the Roman emperor Augustus seized the town in 14 BC and renamed it Vapincum. Eight years later, a Roman road was started, which linked the city to what is now Valencia, Spain. Vapincum grew as a transportation hub and was fortified by later Roman Emperors to protect it against Barbarians. From 28 December 986, the Bishop of Gap had sovereignty over the city due to concerns about future Muslim invasions, and held that power until Revolutionary reforms in 1801 despite Gap being annexed by the French crown in 1512.[tpl]cite web|url=http://larocheusa.org/Gap.htm |title=Gap, Briançon, Hautes Alpes (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur) - Die, Drôme (Rhône-Alpes) |publisher=LaRocheUSA.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17[/tpl]
When the former royal province of Dauphiné was re-organised by the French Revolutionary government in 1790, Gap was made prefecture of the new Hautes-Alpes department, which it remains to this day.
Napoleon I left Elba in February 1815 and had reached Gap on 15 March with 40 horsemen and 10 grenadiers where he had thousands of copies of his Proclamations printed. The whole population of the city accompanied Napoleon when he left Gap.
Gap ran a bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gap-2018.fr/ |title=gap-2018.fr |publisher=gap-2018.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17[/tpl] but lost out as France's candidate to nearby Annecy. The games were eventually awarded to Pyeongchang in South Korea.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/winter_sports/8753631.stm |title=BBC Sport - Winter Sports - Pyeongchang will host the 2018 Winter Olympics |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2013-04-17[/tpl]
