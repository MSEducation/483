The Bob Newhart Show is an American situation comedy produced by MTM Enterprises, which aired 142 half-hour episodes on CBS from September 16, [tpl]ytv|1972[/tpl], to April 1, [tpl]ytv|1978[/tpl]. Comedian Bob Newhart portrays a psychologist having to deal with his patients and fellow office workers. The show was filmed before a live audience.

==Premise==

The show centers around Robert Hartley, Ph.D. (Newhart), a Chicago psychologist. It divides most of its action between the character's work and his home life, with Hartley's supportive (though occasionally sarcastic) wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette), and their friendly but inept neighbor, airline navigator Howard Borden (Bill Daily). At the medical office where Hartley has his psychology practice are Jerry Robinson, D.D.S. (Peter Bonerz), an orthodontist who shared the office suite, and their joke-loving receptionist, Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace).
Hartley's three most frequently seen regular patients are the mean-spirited and neurotic Elliot Carlin (Jack Riley), the milquetoast Marine veteran Emil Peterson (John Fiedler), and shy, reserved Lillian Bakerman (Florida Friebus), an elderly lady who spends most of her sessions knitting. (Carlin was ranked 49th in TV Guide's List of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time, and Riley reprised the character in guest appearances on both St. Elsewhere and Newhart.)
Most of the situations involve Newhart's character playing straight man to his wife, colleagues, friends, and patients, an extension of Newhart's stand-up comedy routines, where Newhart would play one side of a telephone conversation, the other side of which is not heard. Emily routinely acts as straight 'man' to dimwitted Howard, and on occasion to Bob.

==Opening credits==

The original opening of the show begins with a ringing telephone on Bob's office desk, which he answers with a simple, "Hello?" This is a reference to Newhart's stand-up comedy act, which often featured him carrying on a phone conversation with an unheard party on the other end. A piano riff then introduces a jazzy, trumpet-heavy instrumental theme tune ("Home to My Emily," composed by series co-creator Lorenzo Music with his wife Henrietta), as numerous brief shots document Bob's journey home from work, ending with a shot of Emily greeting Bob at their apartment.As is often the case with location filming, Bob's commute journey was geographically inconsistent. For example, he leaves his office building by heading west toward Michigan Avenue, only to then be seen from below walking east from Michigan Avenue, before strolling south over the Michigan Avenue bridge. Bob boards a pair of Chicago Transit Authority 6001-6200 class PCC rapid transit cars at a Loop Elevated station, with the train moving from left to right on screen. The next shot shows Bob sitting down and removing his hat on a 2000-class car, moving from right to left. After that is seen a long shot of a pair of 6000-class cars crossing the Wells Street bridge northbound (screen left to right). Finally, Bob leaves the train at Isabella station (now demolished) on the Evanston line (now the Purple Line) – several miles from his condo building in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago.
From season 4 onwards, the opening (and ending) theme was set to a newly arranged funk-fusion sound and this time shows Bob's morning commute.
In the 1990s, Nick at Nite parodied this opening by adding lyrics to it. The lyrics consisted solely of the words "Bob Newhart" repeated throughout, echoing the melody (and drum rhythms), finally ending with "Here on Nick at Nite."

==Ratings==

The show ranked in the Top 20 for its first three seasons, following the Mary Tyler Moore Show in CBS's Saturday night lineup. By the end of the fifth season, ratings had slipped, and with The Mary Tyler Moore Show leaving and schedule changes, Newhart was thinking seriously of ending the program. CBS offered him a sixth season, but he felt that it was time to move on. He later revealed in an interview that what made him change his mind was the amount of mail he received from viewers begging him not to go off the air. Newhart said that their response  "almost made me cry." As a result, The Bob Newhart Show returned for the 1977-1978 season. On April 1, 1978, the show broadcast its final episode "Happy Trails To You". It ended its sixth year ranking 53rd.

==Awards and honors==

In 1977, the show received two Emmy nominations – for "Outstanding Comedy Series" and for Pleshette for "Outstanding Continued Performance By An Actress In A Comedy Series"."Awards" on IMDB.com Newhart was nominated for Golden Globes as "Best TV Actor—Musical/Comedy" in 1975 and 1976. In 1997, the episodes "Over the River and Through the Woods" and "Death Be My Destiny" were respectively ranked No. 9 and No. 50 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=TV Guide |volume= |issue=June 28-July 4 |pages= |publisher= [/tpl] TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time listed it as No. 44.[tpl]cite news | title = TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml |publisher = CBS News | date = 2002-04-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-06[/tpl]  In 2007, Time magazine placed the show on its unranked list of "100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/completelist/0,,1651341,00.html |title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME |accessdate=2007-09-25 |publisher=Time magazine |date=September 6, 2007[/tpl]

In 2004, TV Land commemorated the show with a statue of Newhart in character as Dr. Hartley, seated and facing an empty couch, as if conducting a therapy session in his office.  The statue was temporarily installed in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office. The statue is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's Navy Pier entertainment complex.

==Final episode==

In the show's final episode, "Happy Trails to You," Bob gives up his psychology practice and accepts a teaching position at a small college in Oregon, with the Hartleys leaving Chicago—as well as their friends and neighbors, and Bob's patients—behind them. The closing scene, in which the cast exchange tearful goodbyes and embrace before bursting into an impromptu refrain of "Oklahoma," is a wry nod to the Mary Tyler Moore Show finale (also produced by MTM) from the previous year.

==Later appearances by series characters==

St. Elsewhere (1985)
Jack Riley reprised his Elliot Carlin role on a 1985 episode of St. Elsewhere and partnered with Oliver Clark as the amnesiac John Doe Number Six. Carlin and Doe have been committed to the hospital's mental ward, where Carlin treats Doe with the same verbal abuse he directed toward Clark's "Mr. Herd" on The Bob Newhart Show. Carlin blames his insanity on an unnamed "quack in Chicago." While Oliver Clark's recurring portrayal of John Doe Number Six is essentially identical to Mr. Herd, the two are never stated to be the same individual.
ALF (1987)
In the episode "Going Out Of My Head Over You", Willie visits a psychologist, Dr. Lawrence "Larry" Dykstra, portrayed by Bill Daily. Jack Riley is in the waiting room, apparently portraying Elliot Carlin. Also in this episode, ALF mentions learning about psychology by watching episodes of The Bob Newhart Show.
Newhart (1988 and 1990)
Riley appears on the 1988 show Newhart, playing an unnamed character who acts very much like Mr. Carlin. This character is being treated by the same therapist in Vermont whom Dick Loudon (Bob Newhart) visits for marriage therapy. Dick feels he recognizes Riley's character, but cannot place his face; whereupon the unnamed patient insults him. Echoing Carlin's statement from the 1985 St. Elsewhere, the therapist apologizes for his patient, explaining that it has taken her "years to undo the damage caused by some quack in Chicago."
Later, Bob Newhart and Suzanne Pleshette reprised their roles from the show for the 1990 finale of Newhart, in which it was revealed that the entire Newhart series had been just Bob Hartley's dream. Bob and Emily are shown in a room appearing to be identical to their Chicago apartment bedroom from the Bob Newhart Show.
The Bob Newhart Show 19th Anniversary (1991)
The entire cast assembled for the one-hour clip show The Bob Newhart Show 19th Anniversary in 1991, which finds the show's characters in the present day. This show is set in Chicago, in the same apartment and office that Bob Hartley had in his 1970s show. During the course of the show, the characters analyzed Bob's dream from the Newhart finale. At one point Howard recalled, "I had a dream like that once. I dreamed I was an astronaut in Florida for five years," as scenes from I Dream of Jeannie featuring Bill Daily as Roger Healey were shown.
Murphy Brown (1994)
Newhart played Bob Hartley on Murphy Brown, in the episode "Anything But Cured" (March 14, 1994) to beg Carol (Marcia Wallace reprising her role from The Bob Newhart Show) to leave her job as Murphy's secretary and come back with him to Chicago.
Saturday Night Live (1995)
Newhart reprised Hartley twice in the February 11, 1995 episode of Saturday Night Live. In one sketch, he appears on a satirical version of Ricki Lake, befuddled by both Ms. Lake's dysfunctional guests and Lake's armchair pop psychology. The episode ended with a repeat of Newhart’s "just a dream" scene, in which Bob Hartley again wakes up with Emily (Pleshette), and tells her that he just dreamt he had hosted SNL. Emily responds, "That show's not still on, is it?"
George & Leo (1997)
In the 1997 episode, "The Cameo Episode", Bill Daily makes an appearance as "The Pilot". Jack Riley also appeared on this episode, but it's unclear whom he is portraying.
CBS at 75 (2002)
Newhart and Pleshette, as "The Hartleys", were the hosts of a segment of the CBS at 75 broadcast.
