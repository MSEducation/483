[[Common Era]]

CATEGORIES: Calendar eras, Chronology, Political correctness

Common Era (also Current Era
or Christian Era),
abbreviated as CE, is an alternative naming of the traditional calendar era, Anno Domini ("in the Year of Our Lord", abbreviated AD).
BCE is the abbreviation for Before the Common/Current/Christian Era (an alternative to Before Christ, abbreviated BC).
The CE/BCE designation uses the year-numbering system introduced by the 6th-century Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus, who started the Anno Domini designation, intending the beginning of the life of JesusIt is unclear whether Dionysius intended this to be the conception or birth of Jesus, or if it would make a difference in counting the years. to be the reference date.
Neither notation includes a year zero,[ref]
Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the astronomical system and the ISO 8601 standard, do use a year zero. The year 1 BCE (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires use of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however; whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow use of the Julian calendar for dates before 1582 CE.
[/ref]
and the two notations (CE/BCE and AD/BC) are numerically equivalent; thus "[tpl]currentyear[/tpl] CE" corresponds to "AD [tpl]currentyear[/tpl]", and "399 BCE" corresponds to "399 BC".
The expression "Common Era" can be found as early as 1708 in English, and traced back to Latin usage among European Christians to 1615, as vulgaris aerae, and to 1635 in English as Vulgar Era. At those times, the expressions were all used interchangeably with "Christian Era", with "vulgar" meaning "ordinary, common, or not regal" rather than "crudely indecent". Use of the CE abbreviation was introduced by Jewish academics in the mid-19th century. Since the later 20th century, use of CE and BCE has been popularized in academic and scientific publications, and more generally by publishers emphasizing secularism or sensitivity to non-Christians.
The Gregorian calendar and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union.
The CE/BCE notation has been adopted by some authors and publishers wishing to be neutral or sensitive to non-Christians
because it does not explicitly make use of religious titles for Jesus, such as "Christ" and Dominus ("Lord"), which are used in the BC/AD notation, nor does it give implicit expression to the Christian creed that Jesus was the Christ.[ref]Anno Domini (which means in the year of the/our Lord)[tpl]cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anno%20domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord | accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl] Translated as "in the year of (Our) Lord" in Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), The Oxford Companion to the Year, Oxford University Press, 782.

Among the reasons given by those who oppose the use of Common Era notation is that it is selective as other aspects of the Western calendar have origins in various belief systems (e.g., January is named for Janus),
and claims that its propagation is the result of secularization, anti-supernaturalism, religious pluralism, and political correctness.

==History==

===Origins===

The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus in the year 525 to replace the Era of Martyrs system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. He attempted to number years from an event he referred to as the Incarnation of Jesus,
although scholars today generally agree that he miscalculated by a small number of years.[ref]Doggett, L.E., (1992), "Calendars" in Seidelmann, P.K., The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, Sausalito CA: University Science Books, p. 579.
[/ref]
Dionysius labeled the column of the Easter table in which he introduced the new era "Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi".[ref]Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al. (Eds.) The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar, Vatican Observatory, p. 52.
[/ref]
Numbering years in this manner became more widespread with its usage by Bede in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before the supposed year of birth[ref]Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), The Oxford Companion to the Year, Oxford University Press, 778.
[/ref]
of Jesus, and the practice of not using a year zero.[ref]As noted in Zero#History, the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the 12th century.
[/ref]
In 1422, Portugal became the last Western European country to switch to the system begun by Dionysius.

===Use of the term "vulgar era"===

The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "Vulgar Era"[ref]from the Latin word vulgus, the common people, i.e. those who are not royalty.
It is relatively recently the word vulgar has come to mean "crudely indecent". Common fractions are still often referred to as vulgar fractions, without any implication of crudeness.
[/ref]
to distinguish it from the regnal dating systems typically used in national law.
The first use of the Latin equivalent (vulgaris aerae)[ref]In Latin, Common Era is written as Vulgaris Aerae. It also occasionally appears as æræ vulgaris, aerae vulgaris, aeram vulgarem, anni vulgaris, vulgaris aerae Christianae, and anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas.
[/ref]
discovered so far was in a 1615 book by Johannes Kepler./>
Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of ephemerides,
and again in 1617.
A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of Vulgar Era in English.
A 1701 book edited by John LeClerc includes "Before Christ according to the Vulgar Æra, 6".
A 1716 book in English by Dean Humphrey Prideaux says, "before the beginning of the vulgar æra, by which we now compute the years from his incarnation."[ref]
Merriam Webster accepts the date of 1716, but does not give the source. [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulgarera |title=Merriam Webster Online entry for Vulgar Era | accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl]
[/ref]
A 1796 book uses the term "vulgar era of the nativity".
The first so-far-discovered usage of "Christian Era" is as the Latin phrase aerae christianae on the title page of a 1584 theology book.
In 1649, the Latin phrase æræ Christianæ appeared in the title of an English almanac.
A 1652 ephemeris is the first instance so-far-found for English usage of "Christian Era".
The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708,
and in a 1715 book on astronomy is used interchangeably with "Christian Era" and "Vulgar Era".[ref]

Before Christ and Christian Era appear on the same page 252, while Vulgar Era appears on page 250
[/ref]
A 1759 history book uses common æra in a generic sense, to refer to the common era of the Jews.[ref]

In this case, their refers to the Jews.
[/ref]
The first-so-far found usage of the phrase "before the common era" is in a 1770 work that also uses common era and vulgar era as synonyms, in a translation of a book originally written in German.
The 1797 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica uses the terms vulgar era and common era synonymously.
In 1835, in his book Living Oracles, Alexander Campbell, wrote: "The vulgar Era, or Anno Domini; the fourth year of Jesus Christ, the first of which was but eight days",
and also refers to the common era as a synonym for vulgar era with "the fact that our Lord was born on the 4th year before the vulgar era, called Anno Domini, thus making (for example) the 42d year from his birth to correspond with the 38th of the common era..."
The Catholic Encyclopedia (1909) used the terms "Christian, Vulgar or Common Era" interchangeably."Foremost among these eras is that which is now adopted by all civilized peoples and known as the Christian, Vulgar or Common Era, in the twentieth century of which we are now living".
The phrase "common era", in lower case, also appeared in the 19th century in a generic sense, not necessarily to refer to the Christian Era, but to any system of dates in common use throughout a civilization. Thus, "the common era of the Jews",
"the common era of the Mahometans",
"common era of the world",
"the common era of the foundation of Rome".
When it did refer to the Christian Era, it was sometimes qualified, e.g., "common era of the Incarnation",
"common era of the Nativity",
or "common era of the birth of Christ".
An adapted translation of Common Era into pseudo-Latin as Era Vulgaris (in Latin this means Common Mistress)C.f. every good Latin dictionary, e.g. perseus.tufts.edu , freedict.com, pons (English/German), pons (German) or auxilium-online.net (German) was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of Aleister Crowley, and thus the abbreviation "e.v." or "EV" may sometimes be seen as a replacement for AD.[ref]

===History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation===

Although Jews have their own Hebrew calendar, they often use the Gregorian calendar.[tpl]cite web | quote=Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our L-rd," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd.  Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). | author=Tracey R Rich | url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl]
As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years on the Western calendar.[ref]

Sivan 5585 AM is June 5, 1825. VE is likely an abbreviation for Vulgar Era.[/ref]
Common Era notation has also been in use for Hebrew lessons for "more than a century".
Some Jewish academics were already using the CE and BCE abbreviations by the mid-19th century, such as in 1856, when Rabbi and historian Morris Jacob Raphall used the abbreviation in his book Post-Biblical History of The Jews.Raphall, Morris Jacob (1856). Post-Biblical History of The Jews. Retrieved from http://books.google.com/books?id=r7CbDH5hTe8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=CE+BCE.[ref]
The term common era does not appear in this book; the term Christian era lowercase does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.

in books has changed dramatically between the years 1800 and 2008, particularly since 1980, with the CE-related variants increasing in usage.

===Contemporary usage===

Some academics in the fields of theology, education and history have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.[ref]See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (current era) ... or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C."

The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, which is the leading publishing body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has been using CE and BCE exclusively in its publications (except in quotations and in The Watchtower—Simplified English Edition) since The Watchtower of 15 April 1964.[ref]Watchtower Library 2009, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world: The Smithsonian Institution prefers Common Era usage, though individual museums are not required to use it.
Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.
Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese Maryland Church News.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide & Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl]
In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in textbooks is growing. Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the College Board in its history tests,[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl]
[/ref]
and by the Norton Anthology of English Literature.
Others have taken a different approach. The US-based History Channel uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as Jerusalem and Judaism.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl];[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl]

Numerous British universities, museums, historians, and book retailers have either dropped BC and AD entirely or are using it alongside the BCE/CE notation.[ref][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2044219/Government-save-Year-Lord-BBCs-Common-Era.html |title=Government to save Year of our Lord from BBC's 'Common Era' |date=2 October 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05 |location=London |work=Daily Mail[/tpl]

The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age[/tpl]

==Rationale==

===Support===

With respect to the use of CE in Jewish scholarship, it was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation AD. Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins too, AD stands out as a particularly direct reference to Jesus as Lord.
Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by Christians, but who are not themselves Christian."/>
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan argued, "The Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era."
It has been noted that the label Anno Domini is arguably inaccurate; "scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before A.D. 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating."[tpl]cite book |last=Doggett |first=L. |chapter=Calendars |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |year=1992 |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, CA |isbn=0-935702-68-7 |editor=P. Kenneth Seidelmann |page=579[/tpl]

===Opposition===

Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth, removing reference to him in era notation is offensive to some Christians.
The Southern Baptist Convention supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations as "a reminder of the preeminence of Christ and His gospel in world history".  The Convention has criticized the use of BCE and CE as being the result of "secularization, anti-supernaturalism, religious pluralism, and political correctness" and encourages its members to "retain the traditional method of dating and avoid this revisionism".
There are also secular concerns. English language expert Kenneth G. Wilson speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the A.D./B.C. convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system is, the method of numbering years itself, given its Christian basis."
The short lived French Revolutionary Calendar, for example, began with the first year of the First French Republic and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to Genesis) for a ten-day week.
Astrobiologist Duncan Steel argues further that if one is going to replace BC/AD with BCE/CE then one should reject all aspects of the dating system (including time of day, days of the week and months of the year), as they all have origins related to pagan, astrological, Jewish, or Christian beliefs. He rejects secular arguments against Christian-based BC/AD as selective. Steel makes note of the consistency of the Quaker system (now rarely used), which removed all such references.
Anthropologist Carol Delaney argues that the substitution of BCE/CE for BC/AD is merely a euphemism that conceals the political implications without modifying the actual source of contention.
Raimon Panikkar contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism"  towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".
Some critics assert that the use of identifiers which have common spellings is more ambiguous than the use of identifiers with divergent spellings. Both CE and BCE have in common the letters "CE", which is more likely to cause confusion, they claim, than identifiers with clearly different spelling.

===Internet reaction===

According to a Los Angeles Times report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within Wikipedia, which prompted the history teacher Andrew Schlafly to found Conservapedia, a cultural conservative wiki.
One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.Conservapedia Commandments at Conservapedia

==Conventions in style guides==

The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).
Thus, the current year is written as [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] CE, or as AD [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]), and the year that Socrates died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with periods (e.g., "BCE" or "C.E.").
Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.SBL Handbook of Style Society of Biblical Literature 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS - The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §7.1.3.2.)"
The terms "Common Era", "Anno Domini", "Before the Common Era", and "Before Christ" in contemporary English can be applied to dates that rely on either the Julian calendar or the Gregorian calendar.
Modern dates are understood in the Western world to be in the Gregorian calendar, but for older dates writers should specify the calendar used. Dates in the Gregorian calendar in the Western world have always used the era designated in English as Anno Domini or Common Era.

==Similar conventions in other languages==

Several languages other than English also have both religious and non-religious ways of identifying the era used in dates. In some communist states during the Cold War period, usage of non-religious notation was mandated.
