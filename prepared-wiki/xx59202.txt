Of the 4 people on board (2 passengers and 2 crew) 2 were killed while the other 2 sustained serious injuries."ASN Aircraft accident Beechcraft 1900C-1 N55000 Saranac Lake-Adirondack Airport, NY (SLK)."

Retrieved on April 23, 2010. "The CommutAir pilot had just contacted the company's ground officials at Lake Clear Airport when the plane went down near the 2400-foot peak of Blue Hill," The aircraft crashed near the peak of Blue Hill. The aircraft was new and the crew was experienced; after the incident the public was baffled, wondering how the incident occurred."2 DIE IN BAFFLING CRASH OF NEW PLANE." The Buffalo News. January 5, 1992. Retrieved on April 23, 2010. Of the deceased, one was 23-year old copilot Dean Montana, and one was an off-duty employee."2 KILLED IN PLANE CRASH." The Palm Beach Post. January 4, 1992. Page 20A. "The victims were co-pilot Dean Montana, 23, of Syracuse and an off-duty CommutAir employee whose identification was withheld pending notification of relatives."

====Investigation====

The aircraft was not required to be equipped with a flight data recorder, therefore a flight data recorder was not present. The cockpit voice recorder was burned to the point that the data inside was not usable. The National Transportation Safety Board used aircraft position data from air traffic control, the aircraft wreckage, survivor interviews, and weather information to find its probable cause.
The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error in establishing a stabilized approach and cross-checking instruments. Factors related to the accident were: weather conditions and possible precipitation static interference, caused by inadequate grounding between the radome and fuselage that could have resulted in unreliable glide slope indications."
