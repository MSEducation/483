Teams from six regions (US East, US Central, US West, Canada East, Canada West, International) are represented at the World Tournament. The ISC allocates berths by region to qualifying tournaments throughout North America. Teams gain entry by winning one of the allocated berths or by accepting an at-large invitation. The current format has 48 teams taking part in a modified double elimination bracket. The first 16 teams eliminated are relegated to the ISC II Tournament. The ISC II Tournament of Champions originally began play in 2002 as a separate tournament for second-tier teams. The two tournaments were amalgamated for the 2010 tournament in Midland, Michigan.
