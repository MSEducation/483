Craig Ashall was a professional rugby league footballer who played professionally for St. Helens in the Super League but now plays at a semi-professional capacity with the Swinton Lions in Championship One. He is by preference a stand-off but can also play at loose-forward. He made his one and only first-grade appearance whilst at St Helens against Catalans Dragons; a game in which St Helens fielded a weakened side in preparation for the 2006 Challenge Cup Final. Ashall scored a try in this 26-22 defeat. He transferred to Swinton in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rleague.com//db/player/a/ashall_craig/index.php|title=rleague.com Profile|publisher=rleague.com|date=2010-01-10|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=10&num=16662&num=16662|title=saints.org.uk Profile|publisher=saints.org.uk|date=2010-01-09|accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl]
