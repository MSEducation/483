[[Uniform 1 k2 polytope]]

CATEGORIES: Multi-dimensional geometry, Polytopes

In geometry, 1k2 polytope is a uniform polytope in n-dimensions (n = k+4) constructed from the En Coxeter group. The family was named by Coxeter as 1k2 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 1-node sequence. It can be named by an exponential Schl√§fli symbol {31,k,2}.

==Family members==

The family starts uniquely as 6-polytopes, but can be extended backwards to include the 5-demicube (demipenteract) in 5-dimensions, and the 4-simplex (5-cell) in 4-dimensions.
Each polytope is constructed from 1k-1,2 and (n-1)-demicube facets. Each has a vertex figure of a {31,n-2,2} polytope is a birectified n-simplex, t2{3n}.
The sequence ends with k=6 (n=10), as an infinite tessellation of 9-dimensional hyperbolic space.
The complete family of 1k2 polytope polytopes are:
