==Story==

The story is about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local arcades. He would meet competitors like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At a certain point in each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a top which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the cabinet panels, turning the ordinary button into a turbo button thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being bucktoothed, and he always wears a hat labeled "Arashi" with a picture of a sprited alien.
Game Center Arashi was the first animation with a gamer as the lead character and have the plot revolve around life with competitive gaming. Some of the games featured in the show include Space Invaders, Breakout, Galaxian, though they were not explicitly named. Some of Arashi's gaming techniques even have special names like "Blazed Top", "Vacuum Hurricane Shot", "Fish Stance".Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. 2006 (2006).

In 1999, the series spawned a PlayStation novel called Game Center Arashi R. In 2004 Microsoft Tokyo used the character of Arashi as a mascot to boost Xbox sales and image.
While the 2002 manga Arcade Gamer Fubuki reused the concept of a powerful gamer in the arcades, and also spawned a TV series of the same name, that show used entirely different characters and plots, modernizing while separating itself from the 1982 counterpart.
