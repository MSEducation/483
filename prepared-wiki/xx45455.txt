</ref> The 1989 game ''[[Hillsfar]]'' was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to ''Pool of Radiance''. ''Hillsfar'' is described instead, by the reviewers of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', as "a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel".<ref name="Dragon147">
[/ref] A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that "you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game."[tpl]cite journal |title=Curse of The Azure Bonds |author=Scorpia |journal=Computer Gaming World |issue=63 |url=http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1989&pub=2&id=63 |date=September 1989 |pages=8â€“9, 46[/tpl]
GameSpot declared that Pool of Radiance, with its detailed art, wide variety of quests and treasure, and tactical combat system, and despite the availability of only four character classes and the low character level cap, "ultimately succeeded in its goal of bringing a standardized form of AD&D to the home computer, and laid the foundation for other future gold box AD&D role-playing games". Scott Battaglia of GameSpy said Pool of Radiance is "what many gamers consider to be the epitome of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons RPGs. These games were so great that people today are using MoSlo in droves to slow down their Pentium III-1000 MHz enough to play these gems."[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/por_a.shtm|title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame|author=Battaglia, Scott|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=5 August 2009[/tpl] In March 2008, Dvice.com listed Pool of Radiance among its 13 best electronic versions of Dungeons & Dragons.

The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game module Ruins of Adventure was produced using the same adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, and many of the same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful clues to the successful completion of the computer missions.[tpl]cite book|last=Ward|first=James|authorlink=Jim Ward (game designer)|coauthors=David "Zeb" Cook, Steve Winter, Mike Breault|title=Ruins of Adventure|publisher=TSR|year=1988|page=2|isbn=0-88038-588-X[/tpl] Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of Radiance.[tpl]cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=113[/tpl] According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.
