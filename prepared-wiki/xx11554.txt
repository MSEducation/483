Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of  meat – red meat, poultry, seafood and the flesh of any other animal; it may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.[tpl]cite web|title=What is a vegetarian?|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=December 11, 2010|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Ingredients 1: Gelatine |publisher=International Vegetarian Union (IVU)|accessdate=February 7, 2013|url=http://www.worldvegfest.org/index.php/gelatin|quote=Since the gelatin product is from hides or bones – not real flesh – and has undergone such significant changes, it is no longer considered 'fleishig' (meat) but 'pareve', and can be eaten with dairy products. ...Rennet is like gelatin in the sense that it's a common food additive but the foods containing it are often considered vegetarian.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Why Avoid Hidden Animal Ingredients?|publisher=The North American Vegetarian Society|accessdate=February 7, 2013|url=http://www.navs-online.org/lifestyle/animal_ingr/hidden_ingredients.php|quote=Surprisingly, some people who consider themselves vegetarian continue to consume products that contain remains of slaughtered animals such as gelatin (made from ground-up skin and bones, found in Jell-O, supplement capsules, and photographic film) and rennet (made from the lining of calves 'stomachs, used to coagulate hard cheese). Some of these people may be unaware that these hidden animal ingredients even exist. Others know about them but feel that they are just minor components of a product, and that their presence is therefore not important... Many people who do not eat meat for ethical reasons do use animal by-products that are obtained while the animals are still alive. Dairy is a good example, as many vegetarians who consume it rationalize their behavior by pointing out that cows are not killed in order to provide humans with this particular by-product.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2007/12/is-cheese-vegetarian.html|title=Is Cheese Vegetarian?|last=Forrest|first=Jamie|date=December 18, 2007|publisher=Serious Eats|accessdate=July 9, 2010|quote=Some vegetarians are OK eating cheeses made with animal rennet, but many will seek out ones made with vegetarian rennet, especially since the latter are quite prevalent nowadays.[/tpl]
Vegetarianism can be adopted for different reasons.  Many object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, along with the concept of animal rights. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic or economic. There are varieties of the diet as well: an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs, and an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products. A vegan, or strict vegetarian, diet excludes all animal products, including eggs, dairy, beeswax and honey. Some vegans also avoid animal products such as leather for clothing and goose-fat for shoe polish.
Various packaged or processed foods, including cake, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, and may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions.[tpl]cite web|title=Things to look out for if you are a vegetarian/vegan|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=December 11, 2010|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729[/tpl] Often, products are reviewed by vegetarians for animal-derived ingredients prior to purchase or consumption. Vegetarians vary in their feelings regarding these ingredients, however. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role in the usual production of cheese and may therefore unknowingly consume the product,[tpl]cite web|first=Michael|last=Keevican|title=What's in Your Cheese?|publisher=Vegetarian Resource Group|accessdate=December 10, 2010|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/cheese.htm|quote=Many vegetarians don't consider that some of the cheeses they are eating could actually contain unfamiliar animal ingredients.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/faqingredients.htm#cheese|title=Frequently Asked Questions — Food Ingredients|publisher=Vegetarian Resource Group|accessdate=July 9, 2010|quote=One of the most frequently asked questions is: Why are some cheeses labeled as "vegetarian cheese"?

Semi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods, but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define meat only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2002 and 2007) defines "vegetarian" (noun) as "A person who on principle abstains from animal food; esp. one who avoids meat but will eat dairy produce and eggs and sometimes also fish (cf. VEGAN noun)."[tpl]Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Susan I.|coauthors=Gwen E.

==Etymology==

The word vegetarian is on record since 1839, referring to what was previously just described as "vegetable diet".
It is a compound of vegetable and the suffix -arian (as in agrarian).
The term was popularised with the foundation of the  Vegetarian Society in Manchester, UK in 1847.[ref]OED vol. 19, second edition (1989), p. 476; Webster’s Third New International Dictionary p. 2537; The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford, 1966, p. 972; The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (1988), p. 1196; Colin Spencer, The Heretic's Feast. A History of Vegetarianism, London 1993, p. 252. The OED writes that the word came into general use after the formation of the Vegetarian Society at Ramsgate in 1847, though it offers two examples of usage from 1839 and 1842: 
[/ref]  
The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House, a school on the north side of Ham Common, London, opened  in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves, from 1841 known as A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College, from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet "The Healthian", which provides some of the earliest occurrences of the term "vegetarian".Extracts from some journals 1842-48 - the earliest known uses of the word 'vegetarian' Compiled by John Davis .

==History==

The earliest records of (lacto) vegetarianism come from ancient India and ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE.Spencer, Colin. The Heretic's Feast: A History of Vegetarianism. Fourth Estate Classic House, pp. 33–68, 69–84. In  the Asian instance the diet was closely connected with the idea of nonviolence towards animals (called ahimsa in India) and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers.Religious Vegetarianism From Hesiod to the Dalai Lama, ed. Kerry S. Walters and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 13–46. Among the Hellenes, Egyptians and others, it had medical or Ritual purification purposes.
Indian emperor Ashoka asserted protection to fauna: [tpl]quote|"Twenty-six years after my coronation various animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, ruddy geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Those nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young are protected, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another." —Edicts of Ashoka, Fifth Pillar[/tpl]
Following the Christianisation of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe as it was in other Continents, except India.[tpl]cite journal | author = Passmore John| year = 1975 | title = The Treatment of Animals | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas| volume = 36 | pages = 196–201 | doi = 10.2307/2708924 | issue = 2 [/tpl] Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish.Lutterbach, Hubertus. "Der Fleischverzicht im Christentum," Saeculum 50/II (1999) p. 202. (The medieval definition of "fish" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers.)Mortimer, Ian. "The Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England," (2008) p. 184.
It re-emerged during the Renaissance,Spencer p. 180–200. becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom;Spencer p. 252–253, 261–262. Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. The International Vegetarian Union, a union of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.

==Varieties of vegetarianism==

There are a number of types of vegetarianism, which exclude or include various foods.
Within the 'ovo-' groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.
Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.
Individuals may label themselves "vegetarian" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet,Yabroff, Jennie. "No More Sacred Cows", Newsweek, December 31, 2009.Gale, Catharine R. et al. "IQ in childhood and vegetarianism in adulthood: 1970 British cohort study", British Medial Journal, December 15, 2006, vol 333, issue 7581, p. 245. as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat,Meat: definition 2b, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2010. Retrieved January 5, 2010. while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh. In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as "flexitarian".[tpl]cite web|title=2003 Words of the Year |publisher=American Dialect Society|date=January 13, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2012|url=http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/2003_words_of_the_year/ [/tpl]
These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:
Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, who state that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.

==Health effects==

Scientific endeavors in the area of vegetarianism have shifted from concerns about nutritional adequacy to investigating health benefits and disease prevention.Sabaté J., ed., Vegetarian Nutrition (Boca Raton:CRC Press), 2001. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is "healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.eatright.org/about/content.aspx?id=8357| title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian diets| date= July 2009| accessdate =November 18, 2012[/tpl] Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischaemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians.Key et al. Mortality in vegetarians and non-vegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 70 (3): 516S.Rejecting meat 'keeps weight low', BBC News, March 14, 2006. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada, 2003, vol 103, issue 6, pp. 748–65. doi 10.1053/jada.2003.50142.Fraser G.

Vegetarians tend to have lower body mass index,[tpl]cite pmid|9622343[/tpl] lower levels of cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and less incidence of heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, metabolic syndrome,Rizzo NS, Sabaté J, Jaceldo-Siegl K, Fraser GE.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2002. Non-lean red meat, in particular, has been found to be directly associated with increased risk of cancers of the esophagus, liver, colon, and the lungs.Maggie Fox, Meat raises lung cancer risk, too, study finds, Reuters, December 10, 2007; A Prospective Study of Red and Processed Meat Intake in Relation to Cancer Risk, PLoS Medicine. April 21, 2008. Other studies have shown no significant differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. A 2010 study compared a group of vegetarian and meat-eating Seventh-day Adventists in which vegetarians scored lower on depression tests and had better mood profiles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/26 |title=Vegetarian diets are associated with healthy mood states: a cross-sectional study in Seventh Day Adventist adults|date= June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl]
The relationship between vegetarian diet and bone health remains unclear. According to some studies, a vegetarian lifestyle can be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and low bone mineral density.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fyiliving.com/research/vitamin-b12-linked-to-osteoporosis-and-bone-loss-in-vegetarians/|title=Vitamin B12 Linked to Osteoporosis and Bone Loss in Vegetarians|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011[/tpl] However, a study of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan found no significant difference in bone mineral density between the two groups.[tpl]cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18364334 |title=Bone mineral density of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=Sept 216, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2013[/tpl]  Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on bone health, suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral densityEllis FR, Holesh S, Ellis JW..

===Nutrition===

Western vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy).[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Health effects of vegetarian and vegan diets|author=Timothy J Key, Paul N Appleby, Magdalena S Rosell|year=2006|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|pages=35–41|volume=65|doi=10.1079/PNS2005481|pmid=16441942|issue=1[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|title=EPIC-Oxford: lifestyle characteristics and nutrient intakes in a cohort of 33 883 meat-eaters and 31 546 non meat-eaters in the UK|author=Davey GK, Spencer EA, Appleby PN, Allen NE, Knox KH, Key TJ|year=2003|journal=Public Health Nutrition |pages=259–69|volume=6|doi = 10.1079/PHN2002430|pmid=12740075|issue=3[/tpl]

====Protein====

Protein intake in vegetarian diets is only slightly lower than in meat diets and can meet daily requirements for any person, including athletes and bodybuilders.[tpl]Cite book| last = Peter Emery| first = Tom Sanders| title = Molecular Basis of Human Nutrition| publisher = Taylor & Francis Ltd|year=2002| page = 32| isbn = 978-0-7484-0753-8[/tpl] Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries,

While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4375/2 | title = Soybeans, mature seeds, raw | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 [/tpl] hempseed, chia seed,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3061/2 | title = Seeds, chia seeds, dried | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 [/tpl] amaranth,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5676/2 | title = Amaranth, uncooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 [/tpl] buckwheat,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5681/2 | title = Buckwheat | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 [/tpl] pumpkin seeds[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3066/2 | title = Pumpkin Seeds | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013[/tpl] spirulina,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2765/2 | title = Spirulina | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 [/tpl] pistachios,[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3135/2| title = Pistachio | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 [/tpl] and quinoa.[tpl]cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 | title = Quinoa, cooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 [/tpl] However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and whole wheat pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.[tpl]Cite journal| author=VR Young and PL Pellett| title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition| journal=Am.

====Iron====

Vegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents.Iron by The Vegetarian Society of the United Kingdom Limited According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal.The Vegetarian Resource Group Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins,  spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread.[tpl]cite web|url=http://goveg.com/essential_nutrients.asp#iron |title=// Health Issues // Optimal Vegan Nutrition |publisher=Goveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009[/tpl] The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Dietary Iron Intake and Iron Status of German Female Vegans: Results of the German Vegan Study|author=Annika Waldmann, Jochen W.

However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=WJ|last2=Mangels|first2=AR|last3=American Dietetic|first3=Association|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: vegetarian diets|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1266–82|year=2009|pmid=19562864|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027[/tpl]

====Vitamin B12====

====Fatty acids====

Plant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma in British meat-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men|author=Rosell MS, Lloyd-Wright Z, Appleby PN, Sanders TA, Allen NE, Key TJ|year=2003|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|pages=327–34|volume=82|pmid=16087975|issue=2[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=May 2011[/tpl] Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts.

Calcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned.[tpl]cite web|title=Meeting Calcium Recommendations  on a Vegan Diet|url=http://vegetariannutrition.net/docs/Calcium-Vegetarian-Nutrition.pdf|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=29 April 2014[/tpl]  Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.[tpl]cite web|title=Calcium Fact Sheet|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional|accessdate=29 April 2014[/tpl]
Non-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet.[tpl]cite web|last=Mangels|first=Reed|title=Calcium in the Vegan Diet|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.php|accessdate=29 April 2014[/tpl]    The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body.[tpl]cite journal|first=NIH|title=Overview of Calcium|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56060/?report=reader|accessdate=29 April 2014[/tpl]   Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher.  Other  foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini (http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.php) Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body.   Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates .   See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group  and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics   for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian and/or vegan diet.

====Vitamin D====

Vitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible  exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight.http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Vitamin-D.html[tpl]cite journal | author = Crissey SD, Ange KD, Jacobsen KL, Slifka KA, Bowen PE, Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis M, Langman CB, Sadler W, Kahn S | title = Serum concentrations of lipids, vitamin D metabolites, retinol, retinyl esters, tocopherols and selected carotenoids in twelve captive wild felid species at four zoos | journal = The Journal of nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 160–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12514284 [/tpl] Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D[tpl]cite web|url=http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin D|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=September 10, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5Rl5u0LB5 |archivedate=September 10, 2007[/tpl] For those who do not get adequate sun exposure and/or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.

====Vitamin D2====

Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot).

===Longevity===

A 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries.[tpl]Cite journal|title= Mortality in vegetarians and non-vegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies|journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume= 70|issue=3|pages=516S–524S|date = September 1999|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S|accessdate=October 30, 2009|author= Timothy J Key, Gary E Fraser, Margaret Thorogood, Paul N Appleby, Valerie Beral, Gillian Reeves, Michael L Burr, Jenny Chang-Claude, Rainer Frentzel-Beyme, Jan W Kuzma, Jim Mann and Klim McPherson |pmid= 10479225[/tpl] The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for vegans was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these vegetarian cohorts". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: "...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established".
In Mortality in British vegetarians,[tpl]cite journal|last1=Key|first1=TJ|last2=Appleby|first2=PN|last3=Davey|first3=GK|last4=Allen|first4=NE|last5=Spencer|first5=EA|last6=Travis|first6=RC|title=Mortality in British vegetarians: review and preliminary results from EPIC-Oxford|journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition|volume=78|issue=3 Suppl|pages=533S–538S|year=2003|pmid=12936946[/tpl] a similar conclusion is drawn: "British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish."[tpl]cite journal|last1=Appleby|first1=PN|last2=Key|first2=TJ|last3=Thorogood|first3=M|last4=Burr|first4=ML|last5=Mann|first5=J|title=Mortality in British vegetarians|journal=Public health nutrition|volume=5|issue=1|pages=29–36|year=2002|pmid=12001975|doi=10.1079/PHN2001248[/tpl]
The Adventist Health Studies is ongoing research that documents the life expectancy in Seventh-day Adventists. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that "the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine, Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001. Retrieved January 9, 2010.
The Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled "Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?" published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that "The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy." However, the study also concluded that "Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians." It further states that "This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet." In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that "5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake."[tpl]cite journal|last=Singh|first=PN|coauthors=Sabaté J, Fraser GE|title=Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=2003|volume=78|issue=3|pages=526S–532S|pmid=12936945|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long|accessdate=28 September 2012[/tpl]

Certain alternative medicines, such as Ayurveda and Siddha, prescribe a vegetarian diet as a normal procedure. Maya Tiwari notes that Ayurveda recommends small portions of meat for some people, though "the rules of hunting and killing the animal, practiced by the native peoples, were very specific and detailed". Now that such methods of hunting and killing are not observed, she does not recommend the use of "any animal meat as food, not even for the Vata types".Maya Tiwari.

==Ethics and diet==

===General===

Various ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.
Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat.

===Ethics of killing for food===

Princeton University professor and founder of the animal rights movement, Peter Singer, believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book Animal Liberation listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutritional value is not sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.[ref][tpl]cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|page=103|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar[/tpl]
[/ref]
Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b |title=Animals and Ethics Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2012[/tpl]

===Milk and eggs===

One of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering and/or a premature death.[tpl]cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781590133446[/tpl]
To produce milk from dairy cattle, calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption.[tpl]cite web|title=Dairy Cows & Welfare |author=Vegetarian Society|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=556[/tpl] Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered "spent" and sent to slaughter for hamburger meat and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.
In battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.[tpl]cite web|title=Egg Production & Welfare |author=Vegetarian Society|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=587#[/tpl]

===Treatment of animals===

Ethical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

Ancient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.
Roman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.

Devadatta was the founder of the tapasa movement in Buddhism and his special rules involved ascetic and austere practices (forest-dwelling, wearing only rags, etc).

===Christianity===

There is no specific teaching on diet in traditional Christianity—except that nothing is forbidden on religious principles. The eating of meat is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Christians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons.[tpl]cite web|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=July 28, 2013|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P4O.HTM#37[/tpl]
The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' "errors".Epiphanius, Panarion, 30.22.4Isidore of Seville, Etymologies, VIII.v.36

The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 "to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/quakers.html |title=The Great War and the Interwar Period |publisher=ivu.org |accessdate=August 14, 2009[/tpl]
According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, all Fridays of Lent, and all other Fridays (subject to the local bishop) as an act of penance.

===Hinduism===

Paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. There are three main reasons for this: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals;Tähtinen, Unto: Ahimsa. Non-Violence in Indian Tradition, London 1976, p. 107–109. the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development.
However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |title=The Hindu : Sci Tech / Speaking Of Science : Changes in the Indian menu over the ages |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2010[/tpl]

===Islam===

Followers of Islam, or Muslims, have the freedom of choice to be vegetarian for medical reasons or if they do not personally like the taste of meat. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.Muslims can’t be vegetarian? Retrieved May 16, 2008

Many non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.

===Jainism===

Followers of Jainism believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death."Vegetarianism Good For The Self And Good For The Environment" at The Jain Study Circle"Spiritual Traditions and Vegetarianism"[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2009[/tpl] at the Vegetarian Society of Colorado website.

===Judaism===

While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits.  One modern-day scholar who is in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals, as all humans and animals were originally commanded by God to only eat plants.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kook |first=Avraham Yitzhak |author= |authorlink=Avraham Yitzhak Kook|last2= |first2= |author2= |authorlink2= |year=1961 |title=A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace |trans_title= |journal= |volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-link=David Cohen (rabbi) |language= |arxiv= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://jewishveg.com/AVisionofVegetarianismandPeace.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= [/tpl] In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the "Nazirite" of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.
According to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and "divine sparks", is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |title=Judaism & Vegetarianism |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009[/tpl]

Pick Jewish law also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter (shechita). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat."The Vision of Eden: Animal Welfare and Vegetarianism" in "Jewish Law and Mysticism", Orot 2003

===Rastafari===

Within the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only "Ital" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari.Osborne, L (1980), The Rasta Cookbook, 3rd ed.

Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?"

==Environment and diet==

Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a "massive scale" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM |title=Livestock's Long Shadow – Environmental issues and options |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009[/tpl]
In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO2 equivalents.  Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.EPA.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990–2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.  This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.

==Economics and diet==

Similar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, "Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry."Worldwatch Institute, News July 2, 1998, United States Leads World Meat Stampede
