The House of Commons of Canada ([tpl]lang-fr|Chambre des communes du Canada[/tpl]) is a component of the Parliament of Canada, along with the Sovereign (represented by the Governor General) and the Senate.[tpl]cite book |title= Guide to the Canadian House of Commons  |work= Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication |publisher= House of Commons of Canada |url= http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/pdf/guide_canadian_house_of_commons-e.pdf |format= PDF |isbn= 0-662-68678-0 |accessdate= 29 September 2007[/tpl] The House of Commons is a democratically elected body, whose members are known as Members of Parliament (MPs).

Historically however, terms have ended before their expiry and the sitting government has typically dissolved parliament within four years of an election according to a long-standing convention. In any case, an Act of Parliament now limits each term to four years.  Seats in the House of Commons are distributed roughly in proportion to the population of each province and territory.  However, some ridings are more populous than others and the Canadian constitution contains some special provisions regarding provincial representation; thus, there is some interprovincial and regional malapportionment relative to population.
The House of Commons was established in 1867, when the British North America Act—now called the Constitution Act, 1867—created the Dominion of Canada, and was modelled on the British House of Commons. The lower of the two houses making up the parliament, the House of Commons in practice holds far more power than the upper house, the Senate. Although the approval of both Houses is necessary for legislation, the Senate very rarely rejects bills passed by the Commons (though the Senate does occasionally amend bills). Moreover, the Government of Canada is responsible solely to the House of Commons. The Prime Minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the support, or "confidence", of the lower house.
It is widely thought[tpl]Who|date=June 2012[/tpl] that "Commons" is a shortening of the word "commoners". However, the term derives from the Anglo-Norman word communes, referring to the geographic and collective "communities" of their parliamentary representatives and not the third estate, the commonality.A. F. Pollard, The Evolution of Parliament (Longmans, 1920), 107–08. This distinction is made clear in the official French name of the body, Chambre des communes. Canada and the United Kingdom remain the only countries to use the name "House of Commons" for a lower house of parliament.
The Canadian House of Commons chamber is located in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings on  Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, Ontario.

==History==

The House of Commons came into existence in 1867, when the British Parliament passed the British North America Act, uniting the Province of Canada (which was separated into Quebec and Ontario), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a single federation called the Dominion of Canada. The new Parliament of Canada consisted of the Queen (represented by the Governor General, who also represented the Colonial Office), the Senate and the House of Commons. The Parliament of Canada was based on the Westminster model (that is, the model of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Unlike the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the powers of the Parliament of Canada were limited in that other powers were assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures. The Parliament of Canada also remained subordinate to the British Parliament, the supreme legislative authority for the entire British Empire. Greater autonomy was granted by the Statute of Westminster 1931,[ref]
