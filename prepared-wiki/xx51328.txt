Crimes of the Heart is a play by Beth Henley.

==Synopsis==

At the core of the tragic comedy are the three MaGrath sisters, Meg, Babe, and Lenny, who reunite at Old Granddaddy's home in Hazlehurst, Mississippi after Babe shoots her abusive husband. The trio was raised in a dysfunctional family with a penchant for ugly predicaments and each has endured her share of hardship and misery. Past resentments bubble to the surface as they're forced to deal with assorted relatives and past relationships while coping with the latest incident that has disrupted their lives.  Each sister is forced to face the consequences of the "crimes of the heart" she has committed.

==Productions==

Henley completed her play in 1978 and submitted it to several regional theatres without success. Unknown to her, a friend entered it in the Great American Play Contest at the Actors Theatre of Louisville, and it was named co-winner and performed in February 1979 at the company's annual festival of New American Plays. The production was extremely well received, and the play was selected by numerous regional theatres for their 1979-80 season. The show starred Lee Anne Fahey, Kathy Bates, and Susan Kingsley.
At the end of 1980, the Manhattan Theatre Club staged the play's New York City premiere for a limited, sold-out engagement of thirty-two performances. After thirteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Melvin Bernhardt, set design by John Lee Beatty, costumes by Patricia McGourty, and lighting by Dennis Parichy, opened on November 4, 1981 at the John Golden Theatre, where it ran for 535 performances. The opening night cast included Mia Dillon, Mary Beth Hurt, Lizbeth MacKay, Raymond Baker, Sharon Ullrick, and Peter MacNicol. The play's success spawned productions in London's West End, Chicago, Washington, DC, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston, and it continues to be a popular choice for community theatre and summer stock productions.
A production at Off-Broadway's Second Stage Theatre ran from April 16, 2001 to May 14, 2001. It was directed by Garry Hynes, and featured Julia Murney (Chick), Enid Graham (Lenny), and Mary Catherine Garrison (Babe). The play was nominated for the Lucille Lortel Award for Best Revival of the season.
