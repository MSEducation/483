[[2003 Bonnaroo Music Festival]]

CATEGORIES: Bonnaroo Music Festival, 2003 in music, 2003 in American music, 2003 in Tennessee

The festival ran June 13â€“15, and 80,000 attended. In 2003, The Bonnaroo organizers planned a festival called Bonnaroo Northeast to take place in Riverhead, Long Island, New York. This festival, as well as the Field Day Festival, another festival to take place at the same site, were cancelled, however, in the weeks leading up to the event due to concern about securing permits in time.
