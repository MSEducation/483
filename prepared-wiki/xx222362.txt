Departures (also promoted as departures.) is a travel adventure television series. An original Canadian production created by Echo Bay Media Inc./Departures Entertainment Inc. (Andre Dupuis and Scott Wilson) and produced by Jessie Wallace and Steven Bray. Distributed by Departures Distribution Inc. an arm of the ShootingStar Film Co. The worldwide premiere was with the Canadian Channel OLN on March 17, 2008 and continued for a total of 42 episodes ending on June 19, 2010.
Series co-creators Scott Wilson (Host) and Andre Dupuis (Director and Videographer) have said that he and Wilson worked on another show, but that it seemed "kind of dry", and that it was not carrying across the feelings that they had, thinking he and Wilson "could probably do a better job".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressplus1.com/television/departures-arrivals-and-the-journeys-in-between-an-interview-with-scott-wilson-justin-lukach-and-andre-dupuis-from-departures.html|title=An Interview with the cast of the hit Travel Show "Departures"|accessdate=2010-05-24|author=Pertic, Gabor|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Press+1[/tpl]
