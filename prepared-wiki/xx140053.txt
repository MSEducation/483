[[Le Monde illustré]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct newspapers of France

Le Monde illustré was a leading 19th-century illustrated newsmagazine in France.  It was in many ways similar to its contemporary English-language newsmagazine, the Illustrated London News.
Many of the highly realistic prints published in the medium of wood-engraving were actually made from photographs, at a time when photographic reproduction in print was not technically feasible until the late nineteenth century.  Among its artists was Hector Giacomelli.
