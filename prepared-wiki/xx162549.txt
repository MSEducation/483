CATEGORIES: Latter Day Saint doctrines regarding deity, Mormon cosmology

Mormon cosmology is the description of the history, evolution, and destiny of the physical and metaphysical universe according to Mormonism, which includes the doctrines taught by leaders and theologians of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Mormon fundamentalism, the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ and other Brighamite denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement. These views are not generally shared by adherents of other Latter Day Saint movement denominations who do not self-identify as "Mormons", such as the Community of Christ.  Mormon cosmology draws from Biblical cosmology, but has many unique elements provided by Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith, Jr.
According to Mormon cosmology, there was a pre-existence, better described as a pre-mortal life, in which human spirits were literal children of heavenly parents.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|1995[/tpl] ("Each human is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents."); [tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|p=9[/tpl] ("Man, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father."). Though their spirits were created, the essential "intelligence" of these spirits is considered eternal, and without beginning. During this pre-existence, two plans were said to have been presented, one championed by Lucifer (Satan) that would have involved loss of moral agency, and another championed by God the Father.  When his plan was not accepted, Lucifer is said to have rebelled and taken "the third part" of the hosts of heaven with him to the earth to serve as tempters.  According to a plan of salvation as described by God the Father, Jehovah (the antemortal Jesus Christ according to Mormonism) created the earth, under the direction of God the Father, as a place where humanity would be tested.  After the resurrection all men and women except spirits that followed Lucifer and the sons of perdition would be assigned one of three degrees of glory.  Within the highest degree, the Celestial Kingdom, there are three divisions, and those in the highest of these divisions would become gods and goddesses through a process called exaltation or "eternal progression".  The doctrine of eternal progression was succinctly summarized by Lorenzo Snow: “As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.”[tpl]citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/02/i-have-a-question?lang=eng |contribution= Is President Lorenzo Snow’s oft-repeated statement—“As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be”—accepted as official doctrine by the Church? |title= I Have a Question |first= Gerald N. |last= Lund |authorlink= Gerald N.

The Earth's creation, according to Mormon scripture, was not ex nihilo, but organized from existing matter.  The faith teaches that this earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and that there are many governing heavenly bodies, including a planet or star Kolob which is said to be nearest the throne of God. According to the King Follett discourse, God the Father himself once passed through mortality like Jesus did, but how, when, or where that took place is unclear. The prevailing view among Mormons is that God once lived on a planet with his own higher god."An explanation of Mormon beliefs about God", BBC – Religions, 2009-10-02.Jana Riess and Christopher Kimball Bigelow, Mormonism for Dummies (John Wiley & Sons, 2005, ISBN 978-0-7645-7195-4) ch. 3.

==Divinity==

In Mormonism, the concept of divinity centers around an idea of "exaltation" and "eternal progression": the idea that mortals themselves may become gods and goddesses in the afterlife, be rulers of their own heavenly kingdoms, have spirit children, and increase in power and glory forever as a result of their posterity.  Mormons understand that there are many gods and goddesses in the cosmos, including a Heavenly Mother.  However, the three persons of the Christian Trinity (God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost) are to be the only objects of worship.

===Exaltation and eternal progression===

In Mormonism, the goal of each adherent is to achieve "exaltation" via the atonement of Jesus, as a result of which they inherit all the attributes of God the Father, including godhood. Mormons believe that these people will become gods and goddesses in the afterlife, and will have "all power, glory, dominion, and knowledge".[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|p=227[/tpl]. Moreover, Mormons teach that exalted people will live with their earthly families and also "have spirit children".[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|p=11[/tpl] Their posterity will continue to grow forever.
According to the belief, exaltation is available only to those who have earned the highest "degree" of the celestial kingdom.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|p=275[/tpl]; [tpl]harvtxt|Pope|1992|p=479[/tpl].  As prerequisites for this "greatest gift of God",Doctrine and Covenants 14:7. adherents believe that either in this life or the afterlife, they must become "perfect" and they must participate in all the required ceremonies. Though not necessary, their exaltation can be "sealed upon them" by the Holy Ghost via the Second Anointing. One of the key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner via the ordinance of sealing,Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–3.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=219–224[/tpl]
