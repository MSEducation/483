===Iowa===

U.S. Route 275 crosses into Iowa [tpl]convert|1+1/2|mi[/tpl] south of Hamburg.  It enters Hamburg and intersects Iowa Highway 333 (Iowa 333), which connects to Interstate 29 (I-29) [tpl]convert|1+1/2|mi[/tpl] to the west.  North of Hamburg, it intersects Iowa 2, and the two routes share [tpl]convert|5|mi[/tpl] of road.  US 275 and Iowa 2 then bypass Sidney on its east side, and east of Sidney, US 275 and Iowa 2 separate.  From east of Sidney, US 275 continues north for [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] through Tabor until it intersects U.S. Route 34 east of Glenwood.  US 275 and US 34 then overlap for [tpl]convert|8|mi[/tpl], mostly bypassing Glenwood.  West of Glenwood, US 34 and US 275 split at an interchange with I-29; US 34 follows southbound I-29, while US 275 follows northbound I-29.  For [tpl]convert|13|mi[/tpl], US 275 overlaps I-29, ending at an interchange with Iowa 92 in southern Council Bluffs.  Turning west, US 275 / Iowa 92 travel together for [tpl]convert|5|mi[/tpl] in Iowa and cross the new South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River.

===Nebraska===

US 275 enters Nebraska in Omaha in the South Omaha neighborhood paired with Nebraska Highway 92.  It goes through Omaha as a four-lane highway until meeting Nebraska Highway 31.  The street designations for US 275 in Omaha are, from east to west, Missouri Avenue, L Street, Industrial Road and West Center Road.  It crosses the Elkhorn River, which it will follow for most of the rest of the route, then separates from NE 92.  It goes northwest and becomes freeway until Fremont.  It meets U.S. Route 30 and they are paired together around Fremont until meeting U.S. Route 77.  US 275 turns north with US 77, meets Nebraska Highway 91 and separates from US 77 near Winslow.  
It turns northwest with NE 91 and they separate near Scribner, Nebraska.  US 275 goes north through West Point, turns northwest through Wisner, and then turns west.  At Norfolk it meets U.S. Route 81.  It continues west-northwest, meets U.S. Route 20 near Inman and the two routes overlap until US 275 ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 281 in downtown O'Neill.

==History==

At its creation in 1932, US 275 ran from Council Bluffs to Saint Joseph, Missouri. In 1939 the route was extended northwest into Nebraska. In 1963 US 275 was truncated to its current end in northwestern Missouri.
Prior to 1963, US 275 extended south to St. Joseph.  The route followed current U.S. Route 136 east from Rock Port to its intersection with U.S. Route 59 near Tarkio, then south with US 59 to St. Joseph.
Before November 2001, US 275 ran alongside the Union Pacific tracks between Waterloo and Fremont, Nebraska.  This routing was replaced by a new freeway segment built as part of a project to connect Fremont via freeway to Omaha. This segment is officially called Reichmuth Road in Douglas County and Bell Street in Fremont. 
Prior to July 1, 2003, US 275 followed a winding two-lane road between Council Bluffs and Glenwood, Iowa. The segment moved to a concurrency with U.S. Route 34 and Interstate 29 that day as part of a mass decommissioning of highways in Iowa.  This road is now Mills County and Pottawattamie County Road L35.
