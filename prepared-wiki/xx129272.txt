Currently 15 species are known, but the most commonly grown are F. albivensis and its cultivars. They are spreading evergreen perennials growing [tpl]convert|10|-|15|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. They bear lush green leaves with accented veins of white to deep pink and have a short fuzz covering their stems. Small buds may appear after time where the stem splits into leaves. Flowers are small with a white to off-white color. Plants are best kept in a moist area with mild sunlight and temperatures above [tpl]convert|55|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl], therefore in temperate areas they must be grown as houseplants. Without water for a few days, this plant is known to "faint" but is easily revived with a quick watering and resumes its healthiness. The fittonia is known to be hard to grow so it is best bought at a nursery then cared for. Its spreading habit makes it ideal as groundcover.
