Albert Leroy "Moose" Marshall (born November 22, 1943) is a retired ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, California Golden Seals, New York Rangers and New York Islanders.

==Playing career==

Bert was a rugged, stay-at-home defenceman who could also provide crisp outlet passes to his forwards. In his rookie season with the Detroit Red Wings, his fine play made him a contender for the Calder Memorial Trophy. The Red Wings made the finals that season before Montreal defeated them four games to two.
Detroit slumped in 1967–68 and traded Bert, with Ted Hampson, to the Oakland Seals for defenceman Kent Douglas. The Seals finished second in 1968–69 and fourth in 1969–70 in the West Division of the NHL, and Bert's fine play was part of the reason. The Oakland Seals became the California Golden Seals in 1970–71, and Bert was injured much of the year, which  contributed to the Seals last place finish.
He was traded to the New York Rangers in 1972–73, but only played eight games. He was drafted by the New York Islanders in the 1973 intra-league draft and it was here that he played his best hockey. He developed good shot-blocking ability and his reliable play and leadership helped the Islanders make the Stanley Cup semi-finals in 1975 and 1976. 
His skating began to go in 1978–79 and he retired at season's end.
He later coached minor league hockey before coaching the NHL's Colorado Rockies for 24 games in 1981–82 before he was fired and replaced by Marshall Johnston.
He currently is a scout for the Carolina Hurricanes. He won the Stanley Cup with Carolina in 2006.
