The flag of Paraguay ([tpl]lang-es|bandera de Paraguay[/tpl]) was adopted in 1842. It is unusual because it differs on obverse and reverse sides. The only other national flags that share this feature are those of Moldova and Saudi Arabia however, both have a mirror image on the reverse, while Paraguay have a completely different image.

==Description==

Each side of the flag consists of three equal, horizontal bands: red, white, and blue, with an emblem centered in the white band. The emblem on the obverse side is the national coat of arms of Paraguay: a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by a green wreath capped by the words REPUBLICA DEL PARAGUAY ("Republic of Paraguay"), all within two concentric circles); the emblem on the reverse side is the seal of the treasury (a yellow lion below a red Phrygian cap and the words Paz y Justicia ("Peace and Justice").
The flag was revised in 2013, simplifying the coat of arms and bringing the design closer to its original form.http://www.flagsaustralia.com.au/Newcountryflags.html
