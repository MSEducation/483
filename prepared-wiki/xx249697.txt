==Attack==

On 8 January 2010, the Togo national team bus was attacked by gunmen as it traveled through the Angolan province of Cabinda for the Africa Cup of Nations.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8449319.stm |title=Togo footballers shot in ambush |accessdate=2010-01-08 |date=2010-01-08 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The bus came under machine gun fire just after it had crossed the border from the Republic of the Congo into the Angolan exclave province of Cabinda.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/6956588/Togo-pull-out-of-African-Nations-Cup-after-bus-attack-in-Angola.html |title=Togo pull out of African Nations Cup after bus attack in Angola |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2010-01-09 | location=London | first1=Duncan | last1=White | first2=Mike | last2=Norrish[/tpl] All of Togo's initial Group B games were to take place in the Estádio Nacional do Chiazi stadium in Cabinda.
According to rebel leader Mingas, the attack was carried out by his Commander Sametonne who claimed 15 FLEC fighters participated in the ambush.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/12/world/AP-EU-France-African-Diplomacy.html |title=Togo Bus Rampage Exposes France's Angola Ties |publisher=The New York Times |author=Angela Charlton |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl] The siege lasted for at least 30 minutes. The bus driver, Mário Adjoua, was killed, cutting off all possible means of escape.

A larger offshoot group known as Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC) also claimed the responsibility. The leader of the group Jean-Claude N'Zita dismissed Mingas' faction as opportunist.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Sport/Story/STIStory_476340.html |title=Second group claims attack  |accessdate=2010-01-13 |date=2010-01-12 |publisher=The Straits Times[/tpl]

==Investigation==

In connection with the deadly attack on the Togolese national football team, the Angolan police arrested two suspects on 10 January 2010.Zwei Festnahmen nach Angriff auf togolesische Fußballmannschaft[tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] As the national radio reported, citing the prosecutor, the arrests were made in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda, located between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in West Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.transfermarkt.de/de/news/34624/togoisches-team-zurueck-in-togo--staatstrauer-.html |title=Togoisches Team zurück in Togo - Staatstrauer |publisher=Transfermarkt.de |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl] A total of 9 suspects were arrested.
Angola arrested four men - Raul Tati, a priest, Francisco Luemba, a lawyer, Belchior Tati, an economist and Jose Benjamin Fuca, a former police officer - who had documents about Flec and had travelled to Paris for meetings with exiled leaders. In August, they were jailed for links to FLEC-PM. A court in Cabinda found the four guilty of crimes against state security; although the judge did not say whether the four had direct links to the attack. Their prison sentences ranged from three to five years.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] On January 11, two FLEC operatives were arrested near the site of the shooting.[tpl]cite news |title=2 separatists held in attack on Togo soccer team |first=Samuel |last=Petrequin |work=Associated Press |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2010 |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SOC_TOGO_BUS_ATTACKED?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2010-01-11-22-03-44[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The trial was criticised by human rights groups that accused the government of using the attacks to justify a crackdown on critics. Martinho Nombo, a lawyer taking part in the court hearings, said the judge convicted them only because they had spoken or written about independence for Cabinda. "This is unconstitutional. A judge cannot jail someone for nothing. This will only worsen Angola's poor record on human rights and the whole peace process with FLEC. The supposed link was implied rather than stated. They were convicted on the basis of those documents." Human Rights Watch also criticised the conviction calling the four "activists" and saying "This is clearly a lost opportunity to restore justice in Angola, and particularly in Cabinda."http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/20108315102504923.html

==Aftermath==

The Togolese team called for a boycott of the competition as a result of the attack.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8449611.stm|title=Attacked Togo stars want Africa Cup of Nations boycott|date=2010-01-08|accessdate=2010-01-08|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] Alaixys Romao and Thomas Dossevi spoke of their disgust and their lack of desire to compete following their experience. Togo's national football squad subsequently withdrew from the tournament. Togolese midfielder Alaixys Romao said the team was also trying to persuade the other teams in their group to pull out of the competition. After seeing the aftermath of the attack, members of the Mozambique national team flying into Luanda asked for assurances of protection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/01/201019133527904790.html |title=Africa - Togo withdraw from Africa Cup |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl]
