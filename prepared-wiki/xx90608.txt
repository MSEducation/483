Meyer set world records in 200-meter, 400-meter, and 800-meter freestyle swimming events at the U.S. Olympics trials. Her winning times at the Olympic Games were 2:10.5 for 200-meter, 4:31.8 for the 400-meter, and 9:24.0 for the 800-meter distances, all of them new or first-time Olympic records. 
In 1968, the women's freestyle races at 200-meter and 800-meter distances were added to the Summer Olympics for the first time. Before this, the longest race for women was the 400-meter freestyle, despite the fact that the male competitors had had the 1,500-meter freestyle race (the metric mile) for decades, dating back to 1896.  
While overcoming her problems with asthma, Meyer broke twenty world records in swimming during her career. All of this put her into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986.U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame Class of 1986, United States Olympic Team. [tpl]Dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
