[[Rack and pinion]]

CATEGORIES: Machines, Kinematics, Automotive steering technologies, Gears, Actuators

A rack and pinion is a type of linear actuator that comprises a pair of gears which convert rotational motion into linear motion. A circular gear called "the pinion" engages teeth on a linear "gear" bar called "the rack"; rotational motion applied to the pinion causes the rack to move, thereby translating the rotational motion of the pinion into the linear motion of the rack.
For example, in a rack railway, the rotation of a pinion mounted on a locomotive or a railcar engages a rack between the rails and forces a train up a steep slope.
For every pair of conjugate involute profile, there is a basic rack. This basic rack is the profile of the conjugate gear of infinite pitch radius.[tpl]cite book|isbn=1-55589-846-7|oclc=65562739|title=Gear Nomenclature, Definition of Terms with Symbols|pages=72|id=ANSI/AGMA 1012-G05|publisher=American Gear Manufacturers Association[/tpl] (I.e. a toothed straight edge.)
A generating rack is a rack outline used to indicate tooth details and dimensions for the design of a generating tool, such as a hob or a gear shaper cutter.

==Applications==

Rack and pinion combinations are often used as part of a simple linear actuator, where the rotation of a shaft powered by hand or by a motor is converted to linear motion.
The rack carries the full load of the actuator directly and so the driving pinion is usually small, so that the gear ratio reduces the torque required. This force, thus torque, may still be substantial and so it is common for there to be a reduction gear immediately before this by either a gear or worm gear reduction. Rack gears have a higher ratio, thus require a greater driving torque, than screw actuators.

===Steering===

A rack and pinion is commonly found in the steering mechanism of cars or other wheeled, steered vehicles. Rack and pinion provides a less efficient mechanical advantage than other mechanisms such as recirculating ball, but less backlash and greater feedback, or steering "feel". The mechanism may be power-assisted, usually by hydraulic or electrical means.
The use of a variable rack (still using a normal pinion) was invented by Arthur Ernest Bishop,[tpl]cite web|title=Rack and pinion variable ratio steering gear|publisher=Google Patent Search|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT3753378&id=bTEwAAAAEBAJ&dq=pinion+%2Bininventor:Arthur+ininventor:E+ininventor:Bishop&jtp=1|accessdate=2007-03-22[/tpl] in the 1970s, so as to improve vehicle response and steering "feel," especially at high speeds. He also created a low cost press forging process to manufacture the racks, eliminating the need to machine the gear teeth.

===Rack railways===

Rack railways are mountain railways that use a rack built into the centre of the track and a pinion on their locomotives. This allows them to work on steep gradients, up to 1 in 2 (50%), far in excess of those a conventional railway relying on friction can achieve.
Although the extra grip of the rack system is obviously important for climbing, it has perhaps a more important use in also allowing controlled braking on these steep lines and for being much less affected by snow or ice on the rails.
