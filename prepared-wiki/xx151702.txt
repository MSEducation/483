Copperfields Mine, originally known as Temagami Mine, is an abandoned copper and silver mine on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami, Ontario, Canada. The mine opened in 1954 and comprises both underground and surface workings within a sulfide ore body. Situated in Phyllis Township, the mine produced 34,000,000 dollars Canadian with 80 million pounds of copper, 230,028 ounces of silver and 13,271 ounces of gold.[tpl]cite journal|author= |year= |title=Ground Geophysical Surveys: Niemetz Property |journal= |id=[tpl]Afri|31M04SW2038[/tpl] [/tpl] It was considered to produce the purest copper ore in Canada.[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl] The mine closed in 1972 and is now flooded by water. Ruins of the Copperfields mill are present as fountains. It is possible to find mineral specimens in the spoil heaps of the old mine, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, malachite, dolomite, hessite, merenskyite, millerite, palladium, quartz and others. The Lake Temagami Access Road was created to ship ore from the mine site.
Copper-nickel mineralization at the mine is associated with semi-massive to disseminated pyrite at the lower contact between altered gabbro and rhyolite of the Temagami greenstone belt. The gabbro is steeply dipping, approximately 250 m thick and has a strike extent of at least 5Â km. The intensity of mineralization varies greatly but is present over most of the defined strike length of the gabbro. Copper is associated with chalcopyrite. Nickel is associated with millerite, gersdorffite, linnaeite and cobalt-nickel sulfarsenides.
Copperfields Mine is the discovery site of a bright white mineral called temagamite.Temagamite: Temagamite mineral information and data. Retrieved on 2007-08-30 It was discovered in 1973.
