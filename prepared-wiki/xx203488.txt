==History==

Linkwater started as a milling town in 1861 due to a stand of kahikatea in the area and its proximity to the Marlborough Sounds. When gold was discovered in 1864 at Hall's Creek, the town expanded with three hotels opening. The gold rush resulted in the foundation of Cullensville a few km to the south of Linkwater. Cullensville remains as a ghost town,[tpl]cite book|title=Click - A Captured Moment - Marlborough's Early Heritage|author=Marlborough Historical Society|year=2005|isbn=0-473-10475-X|pages=68, 94, 201|publisher=Marlborough Historical Society|location=Blenheim[/tpl] although the gold was gone by 1867. The last mill closed in the early 1870s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marlboroughonline.co.nz/index.mvc?ArticleID=34|title=Linkwater|publisher=Marlborough Online[/tpl]
Dairy farming became the mainstay of the area. The Linkwater Co-operative Dairy Factory was established in 1911, and produced milk, cream and cheese until 1953. Dairy farming is still a major component of the economy, but deer farming and forestry are also important.
