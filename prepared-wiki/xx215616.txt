2 is the second album by the Los Angeles band Darker My Love. Recorded primarily at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, with additional recording at Sage & Sound, The Boat, Sonora and Westbeach Recorders, it is the first with Will Canzoneri on organ and clavinet. It was released on 5 August 2008. The artwork for the album was by the lead guitarist/vocalist Tim Presley. Several of the songs on 2 had previously been performed live in a different arrangement under various working titles, appearing on the set of live albums that Darker My Love recorded during their Spaceland residency in 2006. The bass guitarist/vocalist Rob Barbato reportedly compulsively consumed two tablespoons of apple sauce between vocal takes on the song "Two Ways Out".[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
