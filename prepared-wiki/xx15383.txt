==Early years==

Hildegard Knef was born in Ulm.  She began studying acting at the age of 14, in 1940. She appeared in several films before the fall of the Third Reich, but most were released only afterward.
She left school when she was 17 to become an apprentice animator with Universum Film AG. After she had a successful screen test, she went to the State Film School at Babelsberg, Berlin, where she studied acting, ballet and elocution. Josef Goebbels, who was Hitler's propaganda minister, wrote to her and ask to meet her, but Knef's friends wanted her to stay away from him.  
During the Battle of Berlin, Knef dressed as a soldier in order to stay with her lover Ewald von Demandowsky, and joined him in the defence of Schmargendorf.Beevor, A (2003) Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Penguin Books, P311 The Soviets captured her and sent her to a prison camp.http://www.hildegardknef.de/1-Hilde%20englisch/Chronology%201925-49.htm Hildegard Knef fan website.

David O. Selznick invited her to Hollywood, but she refused to agree to the conditions of the contract which reportedly included changing her name to Gilda Christian and pretending to be Austrian rather than German.http://www.hildegardknef.de/Chronologie%20des%20Lebens%20von%20Hildegard%20Knef%201925-49.htm
Years later, Knef's first husband, an American named Kurt Hirsch, encouraged her to try again for success in the U.S. She changed her name from Knef to Neff. But she was only offered a supporting role in the Hemingway adaptation of The Snows of Kilimanjaro in 1952. Knef became a leading lady in films of Germany, France and Britain.  But finally, in 1955 Knef was offered an important role in America in the musical Silk Stockings by Cole Porter. Knef had acted in at least 30 films in the United States and Europe, but her triumph was in New York when she performed in that film. She performed an unemotional Soviet commissar called "Ninotchka" . The New York Times' drama critic, Brooks Atkinson qualified Cole Porter's film as one of his best films and considered that Knef's stage transformation as a corrupted commissar was a very masterful performance.  Knef played the role of "Ninotchka" from 1954 to 1956. She sang Cole Porter tunes in her 675 performances.

The song she is mostly remembered for is "Für mich soll's rote Rosen regnen" ("Red roses are to rain for me"). She is also known for her version of the song "Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin" ("I still have a suitcase in Berlin") and "Mackie Messer" ("Mack the knife").English lyrics for Mackie Messer by Hildegard Knef She sold more than three million records in total.

==Publications==

She published several books. Her autobiography Der geschenkte Gaul - Bericht aus einem Leben (The Gift Horse - Report on a Life, 1970) was a candid recount of her life in Germany during and after World War II, and reportedly became the best-selling German book in the post-war years. Her second book Das Urteil (The Verdict, 1975) was a moderate success, and dealt with her struggle with breast cancer. Knef not only achieved international best- seller status, her books also received incredible amount of praises from critics because her autobiographies were "better-than-average celebrity's." Arthur Cooper of Newsweek claimed that the way in which Knef accounted in The Gift Horse: Report on a Life her childhood and difficult life being an actress and singer while Hitler's Berlin and after the war in Europe and America,  was "a bitterly honest book and a very good one."   The book is not considered a book of "Hollywood-Broadway gossip. The book doesn't try to persuade the public depicting a made up celebrity's adventures. It seems a book that tells the real life of Knef. It refers to her struggles as a German woman who grew up in Berlin under the Nazis.
