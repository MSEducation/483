CATEGORIES: Liverpool docks

George's Dock was a dock, on the River Mersey, England, within the Port of Liverpool. It was connected to Canning Dock to the south and George's Basin to the north.
The dock, which opened in 1771, was designed and built by Henry Berry and expanded by John Foster, Sr..
In 1899 the dock and the adjoining George's Basin were filled in to create what is now the Pier Head,[tpl]citation|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html#geo|title=Trading Places: A History of Liverpool Docks|publisher=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl] to provide one central place for Liverpool Docks' offices, which before were scattered across different sites. A section of the original George's Dock wall is still visible in the basement of the Cunard Building which stands on the site.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.cunardbuilding.com/ext_cunard_building/the_building/building_history |title=Cunard Building: History|publisher=CB Richard Ellis|accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl]
