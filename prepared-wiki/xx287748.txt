==Early life and education==

Khachigian was born in Beirut to Armenian parents who were evangelical Protestant missionaries,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sci.am/members.php?mid=459&langid=1 |title=Levon M. Khachigian |publisher=National Academy of Sciences of Armenia[/tpl] He was raised in Naremburn, New South Wales, Australia[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/heart-disease/to-crack-the-maze/2006/04/26/1145861416396.html|title=To crack the maze - Heart Disease - Health in Focus|first=Jamie|last=Pandaram|date=27 April 2006|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl] and attended Naremburn Public School and Crows Nest Boys' High School.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aips.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Artery-Health.pdf |title=Levon Khachigian, PhD |publisher=Australian Institute of Policy & Science[/tpl]
Khachigian subsequently obtained a B.Sc. with first-class honours, a Ph.D., and a D.Sc. from the University of New South Wales.

==Career==

The Khachigian research group developed Dz13, a molecule that targets the master regulator c-Jun, which is implicated in numerous diseases.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asianscientist.com/health-medicine/drug-dz13-targets-skin-cancer-2013/ |title=Dz13 Drug Targets Skin Cancer in Clinical Trial |date=13 May 2013 |publisher=Asian Scientist[/tpl] This development was published in The Lancet.

==Honours==

Khachigian has served as a President of the Australian Society for Medical Research and of the Australian Vascular Biology Society. He has also been a member of the editorial boards of 12 journals, including American Journal of Pathology and Endothelium. Khachigian has been awarded an Australia Fellowship by the National Health and Medical Research Council, a Commonwealth Health Minister's Award for Excellence in Health and Medical Research, a GlaxoSmithKline Australia Award for Research Excellence, a Gottschalk Award from the Australian Academy of Science, a Eureka Prize for Scientific Research, and a Eureka Prize for Medical Research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/14/1060588496911.html |title=Gene result a touch of shear brilliance |first=Deborah |last=Smith |date=14 August 2003 |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===2009===

In 2009, Khachigian's lab retracted three papers[tpl]cite web |url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/aussie-university-halts-trials-of-skin-cancer-drug-whose-developer-has-four-retractions/ |title=Aussie university halts trials of skin cancer drug whose developer has four retractions |publisher=Retraction Watch |date=12 August 2013 |first=Adam|last=Marcus[/tpl] after David Vaux (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute) raised concerns that they contained images that Vaux "believed were untrustworthy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/cancer-drug-trial-suspended-as-misconduct-allegations-fly-20130813-2rthb.html |title=Cancer drug trial suspended as misconduct allegations fly |first=Amy |last=Corderoy |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=13 August 2013[/tpl] An independent investigation found no evidence of misconduct.
A former scientist in Khachigian's research group Ying Morgan raised concerns with the university. The university appointed an independent panel to investigate these concerns and "there were no findings of research misconduct."

===2013===

In July 2013, a Dz13 trial was suspended. In an official statement, the University of New South Wales claimed that the more recent allegations are novel, that at each of Khachigian's clinical trials, Kachigian's work has been approved by ethics committees, and that, at each stage, funding bodies have been advised as necessary.[tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/general/unsw-response-abc-730-story |title=UNSW response to ABC 730 story |publisher=UNSW |date=12 August 2013[/tpl]
Furthermore, Khachigian, released a statement and reply to questions posed to him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/201308/r1157035_14557155.pdf |title=The statement from Professor Khachigian |first=Levon |last=Kachigian |date=11 August 2013[/tpl] In it, he asserted that, as the matter was under investigation, he could not comment; however, Khachigian maintained that the data is as is and not manipulated and that the allegations were unsubstantiated.
