[[Cernunnos]]

CATEGORIES: Gaulish gods, Hunting gods, Nature gods, Animal gods, Horned deities

Cernunnos is the conventional name given in Celtic studies to depictions of the "horned god" of Celtic polytheism. The name itself is only attested once, on the 1st-century Pillar of the Boatmen, but depictions of a horned or antlered figure, often seated cross-legged and often associated with animals and holding or wearing torcs, are known from other instances.
Nothing is known about the god from literary sources, and details about his name, his cult or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown. Speculative interpretations identify him as a god of nature or fertility.[tpl]cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8 |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge[/tpl]

==Name==

The theonym Cernunnos  appears on the Pillar of the Boatmen, a Gallo-Roman monument dating to the early 1st century CE, to label a god depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.A. Kingsley Porter, "A Sculpture at Tandragee," Burlington Magazine 65 (1934), p. 227, pointing out the relative maturation of the antlers. Both antlers have torcs hanging from them.
The name has been compared to a divine epithet Carnonos in a Celtic inscription written in Greek characters at Montagnac, Hérault (as καρνονου, karnonou, in the dative case).Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107.
A Gallo-Latin adjective carnuātus, "horned," is also found.Equivalent to Latin cornutus, "horned"; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, Revue Celtique 42 (1925) 221–222.
The Proto-Celtic form of the theonym is reconstructed as either *Cerno-on-os[tpl]dubious|date=October 2010[/tpl] or *Carno-on-os. The augmentative -on- is characteristic of theonyms, as in Maponos, Epona, Matronae, and Sirona.Delamarre, citing M. Lejeune, Lepontica (Paris 1971), p. 325.
Maier (2010) states that the etymology of Cernunnos is unknown, as the Celtic word for "horn" has an a (as in Carnonos).Bernard Maier, Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture (Alfred Kröner, 1994; Boydell, 2000), p. 69 online.
Gaulish karnon "horn" is  cognate with Latin cornu and Germanic *hurnaz, English horn, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European [tpl]PIE|*k̑r̥no-[/tpl].Pokorny (1959) "k̑er-, k̑erə-; k̑rā-, k̑erei-, k̑ereu"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0929.html
The etymon karn- "horn" appears in both Gaulish and Galatian branches of Continental Celtic. Hesychius of Alexandria glosses the Galatian word karnon (κάρνον) as "Gallic trumpet", that is, the Celtic military horn listed as the carnyx (κάρνυξ) by Eustathius of Thessalonica, who notes the instrument's animal-shaped bell.Delamarre; Greek text and English translation of the passage from Eustathius' Homeric commentaries given by Edward Wigan, "Account of a Collection of Roman Gold Coins," Numismatic Chronicle 5 (1865), p. 11 online. The root also appears in the names of Celtic polities, most prominent among them the Carnutes, meaning something like "the Horned Ones,"Also Carni and Carnonacae. and in several  personal names found in inscriptions.Such as Carnarus, Carnatus, Carneolus, Carnius and Carnicus; Altay Coşkun with Jürgen Zeidler, "'Cover Names' and Nomenclature in Late Roman Gaul: The Evidence of the Bordelaise Poet Ausonius" (2003), p. 33.

==Epigraphic evidence==

The name Cernunnos occurs only on the "Pillar of the Boatmen" (Pilier des nautes),Koch, Celtic Culture, p. 396 online. now displayed in the Musée National du Moyen Age in Paris. Constructed by Gaulish sailors probably in 14 CE,Based on the inscription (CIL XIII. 03026), on the accession of the emperor Tiberius. it was discovered in 1710 within the foundations of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, site of ancient Lutetia, the civitas capital of the Celtic Parisii. The distinctive stone pillar is an important monument of Gallo-Roman religion. Its low reliefs depict and label by name several Roman deities such as Jupiter, Vulcan, and Castor and Pollux, along with Gallic deities such as Esus, Smertrios, and Tarvos Trigaranus. The name Cernunnos can be read clearly on 18th century drawings of the inscriptions, but the initial letter has been obscured since, so that today only  a reading _ernunnos can be verified[ref]Phyllis Fray Bober, Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity,
American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 55, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 13-51

Additional evidence is given by one inscription on a metal plaque from Steinsel-Rëlent in Luxembourg, in the territory of the Celtic Treveri. This inscriptionAE 1987, 0772 = AE 1989, 00542. read Deo Ceruninco, "to the God Cerunincos", assumed to be the same deity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] The Gaulish inscription from MontagnacRIG 1, number G-224. reads αλλετειυος καρνονου αλισοντεας (alleteiuos karnonou alisonteas), with the last word possibly a place name based on alisia, "service-tree" or "rock" (compare Alesia, Gaulish Alisiia).Delamarre, Dictionnaire pp. 38–39. See also Pierre-Yves Lambert, La langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 53 and 58.

==Iconography==

The god labelled Cernunnos on the Pillar of the Boatmen is  depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth. Both antlers have torcs hanging from them. The lower part of the relief is lost, but the dimensions suggest that the god was sitting cross-legged, providing a direct parallel to the antlered figure on the Gundestrup cauldron.
In spite of the name Cernunnos being attested nowhere else, it is commonly used in Celtological literature as describing all comparable depictions of horned/antlered deities.
This "Cernunnos" type in Celtic iconography is often portrayed with animals, in particular the stag, and also frequently associated with the ram-horned serpent, and less frequently bulls (at Rheims), dogs and rats. Because of his frequent association with creatures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the "Lord of the Animals" or the "Lord of Wild Things", and Miranda Green describes him as a "peaceful god of nature and fruitfulness".Green, Miranda (1992) Animals in Celtic Life and Myth, p. 228.
The Pilier des nautes links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Rheims (Marne, Champagne, France)—in antiquity, Durocortorum, the civitas capital of the Remi tribe—and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the Treveri. The god may have symbolised the fecundity of the stag-inhabited forest.
Other examples of "Cernunnos" images include a petroglyph in Val Camonica in Cisalpine Gaul. The antlered human figure has been dated as early as the 7th century BCE or as late as the 4th.Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221, especially note 103. An antlered child appears on a relief from Vendeuvres, flanked by serpents and holding a purse and a torc.Anne Ross, "Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion," Speculum 34 (1959), p. 42. The best known image appears on the Gundestrup cauldron found on Jutland, dating to the 1st century BC, thought to depict Celtic subject matter though usually regarded as of Thracian workmanship.
Among the Celtiberians, horned or antlered figures of the Cernunnos type include a "Janus-like" god from Candelario (Salamanca) with two faces and two small horns; a horned god from the hills of Ríotinto (Huelva); and a possible representation of the deity Vestius Aloniecus near his altars in Lourizán (Pontevedra). The horns are taken to represent "aggressive power, genetic vigor and fecundity."Francisco Marco Simón, "Religion and Religious Practices of the Ancient Celts of the Iberian Peninsula," e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies 6 (2005), p. 310.
Divine representations of the Cernunnos type are exceptions to the often-expressed view that the Celts only began to picture their gods in human form after the Roman conquest of Gaul.Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221.
The Celtic "horned god", while well attested in iconography, cannot be identified in description of Celtic religion in Roman ethnography and does not appear to have been given any interpretatio romana, perhaps due to being too distinctive to be translatable into the Roman pantheon.Jane Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," American Journal of Archaeology 105 (2001), p. 222; distinctiveness of Cernunnos also in William Van Andringa, "Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language," in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 87–88.
While Cernunnos was never assimilated, scholars have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine figures such as Mercury,David M. Robinson and Elizabeth Pierce Belgen, "Archaeological Notes and Discussions," American Journal of Archaeology 41 (1937), p. 132. Actaeon, specialized forms of Jupiter, and Dis Pater, the latter of whom Julius Caesar said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.Phyllis Fray Bober, “Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity,” American Journal of Archaeology 55 (1951), p. 15ff.

==Possible reflexes in Insular Celtic==

There have been attempts to find the cern root in the name of Conall Cernach, the foster brother of the Irish hero CuchulainnPorter, "A Sculpture at Tandragee," p. 227. in the Ulster Cycle. In this line of interpretation, Cernach is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field — "angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth" — and Conall is seen as "the same figure" as the ancient Cernunnos.John Koch, entry on "Cernunnos," Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 396.

==Possible connection to Saint Ciarán==

Some see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the life of Saint Ciarán of Saighir, one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.  When he was building his first tiny cell, as his hagiograph goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God.  This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.[tpl]cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0-600-00647-6| pages = 47–8[/tpl]

==Neopaganism==

In Wicca and other forms of Neopaganism a Horned God is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos. The Horned God reflects the seasons of the year in an annual cycle of life, death and rebirth.Farrar, Stewart & Janet, Eight Sabbats for Witches
In the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca, the Horned God is sometimes specifically referred to as Cernunnos, or sometimes also as Kernunno.The Rebirth of Witchcraft, Doreen Valiente, page 52-53
