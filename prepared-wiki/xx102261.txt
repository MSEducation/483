The KPXM Tower (formerly KXLI Tower) is the tallest structure in Minnesota, a guyed aerial mast rising 1505 feet (458.72 meters).  It transmits the signal for KPXM channel 41 (40 digital), which is an ION Television network affiliate licensed to serve St. Cloud, Minnesota.  Radio station KLCI in Elk River, Minnesota also transmits from the KPXM tower. However, the tower is located about halfway between St. Cloud and the core of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, near the city of Big Lake.  Geographical coordinates for the tower are [tpl]coord|45|23|00|N|93|42|31|W|[/tpl].
The tower was completed in 1997 and is property of Paxson Minneapolis (now a division of ION Media Networks, the owner of the ION Television network).  KXLI was the call sign of channel 41 when the tower was built.  It surpassed the height of the KMSP Tower, completed in 1971.
The tallest non-guyed structures in the state are the IDS Tower (792 ft/241.4 m or 910 ft/277.3 m with rooftop antennas) and the Capella Tower (776 ft/236.5 m) in Minneapolis.
