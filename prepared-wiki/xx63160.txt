</ref> TWiki has also been used to create collaborative internet sites, such as the [[City of Melbourne]]'s ''FutureMelbourne'' wiki where citizens can collaborate on the future plan.<ref>[http://futuremelbourne.com.au Future of Melbourne City Plan]</ref>

==Realization==

TWiki is implemented in Perl. Wiki pages are stored in plain text files. Everything, including meta such as access control settings, are version controlled using RCS. RCS is optional since an all-Perl version control system is provided.
TWiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data. Many corporate TWiki installations have several hundred thousand pages and tens of thousands of users. Load balancing and caching can be used to improve performance on high traffic sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiScalability |title=TWiki Scalability |publisher=Twiki.org |accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl]
TWiki has database features built into the engine. A TWiki Form is attached to a page as meta data. This represents a database record. A set of pages that share the same type of form build a database table. A formatted search{{cite web|url=http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/FormattedSearch |title=FormattedSearch
