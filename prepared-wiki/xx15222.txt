The RQ-7 Shadow unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used by the United States Army, Marine Corps, Australian Army and Swedish Army for reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition and battle damage assessment. Launched from a trailer-mounted pneumatic catapult, it is recovered with the aid of arresting gear similar to jets on an aircraft carrier. Its gimbal-mounted, digitally stabilized, liquid nitrogen-cooled  electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera relays video in real time via a C-band line-of-sight data link to the ground control station (GCS).
In the US, the Army's 2nd Battalion, 13th Aviation Regiment at Fort Huachuca, AZ, trains soldiers, Marines, and civilians in the operation and maintenance of the Shadow UAV. The training program is mainly undertaken by civilian instructors.

==Design==

The RQ-7 Shadow 200 unmanned aerial vehicle is of a high-wing, constant chord pusher configuration with a twin-tailboom empennage and an inverted v-tail elerudder. The aircraft is powered by a [tpl]convert|38|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] AR741-1101 Wankel engine designed and manufactured by UAV Engines Ltd in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uavenginesltd.co.uk/products/ar741-38-bhp/|publisher=UAV Engines Ltd.|title=AR741 - 38 BHP Engine for surveillance uavs|accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl]US Army Technical Manual 9-5895-YYY-10 Shadow 200 TUAV System, 22 October 2004. Onboard electrical systems are powered by a GEC/Plessey 28 volt, direct current, 2,000 watt generator. Currently, the primary payload for the aircraft is the Israeli Aircraft Industries POP300 Plug-in Optical Payload which consists of a forward-looking Infrared camera, a daytime TV camera with a selectable near-infrared filter and a laser pointer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iai.co.il/2013/35720-16661-en/IAI.aspx|title=Pop Family|publisher=Israeli Aircraft Industries|accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl] The aircraft has fixed tricycle landing gear. Takeoffs are assisted by a trailer-mounted pneumatic launcher which can accelerate the 375 pound aircraft to [tpl]convert|70|kn|km/h[/tpl] in [tpl]convert|50|ft|m[/tpl]. Landings are guided by a Tactical Automatic Landing System, developed by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, which consists of a ground-based micro-millimeter wavelength radar and a transponder carried on the aircraft.Sierra Nevada Corporation Web Site Once on the ground, a tailhook mounted on the aircraft catches an arresting wire connected to two disk brake drums which can stop the aircraft in less than [tpl]convert|170|ft|m[/tpl].
The aircraft is part of a larger system which currently uses the M1152-series of Humvees for ground transport of all ground and air equipment. A Shadow 200 system consists of four aircraft, three of which are transported in the Air Vehicle Transporter (AVT). The fourth is transported in a specially designed storage container to be used as a spare. The AVT also tows the launcher. The AVT Support Vehicle and trailer contain extra equipment to launch and recover the aircraft, such as the Tactical Automatic Landing System. Maintenance equipment for the aircraft is stored in the Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) vehicle and trailer as well as the M1165 MSM Support Vehicle and its associated trailer. 
Two Humvee-mounted Ground Control Stations (GCS), also part of the Shadow 200 system, control the aircraft in flight. Each station has an associated Ground Data Terminal (GDT), which takes commands generated by the GCS and modulates them into radio waves received by the aircraft in flight. The GDT receives video imagery from the payload, as well as telemetry from the aircraft, and sends this information to the GCS. A trailer, towed by the M1165 GCS support vehicle, carries the GDT and houses a 10 kW Tactical Quiet Generator to provide power for its associated GCS. The Shadow 200 system also includes a Portable Ground Control Station (PGCS) and Portable Ground Data Terminal (PGDT), which are stripped-down versions of the GCS and GDT designed as a backup to the two GCSs.
A fielded Shadow 200 system requires 22 soldiers to operate it. Army modelling indicates that crew workload is highest at takeoff, and second-highest at landing.Hunn & Heuckeroth.

==Development==

The RQ-7 Shadow is the result of a continued US Army search for an effective battlefield UAV after the cancellation of the RQ-6 Outrider aircraft. AAI Corporation followed up their RQ-2 Pioneer with the Shadow 200, a similar, more refined UAV. In late 1999, the army selected the Shadow 200 to fill the tactical UAV requirement, redesignating it the RQ-7. Army requirements specified a UAV that used a gasoline engine, could carry an electro-optic/infrared imaging sensor turret, and had a minimum range of 31 miles (50 kilometers) with four-hour, on-station endurance. The Shadow 200 offered at least twice that range, powered by a [tpl]convert|38|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] rotary engine. The specifications also dictated that UAV would be able to land in an athletic field.Goebel, Greg.

==Operational history==

By July 2007, the Shadow platform accumulated 200,000 flight hours, doubling its previous record of 100,000 hours in 13 months.[tpl]cite web|last=Child|first=Jeff|title=Small UAVs Step Up to Advanced Comms Capabilities|url=http://www.cotsjournalonline.com/articles/view/101130|publisher=COTS Journal|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Miller|first=Mollie|title=Cutting edge UAS technology launches at Fort Rucker|url=http://www-tradoc.army.mil/pao/TNSarchives/September%2007/092407-3.html|work=Army Flier|publisher=US Army TRADOC|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] The system then surpassed 300,000 flight hours in April 2008,[tpl]cite web|title=AAI Shadow 200 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=326|work=Military Aircraft|publisher=Military Factory|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] and by May 2010, the Shadow system had accumulated over 500,000 flight hours. As of 2011, the Shadow had logged over 709,000 hours. The Shadow platform has flown over 37,000 sorties in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by US Army and Army National Guard units. On 6 August 2012, AAI announced that the Shadow had achieved 750,000 flight hours during more than 173,000 missions.Shadow achieves 750,000 hours - AAICorp.com, 6 August 2012
Shadow did not see service in the Afghanistan campaign of 2001–2002, but it did fly operational missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operating conditions in Iraq proved hard on the UAVs, with heat and sand leading to engine failures[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl], resulting in a high-priority effort to find fixes with changes in system technology and operating procedures.

The Navy provided personnel for four Shadow platoons in support of army brigades deployed in Iraq. The first two platoons returned from 6-month tours in Iraq in January and February 2008. The Navy personnel went through the Army's training program at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.DC Military: A month later, VC-6 unit’s homecoming just as sweet
The U.S. Army is considering a plan to reform its aerial scout capabilities by scrapping its fleet of OH-58 Kiowa helicopters from 2015-2019 and replacing them with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters teamed with Shadow and MQ-1C Grey Eagle UAVs. Using unmanned assets to scout ahead would put the pilots of manned aircraft out of reach of potential harm. Reformed combat aviation brigades (CAB) would consist of a battalion of 24 Apaches for attack missions and an armed reconnaissance squadron of another 24 Apaches teamed with three Shadow platoons totaling 12 RQ-7s overall. It would also include a Grey Eagle company. The manned-unmanned teaming of Apaches and UAVs can meet 80 percent of aerial scout requirements. The plan may be in jeopardy due to lack of funding for enhancements to the Shadow system. Budget cuts have reduced research and development funding for software modifications to interface the Shadow with the Apache. Upgrades needed include a datalink, which would allow the aircraft to work with high-definition cameras and other electronic systems, and the One System Remote Video Transceiver for soldiers to view video from multiple systems.Scout mission compromised by funding cut - Militarytimes.com, 1 February 2014

===RQ-7 in civilian airspace===

The Shadow system has also received a special airworthiness certificate (experimental) from the Federal Aviation Administration authorizing operations at Benson Municipal Airport, a general aviation facility in southeastern Arizona. This airworthiness certificate is the first issued by the FAA permitting an unmanned aircraft to operate at a public-use airport that serves general aviation, and the first FAA certificate covering the system's technologically sophisticated automated landing system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] This is currently the only FAA certification category available to UAS manufacturers.

==Variants==

===RQ-7A Shadow===

The RQ-7A was the initial version of the Shadow 200 UAV developed by AAI. The first low-rate initial-production systems were delivered to the US Army in 2002 with the first full-scale production systems being delivered in September 2003.  The RQ-7A was [tpl]convert|11|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] long and had a wingspan of [tpl]convert|12|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on[/tpl] with a [tpl]convert|327|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] max takeoff weight.  The aircraft's endurance ranged between 4 to 5.5 hours depending on mission. The "A" model aircraft also had the AR741-1100 engine which could use either 87 octane automotive gasoline or 100LL aviation fuel.  The "A" model also featured IAI's POP200 payload.

===RQ-7B Shadow===

Production of Shadow aircraft shifted to a generally improved RQ-7B variant in the summer of 2004. The RQ-7B features new wings increased in length to [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The new wings are not only more aerodynamically efficient, they are "wet" to increase fuel storage up to 44 liters for an endurance of up to 6 hours. The payload capability has been increased to [tpl]convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=off[/tpl]. After reports from Iraq that engines were failing, in 2005, the Army's UAV project manager called for the use of 100LL, an aviation fuel, rather than the conventional 87 octane mogas. Avionics systems have been generally improved, and the new wing is designed to accommodate a communications relay package, which allows the aircraft to act as a relay station. This allows commanders or even the aircraft operators themselves to communicate via radio to the troops on ground in locations that would otherwise be "dead" to radio traffic.
Other incremental improvements to the system include replacing the AR741-1100 engine with the AR741-1101 which increases reliability through the use of dual spark plugs as well as limiting the fuel to 100LL. Also, the older POP200 payload was replaced with the newer POP300 system.
In February 2010, AAI began a fleet update program to improve the Shadow system. The improvements include installing the wiring harnesses and software updates for IAI's POP300D payload which includes a designator for guiding laser-guided bombs. Other improvements in the program will include an electronic fuel injection engine and fuel system to replace the AR741-1101's carburetored engine. The most visible improvement to the system will be a wider wing of [tpl]convert|20|ft|m[/tpl] in span which is designed to increase fuel capacity and allow for mission endurance of almost 9 hours. The new wings will also include hardpoints for external munitions."AAI’s Shadow Unmanned Aircraft takes flight with new extended wing design" Unmanned Vehicles Magazine Online, 19 April 2010.

==Incidents and accidents==

On 15 August 2011 a US Air Force C-130 cargo plane collided with a RQ-7 while on approach to FOB Sharana in Paktika Province, Afghanistan. The C-130 made an emergency landing with damage to two engines and one wing, while the RQ-7 was destroyed completely.Hodge, Nathan, "U.S. Says Drone, Cargo Plane Collide Over Afghanistan", Wall Street Journal, 17 August 2011, p. 11. The collision caused the cargo aircraft to be grounded for several months while being fixed, while the RQ-7 wreckage was never recovered. Early reports indicating that the mishap occurred when the C-130 took off without clearance were incorrect. The investigating board determined that the mishap was largely due to poor local air traffic control training and supervision.
On 3 April 2014 a Pennsylvania National Guard RQ-7 participating in training exercises at Fort Indiantown Gap crashed near an elementary school in Pennsylvania and was then hit by a civilian vehicle destroying the drone. No injuries were reported.http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2014/04/04/Drone-Crashes-Near-Elementary-Schoolhttp://www.abc27.com/story/25157287/military-drone-crashes-in-lebanon-county
