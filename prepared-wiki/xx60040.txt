Antivirus, anti-virus, or AV software is computer software used to prevent, detect and remove malicious  computer viruses. Most software described as antivirus also works against other types of malware, such as malicious Browser Helper Objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraudtools, adware and spyware.lifehacker: The Difference Between Antivirus and Anti-Malware (and Which to Use) Computer security, including protection from social engineering techniques, is commonly offered in products and services of antivirus software companies.[tpl]cite web|title=What is antivirus software?|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/antivirus-whatis.aspx|publisher=Microsoft[/tpl]  This page discusses the software used for the prevention, detection, and removal of malware threats, rather than computer security implemented by software methods.
A variety of strategies are typically employed. Signature-based detection involves searching for known patterns of data within executable code. However, it is possible for a computer to be infected with new malware for which no signature is yet known; and malware is often modified to change its signature without affecting functionality. To counter such so-called zero-day threats, heuristics can be used. One type of heuristic approach, generic signatures, can identify variants by looking for slight variations of known malicious code in files. Some antivirus software can also predict what a file will do by running it in a sandbox and analyzing what it does to see if it performs any actions which could be malicious.
Antivirus software has some drawbacks. It can impair a computer's performance.[tpl]cite web|title=How Antivirus Software Can Slow Down Your Computer|url=http://www.support.com/blog/post/how-antivirus-software-can-slow-down-your-computer|publisher=Support.com Blog|accessdate=2010-07-26[/tpl] Inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer, considering themselves to be totally protected, and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that antivirus software presents them with. An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious (false positive).[tpl]cite web | title=Softpedia Exclusive Interview: Avira 10 | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Avira-s-New-Anti-Malware-Fleet-139829.shtml| work=Ionut Ilascu | publisher=Softpedia | date=14 April 2010  | accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl] Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system to allow it access to all potential malicious process and files, creating a potential avenue of attack.[tpl]cite web | title=Norton AntiVirus ignores malicious WMI instructions | url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Norton-AntiVirus-ignores-malicious-WMI-instructions/0,130061744,139163678,00.htm | work=Munir Kotadia | publisher=CBS Interactive | date=21 October 2004  | accessdate=2009-04-05[/tpl]

==History==

Most of the computer viruses written in the early and mid-1980s were limited to self-reproduction and had no specific damage routine built into the code.History of viruses That changed when more and more programmers became acquainted with virus programming and created viruses that manipulated or even destroyed data on infected computers.
There are competing claims for the innovator of the first antivirus product. Possibly the first publicly documented removal of a computer virus in the wild was performed by Bernd Fix in 1987.Kaspersky Lab Virus list[ref]
