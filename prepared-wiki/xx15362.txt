CATEGORIES: Dorset, Non-metropolitan counties

Dorset [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔr|s|ɨ|t[/tpl] (or archaically, Dorsetshire), is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authorities of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of [tpl]convert|2653|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl], Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is situated in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.
The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era. The Romans conquered Dorset's indigenous Celtic tribe, and during the early Middle Ages, the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century. The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the 8th century and the black death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348. Dorset has seen much civil unrest: during the English Civil War an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Cromwell's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury; the Duke of Monmouth's doomed rebellion began at Lyme Regis; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement. During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points on D-Day.
Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and three-quarters of its coastline is a World Heritage Site that features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland and an international airport. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to one of Europe's largest outdoor shows. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.

==Toponymy==

Dorset derives its name from the county town of Dorchester.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|first=A.D.|last=Mills|accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] The Romans established the settlement in the 1st century and named it Durnovaria which was a Latinised version of a Common Brittonic word possibly meaning "place with fist-sized pebbles". The Saxons named the town Dornwaraceaster (the suffix "ceaster" being the Old English name for a Roman town) and Dornsæte came into use as the name for the inhabitants of the area from "Dorn"—a reduced form of Dornwaraceaster—and the Old English word "sæte" meaning people.Yorke (p.84) It is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in AD 845 and in the 10th century the county's archaic name, "Dorseteschyre" (Dorsetshire), was first recorded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetcountymuseum.org/dorsetcountyboundarysurvey|title=Dorset County Boundary Survey|publisher=Dorset County Museum|year=2010|accessdate=15 May 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67nlyla39|archivedate=20 May 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal rule was established in Dorset and the bulk of the land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions.Cullingford (pp.37–38) The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester in the early part of the 12th century.Cullingford (p.43) Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required.Cullingford (p.52) The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county.Cullingford (pp.52–54) However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony.Cullingford (pp.54–55) The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country.Cullingford (pp.55–56)Hilliam (p.17)
The dissolution of the monasteries (1536–1541) met little resistance in Dorset and many of the county's abbeys, including Shaftesbury, Cerne and Milton, were sold to private owners.Cullingford (pp.59–60) In 1642, at the commencement of the English Civil War, the Royalists took control of the entire county apart from Poole and Lyme Regis. However, within three years their gains had been almost entirely reversed by the Parliamentarians.Cullingford (pp.68–69) An uprising of Clubmen—vigilantes weary of the depredations of the war—took place in Dorset in 1645. Some 2,000 of these rebels offered battle to Lord Fairfax's Parliamentary army at Hambledon Hill but they were easily routed.Cullingford (pp.70–71)Hilliam (pp.144–145) Sherborne Castle was taken by Fairfax that same year and in 1646 Corfe Castle, the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Dorset, was captured after an act of betrayal: both were subsequently slighted.Yarrow (p.26) The Duke of Monmouth's unsuccessful attempt to overthrow James II began when he landed at Lyme Regis in 1665.Cullingford (p.75) A series of trials known as the Bloody Assizes took place to punish the rebels. Over a five-day period in Dorchester, Judge Jeffreys presided over 312 cases: 74 of the accused were executed, 175 were transported, and nine were publicly whipped.Cullingford (p.78) In 1686, at Charborough Park, a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England. This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution.Cullingford (p.80)
During the 18th century, much smuggling took place along the Dorset coast; its coves, caves and sandy beaches provided opportunities for gangs such as the Hawkhursts to stealthily bring smuggled goods ashore.Cullingford (p.99) Poole became Dorset's busiest port and established prosperous trade links with the fisheries of Newfoundland which supported cloth, rope and net manufacturing industries in the surrounding towns and villages.Cullingford (p.92) However, the industrial revolution largely bypassed Dorset which lacked coal resources and as a consequence the county remained predominantly agricultural.Cullingford (p.105)Draper (p.143) Farming has always been central to the economy of Dorset and the county became the birthplace of the modern trade union movement when, in 1834, six farm labourers formed a union to protest against falling wages. The labourers, who are now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were subsequently arrested for administering "unlawful oaths" and sentenced to transportation but they were pardoned following massive protests by the working classes.Hilliam (p.10)Cullingford (pp.114–116)

==Physical geography==

Dorset covers an area of [tpl]convert|2653|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] and contains considerable variety in its underlying geology, which is partly responsible for the diversity of landscape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=154835&filetype=pdf|title=Dorset Data Book|format=PDF|page=8|year=2010|work=Dorset For You|publisher=Dorset County Council|accessdate=7 February 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65bbTFzDy|archivedate=21 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]Draper (p.136)Chaffey (p.5) A large percentage (66%) of the county comprises either chalk, clay or mixed sand and gravels.

Dorset has a number of limestone ridges which are mostly covered in either arable fields or calcareous grassland supporting sheep.Cullingford (p.91) These limestone areas include a wide band of Cretaceous chalk which crosses the county as a range of hills from north-east to south-west, incorporating Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, and a narrow band running from south-west to south-east, incorporating the Purbeck Hills.Chaffey (p.43)Chaffey (p.11) Between the chalk hills are large, wide vales and wide flood plains.[tpl]cite web |url=http://maps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyviewer_google/googleviewer.html |title=Geology of Britain Viewer |publisher=British Geological Survey |accessdate=14 February 2011[/tpl] These vales are dotted with small villages, farms and coppices, and include the Blackmore Vale (Stour valley) and Frome valley.Chaffey (p.30) The Blackmore Vale is composed of older Jurassic deposits, largely clays interspersed with limestones, and has traditionally been a centre for dairy agriculture.Wightman (p.15) South-east Dorset, including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth, comprises younger Eocene deposits, mainly sands and clays of poor agricultural quality.Wightman (pp.22–25) The soils created from these deposits support a heathland habitat which sustains all six native British reptile species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/336264|title=Dorset's Heathland Reptiles|date=|work=Dorset For You|publisher=Dorset County Council|accessdate=8 April 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65c5nnPtZ|archivedate=21 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] Most of the Dorset heathland has Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) status with three areas designated as internationally important Ramsar sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/135_Dorset_Heaths_tcm6-32146.pdf|title=Dorset Heaths Key Facts & Data|date=|work=|format=PDF|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=22 July 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/69LZIbvsU|archivedate=22 July 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] In the far west of the county and along the coast there are frequent changes in rock strata, which appear in a less obviously sequential way compared to the landscapes of the chalk and the heath.Wightman (pp.10, 19) In the west this results in a hilly landscape of diverse character that resembles that of neighbouring county Devon.Wightman (p.10) Marshwood Vale, a valley of Lower Lias clay at the western tip of the county,Ensom (p.21) lies to the south of the two highest points in Dorset: Lewesdon Hill at [tpl]convert|279|m|ft[/tpl] and Pilsdon Pen at [tpl]convert|277|m|ft[/tpl].Chaffey (p.54)

Dorset's diverse geography ensures it has an assortment of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature.Wright (p.7) Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction.Wright (pp.6–7) The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil.Wright (pp.7–14) The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset towards the end of its journey at Christchurch Harbour.Wright (pp.16–17) The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.Wright (pp.6, 17)

===Climate===

Dorset's climate of warm summers and mild winters is partly due to its position on Britain's south coast. The third most southerly county in the UK, Dorset is less affected by the more intense Atlantic winds than Cornwall and Devon. Dorset, along with the entire south-west, has higher winter temperatures, average [tpl]convert|4.5|to|8.7|C|F[/tpl], than the rest of the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/16.gif | title = Mean Temperature Winter Average | publisher = Met Office | accessdate =14 August 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65eBXT7ZX|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] However, Dorset maintains higher summer temperatures than Devon and Cornwall, with average highs of [tpl]convert|19.1|to|22.2|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmax/14.gif | title = Maximum Temperature Summer Average | publisher = Met Office | accessdate =14 August 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65eBrp552|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] Excluding hills such as the Dorset Downs, the average annual temperature of the county is [tpl]convert|9.8|to|12|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif | title = Mean Temperature Annual Average | publisher = Met Office | accessdate =14 August 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65eCD6Fra|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Politics==

Local government in Dorset consists of a county council (Dorset County Council) and two unitary authorities (Bournemouth Borough Council and Poole Borough Council). Dorset County Council was created by the Local Government Act 1888 to govern the newly created administrative county of Dorset which was based largely on the historic county borders. Dorset became a two-tier non-metropolitan county after a reorganisation of local government in 1974 and its border was extended eastwards to incorporate the former Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch.[tpl]#tag:ref|Alterations to Dorset's boundary prior to 1974 have been comparatively minor. In 1844 Stockland was transferred to Devon in exchange for Thorncombe and Holwell was gained from Somerset. In 1896 the Somerset villages of Adber, Goathill, Poyntington, Sandford Orcas, Seaborough and Trent were added in exchange for Wambrook while Chardstock, Hawkchurch and Tytherleigh were ceded to Devon.Salmon (pp.9–10)Darby & Welldon Finn (pp.71–72)|group=Note[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/1991-and-earlier-censuses/census-bicentenary/area-monitors/regions/dorset/dorset-area-monitor.pdf|format=PDF|page=2|title=200 years of the Census in Dorset|publisher=Office for National Statistics|year=2001|accessdate=25 August 2009|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65XvT9TQO|archivedate=18 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, Bournemouth and Poole each became administratively independent single-tier unitary authorities in 1997, although they remain part of the county geographically and for ceremonial purposes. The county council is based in Dorchester and comprises six-second-tier districts: West Dorset, East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, Christchurch, and Weymouth and Portland. The council is controlled by the Conservative Party: at the 2013 local elections 27 Conservative, 12 Liberal Democrat, 5 Labour and 1 UKIP county councillors were elected.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/local-elections/5278896/Dorset-county-council-local-election-2009.html|title=Dorset county council local election 2009|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=9 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65iIlc4vO|archivedate=25 February 2012|deadurl=no|location=London[/tpl] Bournemouth is also Conservative-controlled: the council comprises 46 Conservative, three Liberal Democrat, three Labour and two independent councillors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/CouncilDemocracy/Councillors/CouncillorsandCommittees.aspx|title=Full list of councillors|publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council|year=2011|accessdate=9 June 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65iJ8XetY|archivedate=25 February 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] The Conservatives lost overall control of Poole at local elections in 2011 but subsequently formed a minority administration—the council comprises 21 Conservative councillors, 18 Liberal Democrat and three Poole People (a political party of Poole residents).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-13387838|title=Conservatives to run Poole as minority administration|publisher=BBC News|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]

The average GVA for the 16 regions of South West England was £4,693 million.
The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture.

Monastic foundations were once abundant in Dorset, but all ceased to exist at the Dissolution.Salmon (p.94) The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the 18th century.Draper (p.82)Newman & Pesvner (p.27) Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren.Newman & Pesvner (p.341) From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style.Newman & Pesvner (pp.30–31) A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation.Lehane (p.59) George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, it is one of the last examples of the Neo Byzantine style.Newman & Pesvner (p.334) The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.Lehane (pp.95–96)

==Education==

Responsibility for state schools in Dorset is divided between three local education authorities: Dorset County Council, which covers the majority of the county, and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities. Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school. Only Dorchester, Ferndown, Wimborne and Purbeck maintain a three-tier system (first, middle and high school),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=138961&filetype=pdf|format=PDF|title=School Pyramid List|page=1|year=2011|work=Dorset For You|publisher=Dorset County Council|accessdate=23 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6683stXXI|archivedate=13 March 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] although Purbeck is expected to switch to a two-tier system by 2013 because of an excess of unfilled places.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-11870023|title=Purbeck school system overhaul agreed|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=23 June 2011[/tpl] Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates a three-tier system but will switch to two tiers from September 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boroughofpoole.com/news/ref:N46BB286C33779/|title=Landmark Decision For Poole Schools|publisher=Borough of Poole|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=23 June 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080706170140/http://www.boroughofpoole.com/news/ref:N46BB286C33779/|archivedate=6 July 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education, each containing two single-sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven plus examination.

Dorset contains a range of privately funded independent schools. Many are boarding schools which also take day pupils, such as the co-educational Canford School which is based around a 19th-century Grade I listed manor house; St Mary's, a Catholic girls' school in Shaftesbury; and Sherborne School, a boys school founded in the 16th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sherborne.org/school/School_History|title=A short history of Sherborne School|publisher=Sherborne School|year=2011|accessdate=23 June 2011[/tpl]
