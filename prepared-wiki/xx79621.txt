The Tyndale Monument  is a tower built on a hill at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, England. It was built in honour of William Tyndale, a translator of the New Testament, who is believed to have been born at North Nibley.
The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111 ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb to the top of the tower, up a spiral staircase of about 120 steps. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. There are two main paths, one which goes up steep steps, or one that follows a rough slope. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley.
The door to the tower is normally unlocked on weekends, otherwise you can get the key from the village shop.[tpl]cite web|title=Tyndale Monument - Places of Interest|url=http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=2024|publisher=Gloucestershire County Council|accessdate=29 April 2011[/tpl]  A deposit is required for borrowing the key and the there is a nominal admission charge.[tpl]cite web|title=Wotton-under-Edge and Tyndale monument|url=http://www.walkscene.co.uk/description_45/WottonunderEdge_and_Tyndale_monument.html|publisher=Walk Scene|accessdate=29 April 2011[/tpl]  Locally, it is commonly called Nibley Monument rather than its official name.

The monument is a landmark that can be seen for miles, even in places as far as Bristol over 20 miles away. In the town of Thornbury there is a street called Tyndale View where the tower can be seen from approximately 10 miles away.
Further down the Cotswold Edge, at Hawkesbury, is the Somerset Monument, erected in 1846, and the design of the Tyndale tower has features in common with this.
