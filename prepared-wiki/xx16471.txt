In mathematics, particularly in measure theory, measurable functions are structure-preserving functions between measurable spaces; as such, they form a natural context for the theory of integration. Specifically, a function between measurable spaces is said to be measurable if the preimage of each measurable set is measurable, analogous to the situation of continuous functions between topological spaces.
By convention a topological space is assumed to be equipped with the Borel algebra generated by its open subsets unless otherwise specified.  Most commonly this space will be the real or complex numbers.  For instance, a real-valued measurable function is a function for which the preimage of each Borel set is measurable.  A complex-valued measurable function is defined analogously.  In practice, some authors use measurable functions to refer only to real-valued measurable functions with respect to the Borel algebra.[tpl]cite book | last = Strichartz | first = Robert | title = The Way of Analysis | publisher = Jones and Bartlett | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7637-1497-6[/tpl] If the values of the function lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space instead of R or C, usually other definitions of measurability are used, such as weak measurability and Bochner measurability.
In probability theory, the sigma algebra often represents the set of available information, and a function (in this context a random variable) is measurable if and only if it represents an outcome that is knowable based on the available information.  In contrast, functions that are not Lebesgue measurable are generally considered pathological, at least in the field of analysis.

==Formal definition==

Let (X, Σ) and (Y, Τ) be measurable spaces, meaning that X and Y are sets equipped with respective sigma algebras Σ and Τ.  A function f: X → Y is said to be measurable if for every E ∈ Τ the preimage of E under f is in Σ; ie
The notion of measurability depends on the sigma algebras Σ and Τ.  To emphasize this dependency, if f: X → Y is a measurable function, we will write

==Non-measurable functions==

Real-valued functions encountered in applications tend to be measurable; however, it is not difficult to find non-measurable functions.
