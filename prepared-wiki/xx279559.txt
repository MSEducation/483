==Incidents==

On February 8, 2014, in the closing minutes of a game at Texas Tech, Oklahoma State player Marcus Smart shoved a Texas Tech fan in the stands after a verbal altercation and received a technical foul.  At a press conference the following afternoon, neither Smart nor OSU coach Travis Ford addressed the question of what the fan said.  OSU announced that Smart would be suspended for 3 games because of the incident.Brendan Malloy, "Marcus Smart suspended 3 games for altercation with fan", Sports Illustrated, February 9, 2014.  Separately, Texas Tech announced its findings that the fan had not used a racial slur (as had been reported by some sources) but had spoken  inappropriately to Smart, and the fan agreed not to attend any further Texas Tech games during the 2013-2014 season."Statement Regarding Incident At Texas Tech-Oklahoma State Men's Basketball Game", Texas Tech University, February 9, 2014.
