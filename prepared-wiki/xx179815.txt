Sgt. Shonen's Exploding Plastic Eastman Band Request Mono! Stereo (also known as Mono! Stereo or simply Mono!) is a 1989 album by Tater Totz. Tater Totz is a supergroup made up of members of Red Kross, Shonen Knife and The Runaways as well as other special guests and musicians. The album itself is a simultaneous tribute to and parody of The Beatles. It contains cover versions of many obscure Beatles and solo members songs such as "The Lovely Linda" and "Cambridge 1969", as well as more conventional songs such as "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Instant Karma!". The album, however, does not only contain covers of Beatles and related tunes. There are also covers of songs such as "Rock On" originally recorded by David Essex and "1, 2, 3, Red Light", originally recorded by The 1910 Fruitgum Company. In addition to the covers, there are also strange original compositions such as "Shompton In Babylon" and the Ono-esque "Two Virgins #9".
