===Early history===

In July 1911, a charter was drawn up for the formation of an Orthodox synagogue named Congregation Agudath Achim Anshai.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2010-11-03/Front_Page/Freehold_temple_celebrates_its_place_in_local_hist.html |title=Freehold temple celebrates its place in local history |work=News Transcript |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/061506/moFreeholdCenter.html |title=Freehold Center celebrates 95 years |work=NJ Jewish News |date= June 15, 2006|author= Jill Huber|accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl]  Many of the founders had immigrated to the United States from Russia and Poland, and many of its leaders were merchants and professionals in the area.  Raphael Riemer, who immigrated to Freehold from Russia in 1906, was the synagogue’s first rabbi and cantor.  Louis Finegold, a clothing store owner, was the first President of the synagogue. In 1911, the synagogue had a membership of 40 families.
The synagogue was first built, at a land and construction cost of approximately $1,000, as a small (32' x 50')[tpl]cite news|url=http://njjewishnews.com/article/monmouth/shul-celebrates-century-of-tradition-and-caring |title=Shul celebrates century of ‘tradition and caring’ |work=New Jersey Jewish News |date=December 6, 2010 |author= Jill Garbi|accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.twp.freehold.nj.us/around_freehold/history/hist_religion_in_twp_4.asp |title=Freehold Township: History of Religions in Freehold Township |publisher=Twp.freehold.nj.us |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl] wooden structure on the corner of First Street and Center Street in Freehold between 1911 and 1916, by the Freehold Hebrew Association, which had been established in 1894.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2006-06-21/Front_Page/107.html |title=Temple to mark 95 years of life with dinner-dance |work=News Transcript |date=June 21, 2006 |author= Dick Metzgar|accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/app/access/1766603831.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+26%2C+2006&author=ALISON+HERGET&pub=Asbury+Park+Press&desc=Synagogue+celebrates+community&pqatl=google |title=Synagogue celebrates community |work=Asbury Park Press |date=June 26, 2006 |author=Alison Herget|accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QD9-ctdh2-gC&pg=PA130&dq=%22Freehold%22+synagogue#v=onepage&q=%22Freehold%22%20synagogue&f=false |title=Freehold: A Hometown History |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0-7385-2418-2 |year= 2003|author=Barbara Pepe |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pDViIlVm0s8C&pg=PA397&dq=%22Freehold%22+synagogue#v=onepage&q=%22Freehold%22%20synagogue&f=false |title=Jewish life in small-town America: a history |publisher= Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10671-8|year= 2005|author=Lee Shai Weissbach |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl]  The synagogue's religious school started at that location in September 1914.  Dues were $6 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|6|1916|r=-1[/tpl][/tpl] today).  The synagogue added a second floor to the building in 1916.
The synagogue formed a sisterhood in 1920, and that year a mikva was constructed below the synagogue.

===1940–2000===

In the 1940s, the Ku Klux Klan became active in the Howell Township area, and members of the synagogue regularly patrolled the synagogue grounds armed with shotguns to protect it against Klan members.  In 1943, during World War II, American soldier and Freehold Jewish Center member Jack Steinberg found an old Torah covered in soot and ash in the burned wreckage of a synagogue in a small Jewish village in Italy.  He shipped it back to the synagogue, where it was  restored 47 years later and is now proudly displayed outside the office.[tpl]cite news|url=http://freeholdvoice.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=freeholdhistory&action=display&thread=2225 |title=Torah at the center of Jewish center; Ancient scroll rescued by G.I. in 1943 from Italian synagogue|work=Asbury Park Press|date=December 16, 1999 |author=John A.

During the 1950s and 1960s, synagogue membership in the synagogue reached 400.  It changed its name to Freehold Jewish Center in the 1960s. Rabbi Eli Fishman was the synagogue's rabbi from 1970 until his retirement in 1997. He was succeeded by Rabbi Kenneth Greene, who retired in 2011. As of 2011, the synagogue is led by Rabbi Dr. Tal Sessler.

In 2002, the synagogue commissioned the writing of a new torah scroll, for $30,000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/app/access/1835766531.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+31%2C+2002&author=DAN+KAPLAN&pub=Asbury+Park+Press&desc=Freehold+Jewish+Center+commissions+Torah+scroll&pqatl=google |title=Freehold Jewish Center commissions Torah scroll |work=Asbury Park Press |date=October 31, 2002 |author= Dan Kaplan|accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/app/access/1822166711.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+22%2C+2003&author=TOM+TRONCONE&pub=Asbury+Park+Press&desc=Freehold+Jewish+Center+celebrates+new+Sefer+Torah&pqatl=google |title=Freehold Jewish Center celebrates new Sefer Torah |work=Asbury Park Press |date=September 22, 2003 |author=Tom Troncone |accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl]  The following year, it was one of a number of area synagogues that took part in helping fund the building of a new home for a family, under the auspices of the Freehold Area Habitat for Humanity.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2003-07-02/Front_Page/020.html |title=Jewish congregations will aid Freehold Habitat project |work=News Transcript |date=July 2, 2003 |author=Clare Marie Celano |accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl]  In April 2003, the synagogue named its chapel the Oglensky Chapel, after David Oglensky, a synagogue member and soldier who had been a lieutenant and commander in the 740th Tank Battalion of the U.S. First Army killed in the Battle of the Bulge, who for his gallantry was awarded posthumously the Purple Heart and the Silver Star.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/app/access/1830573191.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+10%2C+2003&author=DAN+KAPLAN&pub=Asbury+Park+Press&desc=Chapel+rededicated+to+Jewish+soldier&pqatl=google |title=Chapel rededicated to Jewish soldier |work=Asbury Park Press |date=April 10, 2003 |author= Dan Kaplan |accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl] Family members had constructed the synagogue's ark and benches by hand after his death.
In 2006, the synagogue had a membership of 260 families. By 2010, membership had fallen to 175 families.
In 2011, to commemorate its centennial year, the synagogue planned a series of events.  Past president Jerry Einhorn said: “I think it’s absolutely wonderful we have reached our 100th year. It’s a beautiful synagogue, and I look forward to its next 500 years.” That year marked Greene's 13th and final year as the congregation's rabbi.
As of 2013 the congregation's Rabbi is Edward Friedman, the Cantor is Aron Heller, and the President is Gabriel Gurman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freeholdjc.org/Officers.htm |title=Officers/Trustees |publisher=Freeholdjc.org |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2011[/tpl]

==Broad Street Synagogue building==

Ground was broken in 1947 for a new synagogue, on lots 250' x 175' that were purchased in 1943 and 1945, responding to the need for a larger one. In 1957, the new synagogue was completed on the corner of Broad Street and Stokes Street. The synagogue was dedicated on August 25, 1957, with Governor Robert B. Meyner and his wife as guests of honor.  David Metz was president of the synagogue at the time.  In 1973, an addition was added to the synagogue, containing classrooms and offices, and expanding the sanctuary.
The synagogue's sanctuary and extension are flanked in beautiful stained glass windows.  The building also houses 12 classrooms, social halls, a 350-person formal ballroom, a youth lounge, a library, a smaller chapel, and kosher kitchens.
