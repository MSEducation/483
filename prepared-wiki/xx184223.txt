==History==

Waverley was first incorporated as the Oakleigh Road District in January 1857, which became the Shire of Oakleigh in December 1871. Parts of the Central and South Ridings were severed to create the Oakleigh Borough, which went on to become the City of Oakleigh, on 13 March 1891. The remainder was renamed the Shire of Mulgrave on 19 February 1897. In 1949 and 1959, further areas were annexed to the City of Oakleigh. On 14 April 1961, the Shire of Mulgrave became the City of Waverley.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=521â€“522[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
