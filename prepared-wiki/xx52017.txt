===Dancing Plague of 1518===

The Dancing Plague of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) in July 1518. Numerous people took to dancing for days without rest, and, over the period of about one month, some of the people died from heart attack, stroke, or exhaustion.[tpl]cite web |url= http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/01/dancing-death-mystery.html |title= 'Dancing Plague' and Other Odd Afflictions Explained |first= Jennifer |last= Viegas |date= 1 August 2008 |work= Discovery News |publisher= Discovery Communications |accessdate= 8 August 2008 [/tpl]

===Salem Witch Trials (1692-93)===

Adolescent girls Abigail Williams, Betty Parris, Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard began to have fits that were described by a minister as "beyond the power of Epileptic Fits or natural disease to effect."http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/ModestEnquiry/ The events resulted in the Salem Witch Trials, which resulted in the deaths of 25 citizens of Salem and nearby towns.

===Halifax Slasher (1938)===

The Halifax Slasher was the name given to a supposed attacker of residents, mostly women, of the town of Halifax, England in November 1938. The week-long scare began after two women claimed to have been attacked by a mysterious man with a mallet and "bright buckles" on his shoes.http://www.calderdale-online.org/html/community/life3.html 
Further reports of attacks by a man wielding a knife or a razor followed. The situation became so serious that Scotland Yard was called in to assist the Halifax police.http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/making_history_20070501.shtml
On November 29 one of the alleged victims admitted that he had inflicted the damage upon himself for attention. Others soon had similar admissions, and the Yard investigation concluded that none of the attacks had been real. Five local people were subsequently charged with public mischief offenses, and four were sent to prison.

===Tanganyika laughter epidemic (1962)===

The Tanganyika laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha, Tanzania. The laughter started with three girls and spread haphazardly throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18.[tpl]cite journal |author=Provine, Robert R. |title=Laughter |journal=American Scientist |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=38–47 |date=January–February 1996 |doi= |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/laughter/1[/tpl][ref]
</ref> Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days in those affected. The teaching staff were not affected but reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school was forced to close down on March 18, 1962.<ref name=Radiolab>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2008/feb/25/ |title=Laughter |publisher=Radiolab |accessdate=2011-01-12[/tpl]</ref>
After the school was closed and the students were sent home, the epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village that was home to several of the girls. In April and May, 217 people had laughing attacks in the village, most of them being school children and young adults. The Kashasha school was reopened on May 21, only to be closed again at the end of June. In June, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls’ middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls. Another outbreak occurred in Kanyangereka and two nearby boys schools were closed.

===Blackburn, England (1965)===

In October 1965 at a girls' school in Blackburn, several girls complained of dizziness.Moss, P. D. and C. P. McEvedy. “An epidemic of overbreathing among schoolgirls.” British Medical Journal 2(5525) (1966):1295–1300. Web. 17 Dec. 2009. Some fainted. Within a couple of hours, 85 girls from the school were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital after fainting. Symptoms included swooning, moaning, chattering of teeth, hyperpnea, and tetany.
A medical analysis of the event about one year later found that outbreaks began among the 14-year-olds, but that the heaviest incidence moved to the youngest age groups. There was no evidence of pollution of food or air. The younger girls proved more susceptible, but disturbance was more severe and lasted longer in the older girls. Using the Eysenck Personality Inventory, those affected had higher scores for extroversion and neuroticism. It was considered that the epidemic was hysterical, that a previous polio epidemic had rendered the population emotionally vulnerable, and that a three-hour parade, producing 20 faints on the day before the first outbreak, had been the specific trigger.

===Malaysia (1970s-80s)===

Mass hysteria occurred in Malaysia from the 1970s to the 1980s. It affected school-age girls and young women working in factories. The locals have explained this outbreak as "spirits" having possessed the girls and young women.[tpl]cite news|title=Mass hysteria hits Malaysian school|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2001_July_16/ai_77057810/|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=Asian Economic News|date=July 16, 2001|agency=Kyodo|location=Kuala Lumpur[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]http://smj.sma.org.sg/1604/1604smj11.pdf[tpl]cite journal|last=Ong|first=Aihwa|title=The Production of Possession: Spirits and the Multinational Corporation in Malaysia|journal=American Ethnologist|date=Feb 1988|volume=15|series=Medical Anthropology|issue=1|pages=28–42|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=University of California, Berkeley|jstor=645484|doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.1.02a00030[/tpl]

===West Bank fainting epidemic (1983)===

The 1983 West Bank fainting epidemic  was a series of incidents in March 1983 in which 943 Palestinian teenage girls, mostly schoolgirls, and a small number of IDF women soldiers fainted or complained of feeling nauseous in the West Bank. Israel was accused of using chemical warfare to sterilize West Bank women while IDF sources speculated that a toxic substance had been employed by Palestinian militants to stir up unrest[tpl]cite news|title=MORE SCHOOLGIRLS IN WEST BANK FALL SICK|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/04/world/more-schoolgirls-in-west-bank-fall-sick.html|author = DAVID K. SHIPLER|publisher=The New York Times|date = April 4, 1983|accessdate=6 May 2011|location=Jerusalem[/tpl] but investigators concluded that even if some environmental irritant had originally been present, the wave of complaints was ultimately a product of mass hysteria. This conclusion was supported by a Palestinian health official, who said that while 20% of the early cases may have been caused by the inhalation of some kind of gas, the remaining 80% were psychosomatic.[tpl]cite news|title=Ailing Schoolgirls|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953801,00.html#ixzz1M8CldpGE|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=Time|date=Apr 18, 1983[/tpl]
