The Muslim Association Party (MAP) was a political party in the Gold Coast, active from 1954 to 1957.
The MAP grew out of the Gold Coast Muslim Association, which was established as a welfare and social association in 1932. Involved in politics by the early 1950s, it became the Muslim Association Party in 1954. Most of its leaders opposed the ruling Convention People's Party, and the MAP was one of the parties which merged in 1957 to join the United Party.Daniel Miles McFarland, Historical Dictionary of Ghana, 1985, p. 124
