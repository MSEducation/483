The Soil Bleeds Black is a pagan Neo-Medieval band from Ashburn, Virginia.

==History==

The Soil Bleeds Black was conceived in the year 1992 as a project that focused on the experimental visions of twin brothers, Mark and Michael Riddick. Over years the concepts changed as the brothers searched for a complete sound that could appropriately exhibit their transformative thoughts and interests. This endeavor reached a particular climax in the year 1994, when TSBB took on a sound of pure medieval folkloric expression. Shortly after this realization, Mark and Mike added Eugenia Wallace to their ranks. Eugenia's vocal contribution helped to bring to fruition the final elements that would make up the portrait of their endeavors. Essentially, The Soil Bleeds Black aim to convey an enchanting conglomeration of raw sound, medieval customs, and self-expression through ancient allegory, alchemical tract, and their entourage of medieval instruments.
