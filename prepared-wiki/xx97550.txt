==Redevelopment==

As the planned community of Columbia reached its design capacity and development opportunities lessened, its developer sought to increase the population density of existing land in order to make a profitable revitalization of Columbia's aging infrastructure. Kimco Realty Corporation, the current owner of the village center, proposed a controversial redevelopment plan in 2008, that would have torn down buildings and built a large number of apartments in a mixed-use project.Simmonsen, Derek. "Council to take up village center redevelopment;Wilde Lake changes at heart of controversy", Columbia Flier, May 22, 2009 A Kimco executive declared that plan to be "null and void" at a June 1, 2009 meeting.  The vice-president of Acquisitions and Development said: "I have no idea what the concept is now."Simmonsen, Derek, "Kimco holds off on Wilde Lake plans", Columbia Flier, week of June 4, 2009, pp. 1,4 In 2013, Kimco broke ground on a $17,000,000 project, demolishing the community grocery store, and adding 250 multi-story garage apartments and 30,000 sq ft of office space.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Business Monthly|title=Kimco Breaks Ground for Wilde Lake Village Center Redevelopment|date=3 June 2013[/tpl]
