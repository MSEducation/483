The State Road and Tollway Authority (SRTA) is a government agency of the U.S. state of Georgia. It is responsible for financing transportation initiatives and operating the state's only current toll road, the Georgia State Route 400 (SRÂ 400) extension.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] SRTA collects tolls on the southern portion of the expressway, at a toll plaza halfway between Interstate 285 (I-285) and I-85. Tolls are collected with either cash or electronic toll collection with the Georgia Cruise Card. The F.J. Torras Causeway toll from Brunswick to St. Simons Island was removed in 2003.
A proposal to merge SRTA and GRTA, and most of GDOT's functions into a new State Transportation Authority was presented in the 150th Georgia General Assembly, however later in the legislative session a much more moderate plan was passed in March 2009, instead.
