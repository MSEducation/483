</ref> But he was well received by audiences and thought to continue in this career "till something better should offer."<ref name="ingenious"/> Some of the roles reportedly played by Farquhar were Lennox in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]],'' Young Bellair in ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' by [[George Etherege]], Lord Dion in ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]'' by [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]], and Guyomar in ''The Indian Emperor'' by [[John Dryden]].<ref name="strauss1"/>
But while he was performing in the Dryden play, an accident on stage put an end to Farquhar's acting career. As Guyomar, Farquhar was supposed to "kill" Vasquez, one of the Spanish generals in the drama. Forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil before enacting this scene, Farquhar severely wounded Price, the actor playing Vasquez. Although Price recovered, Farquhar resolved after this mishap to give up acting for good.[ref]

==Writing career==

Farquhar then left for London, "possibly with a draft of his first play in his portmanteau." Some writers tie his move to that of his friend Wilks, who had received an offer from the manager of Drury Lane to come to London and join that theatre,[ref]
</ref> and Wilks is also credited with encouraging Farquhar's efforts at writing plays.<ref name=ingenious2>

Farquhar's first comedy, Love and a Bottle, was premiered in 1698; "for its sprightly Dialogue and busy Scenes," it is said to have been "well received by the Audience." Called a "licentious piece" by one scholar, and cited as proof that Farquhar had "absorbed the stock topics, character-types, and situations of Restoration comedy" by another, the play deals with Roebuck, "An Irish Gentleman of a wild roving Temper" who is "newly come to London."[ref]
</ref> The general character of the play can be evaluated by considering that in the opening scene, Roebuck tells his friend Lovewell that he has left Ireland due to getting a woman pregnant with twins (a boy and a girl) and to Roebuck's father trying to force Roebuck to marry the woman; however, Roebuck remarks, "Heav'n was pleas'd to lessen my Affliction, by taking away the She-brat."<ref name=ingeniousplay2>
 Most of these plot details are pointed out by William Myers, ''op. cit.,'' p. vii.</ref>
After the favourable reception of Love and a Bottle, Farquhar decided to devote himself to playwriting. He also at this point received a commission in the regiment of the Earl of Orrery, so his time for the next few years was divided between the vocations of soldier and dramatist. It was also at about this time that Farquhar discovered Anne Oldfield, who was reading aloud a scene from The Scornful Lady at her aunt's tavern. Impressed, he brought her to the notice of Sir John Vanbrugh, and this led to her theatrical career, during which she was the first performer of major female roles in Farquhar's last comedies.[ref]

In 1700, Farquhar's The Constant Couple was acted at Drury Lane and proved a great success,[ref]
</ref> helped considerably by his friend Wilks' portrayal of the character of Sir Henry Wildair<ref name="ingenious2"/> (a performance that Farquhar himself praised generously in his "Preface to the Reader" when the play was published).<ref name=alexf1>
</ref> The playwright followed up with a sequel, ''Sir Harry Wildair,'' the following year, and in 1702 wrote both ''The Inconstant, or the Way to Win Him'' and ''The Twin Rivals.'' Also in 1702, Farquhar published ''Love and Business,'' a collection that included letters, verse, and ''A Discourse Upon Comedy.''<ref name=strauss4>
</ref>
The next year, he married Margaret Pemell, "a widow with three children, ten years his senior," who reportedly tricked him into the marriage by pretending to have a great fortune.[ref]
</ref> His 18th century biographer records that "though
he found himself deceived, his Circumstances embarrassed, and his Family increasing, he never upbraided her for the Cheat, but behaved to her with all the Delicacy and Tenderness of an indulgent Husband."[ref]
