CATEGORIES: Parks in Edmonton

William Hawrelak Park (or simply Hawrelak Park) is a park in Edmonton, Alberta. It is named after former mayor William Hawrelak, and was formerly known as Mayfair Park.
The park is situated in Edmonton's river valley, next to the North Saskatchewan River. The park is home to the Heritage Amphitheatre, which is used for many festivals and performances, such as the Freewill Shakespeare Festival, the Edmonton Heritage Festival and Edmonton Symphony Orchestra's Symphony Under the Sky Festival.
Rented paddleboats may be used on the artificial lake or ducks fed during summer. The lake is also used for the swimming portion of the Edmonton Triathlon. In the winter the entire lake is a vast skating rink.
The park has walkingâ€“hiking trails around the perimeter which can be used for cross-country skiing in the winter. There are picnic sites, a playground, and even beach volleyball nets on site.
In recent years, the park has played host to the Bright Nights Festival around Christmas time. Many light installations are present.
