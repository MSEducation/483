The Salinas Sports Complex is a sporting complex located in Salinas, California on the Central Coast. The main feature of the complex is a 17,000-seat stadium suitable for rodeo, soccer, American football, and rugby. 
The grounds have been home to the California Rodeo Salinas since 1911. The original wood stadium structure was built in 1924 and replaced in 1996. The stadium's field is wide enough to host soccer matches along with football games, and indeed it hosted the California Jaguars of the United Soccer Leagues (then USISL) from 1995 to 1999.
For several years, the PBR has hosted an event from the Touring Pro Division (the PBR's "minor league"; formerly the Challenger Tour) at the complex.
The complex is also home to baseball, and softball fields.
The stadium does not only host rodeo and sports events, it can be converted into a race track for auto racing, monster truck shows, and motorcycle racing. 
Concerts have been held at the venue, such as Eagles in 2005, RBD in 2006, Scorpions in 2006, Mary J. Blige in 2007 Luis Miguel in 2007,  Creedence Clearwater Revisited in 2009, and Alan Jackson in 2012.
