The manga and anime series Freezing features a diverse cast of characters written by Dall-Young Lim and illustrated by Kwang-Hyun Kim. The series revolves around Earth in the middle of a war with aliens from another dimension called the Nova. In order to counter them, Pandoras and Limiters, genetically modified girls with super fighting skills and their male partners who use special "freezing" powers to limit their opponent's mobility, are made to fight against the Nova. The story focuses on Kazuya Aoi, a Limiter whose late sister was a Pandora, and Satellizer el Bridget, a powerful Pandora with a cold personality who is known by others as the Untouchable Queen for her aphephobia, both who are enrolled at West Genetics Academy, one of the many academies where Pandoras and Limiters are trained. They are later joined by Rana Linchen, a Pandora from Tibet in search for her Limiter who believes Kazuya to be her "soulmate", sparking a rivalry with Satellizer.
