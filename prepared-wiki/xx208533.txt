The One Hot Minute Tour (also known as The Wild Tour) was a concert tour by the Red Hot Chili Peppers from 1995-1997 to support their album One Hot Minute. This was the first and only major tour guitarist Dave Navarro  performed on with the band. The One Hot Minute era got off to a rocky start with extensive delays in recording; once the tour was underway there was a variety of mishaps and upheavals that at one point caused Flea to rethink being part the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The U.S. leg of the tour was intended to start in 1995 however was postponed to the following year because drummer Chad Smith broke his arm in a baseball game. A total of 33 dates were canceled due various other problems including a broken arm suffered by singer Anthony Kiedis which eventually led to another drug relapse. Lack of chemistry with Navarro was also a major problem since he joined the band and continued to become a problem as the tour went on. Navarro played his final show with the band in July 1997 during a massive rain storm which cut the band's set short. After spending the entire year of 1997 doing nothing and making some minor attempts to record new music, Navarro was eventually let go in early 1998 and replaced not long after by a returning John Frusciante who quit the band in 1992.

==Songs performed==

==Tour overview==

Some of the U.S. shows opened with a jam that consisted of "Freaky Styley" and Parliament Funkadelic's "Night of the Thumpasorus Peoples" with Kiedis providing his own rap over the Parliament song. The jam would go right into and "Suck My Kiss". Out of the album's thirteen songs, "Falling Into Grace", "One Hot Minute" and "Tearjerker" were the only songs to never be performed live. "Pea" is the only song from the album to be performed live in full since the tour's end in 1997, although "My Friends" and "Walkabout" were briefly teased in 2012 and 2013 respectively.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcoqJvOVNLY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hRkhUwfQXI

==Tour==

===First North American leg===

All dates on the band's Novemberâ€“December 1995 dates had to be re-scheduled because drummer Chad Smith broke his wrist. The North American tour would eventually kick off on February 6, 1996.

===Cancelled 1997 tour===

The entire leg of this tour was cancelled except for Navarro's final U.S. appearance with the band on the January 24, 1997 episode of the Late Show with David Letterman and June 26, 1997 for the Fuji Rock Festival, which ended up being the last performance with Dave Navarro. The set was cut short due to a massive storm. The band decided to cancel the rest of the tour to focus on recording a new album though both Kiedis and Navarro relapsed into drugs and the follow-up album with Navarro would never get made. Navarro would eventually be fired in April 1998 and replaced not long after by John Frusciante.

==Opening acts==

Iggy Pop joined the band onstage at the 2/9/96 show to cover his song "I Wanna Be Your Dog". MTV also aired the first few songs of this show live. MTV titled the special "Online and Onstage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers". A segment before the live performance was shown with the band answering online questions from fans in an AOL chatroom. MTV would also air another special from this performance which featured the band as cameras followed them around throughout the day up until showtime. The Peppers also performed with "socks on cocks" for the first time with Dave and were joined by backing singer, Rob Rule, who also wore a sock, and backing singer, Rain Phoenix who performed topless.
