In 2007 ACH treated the case of 20-month-old Jacob Esses, which spurred the recall of the Aqua Dots toy. After swallowing a number of the toy beads, 1,4-Butanediol coating the beads was metabolized to Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB, a recreational anesthetic).International Herald Tribune http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/08/america/NA-GEN-US-Toys-Date-Rape-Drug.phpUSA Today http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-11-09-toy-recall-chemicals_N.htm The drug has been shown to cause unconsciousness, drowsiness, seizures, coma, or death.US Drug Enforcement Administration http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/ghb_factsheet.html
ACH has been profiled a number of times on the Discovery Health Channel, perhaps most notably in the fall of 2007. The program “Surgery Saved My Life” examined how three physicians in the Arkansas Children’s Hospital Vascular Anomalies Center of Excellence handled patients’ potentially fatal vascular tumors. Featured in the documentary were James Suen, M.D., a head and neck surgeon at ACH and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS); Lisa Buckmiller, M.D., medical director of the ACH Vascular Anomalies Center; and Rick Jackson, M.D., a surgeon at the hospital and associate professor of Surgery in the UAMS College of Medicine. One patient featured in the profile was a 12-year-old girl who was born in Shanghai with what is believed to be the largest vascular tumor ever seen; Chinese surgeons had been reluctant to operate on the tumor.ACH Press Release - Discovery Health to feature ACH VACP https://secure.archildrens.org/press_room/viewPressRelease_Story.asp?PRID=5806

==Construction and expansion==

In September 2008 ACH held a groundbreaking for its new $115 million wing that eventually will allow it to care for thousands more sick children every year.ACH Press Release - ACH Breaks Ground on $115 Million Wing http://www.archildrens.org/news/pages/press_release.aspx?articleid=2611&zoneid=34
"The [tpl]convert|258,000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] South Wing will open much-needed space for providing the highest standard of pediatric care possible. The new ED will include telemedicine technology and four trauma rooms, as well as a dedicated orthopedics suite and a decontamination unit. In addition, the South Wing will open new space for the NICU and CVICU to accommodate the growing demand for their services. An entirely new Hematology/Oncology unit will open in the South Wing for the state’s pediatric cancer and blood disorder patients, as will a new inpatient unit dedicated for care of infants through 3-year-olds.
The project actually will provide about 100 new patient beds, but the hospital plans to retire many that date back more than 40 years. The net increase in patient beds will be 54. The new South Wing also will include 56 new exam rooms, as well as 19 new procedural or diagnostic rooms. A roof garden complete with benches, Arkansas foliage and play areas will be open to patients, families and employees.
The South Wing will rise four stories and will be located on land that is now a parking lot just south of the main hospital and west of its Roy & Christine Sturgis Building. The finished facility will sit in the vicinity of Battery Street and 10th Street. The facility was designed by Cromwell Architects and will be built by Nabholz Construction."
