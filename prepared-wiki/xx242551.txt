==Stories==

The popular stories are from Indian Classics such as the Panchatantra and the Jataka and also from the grand epics of India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharat. Although the stories have strong Indian roots, they speak of morals and ideals that are universal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianbooksandmore.com/?page=shop/browse&category_id=5 |title=Karadi Tales |publisher=Indianbooksandmore.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22[/tpl]

==Series==

===Karadi Tales Mythology===

Karadi brings to life a world of gods and demons, kings and queens, a universe of times past. Stories from Indian mythology are woven together and sung by Award winner and celebrated film and theatre personality Padmabhushan Girish Karnad, who plays the role of Karadi, the bear and sootradhar. The script, lyrics and direction is by Shobha Viswanath. Padmashri Thota Tharani adapts his unique style to communicate art to children, which exposes children to illustrations that are not childish, yet are appealing to the child. Like the art, the music steers away from the childish nursery rhyme format and incorporates Indian aesthetics. The acclaimed group, '3 Brothers & A Violin' have created the songs and background scores that enhance the storytelling experience.

===Under the Banyan===

The Under the Banyan series features folktales from different parts of India. With illustrations and music representative of the region, these stories form a complete cultural experience of different parts of India. The initial four folktales in this series from Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Bihar were narrated by Usha Uthup. The mantle of sootradhar and storyteller has now been taken over by Nandita Das.

===Chitra Picture Books===

Chitra publishes original picture books from India and English-Hindi bilingual editions of popular foreign titles including The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Mixed Up Chameleon, The Grouchy Ladybug and The Tiny Seed by Eric Carle.

===Dreaming Fingers===

Handcrafted tactile picture books that combine bright colours with an array of tactile sensations. These books are accompanied by Braille letters for the visually impaired and children with special needs. This imprint is produced in association with Lemniscaat (Rotterdam, Netherlands).

===Charkha Audio books===

Charkha is Karadi Tales' audio book imprint for Young Adults & Adults.
