Mulan Jameela (born August 23, 1979 in Garut; previously known as Mulan Kwok) is a famous Indonesian solo singer.

==Career with Ratu==

Mulan started her career as a café singer and joined several bands. Her popularity began when she formed a duo Ratu with Maia Ahmad in 2005. The duo released an album on the Sony BMG label in August 2005, entitled Ratu & Friends. The first single of the album, "Teman Tapi Mesra" quickly rocketed Mulan’s name as one of the most popular singers in Indonesia. Peaking number 1 in Indonesia for several weeks, the single also gained commercial success on numerous radio stations in Malaysia and Singapore. The album sold over 400,000 copies (certified Double Platinum) and established Ratu as the most successful female group at the time.
The following year, Ratu released another album, entitled No. Satu, which was a hugely successful and sold 500,000 copies in the first week. The singles, "Lelaki Buaya Darat" and "Dear Diary" gained considerable airplay and landed at number 1 on the charts. Ratu also won several awards, one of them is Anugerah Musik Indonesia (Indonesian Music Awards) in 2006.
However, Mulan decided to quit Ratu in 2007. Mulan left Ratu due to her dissatisfaction with the group's management regarding financial transparency. She later started to establish her own solo career and signed to EMI Indonesia.

==Solo career==

She released her debut self-titled album, Mulan Jameela, in January 2008. The first single from the debut album, "Makhluk Tuhan Paling Sexy" (God's Sexiest Creature), rose to number 1 and competed with the single of her ex-partner, Maia. Her second single, "Wonder Woman" also gained commercial success, peaking at number 1 on several charts in Indonesia.
The album has certified platinum only several weeks into 2008 for selling more than 100,000 copies.

==Personal life==

With her ex-husband Harry Nugraha, Mulan has 2 children Tyarani and Daffi. Both live with her, as Harry and Mulan were divorced in 2005. In 2011, Mulan had a third child while unmarried, although rumours designated Ahmad Dhani as her secret husband.
