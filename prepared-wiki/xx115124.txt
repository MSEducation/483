Napoca is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its single described species, Napoca insignis, is only found in Israel. It is one of seven genera comprising the Harmochireae clade within the Dendryphantinae subfamily.[tpl]cite journal|first=Dmitri V.|last=Logunov|title=A redefinition of the genera Bianor Peckham & Peckham, 1885 and Harmochirus Simon, 1885, with the establishment of a new genus Sibianor gen. n. (Aranei: Salticidae)|journal=Arthropoda Selecta|year=2000|volume=9|issue=4|pages=221â€“286[/tpl]
The genus is known from only a single male specimen. It can be distinguished from similar genera such as Bianor and Sibianor by its sclerotized, bean-shaped abdomen, which overhangs the carapace. In addition, the posterior median eyes are close to the anterior lateral eyes, while they are midway between the anterior lateral eyes and posterior lateral eyes in related genera. The holotype is housed at Oxford University.
