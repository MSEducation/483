==Album==

The album Opus combines electronic music with classical music such as Swan Lake. It's also inspired by and based on songs such as Gymnopédie no. 1 by Erik Satie, Edvard Grieg's Solveig's Song, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini op. 43 and Claude Debussy's Reverie. After Schiller already released some singles with classical influences such as "Ein schöner Tag" (2000) with German singer Isgaard and "Time for Dreams" (2008) with Chinese pianist Lang Lang, it's the first completely classical inspired album of Schiller. Originally it was planned as a purely instrumental album, but then it was supplemented with vocals during the developing process. For the creation of the album Christopher von Deylen travelled to the Coachella Valley in California, USA. The performances of Anna Netrebko were recorded in the Dvorák Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague, Hélène Grimaud's performances were recorded at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City, Diana Tishchenko's and Albrecht Mayer's performances were recorded at the b-sharp Studios in Berlin.
It was released in different editions, including the limited "Ultra Deluxe Edition" of 2.500 exemplares handsigned by Christopher von Deylen.Klassikakzente: Schiller signiert 2.500 Exemplare von „Opus“ Schiller presented this album for the first time to journalists and traders at four exclusive listening sessions in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne.

It's also the first album without a name in German language. And it's the first Schiller album without the standard "Willkommen" (welcome) introduction and the first with a photography instead of a graphic on its cover. The art work includes pictures by photographer Philip Glaser.Berliner Zeitung: Das Werk von SchillerMusicheadquarter.de: SCHILLER das neue Album “Opus”: Wenn Elektronik auf Klassik trifft… The cover landscape photo was shot by Toby Harriman.
