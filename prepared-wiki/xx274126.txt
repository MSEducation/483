The genre is often characterized by heavy action and suspense, interlaced with stylized imagery and cinematographic techniques, that convey an overall feeling of surrealism. More recent titles have shown depictions of gory violence. The narrative of these movies may also be quite surreal, and the viewer is given a strong sense that the movie is not meant to be interpreted literally. These films also have a much smaller production cost than most action films; the films represented below are said to have budgets no greater than $50 million.
As of 2014, the most financially successful of these films (not factoring inflation) is Rian Johnson's Looper, with a total worldwide gross of $176 million. However, the most critically successful of the lot is James Cameron's 1984 breakout hit The Terminator, which has a 100% Fresh rating on the Rotten Tomatoes movie review website.
