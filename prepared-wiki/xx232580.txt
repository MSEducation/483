[[Dibutyltin oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Organotin compounds

Dibutyltin oxide, or dibutyloxotin, is an organotin compound used in organic synthesis. Among many synthetic applications, it is particularly useful in regioselective alkylation, acylation, and sulfonation reactions for starting materials containing alcohol functional groups.

==Applications==

Dibutyltin oxide (DBTO) may be used in the regioselective tosylation (a specific type of sulfonation) of certain polyols to selectively tosylate primary alcohols and exocyclic alcohols over more sterically-hindered alcohols:
