Golden Gloves focuses on three Montreal boxers in training, exploring their lives and hopes. The 1961 film marked a shift among French-Canadian filmmakers at the NFB away from folkloric films towards works that dealt with contemporary Quebec society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=584&navid=46|title=Golden Gloves|last=Morris|first=Peter|work=Canadian Film Encyclopedia|publisher=Film Reference Library|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Spaas|first=Lieve |title=The Francophone film: a struggle for identity|publisher=Manchester University Press|date=April 1, 2001|pages=77|chapter=Gilles Groulx|isbn=0-7190-5861-9|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=suDmAWP6VzoC&pg=PA77&dq=Golden+Gloves+Gilles+Groulx&ei=iQRIS_m0F6PmygTnvuz1DQ&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Golden%20Gloves%20Gilles%20Groulx&f=false[/tpl]
