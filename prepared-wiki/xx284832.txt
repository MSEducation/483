==Background and Inspiration==

The song was inspired by Fernandes' increasing fame and the pressures he faced due to it, which led to his breakup with his former fiancee.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://blog.muchmusic.com/danny-fernandes-releases-trailer-for-fly-again-broken-wings/|title = Danny Fernandes releases trailer for Fly Again (Broken Wings)|date = February 26, 2013|accessdate = August 13, 2013|work = MuchMusic|publisher = Bell Media[/tpl] In an interview with Samaritanmag.com, Fernandes explained the song's message: "With this new single, and much of my new record, I really wanted to show people that celebrity life isn’t all about glamour and money and cars. It can ruin someone’s life. When you are in a position like I am, things are given to you very easily, like going to clubs where they give you alcohol and women are hanging out. It’s easy to get caught up in these things. I got used to it and took advantage of situations."[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.samaritanmag.com/1529/singer-danny-fernandes-getting-hands-world-vision|title = Singer Danny Fernandes Getting Hands On With World Vision|date = March 28, 2013|accessdate = August 13, 2013|publisher = Samaritanmag.com|first = Kim|last = Hughes[/tpl]
With regards to the song's sample of "Broken Wings", Fernandes revealed: "I was in the studio and I had a bunch of producers playing me some records. They actually played me the “Fly Again” song but the chorus was already there. I was like, ‘I know this song’ and they were like, ‘Yeah it’s Mr. Mister.’ So I just said, ‘I’m taking it.’ It was one of those things you hear and just know is a definite hit. So I wrote the rest of it and that’s what came out of it."[tpl]Cite web|url = http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/music/features/new-danny-fernandes-single-spotlights-fame%E2%80%99s-grisly-downside|title = New Danny Fernandes single spotlights fame’s grisly downside|date = April 5, 2013|publisher = MSN Entertainment Canada|accessdate = August 13, 2013[/tpl]
