===Assassination of John F. Kennedy===

Wrone taught a course on the assassination of Kennedy at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and is the author of "The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination", a study discusses the 8 mm film of the assassination captured by Abraham Zapruder.[tpl]cite news|last=Lovell|first=Glenn|title=Shedding light on movies about a dark day in Dallas|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2003/11/21/shedding_light_on_movies_about_a_dark_day_in_dallas/|accessdate=January 11, 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 21, 2003|agency=Knight Ridder|location=Boston[/tpl] According to Wrone, the film proves that there was more than one gunman firing at Kennedy's motorcade.
Wrone has commented on Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK by stating: "The film fails on logic, fails on fact." He described Stone's premise of a conspiracy involving the Central Intelligence Agency and a so-called military-industrial complex as "irrational". According to Wrone, other assassination films, including Executive Action and Interview with the Assassin, are "the commercial exploitation of a great tragedy". Regarding the latter film, he said: "The facts in Interview with the Assassin were so egregiously in error, I had to stop watching it."
In the JFK assassination area Wrone has labored on it for 40 years, lecturing, teaching courses, numerous appearances on television and in documentaries, as well as participating in conferences, publishing a bibliography, and a documentary on a legal case "2052-73" in addition to the study of the history of the Zapruder Film: Reframing the JFK Assassination and "argues persuasively for its authenticity."Michael L. Kurtz, The JFK Assassination Debates. Lone Gunman versus Conspiracy, University Press of Kansas, 2006, p. 106.
He is one of several critics of Gerald Posner's well-known JFK assassination book "Case Closed" which Wrone blames for "massive numbers of factual errors" as well as off-base speculation.Journal of Southern History (Febr. 1995), cited in: James H. Fetzer, Murder in Dealey Plaza, Chapter "The Silence of the Historians" by Fetzer, Catfeet Press, Chicago, 2000,p. 375.
Wrone is on a board of directors of the Assassination Archives Research Board, located in Silver Spring, Maryland, preparing for the 50th anniversary of JFK's murder by assassins unknown. He continues to research the subject.
Wrone has spoken, delivered papers, reviewed books, and participated in conferences on the Martin Luther King, Jr., assassination.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] He holds that authorities in a political decision framed James Ray for the crime in the face of overwhelming, definitive evidence to his innocence.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
