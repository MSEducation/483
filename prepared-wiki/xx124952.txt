Edward Kreitman is an American violin teacher and is widely respected as one of the preeminent Suzuki teachers and teacher trainers in the country.  He is director of the Western Springs School of Talent Education and Naperville Suzuki School in Illinois and is the author of Teaching from the Balance Point: A guide for Suzuki Teachers, Parents, and Students and Teaching with an Open Heart: A guide to Developing Conscious Musicianship for Suzuki Parents, Teachers, and Students.
He studied with Roland and Almita Vamos and Doris Preucil, who were pioneers of the Suzuki method in the United States. In addition to his teaching at WSSTE, he frequently teaches masterclasses at many different Suzuki Institutes in the Americas and abroad.
Currently, Kreitman is the director of "Allegro!!!".  This dynamic group of 16 violinists ages 11â€“16 travels the world spreading their love of music, including recent appearances in Atlanta at the 2012 ASTA Conference, Puerto Rico and New Orleans.  While in New Orleans, they had a chance encounter with the Reverend Jesse Jackson.  He was astounded by their playing and chose them to lead his charity march into the Ninth Ward of the devastated city. As a result of their recent performance at the ASTA conference in Atlanta, the group was invited by Barrage founder, Dean Marshall, to participate in a concert tour of China in June 2013.
