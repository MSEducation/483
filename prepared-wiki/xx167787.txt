Gerald Russell Smallwood (1889â€“1977) was an officer in the British Army during World War II.
In 1939, at the outbreak of war, Brigadier Smallwood commanded the Nigerian Brigade.  By 1940, his brigade was named the 3rd Nigerian Brigade.  In July 1940, under the terms of a war contingency plan, the 3rd Nigerian Brigade was sent to East Africa.  There, the Nigerian brigade was joined by two brigades of the King's African Rifles (KAR) to form the 1st African Division.  Smallwood was the acting Commanding Officer of this division during its formation.
When Major-General H. E. de R. Wetherall officially took command of the 1st African Division, Smallwood once again reverted to command of his original brigade, now named the 23rd Nigerian Brigade.
In 1942, Smallwood was promoted to Major-General.
