==Meteorite fall of 3 January 1970==

On January 3, 1970, four stations (Hominy OK, Woodward OK, Pleasanton KS, and Garden City KS) of the Prairie Meteorite Network simultaneously photographed the track of a meteoroid fireball.[tpl]citation |author=R. E. McCrosky et al. |date= August 1971 |title=Lost City Meteorite: Its Recovery and a Comparison with Other Fireballs |periodical=Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Special Report #336 [/tpl] Analysis of the photographs indicated that a meteorite might have landed within an area east of Lost City. This was the first time in the US that simultaneous photography of a fireball from multiple observation points was achieved, making it possible to calculate a trajectory and delimit a search area on the ground. Six days later, Gunther Schwartz, field manager  went to the Lost City school to ask questions to see if anyone had seen or heard anything about it, at that time a maintenance man and bus driver by the name of Isaac Gifford told the scientist he had seen it while he was raccoon hunting. Clifford took Schwartz to the spot where he had seen the meteorite in the air close to where he was hunting, they walked to the location and soon discovered the meteorite The Daily Oklahoman, January 15, 1970, pg. 7 "'Suddenly there was the black rock in the road, and I wondered what it was doing there, and got out to look at it,' Schwartz said. 'And then you get hysterical. Just think of the odds against finding it there. Fantastic.'"[/ref] within one-half mile of Lost City. Three additional smaller meteorite fragments were recovered later (January 17, 272 g; February 2, 6.6 kg; May 4, 640 g). The Lost City meteorite proved to be an H5 chondrite.Lost City, The Meteoritical Society.
