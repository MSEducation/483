They finished the season 26–9, 12–4 in WCC play to finish in third place. They lost in the semifinals of the West Coast Basketball Tournament to Gonzaga. They received an at-large bid to the 2012 NCAA Tournament where they defeated Iona in the First Four round before falling to in the second round to Marquette.

==Before the season==

The Cougars, coming off a 2010–11 season that saw them rise as high as #3 in the AP Poll and ended in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament, had to recover from major personnel losses. Consensus national player of the year Jimmer Fredette and all-time BYU steals leader Jackson Emery, called BYU's "best backcourt ever" by Salt Lake Tribune writer Jay Drew, both graduated.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/cougars/52721859-88/byu-cougars-rose-fredette.html.csp |title=BYU basketball: Cougars adjust to life without Jimmer Fredette |first=Jay |last=Drew |work=Salt Lake Tribune |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011[/tpl] Another frequent starter, freshman swingman Kyle Collinsworth, temporarily left the team to go on a two-year LDS mission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/22703/byus-kyle-collinsworth-to-go-on-mission |title=BYU's Kyle Collinsworth to go on mission |first=Diamond |last=Leung |work=College Basketball Nation Blog |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011[/tpl]
The Cougars were picked to finish third in the WCC by the media.

===Recruiting===

Gaining size was a key for the 2011 BYU team. In addition to a returning Brandon Davies that would help inside the paint, BYU focused on three centers, two of which are return missionaries who will have their first playing time. The third center, Isaac Nielson, committed to BYU and announced he would serve a church mission before joining the school for the 2013–14 season.

==2011 media==

The school began to hype the basketball season with basketball media days webcasts shown live on BYUtv.org Wednesday, October 12, 2011. Jarom Jordan interviewed all the players, except for Brandon Davies who chose to abstain from interviews until the regular season begins, from the Marriott Center. Common questions asked to the players were how they chose their numbers, what they expected for the upcoming season, what they thought of the new court, and the West Coast Conference. Additionally the Cougars announced that BYUtv would air a True Blue Basketball Preview special on Thursday, November 10, 2011. All Cougar games will be broadcast on the BYU Radio Sports Network with Greg Wrubell serving as the play-by-play man (unless he is away for football) and Mark Durrant providing analysis. When Wrubell is gone for football, Durrant will serve as the play-by-play man with Russ Larson serving as the analyst. Steve Cleveland will also provide analysis on the radio for select conference games. Dave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Steve Cleveland, Robbie Bullough, Jarom Jordan, and Lakia Holmes will provide coverage for BYUtv Sports throughout the season.
The Pre-season WCC poll expects the Cougars to finish 3rd behind Gonzaga and St. Mary's and just ahead of Santa Clara.
