CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Aelurillus is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).

==Description==

Aelurillus are typically about 7Â mm long in females, and up to five mm in males. They are stout, squat-shaped and rather furry, with females often uniformly mottled sandy brown, while males are often black, sometimes with a pattern and with light, annulated legs.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 273

==Habits==

Spiders in this genus mainly catch and feed on ants (myrmecophagy).
A Southeast Asian Aelurillus species has been observed to jump around 30-40 times its body length straight onto the back of a large gnaphosid spider and kill it.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 344
They like hot, dry, stony places or small bare open areas with dead twigs or similar amongst low vegetation.

==Distribution==

Aelurillus occurs in the Palaearctic and Africa, with a few species known from India (A. improvisus, A. minimontanus) and Sri Lanka (A. kronestedti, A. quadrimaculatus). Aelurillus subfestivus is found in Japan.
