==Career==

===Playboy career===

They are the Playmates for the December 1998 issue of Playboy magazine. According to an interview in their video centerfold, Nicole and Erica have tiny black ink dots (one and two dots, respectively) tattooed onto their buttocks, which their parents used to distinguish  the three girls when they were babies.
They are the second set of triplets to be featured in the United States edition of Playboy, after "The Trio from Rio, The Amazing Brazilian Triplets" who were featured in the November 1993 issue. The Dahm sisters were featured in several issues of Playboy, but only appeared on one cover, that of Playboy Australia for June 1999.
They tried out for Playboy's "Girls of the Big Ten" issue on the suggestion of their father.[tpl]cite web|author=Matthew Simpson |url=http://www.askmen.com/toys/top_10_60/82b_top_10_list.html |title=Karen McDougal gallery |publisher=AskMen.com |accessdate=June 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Television career===

The trio appeared on the show Boy Meets World in 1999. The trio was also on the Fox reality show Renovate My Family, where Jay McGraw was the host. All three appeared on Family Feud with their older sister Lisa, and father Bob. Along with their father and an assigned interior decorator, they also competed in and won the reality competition show House Wars; their prize for winning was to keep the house which they had renovated. 
The triplets more recently appeared as regular members of the mob on the final weeks of NBC's game show 1 vs. 100.1 vs. 100
The triplets have appeared on multiple episodes of The Doctors, where Jay McGraw is a producer, discussing a variety of topics, principally around their pregnancies, which all happened about the same time.

===Internet career===

The triplets had their own website, www.dahmgirls.com, which was active until late 2004. The members' area of the site featured photo galleries similar to those produced by Playboy. Toward the end of 2004, that site was replaced with www.jenx3.com (j, e, and n being their initials), which remained active only briefly and contained no nude pictorials. Neither site is currently available. Other appearances on the internet include a pictorial in the Playboy Cyber Club's celebrity photographer feature, shot by NASCAR racer Dale Earnhardt, Jr.
The Dahm Triplets have started their own cooking website called "Triplets Gourmet".http://www.tripletsgourmet.com/default.asp In addition, the triplets have opened up an account on YouTube also called "TripletsGourmet."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/TripletsGourmet |title=TripletsGourmet |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 3, 2012[/tpl] Their first video is their collection of recipes and the usefulness of freezing gourmet food.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piw60ETFtEY |title=Tips for Freezing Your Food from the Triplets Gourmet |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 3, 2012[/tpl]
