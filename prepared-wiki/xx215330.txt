The men's 1500 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 15 and 17 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/beijing/schedule.aspx?dc=SW|title=Olympic Swimming Schedule|publisher=USA Today|date=9 August 2008|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]
Competing at his third Games, Oussama Mellouli made an Olympic milestone to become Tunisia's first ever gold medalist in 48 years. He denied Australia's Grant Hackett a third straight title in the event, touching the wall first in an African record of 14:40.84. Hanging with the leaders through the first two-thirds of the race, Mellouli moved into the lead at the 1,100-metre mark, and held off Hackett's sprinted finish on the final lap. This was also a retribution for Mellouli, who served an 18-month doping ban from FINA for using the banned stimulant Adderall.[tpl]cite news|title=Mellouli shatters Hackett's hat-trick bid|url=http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=2818&section=latestnews|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=17 August 2008|accessdate=16 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Mellouli claims 1500m swim gold|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/swimming/7566090.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2008|accessdate=16 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Ous Mellouli Claims Olympic Gold for Tunisia in Men's 1500 Free|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18854.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]
