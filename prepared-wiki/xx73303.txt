Marsupilami is a fictional comic book species created by André Franquin, first published on 31 January 1952 in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou.[tpl]cite web| last =franquin.com | title =Franquin-Une vie-1952 | url =http://www.franquin.com/bio/1952.php [/tpl][tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Since then it appeared regularly in the popular Belgian comic book series Spirou et Fantasio until Franquin stopped working on the series in 1968 and the character dropped out soon afterward. In the late 1980s, the Marsupilami got its own successful spin-off series of comic albums, Marsupilami, written by Greg, Yann and Dugomier and drawn by Batem, launching the publishing house Marsu Productions. Later, two animated shows featuring this character, as well as a Sega Genesis video game and a variety of other merchandise followed. The asteroid 98494 Marsupilami is named in its honour.
The name is a portmanteau of the words marsupial, Pilou-Pilou (the French name for Eugene the Jeep, a character Franquin loved as a kid) and ami, French for friend.
Marsupilami's adventures had been translated to several languages, like Dutch, German, Spanish,  Portuguese and several Scandinavian languages. More than three million albums of the Marsupilami series are claimed to have been sold by Marsu Productions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|title=Marsu Productions : Merchandising – Promotion – Edition tout pour la BD  et bande dessinée|publisher=Marsuproductions.com|language=French|date=|accessdate=2014-01-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202083439/http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|archivedate=2 February 2009[/tpl]
One album of Spirou and Fantasio featuring Marsupilami, number 15, was translated to English by Fantasy Flight Publishing in 1995, although it is currently out of print. Plans on releasing number 16 ended halfway through the translation process, due to bad sales. In 2007, Egmont's subsidiary Euro Books translated albums number 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 for the Indian market.
