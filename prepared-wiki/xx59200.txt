Continental Connection was a brand name under which several commuter airline carriers and their holding companies operated services marketed exclusively by Continental Airlines. As such all Continental Connection banner carrier (Commercial Aviation) services were provided using piston-engine or turboprop aircraft, in contrast to Continental Express, whose flights were operated by Continental's regional jet partners, ExpressJet Airlines and Chautauqua Airlines.
All flights on Continental Connection are given full OnePass frequent flyer credit, as if they were mainline Continental flights.
The "Continental Connection" name was discontinued and the operation was renamed United Express.
