Jonathan Earl Franzen (born August 17, 1959) is an American novelist and essayist. His 2001 novel, The Corrections, a sprawling, satirical family drama, drew widespread critical acclaim, earned Franzen a National Book Award, was a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction finalist, earned a James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.

Franzen writes for The New Yorker magazine. His 1996 Harper's essay Perchance to Dream bemoaned the state of contemporary literature. Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his purveyance of opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter ("the ultimate irresponsible medium") and the proliferation of e-books ("just not permanent enough") to the disintegration of Europe ("The people making the decisions in Europe are bankers. The technicians of finance are making the decisions there. It has very little to do with democracy or the will of the people.") and the self-destruction of America ("almost a rogue state").[tpl]cite news|first=Alison|last=Flood|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/07/jonathan-franzen-calls-twitter-irresponsible|title=Jonathan Franzen: 'Twitter is the ultimate irresponsible medium'|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2012-03-07[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Alison|last=Flood|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jan/30/jonathan-franzen-ebooks-values|title=Jonathan Franzen warns ebooks are corroding values|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2012-01-30[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first1=Sarfraz|last1=Manzoor|first2=Alex|last2=Healey|first3=Michael|last3=Tait|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/video/2010/oct/25/jonathan-franzen-freedom|title=Jonathan Franzen: 'America is almost a rogue state'|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2010-10-25[/tpl]

Here he met Michael A. Martone, on whom he would later base the character Walter Berglund in Freedom.Ferguson, Mark. "75 Years of the Junior Year in Munich."  Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching of German 40.2 (Fall 2007): 124-132; p.132. He also studied on a Fulbright Scholarship at Freie Universität Berlin in Berlin in 1981-82.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pen.org/author.php/prmAID/54|title=Jonathan Franzen|work=PEN American Center[/tpl] From these experiences, he speaks fluent German. Upon graduation Franzen got married and moved with his wife to Boston to pursue a career as a novelist. When this plan fell through, they moved to New York, in 1987, where Franzen managed to sell his first novel, The Twenty-Seventh City.[tpl]cite news|first=Nina|last=Willdorf|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/multi-page/documents/01997111.htm|title=An author's story: How literary It Boy Jonathan Franzen spun himself into a tornado of controversy|work=The Phoenix[/tpl]

==Early novels==

The Twenty-Seventh City, published in 1988, is set in Franzen's hometown, St. Louis, and deals with the city's fall from grace, St. Louis having been the "fourth city" in the 1870s. This sprawling novel was warmly received and established Franzen as an author to watch.Laura Shapiro, "Terra Not So Firma," Newsweek, January 20, 1992. (Shapiro: "A huge and masterly drama of St. Louis under siege, gripping and surreal and overwhelmingly convincing." Shapiro also noted The Twenty-Seventh City's "brilliance," and the author's "prodigious gifts," concluding, "The news that he is at work on a third novel is welcome indeed."] In a conversation with novelist Donald Antrim for Bomb Magazine, Franzen described The Twenty-Seventh City as  "a conversation with the literary figures of my parents' generation, the great sixties and seventies Postmoderns.",Antrim, Donald. "Jonathan Franzen". Bomb Magazine. Fall 2001. Retrieved 2011-07-27. adding in a later interview "I was a skinny, scared kid trying to write a big novel. The mask I donned was that of a rhetorically airtight, extremely smart, extremely knowledgeable middle-aged writer."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6054/the-art-of-fiction-no-207-jonathan-franzen|title=Jonathan Franzen, The Art of Fiction No. 207|work=The Paris Review|author=Stephen J. Burn|date=Winter 2010[/tpl]
Strong Motion (1992) focuses on a dysfunctional family, the Hollands, and uses seismic events on the American East Coast as a metaphor for the quakes that occur in family life (as Franzen put it, "I imagined static lives being disrupted from without—literally shaken. I imagined violent scenes that would strip away the veneer and get people shouting angry moral truths at each other."). A 'systems novel', the key 'systems' of Strong Motion according to Franzen are "... the systems of science and religion—two violently opposing systems of making sense in the world." The novel was not a critical or financial success at the time of its publication, and Franzen subsequently defended the novel in his 2010 Paris Review interview, remarking "I think they and readers may be overlooking Strong Motion a little bit."

==The Corrections==

Franzen's The Corrections, a novel of social criticism, garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United States, winning both the 2001 National Book Award for Fiction[ref]

In September 2001, The Corrections was selected for Oprah Winfrey's book club. Franzen initially participated in the selection, sitting down for a lengthy interview with Oprah and appearing in B-roll footage in his hometown of St. Louis (described in an essay in How To Be Alone titled "Meet Me In St. Louis"). In October 2001, however, The Oregonian printed an article in which Franzen expressed unease with the selection. In an interview on National Public Radio's Fresh Air, he expressed his worry that the Oprah logo on the cover dissuaded men from reading the book:
[tpl]quote|So much of reading is sustained in this country, I think, by the fact that women read while men are off golfing or watching football on TV or playing with their flight simulator or whatever. I worry — I'm sorry that it's, uh — I had some hope of actually reaching a male audience and I've heard more than one reader in signing lines now at bookstores say "If I hadn't heard you, I would have been put off by the fact that it is an Oprah pick. I figure those books are for women. I would never touch it." Those are male readers speaking. I see this as my book, my creation.[tpl]cite news|first=Terry|last=Gross|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1131456|title=Novelist Jonathan Franzen|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|date=October 15, 2001[/tpl][/tpl]
Soon afterward, Franzen's invitation to appear on Oprah's show was rescinded. Winfrey announced, "Jonathan Franzen will not be on the Oprah Winfrey show because he is seemingly uncomfortable and conflicted about being chosen as a book club selection. It is never my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or cause anyone conflict. We have decided to skip the dinner and we're moving on to the next book."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mobylives.com/Oprah_v_Franzen.html|title=You go, girl… and she went|work=The Age|date=2006-01-21|accessdate=2007-04-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/obc/pastbooks/jonathan_franzen/obc_user_communication.jhtml|title=Oprah's Book Club user communication, October 22, 2001[/tpl]
These events gained Franzen and his novel widespread media attention. The Corrections soon became one of the decade's best-selling works of literary fiction. At the National Book Award ceremony, Franzen said "I'd also like to thank Oprah Winfrey for her enthusiasm and advocacy on behalf of The Corrections."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_jfranzen.html|title=National Book Awards Acceptance Speeches: Jonathan Franzen|work=National Book Foundation|year=2001|accessdate=2007-04-04[/tpl]
Following the success of The Corrections and the publication of The Discomfort Zone and How to Be Alone, Franzen began work on his next novel. In the interim, he published two short stories in The New Yorker: "Breakup Stories", published November 8, 2004, concerned the disintegration of four relationships; and "Two's Company", published May 23, 2005, concerned a couple who write for TV, then split up.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/jonathan_franzen/search?contributorName=jonathan%20franzen&page=1&sort=publishDateSort%20desc,%20score%20desc&queryType=parsed|title=jonathan franzen: Contributors|work=The New Yorker|date=|accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl]
In 2011, it was announced that Franzen would write a multi-part television adaptation of The Corrections in collaboration with The Squid and The Whale director Noah Baumbach for HBO.[tpl]cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Neal|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/noah-baumbach-developing-jonathan-franzens-the-cor,61383/|title=Noah Baumbach developing Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections as HBO series|work=A.

==Freedom==

On June 8, 2009, Franzen published an extract from Freedom, his novel in progress, in The New Yorker. The extract, titled "Good Neighbors", concerned the trials and tribulations of a couple in St. Paul, Minnesota. On May 31, 2010, a second extract — titled "Agreeable" — was published, also in The New Yorker.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/05/31/100531fi_fiction_franzen|publisher=The New Yorker|date=2010-05-31|title=Agreeable|author=Jonathan Franzen |date=May 31, 2010 [/tpl]
On October 16, 2009, Franzen made an appearance alongside David Bezmozgis at the New Yorker Festival at the Cedar Lake Theatre, reading a portion of his forthcoming novel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/festival/schedule/index/friday#bezmozgis|title=Festival |work=The New Yorker|date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2009/11/55140/the-franzen-interface/|title=The Franzen Interface|work=North by Northwestern |date=|accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl] Sam Allard, writing for North By Northwestern about the event, said that the "…material from his new (reportedly massive) novel" was "as buoyant and compelling as ever" and "marked by his familiar undercurrent of tragedy". Franzen read "an extended clip from the second chapter."
On September 9, 2010, Franzen appeared on Fresh Air to discuss Freedom in the wake of its release. Franzen has drawn what he describes as a "feminist critique" for the attention that male authors receive over female authors—a critique he supports. Franzen also discussed his friendship with David Foster Wallace and the impact of Wallace's suicide on his writing process.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129747555|title=Franzen On The Book, The Backlash, His Background|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-10[/tpl]
Freedom  was the subject of a highly unusual "recall" in the United Kingdom starting in early October 2010.  An earlier draft of the manuscript, to which Franzen had made over 200 changes, had been published by mistake.  The publisher, HarperCollins initiated an exchange program, but thousands of books had been distributed by that time.[tpl]cite news|first1=Alison|last1=Flood|first2=Rowenna|last2=Davis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/01/jonathan-franzen-freedom-uk-recall|title=Jonathan Franzen's book Freedom suffers UK recall|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2010-10-01[/tpl]
While promoting the book, Franzen became the first American author to appear on the cover of Time magazine since Stephen King did so in 2000. Franzen did so alongside the headline "Great American Novelist".[tpl]cite news|first=Craig|last=Fehrman|url=http://www.themillions.com/2010/08/the-franzen-cover-and-a-brief-history-of-time.html|title=The Franzen Cover and a Brief History of Time|work=The Millions|date=August 16, 2010[/tpl] He discussed the implications of the Time coverage, and the reasoning behind the title of Freedom in an interview in Manchester, England, in October 2010.[tpl]cite news|first=Dave|last=Haslam|url=http://www.davehaslam.com/Franzen.html |title=Onstage interview with celebrated American novelist Jonathan Franzen|work=Dave Haslam, Author and DJ - Official Site|date=October 3, 2010[/tpl]

==Fifth novel==

In a Q&A interview with Portland Monthly on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently has "a four-page, single-spaced proposal" for a fifth novel he is currently working on,http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/books-and-talks/articles/q-and-a-with-jonathan-franzen-january-2013 although he went on to suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, "I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, “How come I couldn’t see that? What is all this other stuff?”". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding "I’ve let go of any illusion that I’m a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me".

==Other works==

In 1996, while still working on The Corrections, Franzen published a literary manifesto in Harper's Magazine entitled Perchance to Dream. Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and Tom Wolfe, among others, Franzen grappled with the novelist's role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel. In the end, Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great social novel about issues and ideas, in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions. Given the huge success of The Corrections, this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen's goals as both a literary and commercially-minded author.[tpl]cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/1996/04/0007955|title=Perchance to dream: In the age of images, a reason to write novels|work=Harper's|year=1996[/tpl]
In 2002, Franzen published a critique of the novels of William Gaddis, entitled "Mr. Difficult", in The New Yorker.  He begins by recounting how some readers felt The Corrections was spoiled by being too high-brow in parts, and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction.  He proposes a "Status model", whereby the point of fiction is to be Art, and also a "Contract model", whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment, and finds that he subscribes to both models.  He praises The Recognitions, admits that he only got half-way through J R, and explains why he does not like the rest of Gaddis's novels.[tpl]cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/09/30/020930fa_fact_franzen|title=Mr. Difficult|work=The New Yorker|year=2002[/tpl]
Since The Corrections Franzen has published How to Be Alone (2002), a collection of essays including "Perchance To Dream", and The Discomfort Zone (2006), a memoir. How To Be Alone is essentially an apologia for reading, articulating Franzen's uncomfortable relationship with the place of fiction in contemporary society. It also probes the influence of his childhood and adolescence on his creative life, which is then further explored in The Discomfort Zone.
In September 2007, Franzen's translation of Frank Wedekind's play Spring Awakening ([tpl]lang-de|Frühlings Erwachen[/tpl]) was published. In his introduction, Franzen describes the Broadway musical version as "insipid" and "overpraised." In an interview with New York magazine, Franzen stated that he had in fact made the translation for Swarthmore College's theater department for $50 in 1986 and that it had sat in a drawer for 20 years since. After the Broadway show stirred up so much interest, Franzen said he was inspired to publish it because "I knew it was a good translation, better than anything else out there."[tpl]cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/37214/|title=Q&A With 'Spring Awakening: A Play' Translator Jonathan Franzen|date=2007-09-10|accessdate=2009-01-21[/tpl]
Franzen published a social commentary on cell phones, sentimentality, and the decline of public space, I Just Called To Say I Love You (2008),[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/21173/?a=f|title=I Just Called to Say I Love You|date=September/October 2008, Technology Review|accessdate=2010-12-01[/tpl] in the September/October 2008 issue of "Technology Review", published by MIT.
In 2012 he published Farther Away, a collection of essays dealing with such topics as his love of birds, his friendship with David Foster Wallace, and his thoughts on technology.[tpl]cite news|last=Lopate|first=Phillip|title=Manageable Discontents|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/books/review/farther-away-essays-by-jonathan-franzen.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=18 July 2012|date=May 18, 2012[/tpl]
In 2013, Franzen published The Kraus Project. It consists of three major essays by the "Perennially ... impossible to translate"http://www.melleragency.com/shared/detail.php?id=24916 Austrian "playwright, poet, social commentator and satirical genius" Karl Kraus - "“Heine and the Consequences” a takedown of the beloved German poet, “Nestroy and Posterity” which established that playwright’s reputation in Austria to this day, and “Afterword to Heine and the Consequences”". The essays are accompanied by "Franzen’s  own plentiful, trenchant yet off-beat annotations" taking on "... Kraus’ mantle-commenting on what Kraus would say (and what Franzen’s opinion is) about Macs and PCs; decrying Twitter’s claim of credit for the Arab Spring; and unfurling how media conglomerates influence on politics in their quest for profits."

==Philosophy==

In a lecture on autobiography and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often addressed to him by others, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, and what do you write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters "take over" and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular "This one always raises my blood pressure" and quoted Nabokov in response.[tpl]cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Franzen|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/may/25/jonathan-franzen-the-path-to-freedom|title=Jonathan Franzen: the path to Freedom|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2012-05-25[/tpl]
In February 2010, Franzen (along with writers such as Richard Ford, Zadie Smith and Anne Enright) was asked by The Guardian to contribute what he believed were ten serious rules to abide by for aspiring writers.[tpl]cite news|first1=Geoff|last1=Dyer|first2=David|last2=Hare|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one|title=Ten rules for writing fiction|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2010-02-20|accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl] Franzen's rules ran as follows:
