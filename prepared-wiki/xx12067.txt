Wallace and Gromit is a British stop motion comedy franchise. Created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations, the series consists of four short films and a feature-length film. The series centres on Wallace, an absent-minded inventor and cheese enthusiast, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet intelligent anthropomorphic dog.
The duo live in the north of England at 62 West Wallaby Street. Wallace is primarily voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, and alternatively by Ben Whitehead when Sallis is not available. Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language.
Wallace and Gromit has been translated into over 20 languages and has a particularly big following in Japan, as well as in its native Britain and across Europe and the United States.
Because of their endearing (if quirky) personalities and widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international icons of both modern British culture in particular and British people in general. BBC News has called them "some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK".Wallace and Gromit's cracking careers. By Ian Youngs. BBC News. Published 10 October 2005. Icons has said they have done "more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors".Wallace and Gromit. icons.org.uk. Retrieved 7 June 2009.
The short films The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave and the full length feature The Curse of the Were-Rabbit released in 2005 have all received Academy Awards. The first short film, A Grand Day Out first shown in 1989, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but lost to Creature Comforts, another animated creation of Nick Park.
The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was Nick Park's first production since his five-film deal with DreamWorks broke down in 2008 after only three films; also including Flushed Away. Park said later that culture clash contributed to the collapse of the relationship: DreamWorks couldn't help but try to Americanise the very British Wallace and Gromit, tarnishing some of the duo's nostalgic charm.
The most recent short film A Matter of Loaf and Death was likewise nominated in 2010, but lost to Logorama. 
The films have received critical acclaim, with all four of the short films having 100% positive ratings on aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes and the feature film having a 95% rating, placing it in the top 20 animated feature films on the site.
In 2012, Wallace and Gromit featured on an advert saying 'Inventing For Britain' which was part of a poster campaign to promote British trade and business aboard in the year they hosted the Olympics. In 2013, sculptures of Gromit went on display in Bristol, many decorated by famous artists, they were auctioned off in October 2013 in aid of the Wallace and Gromit Foundation charity and raised over £2 million.
In 2013, Peter Lord tweeted that there were no plans at the moment for a new short film.

==Wallace==

Voiced by Peter Sallis (until 2010), and Ben Whitehead in Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures and Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels,  commercials and apps. Wallace can usually be found wearing a white shirt, brown wool trousers, a green knitted pullover, and a red tie. He is best known for his love of cheese, especially Wensleydale,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php |title=WallaceAndGromit.net |publisher=WallaceAndGromit.net |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] and crackers.  His birthday is 7 August. The thought of Lancashire hotpot keeps him going in a crisis. He enjoys tea, and on special occasions a little Bordeaux red. He reads the Morning, Afternoon and Evening Post.
Wallace is an inveterate inventor, creating elaborate contraptions that often do not work as intended. He is a self-proclaimed genius, evident from his exclamation when he discovers Hutch's borrowed skill, a talent for all things mechanical. Most of Wallace's inventions look not unlike the designs of W. Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg, and Nick Park has said of Wallace that all his inventions are designed around the principle of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Wallace's official job varies; in A Close Shave he is a window washer.  In The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Wallace runs a humane pest control service, keeping the captured creatures (nearly all of which are rabbits) in the basement of his house. In the most recent short, A Matter of Loaf and Death, he is a baker.
Some of Wallace's contraptions are based on real-life inventions. For example, his method of waking up in the morning utilizes a bed that tips over to wake up its owner, an invention that was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851 by Theophilus Carter, and is similar to a device sold in Japan that is used to ensure the sleeper awakens on time by inflating a pillow under their normal pillow and rolling the person, thus waking them up.
He has a kindly nature, and is perhaps a little over-optimistic. At times he can be inadvertently selfish and inconsiderate, but he has a good heart and always means well.  Nick Park, his creator, says: "He's a very self-contained figure. A very homely sort who doesn't mind the odd adventure." He is loosely based on Nick Park's father,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/2314009.stm |title=Talking Point | Forum | Ask Wallace and Gromit creator: Nick Park |publisher=BBC News |date=15 October 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] whom Park described in a radio interview as "an incurable tinkerer". He described one of his father's constructions, a combination beach hut and trailer, as having curtains in the windows, bookshelves on the walls, and full-sized furniture bolted to the floor. The way he dresses and his passion for cheese is based on an eccentric school teacher.
In the first photo shown on The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it was revealed that once, when Gromit was little, Wallace had much more hair and a beard. On the photo that shows Gromit's graduation at Dogwarts, he had lost his beard, but still had a little hair, in the form of side burns just above his ears. As shown in The Wrong Trousers, he still uses a hair-dryer. In a "Matter of Loaf and Death", when Wallace is talking to Gromit, a picture is seen behind Gromit of Wallace with a brown beard and brown hair.
Wallace has had three love interests. The first was Wendolene Ramsbottom,http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004598/ which ended quickly when Wendolene told Wallace that she was allergic to cheese. The second was Lady Tottington in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, whom Wallace fondly calls "Totty". In A Matter of Loaf and Death, Wallace becomes engaged to Piella Bakewell,[tpl]cite web|author=A Close Shave |url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/films/loafanddeath/characters.html |title=Characters |publisher=Wallace and Gromit |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] but this ended when she turned out to be a murderess who hated bakers, and she was eaten by crocodiles upon trying to escape justice. He remembers all three though, since in Musical Marvels, after the montage of his three love interests, he refers to them as "the ones that got away".

==Gromit==

Gromit is Wallace's pet dog and also is generally more intelligent than Wallace. His birthday is 12 February.In an early scene in The Wrong Trousers, Gromit notes the date on a monthly calendar that is unlabeled but contains 29 days. Gromit graduated from "Dogwarts University" ('Dogwarts' being a pun on 'Hogwarts', the wizard school from the Harry Potter books) with a double first in Engineering for Dogs.Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Wallace & Gromit: Annual 2007 He likes knitting, playing chess, reading the newspaper and cooking. His prized possessions include his alarm clock, dog bone, brush, and a framed photo of himself with Wallace. He is also very handy with electronic equipment and an excellent aeroplane pilot. Though this is not mentioned a lot, according to Wallace or any other person he is a beagle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/characters/gromit.html |title=Wallace & Gromit — Characters — Gromit |publisher=Wallaceandgromit.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] More often than not, he is seen as a threat to the plans of the various villains he and Wallace have encountered in their adventures.
Gromit has no visible mouth and he does not express himself through spoken words, but his facial expressions and body language speak volumes. Peter Hawkins originally intended to voice Gromit, but Park dropped the idea when he realized how Gromit's expressions could easily be made through small movements.[tpl]cite book |author=Andy Lane |title=The World of Wallace and Gromit |year=2004 |publisher=BoxTree |page=43 |isbn=9780752215587[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Nigel Farndale|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3831833/Wallace-and-Gromit-one-man-and-his-dog.html|title=Wallace and Gromit: one man and his dog|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=18 December 2008|location=London[/tpl]
Many critics believe that Gromit's silence makes him the perfect straight man with a pantomime expressiveness that drew favourable comparisons to Buster Keaton.Review of Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in Variety. He does at times make dog-like noises, such as yelps and growling.Gromit Speaks Nick Park says: "We are a nation of dog-lovers and so many people have said: 'My dog looks at me just like Gromit does!'" Gromit enjoys eating "KornFlakes" and reading many books, including The Republic, by Pluto (a nod to the Disney character of the same name and a pun on Plato); Crime and Punishment, by Fido Dogstoyevsky (a pun on Fyodor Dostoyevsky); and a "how-to" guide entitled, Electronics for Dogs. In A Matter of Loaf and Death, a copy of "Pup Fiction" is seen in the bin, a pun on Pulp Fiction. He also listens to Bach, knits, and solves puzzles with ease.
Sometimes, Gromit refuses to take (or simply ignores) Wallace's orders, such as in A Close Shave and Shopper 13, wherein Wallace orders him to get rid of Shaun, but Gromit does not.
NASA named one of its new prototype Mars explorer robots after Gromit in 2005.[tpl]Cite news|title=NASA's new robots show their stuff: Gromit, K-9 have the smarts to travel on the moon, Mars |author=David Perlman |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=4 October 2005 |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/10/04/MNGM7F25CD1.DTL  [/tpl]
On 1 April 2007, HMV announced that Gromit would stand in for Nipper for a three-month period, promoting children's DVDs in its UK stores.
Gromit has had one love interest: Fluffles, a poodle and pet to Piella. Fluffles does not share her mistress's hatred of bakers and joined Wallace and Gromit delivering bread at the end of A Matter of Loaf and Death, where she is seen with Gromit making a delivery, while listening to "Puppy Love" (performed, according to the record cover by "Doggy Osmond").
In 2010, Empire magazine placed Gromit first in their list of "The 50 best animated movie characters". Empire wrote that; "Gromit doesn't ever say a word, but there has never been a more expressive character (animated or otherwise) to grace our screens."

==Location==

While not overtly setting the series in any particular town, Nick Park had previously hinted that its milieu was inspired by thoughts of 1950s Wigan, reinforced by an A-Z Wigan being displayed on Wallace's Anti-Pesto van in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In The Wrong Trousers, Gromit picks up a letter at the Wallace and Gromit residence addressed to "62 West Wallaby Street, Wigan". The address includes a postcode of WG7 7FU, though this does not match any street in Wigan, whose postcodes begin with the letters WN. This address can also be seen in the Cracking Contraptions episode  "Shopper 13".
Wallace's accent (voiced by Peter Sallis) comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire. Near the beginning of A Matter of Loaf and Death, Wigan is referenced on the newspaper Wallace is reading, and near the end, while looking for somewhere appropriate to dispose of a bomb, Gromit sees the Yorkshire border from their home (a joke referencing the rivalry between Lancashire and Yorkshire).
In the Cracking Contraptions episode "The Soccamatic", Wallace says to Gromit, "How do you like my Preston North End soccamatic, Gromit?". Whether this is the team they support, or rather where they live, is unknown.
Both Ramsbottom and Tottington are small towns near Bury in Greater Manchester, and both are the names of love interests of Wallace.
At the end of A Grand Day Out, Wallace tells Gromit to set coordinates for "62 West Wallaby Street" as they are returning to Earth.
Other people have said that Wallace's home town is not unlike Beanotown.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3831833/Wallace-and-Gromit-one-man-and-his-dog.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nigel | last=Farndale | title=Wallace and Gromit: one man and his dog | date=18 December 2008[/tpl]

==Stop-motion technique==

The Wallace and Gromit movies are shot using the stop motion animation technique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.andybrain.com/archive/stop-motion-claymation.htm |title=DIY Wallace and Gromit: How to make free stop motion animated movies |publisher=Andybrain.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] After detailed storyboarding, set and plasticine model construction, the movies are shot one frame at a time, moving the models of the characters slightly to give the impression of movement in the final film. In common with other animation techniques, the stop motion animation in Wallace and Gromit may duplicate frames if there is little motion, and in action scenes sometimes multiple exposures per frame are used to produce a faux motion blur. Because a second of film constitutes 24 separate frames, even a short half-hour film like A Close Shave takes a great deal of time to animate well. General quotes on the speed of animation of a Wallace and Gromit film put the filming rate at typically around 30 frames per day — i.e. just over one second of film is photographed for each day of production. Resultingly, the full films take a great deal of time to produce. The feature-length The Curse of the Were-Rabbit took 15 months to make.
As with Park's previous movies, the special effects achieved within the limitations of the stop motion technique were quite pioneering and ambitious. In A Close Shave, for example, consider the soap suds in the window cleaning scene, and the projectile globs of porridge in Wallace's house. There was even an explosion in "The Auto Chef", part of the Cracking Contraptions shorts. Some effects (particularly fire, smoke, and floating bunnies) in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit proved impossible to do in stop motion and so were rendered on computer.
Park has consistently turned down requests for an ongoing television series because of the time and effort that would be required for even a single episode.
Most of the models were destroyed in the 2005 Aardman studio fire, but a set from A Matter of Loaf and Death is presently on display at the At-Bristol science centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/animateit.html|title=At-Bristol Animate It[/tpl]
