[[PostScript Printer Description]]

CATEGORIES: PostScript, Computer file formats

PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files are created by vendors to describe the entire set of features and capabilities available for their PostScript printers.
A PPD also contains the PostScript code (commands) used to invoke features for the print job. As such, PPDs function as drivers for all PostScript printers, by providing a unified interface for the printer's capabilities and features. For example, a generic PPD file for all models of HP Color LaserJet contains:
 *% =================================
 *% Basic Device Capabilities
 *% =================================
 *LanguageLevel: "2"
 *ColorDevice: True
 *DefaultColorSpace: CMYK
 *TTRasterizer: Type42
 *FileSystem: False
 *Throughput: "10"
which specifies that the printer understands PostScript Level 2, is a color device, and so forth. The PPD can describe allowable paper sizes, memory configurations, the minimum font set for the printer, and even specify a tree-based user interface for printer-specific configuration.

==CUPS==

CUPS uses PPD drivers for all of its PostScript printers, and has even extended the concept to allow for PostScript printing to non-PostScript printing devices, by directing output through a CUPS filter. Such a file is no longer a standard PPD, but rather a "CUPS-PPD".
CUPS clients usually read the current PPD file from the server every time a new print job is created.

==Windows==

Microsoft Windows also uses PPD files but converts these to a binary .BPD file format before using them. These are normally stored in C:\WINDOWS\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\3 on a x86 system, or C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3 on a 64 bit system. Updating the PPD files requires removing and then reinstalling the printer.

==MIME Type==

The MIME type for the CUPS variant of PPD is application/vnd.cups.ppd.IANA: http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.cups-ppd
