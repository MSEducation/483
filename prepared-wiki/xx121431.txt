[[Darwin Dam]]

CATEGORIES: Western Tasmania, West Coast Range (Tasmania), Hydro Tasmania dams

Darwin Dam  is one of two dams that contain Lake Burbury, West Coast, Tasmania.
It captures the high rainfall in the catchment of the King River.
In the 1910s the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company had investigated and surveyed a site very close to this dam for a proposed scheme.
The water is piped down a 7Â km tunnel to the John Butters Power StationHEC (no date) King River Power development page 13 - calling it the ''Headrace Tunnel' which is close to the confluence of the King River with the Queen River.
