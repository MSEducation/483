==History==

In the 1920s Philip Wright of Wollomombi led the push to have this area declared a National Park. Most of the area was declared a reserve in 1931 and in 1935 dedicated for public recreation. Between 1934 and 1956 mining leases for antimony were granted.Donald, J.Kay, Exploring the North Coast and New England, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1978, ISBN 0-86417-121-8

==Geography==

Located on the precipitous escarpment on the east of the undulating Northern Tablelands plateau, the wilderness consists of impressive cliffs, rugged ridges, spurs and streams. To the west the Nymboida, Guy Fawkes and Styx Rivers drain across the tablelands.[tpl]cite book |title=New England National Park Plan Of Management |year=1991 |publisher=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service |location= |isbn=0-7305-2314-4 |pages= [/tpl] To the east is the thickly forested Bellinger River valley.
The Cunnawarra National Park adjoins the New England National Park on the north-western boundary and the Bellinger River National Park joins it on the north-eastern corner.National Parks of the Waterfall Way, NSW NPWS, 2002
Public access to the park focuses on the Point Lookout area (1,563 m above sea level), from where on a clear day the Pacific Ocean is visible. This lookout is the second tallest mountain in the region and one of the highest places north of the Snowy Mountains.

==Flora and fauna==

The park lies within the Eastern Australian temperate forests ecoregion.[tpl]cite journal |author = Olson, D. M, E. Dinerstein, et al |title = Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal = BioScience |year = 2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages= 933–938 |url = http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)0510933:TEOTWA2.0.CO;2 [/tpl] It is noted for the wide variety of plant and animal species. The diverse vegetation in the park includes sub-tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate rainforest in the higher altitudes. There are also areas of sclerophyll forest, sub-alpine woodland, heathland and swampland.  In the eucalpyt forests Brush box, Sydney blue gum and Tallow-wood predominate.[tpl]cite book |title=Walks, Tracks and Trails of New South Wales |last=Derrick |first=Stone |year=2012 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=0643106928 |pages=20–21 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i-nTbc01KK8C |accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl]
Heathland is found at Wrights Lookout and in other patches. Previous estimates of the number of different plant species in the park place the figure at 500. This figure has been revised upwards to around 1,000. This includes snow gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora), Antarctic Beech, tree ferns and red cedars (Toona ciliata).
Dingos, Koalas, Tiger Quolls, Common Bentwing Bats, Brown Antechinuses, and Northern Brown Bandicoots are some of the mammals found in the park.

At least 100 species of birds have been recorded.

New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service Eastern Whipbirds, Eastern Bristlebirds, Crimson Rosellas, Australian King Parrots and several kinds of honeyeaters also inhabit the reserve.
The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports one of five remaining populations of Rufous Scrub-birds, as well as of Flame and Pale-yellow Robins, Paradise Riflebirds, Green Catbirds, Regent Bowerbirds and Australian Logrunners.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: New England |accessdate=2011-08-30 |work= Birdata |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]

==Facilities==

There is an extensive walking track system that traverses the higher areas of the park.
Limited accommodation is available in the park at Banksia Point. If visiting in winter it is a good idea to bring warm clothes because at such a high altitude the region experiences frequent snow falls and cold temperatures.
