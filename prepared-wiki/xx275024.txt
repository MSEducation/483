It contains a Sufi tale designed to describe the soul's present state and its liberation, in the form of an exciting story: King Kadam Rao wants to learn yoga. But the shrewd yogi bans the king's soul into a parrot, slips into the king's body and rules in his place. The vizier Padam Rao notices it, searches the King and finally finds and frees him.
