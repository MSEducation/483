==Season summary==

The quality of the competition in 1918 suffered due to the loss of players fighting in World War I.[tpl]cite news|last=Middleton|first=David|title=Ten of the most dominant seasons in rugby league history from historian David Middleton|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/ten-of-the-greatest-seasons-in-rugby-league-history-according-to-historian-david-middleton/story-fni3fbgz-1226729899765|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 September 2013[/tpl] Both South Sydney and Western Suburbs dominated the season, dropping just two and three games respectively. With just three rounds to go, both sides met each square on 18 points each. A win for South Sydney would virtually guarantee them the premiership unless they dropped their final two games. At the end of the day, South Sydney prevailed 11-3 and went on to win their remaining games as well, taking away their fourth premiership from 11 starts. 
The season also saw the struggling Dales fail to win a game from fourteen starts. It signalled the beginning of the downfall of the side, who would just play a further two seasons in the premiership.
The Western Suburbs club claim their first title by winning the knockout competition, the City Cup.
