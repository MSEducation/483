Mount Eccles National Park is a national park in Victoria, Australia, 270 km west of Melbourne.
Mount Eccles is located inside the national park and is the site of the most recent active volcano in Australia. The first activity was about 40,000 years ago when Mount Eccles was formed by lava pouring out the Earth's crust. The most recent eruption was approximately 8,000 years ago.
Mount Eccles is a fairly small hill surrounded by lush vegetation with a small hidden deep volcanic crater lake named Lake Surprise. It is famous for an adjacent lava tube and there are numerous lava tubes in the surrounding farm land.
The park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2004 as part of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape - Mount Eccles Lake Condah Area for its importance in Indigenous history and its geology.[tpl]Citation | last = Australian Heritage Database | title = Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/budj-bim/index.html | accessdate = 2010-05-28 [/tpl]
