[[Tetracyclic antidepressant]]

CATEGORIES: Tetracyclic antidepressants

Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) are a class of drugs used primarily as antidepressants that were first introduced in the 1970s. They are named after their chemical structure which contains four rings of atoms and are closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) which contain three rings of atoms.

==List of TeCAs==

The TeCAs include the following agents:
