Northern Failures is an album by Cable, released in 2001 by Hydra Head Records.  The album was produced by Steve Austin of Today Is The Day, the first of three releases he would produce for the group, and the band's last record for Hydra Head Records.  "Can't You See" is Marshall Tucker Band cover.  According to drummer Vic Szalaj, much of the album, from its title to the lyrics, were inspired by a 10 day trip he and bassist/vocalist Randy Larsen took to the White Mountains in New Hampshire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stonerrock.com/features/index.asp?FeatureID=148 |title=All That is Heavy - Vinyl Records, CDs, DVDs, T-Shirts |publisher=Stonerrock.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl]
