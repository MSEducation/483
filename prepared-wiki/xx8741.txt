Noah Webster, Jr. (October 16, 1758 – May 28, 1843), was a lexicographer, textbook pioneer, English-language spelling reformer, political writer, editor, and prolific author. He has been called the "Father of American Scholarship and Education". His blue-backed speller books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read, secularizing their education. According to Ellis (1979) he gave Americans "a secular catechism to the nation-state".Joseph Ellis, After the Revolution: Profiles of Early American Culture (1979) p 175
Webster's name has become synonymous with "dictionary" in the United States, especially the modern Merriam-Webster dictionary that was first published in 1828 as An American Dictionary of the English Language. He is considered one of the Founding Fathers of the nation.http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/book-review-the-forgotten-founding-father-noah-websters-obsession-and-the-creation-of-an-american-culture-by-joshua-kendall.html?pagewanted=all

==Biography==

Webster was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, to an established family. His father, Noah Sr. (1722–1813), was a descendant of Connecticut Governor John Webster; his mother Mercy (née Steele; 1727–1794) was a descendant of Governor William Bradford of Plymouth Colony.Noah had two brothers, Abraham (1751–1831) and Charles (b. 1762), and two sisters, Mercy (1749–1820) and Jerusha (1756–1831). His father was primarily a farmer though he was also deacon of the local Congregational church, captain of the town's militia, and a founder of a local book society—a precursor to the public library.Kendall, Joshua, The Forgotten Founding Father, p. 22. After American independence, he was appointed a justice of the peace.Kendall, p. 22.
Though Webster's father never attended college, he was intellectually curious and prized education; his mother spent long hours teaching Noah and his siblings spelling, mathematics and music.Kendall, pp. 21–23. At the age of six, Webster began attending a dilapidated one room primary school that had been built by West Hartford's Ecclesiastical Society. Many years later, he described the teachers as the "dregs of humanity" and complained that the instruction was mainly in religion.Kendall, pp. 22–24. Webster's negative experiences in primary school motivated him to improve the education experience of future generations.Kendall, p. 24.
At the age of fourteen, he began receiving tutoring in Latin and Greek from his church pastor to prepare for entrance to Yale College.Kendall, pp. 29–30. He enrolled at Yale just shy of his 16th birthday, studying during his senior year with the learned Ezra Stiles, Yale's president. His four years at Yale overlapped with the American Revolutionary War, and because of food shortages and threatened invasions by the British, many of his college classes were held in other towns. He served in the Connecticut Militia. His father had mortgaged the farm to send Webster to Yale, but the son was now on his own and had no more to do with his family.Richard Rollins, The Long Journey of Noah Webster (1980) p. 19.
Webster lacked firm career plans after graduating from Yale in 1778, later writing that a liberal education "disqualifies a man for business".Kendall, p. 54. He briefly taught school in Glastonbury, found the working conditions to be harsh and the pay low, then left to study law to increase in earning power.Kendall, p. 56. While studying law under the mentorship of Oliver Ellsworth, the future U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Webster held a full-time job teaching in Hartford—a schedule he found grueling, and ultimately impossible to sustain. After quitting his legal studies for a year and lapsing into a depression, he found another practicing attorney to mentor him, completing his studies and passing the bar examination in 1781.Kendall, pp. 58–59. However, with the Revolutionary War still ongoing, he could not find employment as a lawyer. He picked up a masters degree from Yale for giving an oral dissertation to the Yale graduating class, and later that year opened a small, private school in western Connecticut that was an instant success, though he quickly closed it and left town—likely due to a failed romance.Kendall, p. 59-64 Turning to literary work as a way to overcome his losses and channel his ambitions,Kendall, p. 65. he began writing a series of well-received articles for a prominent New England newspaper justifying and praising the American Revolution and arguing that the separation from Britain was permanent.Kendall, pp. 65–66. He then founded a private school catering to wealthy parents in Goshen, New York, and by 1785, he had written his speller, a grammar book and a reader for elementary schools.Kendall, pp. 69–71. Proceeds from continuing sales of the popular blue-backed speller enabled Webster to spend many years working on his famous dictionary.Kendall, pp. 71–74.

==Political vision==

Webster was by nature a revolutionary, seeking American independence from the cultural thralldom to Britain. To replace it he sought to create a utopian America, cleansed of luxury and ostentation and the champion of freedom.Rollins (1980) p 24 By 1781, Webster had an expansive view of the new nation. American nationalism was superior to Europe because American values were superior, he claimed.Ellis 170
Webster dedicated his Speller and Dictionary to providing an intellectual foundation for American nationalism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] From 1787 to 1789 Webster was an outspoken supporter of the new Constitution. In October 1787, he wrote a pamphlet titled "An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution Proposed by the Late Convention Held at Philadelphia", published under the pen name "A Citizen of America".Kendall, Joshua, The Forgotten Founding Father, pp. 147–49 The pamphlet was influential, particularly outside New York State.
In terms of political theory, he deemphasized virtue (a core value of republicanism) and emphasized widespread ownership of property (a key element of liberalism). He was one of the few Americans who paid much attention to the French theorist Jean Jacques Rousseau. It was not Rousseau's politics but his ideas on pedagogy in Emile (1762) that influenced Webster in adjusting his Speller to the stages of a child's development.Rollins, (1980) ch 2

==Federalist editor==

Webster married well and had joined the elite in Hartford but did not have much money. In 1793, Alexander Hamilton lent him $1,500 to move to New York City to edit the leading Federalist Party newspaper. In December, he founded New York's first daily newspaper, American Minerva (later known as the Commercial Advertiser), and edited it for four years, writing the equivalent of 20 volumes of articles and editorials. He also published the semi-weekly publication, The Herald, A Gazette for the country (later known as The New York Spectator).
As a Federalist spokesman, he was repeatedly denounced by the Jeffersonian Republicans as "a pusillanimous, half-begotten, self-dubbed patriot", "an incurable lunatic", and "a deceitful newsmonger ... Pedagogue and Quack". Rival Federalist pamphleteer "Peter Porcupine" (William Cobbett) said Webster's pro-French views made him "a traitor to the cause of Federalism", calling him "a toad in the service of sans-cullottism", "a prostitute wretch", "a great fool, and a barefaced liar", "a spiteful viper", and "a maniacal pedant". Webster, the consummate master of words, was distressed. Even the use of words like "the people", "democracy", and "equality" in public debate bothered him, for such words were "metaphysical abstractions that either have no meaning, or at least none that mere mortals can comprehend".Ellis 199, 206.
Webster followed French radical thought and urged a neutral foreign policy when France and Britain went to war in 1793. But when French minister Citizen Genêt set up a network of pro-Jacobin "Democratic-Republican Societies" that entered American politics and attacked President Washington, Webster condemned them. He called on fellow Federalist editors to "all agree to let the clubs alone—publish nothing for or against them. They are a plant of exotic and forced birth: the sunshine of peace will destroy them".Ellis p. 201.
For decades, he was one of the most prolific authors in the new nation, publishing  textbooks, political essays, a report on infectious diseases, and newspaper articles for his Federalist party. He wrote so much that a modern bibliography of his published works required 655 pages. He moved back to New Haven in 1798; he was elected as a Federalist to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1800 and 1802–1807.

==Copyright==

Politician Daniel Webster was Noah Webster's distant relative; he sponsored Noah's proposed copyright bill.[tpl]cite web| url=https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/exhibitions/webster|title=An Exhibit Commemorating the 250th Anniversary of Noah Webster's Birth, October 16, 1758| publisher=Amherst College.| accessdate=July 18, 2008[/tpl] The first major statutory revision of U.S. copyright law, the 1831 Act was a result of intensive lobbying by Noah Webster and his agents in Congress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cgi-bin/kleioc/0010/exec/ausgabe/%22us_1831%22 |title=Copyright Act (1831), Primary Sources on Copyright (1450–1900), eds L.

==Blue Backed Speller==

As a teacher, he had come to dislike American elementary schools. They could be overcrowded, with up to seventy children of all ages crammed into one-room schoolhouses. They had poor underpaid staff, no desks, and unsatisfactory textbooks that came from England. Webster thought that Americans should learn from American books, so he began writing a three volume compendium, A Grammatical Institute of the English Language. The work consisted of a speller (published in 1783), a grammar (published in 1784), and a reader (published in 1785). His goal was to provide a uniquely American approach to training children. His most important improvement, he claimed, was to rescue "our native tongue" from "the clamourCiting this article, "at first he kept the u in words like colour or favour" so this quote should have a 'U' in clamour of pedantry" that surrounded English grammar and pronunciation. He complained that the English language had been corrupted by the British aristocracy, which set its own standard for proper spelling and pronunciation.See Brian Pelanda, Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783–1787 58 Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. 431, 431–454 (2011). Webster rejected the notion that the study of Greek and Latin must precede the study of English grammar. The appropriate standard for the American language, argued Webster, was "the same republican principles as American civil and ecclesiastical constitutions". This meant that the people-at-large must control the language; popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language.
The Speller was arranged so that it could be easily taught to students, and it progressed by age. From his own experiences as a teacher, Webster thought the Speller should be simple and gave an orderly presentation of words and the rules of spelling and pronunciation. He believed students learned most readily when he broke a complex problem into its component parts and had each pupil master one part before moving to the next. Ellis argues that Webster anticipated some of the insights currently associated with Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Webster said that children pass through distinctive learning phases in which they master increasingly complex or abstract tasks. Therefore, teachers must not try to teach a three-year-old how to read; they could not do it until age five. He organized his speller accordingly, beginning with the alphabet and moving systematically through the different sounds of vowels and consonants, then syllables, then simple words, then more complex words, then sentences.Ellis 174.
The speller was originally titled The First Part of the Grammatical Institute of the English Language. Over the course of 385 editions in his lifetime, the title was changed in 1786 to The American Spelling Book, and again in 1829 to The Elementary Spelling Book. Most people called it the "Blue-Backed Speller" because of its blue cover, and for the next one hundred years, Webster's book taught children how to read, spell, and pronounce words. It was the most popular American book of its time; by 1837 it had sold 15 million copies, and some 60 million by 1890—reaching the majority of young students in the nation's first century. Its royalty of a half-cent per copy was enough to sustain Webster in his other endeavors. It also helped create the popular contests known as spelling bees.
Slowly, edition by edition, Webster changed the spelling of words, making them "Americanized". He chose s over c in words like defense, he changed the re to er in words like center, and he dropped one of the Ls in traveler. At first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions. He also changed "tongue" to "tung"—an innovation that never caught on.Scudder 1881, pp, 245–252.
Part three of his Grammatical Institute (1785) was a reader designed to uplift the mind and "diffuse the principles of virtue and patriotism".[tpl]cite book |first=Harry Redcay |last=Warfel |title=Noah Webster, schoolmaster to America |year=1966 |page=86 |location=New York |publisher=Octagon |isbn= [/tpl]
Students received the usual quota of Plutarch, Shakespeare, Swift, and Addison, as well as such Americans as Joel Barlow's Vision of Columbus, Timothy Dwight's Conquest of Canaan, and John Trumbull's poem M'Fingal. He included excerpts from Tom Paine's The Crisis and an essay by Thomas Day calling for the abolition of slavery in accord with the Declaration of Independence.
Webster's Speller was entirely secular by design.Ellis, After the Revolution: Profiles of Early American Culture (1979) p 175  It ended with two pages of important dates in American history, beginning with Columbus's in 1492 and ending with the battle of Yorktown in 1781. There was no mention of God, the Bible, or sacred events. "Let sacred things be appropriated for sacred purposes", wrote Webster. As Ellis explains, "Webster began to construct a secular catechism to the nation-state. Here was the first appearance of 'civics' in American schoolbooks. In this sense, Webster's speller becoming what was to be the secular successor to The New England Primer with its explicitly biblical injunctions".Ellis 175. Later in life Webster became intensely religious and added religious themes. However after 1840 Webster's books lost market share to the McGuffey Eclectic Readers of William Holmes McGuffey, which sold over 120 million copies.[tpl]cite book |first=John H.

Bynack (1984) examines Webster in relation to his commitment to the idea of a unified American national culture that would stave off the decline of republican virtues and solidarity. Webster acquired his perspective on language from such theorists as Maupertuis, Michaelis, and Herder. There he found the belief that a nation's linguistic forms and the thoughts correlated with them shaped individuals' behavior. Thus the etymological clarification and reform of American English promised to improve citizens' manners and thereby preserve republican purity and social stability. This presupposition animated Webster's Speller and Grammar.[tpl]cite journal |first=Vincent P. |last=Bynack |title=Noah Webster and the Idea of a National Culture: the Pathologies of Epistemology |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1984 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=99–114 |doi= 10.2307/2709333[/tpl]

==Dictionary==

===Publication===

In 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, An American Dictionary of the English Language; it took twenty-six years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-eight languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), Gothic, German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, Welsh, Russian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used different languages. They also spelled, pronounced, and used English words differently.Pearson, Ellen Holmes. "The Standardization of American English," Teachinghistory.org, accessed March 21, 2012
Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced American English spellings, replacing "colour" with "color", substituting "wagon" for "waggon", and printing "center" instead of "centre". He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828, registering the copyright on April 14.[tpl]cite book|last=Wright|first=Russell O.|title=Chronology of education in the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xBGcAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 13, 2012|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2502-0|page=44[/tpl]
Though it now has an honored place in the history of American English, Webster's first dictionary only sold 2,500 copies. He was forced to mortgage his home to develop a second edition, and his life from then on was plagued with debt.
In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. On May 28, 1843, a few days after he had completed revising an appendix to the second edition, and with much of his efforts with the dictionary still unrecognized, Noah Webster died.

===Impact===

Lepore (2008) demonstrates Webster's paradoxical ideas about language and politics and shows why Webster's endeavors were at first so poorly received. Culturally conservative Federalists denounced the work as radical—too inclusive in its lexicon and even bordering on vulgar. Meanwhile Webster's old foes the Republicans attacked the man, labeling him mad for such an undertaking.[tpl]cite book |first=Jill |last=Lepore |chapter=Introduction |editor-first=Arthur |editor-last=Schulman |title=Websterisms: A Collection of Words and Definitions Set Forth by the Founding Father of American English |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2008 |isbn= [/tpl]
Scholars have long seen Webster's 1844 dictionary to be an important resource for reading poet Emily Dickinson's life and work; she once commented that the "Lexicon" was her "only companion" for years. One biographer said, "The dictionary was no mere reference book to her; she read it as a priest his breviary – over and over, page by page, with utter absorption".[tpl]cite journal |first=Jed |last=Deppman |title='I Could Not Have Defined the Change': Rereading Dickinson's Definition Poetry |journal=Emily Dickinson Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=49–80 |doi=10.1353/edj.2002.0005 [/tpl] Martha Dickinson Bianchi, The life and letters of Emily Dickinson (1924) p 80 for quote
Austin (2005) explores the intersection of lexicographical and poetic practices in American literature, and attempts to map out a "lexical poetics" using Webster's dictionaries. He shows the ways in which American poetry has inherited Webster and drawn upon his lexicography in order to reinvent it. Austin explicates key definitions from both the Compendious (1806) and American (1828) dictionaries and brings into its discourse a range of concerns including the politics of American English, the question of national identity and culture in the early moments of American independence, and the poetics of citation and of definition.
Webster's dictionaries were a redefinition of Americanism within the context of an emergent and unstable American socio-political and cultural identity. Webster's identification of his project as a "federal language" shows his competing impulses towards regularity and innovation in historical terms. Perhaps the contradictions of Webster's project comprised part of a larger dialectical play between liberty and order within Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary political debates.[tpl]cite journal |first=Nathan W. |last=Austin |title=Lost in the Maze of Words: Reading and Re-reading Noah Webster's Dictionaries |journal=Dissertation Abstracts International |year=2005 |volume=65 |issue=12 |page=4561 [/tpl]
Webster's dictionaries dominated the English speaking world. In 1850, for example, Blackie and Son in Glasgow published the first general dictionary of English that relied heavily upon pictorial illustrations integrated with the text. Its The Imperial Dictionary, English, Technological, and Scientific, Adapted to the Present State of Literature, Science, and Art; On the Basis of Webster's English Dictionary used Webster's for most of their text, adding some additional technical words that went with illustrations of machinery.[tpl]cite journal |first=Michael |last=Hancher |title=Gazing at the Imperial Dictionary |journal=Book History |volume=1 |year=1998 |pages=156–181 |doi=10.1353/bh.1998.0006 [/tpl]

==Religious views==

Webster in early life was something of a freethinker, but in 1808 he became a convert to Calvinistic orthodoxy, and thereafter became a devout Congregationalist who preached the need to Christianize the nation.Snyder (1990). Webster grew increasingly authoritarian and elitist, fighting against the prevailing grain of Jacksonian Democracy. Webster viewed language as a tool to control unruly thoughts. His American Dictionary emphasized the virtues of social control over human passions and individualism, submission to authority, and fear of God; they were necessary for the maintenance of the American social order. As he grew older, Webster's attitudes changed from those of an optimistic revolutionary in the 1780s to those of a pessimistic critic of man and society by the 1820s.Rollins (1980).
His 1828 American Dictionary contained the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. Webster considered education "useless without the Bible". Webster released his own edition of the Bible in 1833, called the Common Version. He used the King James Version (KJV) as a base and consulted the Hebrew and Greek along with various other versions and commentaries. Webster molded the KJV to correct grammar, replaced words that were no longer used, and did away with words and phrases that could be seen as offensive.
In 1834, he published an apologetic book in defense of The Bible and Christianity itself.

==Opposition to slavery==

Webster helped found the Connecticut Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1791,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xxSGv0uGKkYC&pg=PA1801&lpg=PA1801&dq=%22noah+webster%22+abolitionist&source=bl&ots=-2z0AiAa_v&sig=PhQlFC25GRnmWsaHIWbnljRqHYE&hl=en&ei=NPz6S7b2DJKKNe_srIQI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Noah Webster and the First American Dictionary, Luisanna Fodde Melis, Rosen Publishing Group, New York, 2005 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl] but by the 1830s rejected the new tone among abolitionists that emphasized Americans who tolerated slavery were themselves sinners. In 1837, Webster warned his daughter Eliza about her fervent support of the abolitionist cause. Webster wrote, "slavery is a great sin and a general calamity – but it is not our sin, though it may prove to be a terrible calamity to us in the north. But we cannot legally interfere with the South on this subject".Florea, Silvia. Americana Vol. VI, No 2, Fall 2010 "Lessons from the Heart and Hearth of Colonial Philadelphia: Reflections on Education, As Reflected in Colonial Era Correspondence to Wives" http://americanaejournal.hu/vol6no2/florea#fn7 He added, "To come north to preach and thus disturb our peace, when we can legally do nothing to effect this object, is, in my view, highly criminal and the preachers of abolitionism deserve the penitentiary".

==Family==

Noah Webster married Rebecca Greenleaf (1766–1847) on October 26, 1789, New Haven, Connecticut. They had eight children:
He moved to Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1812, where Webster helped to found Amherst College. In 1822, the family moved back to New Haven, and Webster was awarded an honorary degree from Yale the following year. He is buried in New Haven's Grove Street Cemetery.
