==Song information==

"Primaballerina" is a midtempo schlager song. It is addressed to a porcelain figure on a clock, who is asked why she is alone and has to pass through life without a lover. The singer tells that music is the life of the Primaballerina and that she just keeps turning to chimes. Nevertheless, in the final chorus she says that one day everything beautiful will fade and that the porcelaine figure will never understand that.Primaballerina - lyrics - Diggiloo Thrush
