Mak-yek ([tpl]lang-th|หมากแยก[/tpl], [tpl]RTGS|mak yaek[/tpl]) is a board game played in Thailand and Malaysia (where it is known as Apit-sodok) on an 8 by 8 board by two players each having sixteen pieces or "men."
Men are laid out on the first and third row from the player. There is no special way of deciding who starts the game. Players take turns moving their men horizontally or vertically like the rook in chess (i.e. not through pieces), capturing the opponent's pieces throughcustodian capture and intervention capture. 
Intervention capture is the opposite of custodian. If a stone moves between two enemy stones, it captures both stones. 
The first player with no pieces left loses.
