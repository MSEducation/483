QVC (an initialism for "Quality, Value, Convenience") is an American cable, satellite and broadcast television network, and multinational corporation specializing in televised home shopping that is owned by Liberty Interactive. Founded in 1986 by Joseph Segel in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States, QVC broadcasts in six countries as QVC US, QVC UK, QVC Germany, QVC Japan, QVC Italy, and QVC/CNR (China) to 235 million households.

==History==

QVC was founded on June 13, 1986 by Joseph Segel. One of the first brands to sign a two-year deal with QVC for its products was Sears.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] The channel's first live broadcast took place at 7:30 p.m. ET on November 24 of that year, reaching 7.6 million cable television homes; the first item sold was a "Windsor Shower Companion" shower radio, presented by host John Eastman (Bob Bowersox was the first host seen on-screen).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKaIMdX6K7g&feature=plcp&context=C4969c1cVDvjVQa1PpcFNIWFdxz-IbDPJwXb9m8ks4JpEoWt_an9Y= |title=QVC's First Broadcast 11/24/86 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03[/tpl] The corporation later set a new record for first full-year fiscal sales for a new public company of $112 million.About QVC, About QVC
Initially broadcast live from 7:30 p.m. until midnight ET each weekday and all day on Saturdays and Sundays, the channel extended its live programming to 24 hours in January 1987. QVC acquired its top competitor, the Cable Value Network (CVN), in 1989. The $380 million deal contributed to a loss of $17 million during the next fiscal quarter, and then led to difficulties in the couple of years that followed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~jsegel/BIOGRAPHY_Joseph_M_Segel.html |title=Biography |publisher=Home.comcast.net |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2013-02-03[/tpl]
On February 2, 1995, Comcast purchased a majority shareholder stake in QVC, Inc., taking control of the corporation. That year, QVC kicked off the "Quest for America's Best: 50 in 50 Tour," a 50-week nationwide product search. QVC.com was started in 1996 as iQVC.Archive.org, QVC.com on December 22, 1996.
In 1998, two former hosts filed a class-action lawsuit against QVC, claiming that they were discriminated against by the shopping channel based on their race. The lawsuit went on to state that QVC refused to allow non-white hosts any permanent daytime/primetime spots, which relegated them to the overnight hours, otherwise known as the "graveyard shift." Because of this, the non-white hosts were paid considerably less than the white hosts.[tpl]cite web|author=Sean Sexton |url=http://www.dmnews.com/lawsuit-alleges-pattern-of-racism-at-qvc/article/60890/ |title=Lawsuit Alleges Pattern of Racism at QVC - Direct Marketing News |publisher=Dmnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2004-06-07/news/25369173_1_qvc-jack-comstock-q2 |title=QVC official denies any racism A suit contends Jack Comstock treated minorities badly.

In July 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Liberty Media. On September 23, 2007, QVC U.S. rebranded itself, changing its logo on-air and online. The rebranding was accompanied by an advertising campaign with the tagline "iQdoU?" ("I shop QVC, do you?") that had preceded the rebrand with billboards in major U.S. cities. The iQdoU? campaign also included a "teaser" website.iqdou.com[tpl]cite web|url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/prnewswire/press_releases/national/Pennsylvania/2007/09/23/NESU001 |title=Press Releases - Philadelphia Business Journal |publisher=Philadelphia.bizjournals.com |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2013-02-03[/tpl]
On September 30, 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site. Its initial reach was reported to be 35 million households.
In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on August 5, 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition. The channel is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations in selected areas. The broadcast service is branded as "QVC Over the Air", with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming.
On August 22, 2013, QVC launched a timeshift channel called QVC Plus (the first such channel operated by a home shopping network), made available initially on cable provider Bright House Networks and satellite provider DirecTV, which broadcasts the channel's programming on a three-hour tape delay.QVC Launches Second Linear Channel, Multichannel News, August 23, 2013.

===High definition===

QVC HD is a high definition simulcast feed of QVC, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. QVC became the first shopping network to offer a native high-definition simulcast channel in May 2009. The 4:3 cut for its standard definition feed in this 16:9 presentation is made to the right of the screen rather than on both sides of the 4:3 frame, allowing the network to place its graphics fully to the left and lower portions of the screen to maximize camera presentation space.

==Operations==

All of QVC's operations (U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, Italy and China) run 24 hours a day, although live programming hours vary between each region.
