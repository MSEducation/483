Route 161 is a 1.10-mile (1.77 km) state highway in Clifton, New Jersey, United States, running along Clifton Avenue between Allwood Road (County Route 602) and Van Houten Avenue (County Route 614). Although it is a signed state highway, it does not connect to any other state-maintained roadways. However, the south terminus is aligned just northeast of the interchange of Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway (Interchange 153). The highway originated as Route S3 Spur, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 3 to State Highway Route 6 (currently U.S. Route 46). The route was redesignated in 1953 as NJ 161.
