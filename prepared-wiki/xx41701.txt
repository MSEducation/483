Beeman. It also gave name to [[Pepsi-Cola]], originally formulated with pepsin and cola nuts.
Pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of F(ab')2 fragments from antibodies. In some assays, it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the antibody. For these applications, antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an Fab or an F(ab')2 fragment of the antibody. To produce an F(ab')2 fragment, IgG is digested with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region. One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule (containing two antibody binding sites), hence the designation F(ab')2. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain. The Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. Fab fragments are generated by cleavage of IgG with papain instead of pepsin. Papain cleaves IgG above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains, but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain. This generates two separate monovalent (containing a single antibody binding site) Fab fragments and an intact Fc fragment. The fragments can be purified by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.[tpl]cite book | author = Lane, David Stuart; Harlow, Edward; Harlow, Ed | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Antibodies: a laboratory manual | edition = | language = | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 1988 | origyear = | pages = A2926  | quote = | isbn = 0-87969-314-2 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl]
Fab and F(ab')2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the Fc region may cause problems. In tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen, or in peripheral blood preparations, cells with Fc receptors (macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells) are present which can bind the Fc region of intact antibodies, causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen. Use of F(ab')2 or Fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not Fc receptors. These fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma, because they are not able to bind complement, which could lyse the cells. F(ab')2, and to a greater extent Fab, fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen, i.e., in staining tissue for electron microscopy. The divalency of the F(ab')2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens, allowing use for precipitation assays, cellular aggregation via surface antigens, or rosetting assays.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/metabolomics/enzyme-explorer/analytical-enzymes/pepsin.html | title = Enzyme Explorer- Pepsin | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | work = | publisher = Sigma-Aldrich | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = [/tpl]
