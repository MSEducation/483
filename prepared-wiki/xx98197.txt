The United States Department of the Navy (DoN) was established by an Act of Congress on 30 April 1798 (initiated by the recommendation of James McHenry),Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, The life and correspondence of James McHenry (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907). to provide a government organizational structure to the United States Navy and, from 1834 onwards, for the United States Marine Corps, and when directed by the President, for the United States Coast Guard as a service within the Navy.Chap. XXXV. 1 Stat. 553 from "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation:  U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875". Library of Congress, Law Library of Congress. Retrieved March 24, 2012. The Department of the Navy was an Executive Department and the Secretary of the Navy was a member of the President's cabinet until 1949, when amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 changed the name of the National Military Establishment to the Department of Defense and made it an Executive Department. The Department of the Navy then became, along with the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force, a Military Department within the Department of Defense: subject to the authority, direction and control of the Secretary of Defense.

==Proposed redesignation==

A provision in the initial House of Representatives bill (H.R. 1585) for the fiscal year 2008 national defense authorization would have renamed the Department of the Navy as the "Department of the Navy and Marine Corps." The bill passed in the House on 17 May 2007,[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1585|title=H.R. 1585: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008| work=Legislation: 2007-2008 (110th Congress)|publisher=GovTrack.us[/tpl] but encountered opposition among members of the DoD civilian leadership and among senior Navy admirals and Marine Corps generals.
In the Senate, the provision was replaced in S. Amdt. 2011, an amendment in the nature of a substitute proposed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan on 9 July 2007 and agreed to by unanimous consent on 1 October 2007.[tpl]Cite web |accessdate=24 December 2007 |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/amendment.xpd?session=110&amdt=s2011 |title=S.Amdt. 2011: In the nature of a substitute. |work=Legislation: 2007-2008 (110th Congress)|publisher=GovTrack.us[/tpl] The amendment removed the renaming provision and also made other changes. The House version including the provision was withdrawn in conference committee and so was not included in the final National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.
