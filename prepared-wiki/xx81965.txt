Hebron Yeshiva, also known as Yeshivas Hevron, or Knesses Yisroel, is a yeshiva devoted to high-level study of the Talmud. It originated in 1924 when the roshei yeshiva and 150 students of the Slabodka Yeshiva, known colloquially as the "mother of yeshivas", relocated to Hebron.

==Relocation of Slabodka Yeshiva to Palestine==

A 1924 edict requiring enlistment in the military or supplementary secular studies in the yeshiva led a large number of students in the Slabodka yeshiva to relocate to Palestine. Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, also known as "Der Alter fun Slabodka" (The Elder of Slabodka), sent Rabbi Avraham Grodzinski to head this group and establish the yeshiva in Hebron.See Toras Avraham page 13 Upon Grodzinski's return to Slabodka, the Alter transferred the mashgiach ruchani responsibilities to him, and the rosh yeshiva duties to Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Sher and himself and moved to Hebron to lead the yeshiva there.Toras Avraham page 13 Hebron was chosen over Jerusalem to avoid the influence of the Conservative Old Yishuv.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] The Slabodka yeshiva ceased operation during the Holocaust. A branch was also established in Bnei Brak.

==1929 Hebron massacre and relocation to Jerusalem==

Twenty-four students were murdered in the 1929 Hebron massacre, and the yeshiva was re-established in the Geula neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Despite a delay after the death of Rabbi Moshe Hebroni, the last of the previous generation, the yeshiva moved into a new and larger campus in the south-central Givat Mordechai neighbourhood in 1975. This yeshiva today has about 1300 students and is one of the most prestigious and influential Lithuanian yeshivohs in Israel. The current roshei yeshiva are Rabbi Dovid Cohen[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Hamodia|date=July/10/13|page=A25[/tpl] and Rabbi Yosef Chevroni.
