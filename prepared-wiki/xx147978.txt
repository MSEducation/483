The history of the school district dates back to the 1850s when Joseph McKnight built a home on top of a hill overlooking the city of Washington, Pennsylvania.  This home came to be called Spring Hill and is now the old part of the district's high school.  It later was established as an Episcopal military school for boys and was named Trinity Hall Military Academy.  Trinity Hall Military Academy became one of the best equipped military schools for boys in the country.  The Smith family owned the property after McKnight and welcomed President Ulysses S. Grant to stay there on several occasions. It had to be expanded in 1881 due to the school's number of students had increased.  After the death of William Smith in 1904, the school had to close due to lack of funding.  It reopened in 1925 with a joint venture of Amwell, Canton, North Franklin, and South Strabane Townships to establish the building as a high school.  This marks the foundation of the school district.
The district operates six schools: Trinity North Elementary, Trinity South Elementary, Trinity East Elementary, Trinity West Elementary, Trinity Middle School and Trinity High School

School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district up to one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=7201&PageID=510952&mode=2&contentid=http://pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/global/news_releases/governor_s_office/news_releases/pennsylvania_s__race_to_the_top__fueled_by_effective_reforms__strong_local_support.html |title=Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education Press Release |date=January 2009[/tpl] Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success.

===Common Cents state initiative===

The Trinity Area School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/common_cents/8781 |title=Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |accessdate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.

===Real estate taxes===

The Trinity Area School Board set property tax rates in 2010-2011 at 103.0000 mills.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/40141929/Pennsylvania-Department-of-Education-Finances-Real-Estate-Tax-Rates-2010-11 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2010-11[/tpl] A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education, |title=Act 511 Tax Report, 2004[/tpl] The school district includes municipalities in three counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties.

====Act 1 Adjusted index====

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

For the 2011-12 school year the Trinity Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index.

A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 the Taxpayer Relief Act information |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011[/tpl]
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index.

Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456/report_on_referendum_exceptions/510336 |title=Report on Exceptions |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=April 2011[/tpl]

====Property tax relief====

In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Trinity Area School District was $171 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 7,515 property owners applied for the tax relief. Washington School District received $407, the highest property tax relief allotted in Washington County for 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wgal.com/download/2009/0501/19345089.pdf |title=Estimated Tax Relief Per Homestead and Farmstead May 1, 2009 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2009[/tpl] The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 73% of property owners applied for tax relief in Washington County.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/department/press/wagnerpennsylvaniansmissingoutonprop.html |title=Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, |date=2010-02-23[/tpl] Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/property_tax_reduction_allocations/510335 |title=Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_rent_rebate/11410 |title=Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education[/tpl]
