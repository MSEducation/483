==History==

===Fortress===

The first fortification was built by Swedes in 1299 but was lost to the Novgorodians in 1301. A wooden fortress named Oreshek ([tpl]lang|ru|Орешек[/tpl]) or Orekhov ([tpl]lang|ru|Орехов[/tpl]) was built by Grand Prince Yury of Moscow (in his capacity as Prince of Novgorod) on behalf of the Novgorod Republic in 1323. It guarded the northern approaches to Novgorod and access to the Baltic Sea. The fortress is situated on Orekhovets Island, whose name, refers to nuts in Swedish, as well as in Finnish (Pähkinäsaari, "Nut Island") and Russian languages.
After a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed at Oreshek on August 12, 1323 between Sweden and Grand Prince Yury and the Novgorod Republic. This was the first agreement on the border between Eastern and Western Christianity running through present-day Finland. A modern stone monument to the north of the Church of St. John in the fortress commemorates the treaty.
Twenty-five years later, King Magnus Eriksson attacked and briefly took the fortress during his crusade in the region in 1348–1352.Michael C. Paul, "Archbishop Vasilii Kalika, the Fortress at Orekhov and the Defense of Orthodoxy," in Alan V. Murray, ed., The Clash of Cultures on the Medieval Baltic Frontier (Farnham, UK: Ashgate, 2009): 266–267. It was largely ruined by the time the Novgorodians retook the fortress in 1351. The fortress was rebuilt in stone in 1352 by Archbishop Vasily Kalika of Novgorod (1330–1352), who, according to the Novgorod First Chronicle, was sent by the Novgorodians after several Russian and Lithuanian princes ignored the city's pleas to help them rebuild and defend the fort.Arseny Nikolayevich Nasonov, ed. "Новгородская первая летопись: старшего и младшего изводов". Moscow and Leningrad, 1950, p. 100 Michael C. Paul. "Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest". Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 8, No. 2, pp. 237, 249; Paul, "Archbishop Vasilii Kalika," 257-258.  The remnants of the walls of 1352 were excavated in 1969 and can be seen just north of the Church of St. John in the center of the present fortress.
The fort was captured by Sweden in 1611 during the Ingrian War. As part of the Swedish Empire, the fortress was known as Nöteborg ("Nut-fortress") in Swedish or Pähkinälinna in Finnish, and became the center of the north-Ingrian Nöteborg county (slottslän).
In 1702, during the Great Northern War, the fortress was taken by Russians under Peter the Great in an amphibious assault: 250 Swedish soldiers defended the fort for ten days before surrendering. Russian losses were 6,000 men against 110 Swedish losses. It was then given its current name, Shlisselburg, a corruption of Schlüsselburg. The name, meaning "Key-fortress" in German, refers to Peter's perception of the fortress as the "key to Ingria".
During Imperial times, the fortress was used as a notorious political prison; among its famous prisoners were Wilhelm Küchelbecker, Mikhail Bakunin and, for thirty-eight years, Walerian Łukasiński. Ivan VI was murdered in the fortress in 1764, and Lenin's brother, Aleksandr Ulyanov, was hanged there as well.
Out of original ten towers, the fortress retains only six (five Russian and one Swedish). The remains of a church inside the fortress were transformed into a memorial to the fortress's defenders. The fortress has been the site of an annual rock concert since 2003. There is also a museum of political prisoners of the Russian Empire and a small collection of World War II artillery.

===Town===

The town on the mainland opposite the island fortress was founded in 1702 by Peter the Great.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In the course of Peter's administrative reform, Shlisselburg was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In 1727, it became a part of Sankt-Petersburgsky Uyezd, and in 1755 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was established.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In 1914, Sankt-Peterburgsky Uyezd was renamed Petrogradsky Uyezd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://starye-karty.litera-ru.ru/uezd/pet_karta-peterburgkiy_uezd.html|title=Старые карты Петербургского (Санкт-Петербургского) уезда|publisher=Картографическая энциклопедия|language=Russian|accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl] On February 14, 1923, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://classif.spb.ru/sprav/np_lo/8_Petrogradsky.htm|title=Петроградский уезд (1917 г. - январь 1924 г.), Ленинградский уезд (январь 1924 г.- август 1927 г.)|publisher=Система классификаторов исполнительных органов государственной власти Санкт-Петербурга|language=Russian|accessdate=March 6, 2014[/tpl] In January 1924, the uyezd was renamed Leningradsky. St. Petersburg Governorate was twice renamed, first Petrograd Governorate and subsequently Leningrad Governorate.
On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished. Shlisselburg was made a town of okrug significance and belonged to Leningrad Okrug.{ On August 19, 1930, Leningradsky Prigorodny District, with the administrative center in Leningrad, was established.[tpl]cite web|url=http://classif.spb.ru/sprav/np_lo/71_Leningradsky_prigorodny_rayon.htm|title=Ленинградский Пригородный район (август 1930 г. - август 1936 г.)|publisher=Система классификаторов исполнительных органов государственной власти Санкт-Петербурга|language=Russian|accessdate=March 6, 2014[/tpl] On August 19, 1936, the district was abolished and Shlisselburg became the town of oblast significance.
During World War II, the town (but not the fortress) was seized by German troops. German occupation lasted from September 8, 1941 to January 18, 1943. The recapture of Shlisselburg in January 1943 by the Red Army reopened access to besieged Leningrad. In 1944, the town's name was changed to Petrokrepost (lit., Peter's fortress).[tpl]cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=525[/tpl] Shlisselburg regained its former name in 1992.
In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure,[tpl]cite web|url=http://msu.lenobl.ru/news?id=38614|title=Отчет о работе комитета по взаимодействию с органами местного самоуправления Ленинградской области в 2010 году|publisher=Комитет по печати и связям с общественностью Ленинградской области|language=Russian|accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl] and Shlisselburg became a town of district significance, subordinated to Kirovsky District.

==Economy==

===Industry===

There are several shipyards in Shlisselburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shlisselburg.ru/prom.htm|title=Промышленные предприятия города Шлиссельбурга|publisher=www.shlisselburg.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl]

===Transportation===

The railway platform of Petrokrepost, which has passenger service to Ladozhsky railway station in St. Petersburg, is located on the other bank of the Neva opposite of Shlisselburg.
The A120 road, which encircles St. Petersburg, and the M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, pass several kilometers south of the town.
The Neva and Lake Ladoga are navigable. In the beginning of the 19th century, a system of canals bypassing Lake Ladoga was built, which at the time was a part of Mariinsky Water System, connecting the Neva with the Volga River. In particular, the New Ladoga Canal connects the Volkhov and the Neva Rivers. It replaced the Old Ladoga Canal built by Peter the Great, which thus became disused and decayed. The canals collectively are known as the Ladoga Canal. The canals originate from the Neva in Shlisselburg.

==Architecture==

The town does not retain many historical buildings, apart from a handful of 18th-century churches. Perhaps the most remarkable landmark is the Old Ladoga Canal, started at the behest of Peter the Great in 1719 and completed under the guidance of Fieldmarshal Munnich twelve years later. The canal stretches for [tpl]convert|104|verst|km[/tpl]; its granite sluices date from 1836.
