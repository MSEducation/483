[[Gibibyte]]

CATEGORIES: Units of information

The gibibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  It is a member of the set of units with binary prefixes defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).[tpl]cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html|title=Prefixes for binary multiples|date=2007|publisher=NIST|accessdate=10 August 2007[/tpl] Its unit symbol is GiB.
The prefix gibi (symbol Gi) represents multiplication by 10243, therefore:
The gibibyte is closely related to the gigabyte (GB), which is defined as 109 bytes = [tpl]gaps|1|000|000|000|bytes[/tpl], but has been used as a synonym for gibibyte in some contexts. [tpl]gaps|1|GiB[/tpl] â‰ˆ [tpl]gaps|1.074|GB[/tpl]. 1024 gibibytes are equal to one tebibyte.
Binary prefixes are increasingly used in technical literature and open source software, and are a component of the International System of Quantities.[tpl]cite web|title=IEC 80000-13:2008|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31898|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=21 July 2013[/tpl]
