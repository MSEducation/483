Through its president, Mark French's contributions to section179.org, Crest Capital helps small and medium-sized companies to understand Section 179 depreciation deductions. Section 179 of the IRS tax code allows small, medium-sized and large businesses to write off business expenses related to the acquisition of new or used equipment in a particular tax year. Crest Capital assists businesses to benefit from this IRS tax incentive to write-off acquisitions of equipment and software. As of 2011, businesses were able to claim up to $500,000. Businesses exceeding this limit are also able to benefit from further reductions for equipment acquired that is valued above $2 million. This deduction also applies to the acquisition of software, computers and other equipment used in the business.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.cisco-eagle.com/blog/2010/05/25/section-179-enhanced-limits-extended-for-2010-tax-year/ |title=Section 179 Enhanced Limits Extended for 2010 tax year |last=Stone |first=Scott |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl] Though these benefits were lowered to fifty percent in 2012, businesses wishing to acquire new equipment still enjoy some amount of tax incentive.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://atyourservice.haascnc.com/whats_new/cnc-machines-government-write-off/ |title=Get The Haas You Want â€“ And Then Write Off the Entire Cost in 2011 |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl]
