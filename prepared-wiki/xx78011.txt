45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records is a double album released in 2002 by NOFX. There are actually 47 songs on the CD version, and all the songs could easily fit onto one CD.
The band built up a list of songs that did not make it onto any of their albums, or had previously appeared on compilation albums, vinyl singles, or b-sides. Many of these had been dropped originally because of Fat Mike's tendency to not release albums that run for too long.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
The first CD contains a collection of songs spanning almost the entirety of the band's career. The oldest track is from the band's first demo, and the newest was recorded just for this album.
The second CD contains the EPs Fuck the Kids and Surfer, each of which contain 13 or so very short songs that were previously available only on 7" vinyl. Fat Mike chose to leave one song off of each of the EPs when compiling this CD, "just to annoy people a bit".
The vinyl release of the album was renamed to 22 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records, but actually includes just the first 21 tracks from the first CD. This was because of all of the second CD being already available on the two vinyl EPs mentioned above.
