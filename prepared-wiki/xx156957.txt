Captain Bartholomew Teeling (b. 1774 Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland – d. 24 September 1798 Arbor Hill, County Dublin, Ireland) was a leader of the Irish forces during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and who carried out an act of bravery during the Battle of Collooney. He was captured at the Battle of Ballinamuck and executed for treason.

==Background==

Teeling was educated at the Dubordieu School in Lisburn and at Trinity College Dublin. His younger brother Charles Teeling (1778–1850) went on to be a writer. In 1796 he enlisted in the United Irishmen and travelled to France to encourage support for a French invasion of Ireland.

==1798 Rebellion==

===Land at Killala===

Teeling returned to Ireland on 22 August 1798, as Chief Aide de Camp to General Humbert, and landed at Killala Bay between County Sligo and Mayo with French troops. On 28 August the combined forced captured Castlebar and declared the Republic of Connacht. The Franco-Irish troops then pushed east through County Sligo but were halted by a cannon which the British forces had installed above Union Rock near Collooney.

===Battle of Collooney===

On 5 September 1798, Teeling cleared the way for the advancing Irish-French army by single handedly disabling a British gunner post during the Battle of Collooney in Sligo when he broke from the French ranks and galloped towards Union Rock. He was armed with a pistol and shot the cannon's marksman and captured the cannon. The French and Irish advanced and the British, after losing the cannon position, retreated towards their barracks at Sligo, leaving 60 dead and 100 prisoners.[tpl]cite web | title=Bartholomew Teeling biography | work=Brefine Tourism| url=http://www.breifne.ie/content.asp?ID=1769| accessdate=30 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Bill Peterson | title=In the Footsteps of Général Humbert: The French Invasion of Ireland, 1798 | work=The Napoleonic Wargaming Club| url=http://www.wargame.ch/wc/nwc/newsletter/September2001/Newsletter15/Ireland.html| accessdate=30 May 2007[/tpl]

===Battle of Ballinamuck===

During the Battle of Ballinamuck at Longford Teeling and approximately 500 other Irishmen were captured along with their French allies. The French troops were treated as prisoners of war and later returned to France, however the Irish troops were executed by the British.
Teeling was court-martialled by Britain as an Irish rebel. To positively identify him, the authorities enlisted William Coulson, a damask manufacturer from Lisburn, who identified him as a son of Luke Teeling, a linen merchant who lived in Chapel Hill, Lisburn. Teeling was hanged at Arbour Hill Prison in Dublin, in his French uniform adorned with an Irish tricolour in his hat.[tpl]cite web | author=Aengus O Snodaigh | title=Croppies Acre | work=An Phoblacht | url=http://republican-news.org/archive/1998/October01/01hist.html| accessdate=30 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=1798 Rebellion | work=Lisburn.com| url=http://www.lisburn.com/history/history_lisburn/1798_rebellion.htm| accessdate=30 May 2007[/tpl]
