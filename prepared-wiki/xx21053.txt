[[Sidereal year]]

CATEGORIES: Celestial coordinate system, Units of time, Hindu astrology, Technical factors of astrology

A sidereal year is the time taken by the Earth to orbit the Sun once with respect to the fixed stars. Hence it is also the time taken for the Sun to return to the same position with respect to the fixed stars after apparently travelling once around the ecliptic.  This differs from the solar or  tropical year which has length equal to the time interval between vernal equinoxes in successive years. It was equal to [tpl]nowrap|365.256363004 SI daysIERS EOP PC Useful constants Each of these days contains 86400 SI seconds.[/tpl] at noon 1 January 2000 (J2000.0).  This is 6 hours and 9.1626 minutes longer than the standard calendar year of 365 SI days, and 20 min 24.5128 s longer than the mean tropical year at J2000.0. The word "sidereal" is derived from the Latin sidus meaning "star".

==Apparent motion of the Sun against the stars==

As the Earth orbits the Sun, the apparent position of the Sun against the stars gradually moves along the ecliptic, passing through the twelve traditional constellations of the zodiac, and returning to its starting point after one sidereal year. This motion is difficult to observe directly because the stars cannot be seen when the Sun is in the sky. However, if one looks regularly at the sky before dawn, the annual motion is very noticeable: the last stars seen to rise are not always the same, and within a week or two an upward shift can be noted. As an example, in July in the Northern Hemisphere, Orion cannot be seen in the dawn sky, but in August it becomes visible. 
This effect is easier to measure than the north/south movement of the position of sunrise (except in high-latitude regions), which defines the seasonal cycle and the tropical year on which the Gregorian calendar is based. For this reason many cultures started their year on the first day a particular special star (Sirius, for instance) could be seen in the east at dawn. In Hesiod's Works and Days, the times of the year for sowing, harvest, and so on are given by reference to the first visibility of stars. Such a calendar effectively uses the sidereal year.
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus is regarded as the one who defined precession. Therefore it is believed that up to this point the years measured by the stars (sidereal years) were thought to be the same as years measured by the seasons (tropical years). Although the phenomenon of the precession seems to have been discovered in many ancient cultures, forming the basis for various world-age myths. In fact, sidereal years are slightly longer than tropical years: One sidereal year is roughly equal to [tpl]nowrap|1 + 1/26000[/tpl] or 1.0000385 tropical years. The difference is caused by the precession of the equinoxes, and means that over long periods of time a calendar based on the sidereal year will drift out of sync with the seasons at the rate of about one day every 72 years.
