The chapel of St Julitta was acquired in 1238 by the canons of St Stephens by Launceston and before 1269 was annexed to their church of St Gennys. At the Reformation it was separated from St Gennys and became a donative served by perpetual curates who were paid Â£7 annually. It became a rectory in 1865. There was formerly a north transept which was removed in the Victorian restoration.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 113-14  The tower is of three stages; the south aisle is built of granite and has one additional bay east of the end of the nave. Features of interest include the vaulted granite south porch and a relief in bronze of the Deposition of Christ which is the work of an Italian 16th century Mannerist. There are two Cornish crosses in the churchyard.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin; p. 182 The parish now belongs to the Boscastle group of Anglican parishes.

==Thomas Hardy==

In 1870 the famous British novelist, short story writer, and poet Thomas Hardy was sent to plan a church restoration at St Juliot. There he met Emma Gifford, sister-in-law of the vicar of St Juliot. She encouraged him in his writing, and they were married in 1874. After Emma Hardy died in November 1912 and was buried in Stinsford churchyard, Thomas was stricken with guilt and remorse, but the result was some of his best poetry, expressing his feelings for his wife of 38 years.
From Satires of Circumstance, Thomas Hardy's 1914 book of poems about Emma.
