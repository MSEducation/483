The 1945 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1945 college football season.  In their eighth year under head coach was Fritz Crisler, the Wolverines compiled a 7-3 record (5-1 Big Ten) and finished the season ranked #6 in the final Associated Press Poll.  Quarterback Joe Ponsetto was the team captain, and center Harold Watts won the Most Valuable Player award and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player.  
On October 13, 1945, the Wolverines lost, 28-7, to Army at Yankee Stadium in New York.  Outmanned by an Army team that was loaded with talent that included 1945 and 1946 Heisman Trophy winners Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis, Crisler unveiled a platoon system in which separate groups played offense and defense.[tpl]cite news|title=Football Platoon System Originator Fritz Crisler Dies|newspaper=Tyrone Daily Herald (UPI story)|date=1982-08-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Fritz Crisler Hall of Fame profile|publisher=College Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=40083[/tpl]  According to one account, Crisler developed the two-platoon system "in a bout of desperation."  Crisler later recalled, "I reported the plan to the players and told them we might have a lot of fun.  At the end of three periods we were tied 7-7 and I knew it couldn't last. I knew sooner or later Army would overpower us. And that's what happened. We lost 28 to 7â€”but we had a lot of fun."[tpl]cite news|title=The Innovator: How U-M coach Fritz Crisler and World War Two created modern football|author=James David Dickson|publisher=Michigan Today|date=July 14, 2010|url=http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2010/07/story.php?id=7795#.UTzC6hypx8E[/tpl]
