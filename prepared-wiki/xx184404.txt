Neve Sha'anan ([tpl]lang-he|נווה שאנן[/tpl], lit. Tranquil Oasis) is a small neighborhood  in central Jerusalem. It is located between the Israel Museum and the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, bordering Nayot. 

==History==

The first three homes were built in 1929 by the Neve Sha'anan society. The name of the neighborhood was based on Isaiah 33:20. The planning principles were similar to those employed by Ricard Kaufmann, who designed the garden suburbs of Jerusalem during the British Mandate.Ruth Kark, Neighborhoods of Jerusalem
The original homes were demolished to make way for the Israel Museum, and were rebuilt further down the slope, at the neighborhood's current location. [tpl]Fact|date=May 2009[/tpl] Two apartment buildings at the end of Neve Sha'anan Street were built to house professors of the Hebrew University.
