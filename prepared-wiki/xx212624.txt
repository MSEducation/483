[[Renard Epervier]]

The Renard Epervier was a Belgian prototype single-seat all-metal fighter monoplane built by the brothers Renard for a government-sponsored design contest in 1928. The Epervier Type 2 was built and flown in 1928, being constructed by Belgian aircraft manufacturer Stampe et Vertongen. It carried an armament of two synchronised 7.7mm guns and was lost later in 1928 after failing to recover from a flat spin. A second prototype, the Epervier Type 2bis, introduced revised streamlined fairings for the cantilever mainwheel legs, mainwheel spats and cylinder aft-fairings and was built by SABCA (Société Anonyme Belge de Constructions Aéronautiques).

==Operational history==

The Type 2bis was first demonstrated to the Belgian government in 1930 in an Aviation Militare order, however it was rejected in favour of the Fairey Firefly. Another design, the Epervier Type 3, was improved with a 480hp engine and was studied under government contract, but again was not built.
