He is the son of Julius and Henrietta Krohn Wallber, both of whom were natives of Berlin, Germany, where they resided until they came to this country in 1850. Judge Wallber was born in Berlin, April 1st, 1841, and was consequently nine years of age when he made his home in America.  Upon their arrival in this country the family took up their residence in New York City, where the elder boys attended the public schools, Emil shaping his studies so as to prepare him for entering upon the study of law, upon which he had already decided as his profession.
