[[Cache Meta Language]]

CATEGORIES: Scripting languages

Cache Meta Language is a computer programming language used to configure high-speed caching functionality in web server software such as lighttpd, which couples the functionality with that of memcache, a memory-based caching system.
The lighttpd module that supported CML is now considered deprecated (2007), however its documentation claimed over 16x speed increase compared to performing similar caching in PHP.
