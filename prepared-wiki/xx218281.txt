[[Empylus]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman rhetoricians

Empylus (1st century BC) was an Ancient Roman rhetorician. He was the companion, as we are told by Plutarch, of Brutus, to whom he dedicated a short essay, not destitute of merit, on the death of Caesar. It is not stated to what country he belonged.
"Empylus the Rhodian" is mentioned in a passage of Quintilian, where the text is very doubtful, as an orator referred to by Cicero, but no such name occurs in any  extant work of the latter.Plut Brut. 2; Quintil. x. 6. ยง 4, and Spalding's note. (cited by Ramsay)
