==Description and anatomy==

Smilodon was around the size of a modern lion or tiger but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, broad limbs with relatively short feet and long canines.[tpl]cite web|title=What Is a Sabertooth? |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=2013-04-08 |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/carnivora/sabretooth.html[/tpl] The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Radinsky, L. B. |year=1975 |title=Evolution of the felid brain |journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution |volume=11 |issue=3–4 |pages=214–254 |doi=10.1159/000123636 |pmid=1181005[/tpl] In reconstructing the facial appearance of Smilodon, Miller (1969) proposed that it looked very different from a typical cat: having a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open so wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower placed ears.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miller, G. J. |year=1969 |title=A new hypothesis to explain the method of food ingestion used by Smilodon californicus Bovard |journal=Tebiwa |volume=12 |pages=9–19[/tpl] However this is disputed, and Antón, et al. (1998) write that the facial features of Smilodon were overall no different than that of other cats.[tpl]cite journal|author=Antón, M.; García-Perea, R.; Turner, A. |year=1998 |title=Reconstructed facial appearance of the sabretoothed felid Smilodon |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=369–86 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1998.tb00582.x[/tpl]
There is some dispute over whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of Smilodon fatalis fossils have found little difference between the sexes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Van Valkenburgh, B.; Sacco, T. |year=2002 |title=Sexual dimorphism, social behavior and intrasexual competition in large Pleistocene carnivorans |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=164–169 |jstor=4524203 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)0220164:sdsbai2.0.co;2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Meachen-Samuels, J.; Binder, W.|year=2010|title=Sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic growth in the American lion and sabertoothed cat from Rancho La Brea |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=280 |issue=3 |pages=271–279 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00659.x[/tpl] Conversely a 2012 study found that while fossils of S. fatalis show less variation in size among individuals than modern Panthera, they do appear to show the same difference in some traits between the sexes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Christiansen, P.; Harris J. M.|year=2012|title=Variation in craniomandibular morphology and sexual dimorphism in Pantherines and the sabercat Smilodon fatalis|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=10|page=e48352|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048352|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...748352C [/tpl]

===Limbs===

Smilodon had shorter and more massive limbs than other felids. It had well developed flexors and extensors in its forearms, which enabled it to pull down and securely hold down large prey so it could deliver a killing bite without endangering the vulnerable elongate canines. Analysis of the cross-sections of S. fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening to such an extent that they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. However, the thickening of S. fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Meachen-Samuels |first1=J. A. |last2=Van Valkenburgh|first2=B. |title=Radiographs reveal exceptional forelimb strength in the sabertooth cat, Smilodon fatalis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=7 |date=2010-07-02 |pages=e11412 |issn=1932-6203 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011412[/tpl] The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long which suggests it was a good jumper.

===Teeth and jaws===

Smilodon is most famous for its relatively long canines, which are the longest  found in the saber-toothed cats, at about [tpl]Convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2[/tpl] long in the largest species Smilodon populator. Those of S. fatalis reached their full size in 18 months at a growth rate of 7 mm/month.[tpl]cite journal|author=Feranec, R. C. |year=2004 |title=Isotopic evidence of saber-tooth development, growth rate, and diet from the adult canine of Smilodon fatalis from Rancho La Brea |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=206|issue=3–4 |pages=303–310 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.01.009[/tpl] These canine teeth were slender and had fine serrations. They were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; thus, these cats did not use their long teeth while taking down prey, due to the risk of breaking.  Only when their prey was totally subdued did they use their teeth to slash the throat.
Despite being more powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon actually had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more pronounced zygomatic arches, while Smilodon had smaller zygomatic arches which restricted the thickness and therefore power of the temporalis muscles, and thus reduced Smilodon's bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates it could produce a bite only a third as strong as that of a lion.[tpl]cite journal | author=Jeff Hecht | title=Sabre-tooth cat had a surprisingly delicate bite | journal=New Scientist | date=1 October 2007 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12712-sabretooth-cat-had-a-surprisingly-delicate-bite.html[/tpl] The study used finite element analysis, a computerized technique common in engineering. There seems to a be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. However, analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern "big cats".[tpl]cite journal | author=Christiansen, P. | title=Comparative bite forces and canine bending strength in feline and sabretooth felids: implications for predatory ecology | journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume=151  | issue=2 | date=October 2007 | pages=423–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2007.00321.x | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/zoj/2007/00000151/00000002/art00007;jsessionid=3fer3dm7dsjm.alexandra [/tpl] In addition, Smilodon's gape could have reached almost 120 degrees,[tpl]cite journal|author=Andersson, K.; Norman, D.; Werdelin, L.;|year=2011|title=Sabretoothed Carnivores and the Killing of Large Prey|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|page=e24971|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024971|bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624971A|pmid=22039403|pmc=3198467[/tpl] while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin, L. D. |year=1980|title=Functional morphology and the evolution of cats |journal=Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=141–54 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1286&context=tnas&sei-redir=1[/tpl] This makes the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.

==Paleoecology and paleobiology==

Smilodon was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats and lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5  mya–10,000 years ago). Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Berta, A. |year=1985 |title=The status of Smilodon in North and South America |journal=Contributions in Science, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |volume=370 |pages=1–15[/tpl] In particular, numerous specimens have been discovered in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California and the Talara Tar Seeps in Peru. Smilodon likely lived in "closed" habitat (forest and bush).[tpl]cite journal|author=Meloro, C.; Elton, S.; Louys, J.; Bishop, L. C.; Ditchfield, P.|year=2013|title=Cats in the forest: predicting habitat adaptations from humerus morphometry in extant and fossil Felidae (Carnivora)|journal=Paleobiology|volume=39|issue=3|pages=323–44|doi=10.1666/12001[/tpl]

===Diet and hunting===

Smilodon was an apex predator and primarily hunted large mammals like bison, camels, ground sloths, horses and mastodons. Isotopes preserved in the bones of S, fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison and camels were most commonly taken by the cats.[tpl]cite journal|author=Coltrain, J. B.; Harris, J. M.; Cerling, T. E.; Ehleringer, J. R.; Dearing, M-D.; Ward, J.; Allen, J.| year=2004| title=Rancho La Brea stable isotope biogeochemistry and its implications for the palaeoecology of late Pleistocene, coastal southern California| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=205| issue=3–4| pages=199–219| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2003.12.008| url=http://bioweb.biology.utah.edu/dearing/2011/Publications/Stable_Isotopes/LaBrea_animals.pdf[/tpl] In addition, isotopes preserved in the enamel of S. gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species feed on the pig-like Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia.[tpl]cite journal| author=Fennec, R. S.| year=2005|title=Growth rate and duration of growth in the adult canine of Smilodon gracilis and inferences on diet through stable isotope analysis| journal=Feranec Bull FLMNH| volume=45| issue=4| pages=369–77[/tpl] Isotopic studies of dire wolf and American lion bones show an overlap with S. fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The amount of prey available to these predators in the La brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa.[tpl]cite journal|author=Vanvalkenburgh, B.; Hertel, F.| year=1993| title=Tough times at la brea: tooth breakage in large carnivores of the late Pleistocene| journal=Science| volume=261|issue=5120| pages=456–59| pmid=17770024|bibcode = 1993Sci...261..456V |doi = 10.1126/science.261.5120.456 [/tpl]
Smilodon was likely an ambush predator and concealed itself in dense vegetation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gonyea, W. J.| year=1976| title=Behavioral implications of saber-toothed felid morphology| journal=Paleobiology| volume=2| issue=4| pages=332–42| jstor=2400172[/tpl] It probably used its great upper-body strength to wrestle prey to the ground, where its long canines could deliver a deep stabbing bite to the throat which would generally cut through the jugular vein and/or the trachea and thus kill the prey very quickly.[tpl]cite journal | author=McHenry, C.R., Wroe S., Clausen, P.D., Moreno, K. and Cunningham, E. | title=Supermodeled sabercat, predatory behavior in Smilodon fatalis revealed by high-resolution 3D computer simulation | journal=PNAS | year=2007 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0706086104 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0706086104v1  | volume=104 | pages=16010–16015 | pmid=17911253 | issue=41 | pmc=2042153|bibcode = 2007PNAS..10416010M [/tpl] By contrast, modern cats kill large prey with a suffocating bite. An alternate hypothesis suggests that Smilodon targeted the belly of its prey. However, this is disputed as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite.[tpl]cite journal |author=Anyonge, W. |year=1996 |title=Microwear on canines and killing behavior in large carnivores: saber function in Smilodon fatalis |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=1059–1067 |jstor=1382786 |url=http://www.2ndchance.info/bones-Anyonge1996.pdf[/tpl] Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Valkenburgh, B.; Teaford, M. F.; Walker, A. |year=1990 |title=Molar microwear and diet in large carnivores: inferences concerning diet in the sabretooth cat, Smilodon fatalis |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=222 |issue=2 |pages=319–40|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1990.tb05680.x[/tpl] Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills.[tpl]cite journal|author=Van Valkenburgh, B. |year=1991 |title=Iterative evolution of hypercarnivory in canids (Mammalia: Carnivora): evolutionary interactions among sympatric predators |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=4|pages=340–362|jstor=2400749[/tpl]

===Social behavior===

Scientists debate whether Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions, spotted hyenas respond more to the distress calls of prey than solitary species. Since Smilodon fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that La Brea S. fatalis were social as well.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carbone, C.; Maddox, T.; Funston, P. J.; Mills, M. G. L.; Grether, G. F.; Van Valkenburgh, B. |year=2009 |title=Parallels between playbacks and Pleistocene tar seeps suggest sociality in an extinct sabretooth cat, Smilodon |journal=Biological Letters |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=81–85 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0526 |pmid=18957359 |pmc=2657756[/tpl] Critics claim the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely to get stuck then lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals like the American lion may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). In addition, they note that solitary cats like tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kiffner, C. |year=2009 |title=Coincidence or evidence: was the sabretooth cat Smilodon social? |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=561–562 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0008[/tpl] The authors of the original study have responded to these criticisms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Valkenburgh, B.; Maddox, T.;  Funston, P. J.; Mills, M. G. L.; Grether, G. F.; Carbone, C. |year=2009 |title=Sociality in Rancho La Brea Smilodon: arguments favour 'evidence' over 'coincidence' |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=563–564 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0261[/tpl]
Another argument for sociality is based on the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heald, F. |year=1989 |title=Injuries and diseases in Smilodon californicus |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology (Supplement) |volume=9 |page=24A[/tpl] This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive as long as it had access to water.[tpl]cite journal|author=McCall, S.; Naples, V.; Martin, L.; |year=2003 |title=Assessing behavior in extinct animals: was Smilodon social? |journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=159–64 |pmid=12697957 |doi=10.1159/000069752[/tpl] Some researchers have argued that Smilodon's brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. However, an analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yamaguchi, N.; Kitchener, A. C.; Gilissen, E.; MacDonald, D. W. |year=2009 |title=Brain size of the lion (Panthera leo) and the tiger (P. tigris): implications for intrageneric phylogeny, intraspecific differences and the effects of captivity |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=85–93 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01249.x[/tpl] Another argument against Smilodon being social is based on it being an ambush hunter in closed habitat which would likely have negated sociality.
Whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic has implications for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggest that if the cats were social they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) conclude that aggression between males was less pronounced in S. fatalis than the American lion. However, Christiansen and Harris (2012) find that as S. fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, there would have been evolutionary selection for competition between males.  
In recent years, Smilodon cubs have been found in tar pits close to the Rancho  La Brea site, near the bones of larger adults. Unlike the mature specimens, juvenile Smilodon had smaller saber teeth which were used more for cutting flesh away from bones than killing prey. This likely implies that they were coming in to feed after the adults had made a kill and fed on parts of the kill that were inaccessible to the adults. In attempting to feed, the cubs and subadults would also become mired and starve to death. This behavior was recently revealed in popular culture in the first episode of the 2013 BBC documentary miniseries "Ice Age Giants".Ice Age Giants: Land of the Sabertooth

===Paleopathology===

Several Smilodon fossils show signs of ankylosing spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma;[tpl]cite journal |author=Bjorkengren, A. G.; Sartoris, D. J.; Shermis, S.; Resnick, D. |year=1987 |title=Patterns of paravertebral ossification in the prehistoric saber-toothed cat |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=148 |issue=4 |pages=779–782 |pmid=3103404 |doi=10.2214/ajr.148.4.779[/tpl] some also had arthritis which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, which is where the largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines.[tpl]cite journal |author=Duckler, G. L. |year=1997 |title=Parietal depressions in skulls of the extinct saber-toothed felid Smilodon fatalis: evidence of mechanical strain |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=600–609 |doi=10.1080/02724634.1997.10011006[/tpl]

==Extinction==

Smilodon went extinct 10,000 years ago, along with most of the Pleistocene megafauna, in the Quaternary extinction event. Its extinction may be linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. However, a 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans.[tpl]cite journal|author=DeSantis, L. R. G.; Schubert, B. W.; Scott, J. R.; Ungar, P. S. |year=2012 |title=Implications of Diet for the Extinction of Saber-Toothed Cats and American Lions |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |page=e52453 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052453|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...752453D [/tpl]
