In heat transfer at a boundary (surface) within a fluid, the Nusselt number (Nu) is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across (normal to) the boundary. In this context, convection includes both advection and diffusion. Named after Wilhelm Nusselt, it is a dimensionless number.  The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the heat convection but with a (hypothetically) stagnant (or motionless) fluid.
A Nusselt number close to one, namely convection and conduction of similar magnitude, is characteristic of "slug flow" or laminar flow.  A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100â€“1000 range.
The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case.

Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer.  Some examples of characteristic length are: the outer diameter of a cylinder in (external) cross flow (perpendicular to the cylinder axis), the length  of a vertical plate undergoing natural convection, or the diameter of a sphere.  For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area.  The thermal conductivity of the fluid is typically (but not always) evaluated at the film temperature, which for engineering purposes may be calculated as the mean-average of the bulk fluid temperature and wall surface temperature.  For relations defined as a local Nusselt number, one should take the characteristic length to be the distance from the surface boundary  to the local point of interest.  However, to obtain an average Nusselt number, one must integrate said relation over the entire characteristic length.
Typically, for free convection, the average Nusselt number is expressed as a function of the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, written as: Nu = f(Ra, Pr).  Else, for forced convection, the Nusselt number is generally a function of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, or Nu = f(Re, Pr).  Empirical correlations for a wide variety of geometries are available that express the Nusselt number in the aforementioned forms.
The mass transfer analog of the Nusselt number is the Sherwood number.

==Introduction==

An understanding of convection boundary layers is necessary to understanding convective heat transfer between a surface and a fluid flowing past it. A thermal boundary layer develops if the fluid free stream temperature and the surface temperatures differ. A temperature profile exists due to the energy exchange resulting from this temperature difference.
The heat transfer rate can then be written as,
And because heat transfer at the surface is by conduction,
These two terms are equal; thus
Rearranging,
Making it dimensionless by multiplying by representative length L,
The right hand side is now the ratio of the temperature gradient at the surface to the reference temperature gradient. While the left hand side is similar to the Biot modulus. This becomes the ratio of conductive thermal resistance to the convective thermal resistance of the fluid, otherwise known as the Nusselt number, Nu.

==Derivation==

The Nusselt number may be obtained by a non dimensional analysis of the Fourier's law since it is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface:
we arrive at
then we define
so the equation becomes
By integrating over the surface of the body:

====Dittus-Boelter equation====

The Dittus-Boelter equation (for turbulent flow) is an explicit function for calculating the Nusselt number.  It is easy to solve but is less accurate when there is a large temperature difference across the fluid.  It is tailored to smooth tubes, so use for rough tubes (most commercial applications) is cautioned.  The Dittus-Boelter equation is:
