[[List of birds of Sri Lanka]]

Sri Lanka is a tropical island situated close to the southern tip of India. The bird life of Sri Lanka is very rich for its size, and about 433 species have been recorded. In addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds.
233 species are resident, of which the most important are the 26 Endemic.The other resident species are also found in the adjacent Indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct Sri Lankan races. Some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in India.
Bird distribution in Sri Lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. The dry zone is largest of the three, covering more than half of the area of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the northeast monsoon from October to January).
The wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the southwestern quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high.
The central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000Â ft) and has a cool temperate climate. Most of the 26 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well.
Recent updates and sighting information can be obtained through the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka web site.

==Shearwaters and petrels==

Order: Procellariiformes. Family: Procellariidae
The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized 'true petrels', characterised by united nostrils with a medium septum, and a long outer functional primary. There are 75 species worldwide of which twelve have occurred in Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite book | last = Onley | first = Derek | coauthors= Scofield, Paul |title = Albatrosses, Petrels and Shearwaters of the World (Helm Field Guides) | year = 2007 | publisher = Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd | isbn =0-7136-4332-3 [/tpl]

==Storm petrels==

Storm-petrels are small birds which spend most of their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering across the water. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. There are 22 species worldwide, two of which has been recorded in Sri Lanka.

==Tropicbirds==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Phaethontidae
Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. There are three species worldwide  of which two have occurred in Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite book | last = Harrison | first = Peter | coauthors= Peterson, Roger Tory |title = Seabirds: A Complete Guide to the Seabirds of the World (Helm Identification Guides)| year = 1991 | publisher =Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd | isbn =0-7136-3510-X [/tpl]

==Pelicans==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Pelecanidae
Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under the beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. There are eight species worldwide  of which one occurs in Sri Lanka.

==Boobies==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Sulidae
The gannets and boobies in the family Sulidae are medium-to-large coastal sea-birds that plunge-dive for fish. There are nine species worldwide of which three have occurred in Sri Lanka. 

==Cormorants==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Phalacrocoracidae
The Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium-to-large coastal, fish-eating sea-birds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies; the majority of species have mainly dark plumage, but some are pied black and white, and a few are more colourful. There are 38 members of this family worldwide, of which three are resident in Sri Lanka.

==Darters==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Anhingidae
Darters are frequently referred to as "snake-birds" because they have long thin necks, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged.
The males have black and dark brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape, and a larger bill than the female. The females have a much paler plumage, especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet, and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. There are four species worldwide, of which one is resident in Sri Lanka.

==Frigatebirds==

Order: Pelecaniformes. Family: Fregatidae
Frigatebirds are large sea-birds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have inflatable coloured throat pouches. They do not swim or walk, and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan to body weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. There are five species worldwide of which three occur in Sri Lanka. None are resident.

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==

Order: Ciconiiformes. Family: Ardeidae
The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills, members of this family fly with their necks retracted. There are 61 species worldwide of which 17 occur in Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite book|last=Walters|first=Michael P.|title=Complete Birds of the World|year=1980|publisher=David & Charles PLC|isbn=0-7153-7666-7[/tpl]

==Storks==

Order: Ciconiiformes. Family: Ciconiidae
Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are virtually mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of stork communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. There are 19 species worldwide of which seven occur in Sri Lanka.

==Ibises and spoonbills==

Order: Ciconiiformes. Family: Threskiornithidae
Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which comprises the ibises and spoonbills. Its members have long, broad wings with 11 primary  and about 20 secondary flight feathers. They are strong fliers and, despite their size and weight, very capable soarers. There are 36 species worldwide  of which three occur in Sir Lanka.

==Flamingos==

Order: Ciconiiformes. Family: Phoenicopteridae

==Ducks, geese and swans==

Order: Anseriformes. Family: Anatidae
The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These are birds that are modified for an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. There are 131 species worldwide  of which 18 occur in Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite book | last =Madge | first =Steve | coauthors= Burn, Hilary|title = Wildfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese and Swans of the World (Helm Identification Guides) | year =  1988| publisher = Christopher Helm|pages =| isbn = 0-7470-2201-1[/tpl]
