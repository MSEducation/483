Maribor ([tpl]IPA-sl|ˈmaːɾibɔɾ|pron|Maribor.ogg|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-de|Marburg an der Drau[/tpl]) is the second-largest city in Slovenia with about 114,487 inhabitants in 2013. Maribor is also the largest city of the traditional region of Lower Styria and the seat of the City Municipality of Maribor. 
In 2000, Maribor was given the Alpine Town of the Year award. Association football club NK Maribor is based in the city.
In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as [tpl]lang-la|Marburgum[/tpl] and [tpl]lang-it|Marburgo[/tpl].

==Early years==

In 1164, a castle known as the Marchburch (Middle High German or "March Castle") was documented in the March of Styria.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]  The castle was originally built on Piramida Hill, which is located just above the city. Maribor was first mentioned as a market near the castle in 1204, and received town privileges in 1254.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] It began to grow rapidly after the victory of Rudolf I of the Habsburg dynasty over King Otakar II of Bohemia in 1278.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]  Maribor withstood sieges by Matthias Corvinus in 1480/1481 and by the Ottoman Empire in 1532 and 1683.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Jewish community===

Jewish people living in Maribor were first mentioned in 1277. However, it is suggested that at that time there was already a Jewish quarter in the city. Notwithstanding, the first reliable source for Jews citizens appeared in 1317. The Jewish ghetto was located in the southeastern part of the city and it comprised, at its peak, several main streets in the city centre including part of the main city square. The ghetto boasted a synagogue, a Jewish cemetery and also a Talmud school. The  Talmud scholar and Halakhist Israel Isserlein was the chief Rabbi of Carinthia, Styria, and Carniola, and spent most of his life as a resident of the city. The Jewish community of Maribor was numerically at its apex around 1410. After 1450 the circumstances changed dramatically: increasing competition that coincided with an economic crisis dealt a severe blow to the economic activities that were crucial to their economic success. According to a decree issued by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in power until 1861.Jewish community of Slovenia [tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl]
In April 1941, Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia, and Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich. The Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps from late spring 1941 onward.

===Early 20th century===

In 1900 the city had a population that was 82.3% Austrian Germans and 17.3% Slovenes (based on the language spoken at home);Leksikon občin kraljestev in dežel zastopanih v državnem zboru, vol. 4: Štajersko. 1904. Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Državna Tiskarna, p. 4. [tpl]sl icon[/tpl] most of the city's capital and public life was in Austrian German hands. Thus, it was mainly known by its Austrian name [tpl]lang|de|Marburg an der Drau[/tpl]. According to the last Austro-Hungarian census in 1910, the city of Maribor and the suburbs Studenci (Brunndorf), Pobrežje (Pobersch), Tezno (Thesen), Radvanje (Rothwein), Krčevina (Kartschowin), and Košaki (Leitersberg) was inhabited by 31,995 Austrian Germans (including German-speaking Jews) and only 6,151 ethnic Slovenes. The surrounding area however was populated almost entirely by Slovenes, although many Austrian Germans lived in smaller towns like Ptuj.
During World War I many Slovenes in the Carinthia and Styria were detained on suspicion of being enemies of the Austrian Empire. This led to distrust between Austrian Germans and Slovenes. After the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and German Austria. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the German-speaking city should be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major Rudolf Maister, who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city. All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new German Austria state. The city council then held a secret meeting, where it was decided to do whatever possible to regain Maribor for German Austria. They organised a military unit called the Green Guard (Schutzwehr), and approximately 400 well-armed soldiers of this unit opposed the pro-Slovenian and pro-Yugoslav Major Maister. Slovenian troops surprised and disarmed the Green Guard early in the morning of 23 November. Thereafter, there was no threat to the authority of Rudolf Maister in the city.
On 27 January 1919 Austrian Germans gathered to await the United States peace delegation at the city's marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops, who apparently feared the thousands of ethnic German citizens. Nine citizens were killed and some eighteen were seriously wounded;[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] who had actually ordered the shooting has never been unequivocally established. German sources accused Maister's troops of shooting without cause. In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the Maribor city hall. Regardless of who was responsible, the Austrian German victims all had been without any arms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The German-language media called the incident Marburg's Bloody Sunday.
As Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes without a plebiscite in the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria.
After 1918 most of Maribor's Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for Austria. These included the German-speaking officials who had not been from the region. Austrian German schools, clubs, and organizations were ordered closed by the new state of Yugoslavia, even though ethnic Germans still made up more than 25% of the city's total population as late as the 1930s. A policy of cultural assimilation was pursued in Yugoslavia against the Austrian German minority similar to the Germanization policy followed by Austria against its Slovene minority in Carinthia. However, in the late 1930s the policy was abandoned and the Austrian German minority's position improved significantly in an attempt to gain better diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany.

===World War II and aftermath===

In 1941 Lower Styria, the predominantly Yugoslav part of Styria, was annexed by Nazi Germany. German troops marched into the town at 9 pm on 8 April 1941.
On 26 April Adolf Hitler, who encouraged his followers to "make this land German again",[tpl]cite book| author = Jozo Tomasevich| title = War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration|volume=2|series=War and revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945|date = 31 January 2001| publisher = Stanford University Press| ISBN = 978-0-8047-3615-2| page = 85 [/tpl] visited Maribor and a grand reception was organised in the city castle by the local Germans. Immediately after the occupation, Nazi Germany began mass expulsions of Slovenes to the Independent State of Croatia, Serbia, and later to the concentration and work camps in Germany. The Nazi goal was to re-Germanize the population of Lower Styria after the war.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] Many Slovene patriots were taken hostage and some are believed to have been shot later in the prisons of Maribor and Graz.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] This led to organised partisans resistance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]. Maribor was the site of a German prisoner-of-war camp from 1941 to 1945 for many British, Australian, and New Zealand troops who had been captured in Crete in 1941.
The city, a major industrial centre with an extensive armament industry, was systematically bombed by the Allies in the closing years of World War II. A total of 29 bombing raids devastated some 47% of the city area, killing 483 civilians and leaving over 4,200 people homeless.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zivljenjenadotik.si/index.php?id=275&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3178&cHash=1838e06bd636ba2a9732f225784f6f85 |title=Maribor 2012: Smrt je kosila tudi iz zraka |publisher=Zivljenjenadotik.si |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]
By the end of the war Maribor was the most war-damaged major town of Yugoslavia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zveza-msdbranik.si/vsebina/1/30/Po_2._svetovni_vojni.html |title=Zveza mariborskih športnih društev Branik |publisher=Zveza-msdbranik.si |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] The remaining German-speaking population, except those who had actively supported the resistance during the war, was summarily expelled at the end of the war in May 1945. At the same time mass killings took place of (alleged) Croatian Home Guard members and their relatives, who tried to escape from Yugoslavia and were executed by the Yugoslav Army, mass graves were discovered in 1999 and 2002.

===Postwar period===

After the liberation Maribor made good use of its proximity to Austria and its workforce, and developed into a major transit- and cultural centre of northern Slovenia, which had been enabled by Tito's decision not to build an Iron Curtain at the borders with Austria and Italy and to provide passports to all Yugoslav citizens.
When Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991, the loss of the Yugoslav market severely strained the city's economy, which was based on heavy industry. The city saw a record unemployment rate of nearly 25%. After Slovenia entered the European Union in 2004, introduced the Euro currency in 2007, and joined the Schengen treaty, all of the border controls between Slovenia and Austria ceased on 25 December 2007. The economic situation of Maribor after the mid-1990s crisis worsened again with the onset of global economic crisis combined with the European sovereign-debt crisis.
In 2012, Maribor saw the beginning of 2012–13 Maribor protests which spread into 2012–2013 Slovenian protests. During the year 2012 Maribor was one of two European Capitals of Culture.  The following year Maribor was the European Youth Capital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mb2013.si/en/ |title= Evropska prestolnica mladih |language=[tpl]sl icon[/tpl] |publisher=Mb2013.si  |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]

===Roman Catholics===

Maribor, previously in the Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau, became part of the Diocese of Lavant on 1 June 1859, and the seat of its Prince-Bishop. The name of the diocese (after a river in Carinthia) was later changed to the Diocese of Maribor on 5 March 1962. It was elevated to an archdiocese by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 April 2006.

==Architecture==

Many medieval structures still stand in Maribor. Of the remains of city walls, the most prominent are the Judgement Tower, the Water Tower, and the Jewish Tower.  The Maribor Cathedral was built in the Gothic style in the 13th century. The Town Hall was constructed in the Renaissance style.
Piramida Hill dominates the northern border of the city. Ruins of the first Maribor castle from the 11th century and a chapel from the 19th century are also situated here. The hill offers an easy-to-reach view of Maribor and its southern Hinterland with the Drava River.
At the start of the new century plans were made for a new modern business, residential and entertainment district, called the Drava Doors ([tpl]lang|sl|Dravska vrata[/tpl]) and nicknamed Maribor Manhattan. The project includes many new exclusive residential apartments, offices and conference halls, a green and recreational space, and other objects. It also includes a [tpl]convert|111|m[/tpl] tall skyscraper that would be the tallest building in Slovenia. Due to lack of finances, the project is currently postponed.
In 2008 the Studenci Footbridge (Studenška brv) was renovated according to the design of the Ponting company. Also in 2008, during the 3rd International Footbridge Conference in Porto, this design was awarded the prestigious Footbridge Award.
Maribor organised in 2010 an international architectural competition ECC Maribor 2012 – Drava 2012 to gather proposals for design and reconstruction of the Drava banks, construction of a new art gallery, and for a new footbridge. Its jury received about 400 proposals for the three different projects. The footbridge and the river embankments will be built in the near future, but the art gallery was replaced with a cultural center MAKS, which currently is under construction.
