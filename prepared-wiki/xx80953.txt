In mathematics, a zero-dimensional topological space is a topological space that has dimension zero with respect to one of several inequivalent notions of assigning a dimension to a given topological space. Specifically:
The two notions above agree for separable, metrisable spaces.

==Properties of spaces with covering dimension zero==

A zero-dimensional Hausdorff space is necessarily totally disconnected, but the converse fails.
However a locally compact Hausdorff space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected. (See [tpl]harv|Arhangel'skii|2008|loc=Proposition 3.1.7, p.136[/tpl] for the non-trivial direction.)
Zero-dimensional Polish spaces are a particularly convenient setting for descriptive set theory. Examples of such spaces include the Cantor space and Baire space.
