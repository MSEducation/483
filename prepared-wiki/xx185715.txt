[[PKD2L1]]

Polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 protein also known as transient receptor potential polycystic 3 (TRPP3) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PKD2L1 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: PKD2L1 polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9033| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

TRPP3 is a member of the polycystin protein family. TRPP3 contains multiple transmembrane domains, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini. TRPP3 may be an integral membrane protein involved in cell-cell/matrix interactions. TRPP3 functions as a calcium-regulated nonselective cation channel. Alternative splice variants have been described but their full length sequences have not been determined.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: PKD2L1 polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9033| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Interactions==

PKD2L1 has been shown to interact with TNNI3.[tpl]cite journal | author = Li Q, Liu Y, Shen PY, Dai XQ, Wang S, Smillie LB, Sandford R, Chen XZ | title = Troponin I binds polycystin-L and inhibits its calcium-induced channel activation | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 24 | pages = 7618â€“25 |date=June 2003 | pmid = 12809519 | doi = 10.1021/bi034210a | url = | issn = [/tpl]
