Ross had been involved in hundreds of interventions with members of various religious groups over a 15-year period.  The large damage award, plus a large number of additional civil tort cases brought against CAN by the Church of Scientology, drove the "Old CAN" into bankruptcy in 1996, and its assets, including records, names and phone numbers, ended up in the hands of Scientologists.[tpl]cite news  | last = Knapp | first = Dan |  title = Group that once criticized Scientologists now owned by one | work = CNN |   publisher = Time Warner | date = December 19, 1996 | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/19/scientology/index.html | accessdate = 2007-10-29 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Baggini | first = Julian  |   title = Making Sense: Philosophy Behind the Headlines  | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2002 |  pages = 201–203 |   isbn =  0-19-280506-1[/tpl]
Ross went into bankruptcy as well, but emerged in December 1996 when Scott reconciled with his mother and settled with Ross for five-thousand dollars and 200 hours of Ross's services "as an expert consultant and intervention specialist". Scott fired his attorney Kendrick Moxon the next day and retained long-time Church of Scientology opponent Graham Berry as his lawyer instead.
After Scott fired Moxon, Moxon filed emergency motions in two states and alleged Scott had been influenced by supporters of CAN to hire Berry as his lawyer.[tpl]cite news  | last =Goodstein | first =Laurie  | title =Plaintiff Shifts Stance on Anti-Cult Group - Scientology-Linked Lawyer Is Dismissed In Move That May Keep Network Running | work =The Washington Post | page =A4 | publisher =The Washington Post Company | date =December 23, 1996  [/tpl] "He's really been abused by CAN and disgustingly abused by this guy Berry", said Moxon in a statement in The Washington Post. Moxon, who had argued in the case that Ross and associates had hindered a competent adult's freedom to make his own religious decisions, immediately filed court papers seeking to rescind the settlement and appoint a guardian for Scott, whom he called "incapacitated".
