Ephippus (Ephippos) of Athens was an Ancient Greek comic poet of the middle comedy.
We learn this from the testimonies of Suidas and Antiochus of Alexandria,Athen. xi. p. 482, c. (cited by Smith) and from the allusions in his fragments to Plato, and the Academic philosophers,Athen. xi. p. 509, c. d. (cited by Smith) and to Alexander of Pherae and his contemporaries, Dionysius the Elder, Cotys, Theodorus[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl], and others.Athen. iii. p 112, f. xi. p. 482, d. (cited by Smith)
The following are the known titles of his plays: Artemis, Bousiris, Gêruonês ("The Geryons"), Empolê ("Merchandise"), Ephêboi ("Adolescents"), Kirkê ("Circe"), Kudôn, Nauagos ("Shipwrecked"), Obeliaphoroi ê Homoioi, Peltastês, Sapphô, Philura. An epigram which Eustathius ascribes to Ephippusad Ilad. xi. 697, p. 879. 38 (cited by Smith) is not his, but the production of some unknown author.Comp. Athen. x. p. 442, d. (cited by Smith) There are some fragments also extant from the unknown plays of Ephippus.Meineke, Fragm. Com. Graec. vol. i. pp. 351-354, iii. pp. 322-340; Fabric. Bibl.
