[[Demographics of South Africa]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of South Africa

The demographics of South Africa encompasses about 52 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. The last census was held in 2011 and the next will be taken anywhere from 2016–2021.
South Africa is home to an estimated five million illegal immigrants, including some three million Zimbabweans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/23/africa/23saf.php|title=Anti-immigrant violence spreads in South Africa, with attacks reported in Cape Town[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1277808,00.html|title=Escape From Mugabe: Zimbabwe's Exodus[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2035097|title=More illegals set to flood SA[/tpl] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7396868.stm|title=South African mob kills migrants|publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 May 2008 | date=12 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Barry Bearak|title=Immigrants Fleeing Fury of South African Mobs|date=23 May 2008|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/world/africa/23safrica.html?_r=1&ref=africa&oref=slogin|accessdate=5 August 2008[/tpl]

==Population==

===Historical population: 1904 to 2011===

===U.N. population projections: 2010 to 2040===

===Age and population estimates: 1950 to 2010===

According to the 2010 revision of the United Nations Secretariat's World Population Prospects, South Africa's total population was 50,133,000 in 2010, compared to only 13,683,000 in 1950. In 2010, 30.1% of the people were children under the age of 15, 65.2% were between 15 and 64 years of age, and 4.6% were 65 or older.Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision All population estimates are rounded to the nearest thousand.

==Vital statistics==

Registration of vital events in South Africa has improved considerably during the past decade, but still not considered to be complete for black South Africans. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates. (Natural increase or decrease over a time period is the difference between that period's live births and deaths, before accounting for inward or outward migration.)

===Age and sex distribution===

===Age and race distribution===

====Age distribution within each racial group====

=====By generation=====

=====By five-year cohorts=====

====Racial composition of each age group====

Note that while over one-fifth (20%) of each age group over 65 is white, whites form less than one-twentieth (5%) of South Africans under 5 years of age. Similarly, while the Coloured population is now about equal to the white population (about 4.6 million each or 8.9% of the total), the nearly 2.9 million Coloured under 35 outnumber just over 2 million whites under 35 in every age group below 35, but the 1.7 million Coloured over 35 are less numerous than their 2.5 million white contemporaries in every age group above 35.

==Racial groups==

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[tpl]cite news|last=Lehohla|first=Pali|title=Debate over race and censuses not peculiar to SA|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp|date=5 May 2005|newspaper=Business Report|accessdate=25 August 2013|quote=Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.[/tpl] The 2011 census figures for these groups were Black African at 79.2%, White at 8.9%, Coloured at 8.9%, Indian or Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[tpl]cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/Census2011/Products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885[/tpl][tpl]rp|21[/tpl] The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; it declined to 16% in 1980,[tpl]Cite book | author=Study Commission on U.S. Policy toward Southern Africa (U.S.) | title = South Africa: time running out : the report of the Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward Southern Africa  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&pg=PA42&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher=University of California Press | year = 1981 | page = 42 | isbn = 0-520-04547-5[/tpl] and 8.9% in 2011.[tpl]rp|21[/tpl]

==Languages==

South Africa has eleven official languages:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fs.gov.za/Departments/SAC/Library/DEPART/lang_legislation1.htm |title=Constitution of South Africa, Chapter 1, Section 6 |publisher=Fs.gov.za |accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sotho, Swazi, Tswana, Tsonga, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. In this regard it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2011 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%), Xhosa (16.0%), and Afrikaans (13.5%).[tpl]rp|23–25[/tpl] Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it ranked fourth, and was spoken by only 9.6% of South Africans as a first language in 2011.[tpl]rp|23–25[/tpl]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Fanagalo, Khoe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi, San and South African Sign Language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/people/language.htm |title=The languages of South Africa |publisher=SouthAfrica.info |date=4 February 1997 |accessdate=7 November 2010[/tpl] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the "unofficial languages" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, and Greek, while some Asians and Indians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. French is still widely spoken by French South Africans especially in places like Franschhoek, where many South Africans are of French origin. South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of Deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

===By ethnicity===

In 2011, the first language was Zulu for 28.1% of Black residents, Xhosa for 19.8%, Northern Sotho for 11.2%, Tswana for 9.7%, Sesotho for 9.3%, Tsonga for  5.5%, Swati for 3.1%, Venda for 2.9%, English for  2.8%, Southern Ndebele for  2.6%, Afrikaans for 1.5%, while 3.4% had another first language.[tpl]cite web|title=Community profiles > Census 2011|url=http://interactive.statssa.gov.za/superweb|publisher=Statistics South Africa Superweb|accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl]
Among whites, Afrikaans was the first language for 59.1% of the population, compared to 35.0% for English. Other language accounted for the remaining 5.9%.

==Religion==

According to the 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7% of the population. This includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus about 1.3%, and Jews 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were classified as other and 1.4% were unspecified.[tpl]CIA World Factbook link|sf|South Africa[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51496.htm|title=South Africa – Section I.

African Indigenous Churches made up the largest of the Christian groups. Some believe that many people claiming no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to traditional indigenous religions. Many people have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.Department of State, USA.
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa. South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12 000 in 1991 to 74 700 in 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0110/p13s1-woaf.html|title=In South Africa, many blacks convert to Islam[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/9398/muslims-say-their-faith-growing-fast-in-africa |title=Muslims say their faith growing fast in Africa |publisher=Religionnewsblog.com |accessdate=7 November 2010[/tpl]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism and Bahá'í Faith.

===By ethnicity===

87.9% of Black residents are Christian, 9.5% have no religion, 0.2% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu and 2.3% have other or undetermined beliefs.
71.8% of White residents are Christian, 23.8% have no religion, 0.2% are Muslim, 1.4% are Jewish, and 0.0% are Hindu. 2.7% have other or undetermined beliefs.

==Immigration==

South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007. Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900). These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[tpl]cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=19 June 2008|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey[/tpl] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are less than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/PublicationsHTML/P03022009/html/P03022009_6.html |title=P03022009_6 |publisher=Statssa.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.So where are Zimbabweans going?, BBC News. 8 November 2005.SA population may be much larger than previously thought Beeld 1 June 2009.Reference to 1996 HSRC studySouth African Police Service 2009 Annual Report page 9 indicating the number exceeds 3 million[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
