==Stadium==

Ferring play their home games at The Geleblands,Greystoke Road, Worthing, west Sussex, BN12 5NJ.
The club has played there since its inception and at first had to user the village hall for changing rooms until the early 1960s when changing rooms were added. A new club house was opened in 1983 with a match against Worthing, and was partly funded by getting the local people to sponsor the 4000 roof tiles at £1 each.
