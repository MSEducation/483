X Factor is a TV show which airs on prime time in Italy. The singing competition is the Italian version of The X Factor franchise. It was hosted until the Season 4 by Francesco Facchinetti, its judges in the first two series (2008 and 2008–2009) were the musical producer Mara Maionchi, TV host Simona Ventura and the singer-songwriter Morgan.
In the third series (2009), former actress/singer-turned-music producer Claudia Mori replaced Ventura as judge.
The fourth series faced many changes: first of all the categories became four like the UK version: 25+, Groups, Boys and Girls. Also, the judge's table faced a major shook-up: Mara Maionchi is the only judge confermed from the past seasons. Claudia Mori and Morgan have been replaced by singer and musician Elio, singer-songwriter Enrico Ruggeri and pop singer Anna Tatangelo.
The fifth series is now aired by pay-TV Sky Uno, the entertainment-purposed channel of Sky Italy, owned by News Corporation. The host is the former MTV veejay Alessandro Cattelan, while the four judges were the TV host Simona Ventura, the young singer Arisa and the singers and songwriters Elio and Morgan for series 5 & 6.
The winners of the first edition were the Vocal Group Aram Quartet. Giusy Ferreri, the runner-up of the show, has become one of the most successful female singers in Italy. The winner of the second edition was Matteo Becucci (25+ years), while Noemi came to major success between the Italian public; the third edition was won by Marco Mengoni. The three series have been won by acts mentored by Morgan. Elio has token the title in the fourth season with Nathalie Giannitrapani. The fifth edition has been won by Francesca Michielin. The sixth has been won by Chiara Galiazzo followed by Michele Bravi during the seventh.
In 2013, the judging panel had slightly changed with Mika replacing Arisa.
