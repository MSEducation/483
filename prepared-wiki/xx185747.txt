[[GRHPR]]

Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GRHPR gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rumsby G, Cregeen DP | title = Identification and expression of a cDNA for human hydroxypyruvate/glyoxylate reductase | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1446 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–8 |date=Nov 1999 | pmid = 10524214 | pmc =  | doi =  10.1016/S0167-4781(99)00105-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Cramer SD, Ferree PM, Lin K, Milliner DS, Holmes RP | title = The gene encoding hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is mutated in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type II | journal = Hum Mol Genet | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2063–9 |date=Dec 1999 | pmid = 10484776 | pmc =  | doi =10.1093/hmg/8.11.2063  [/tpl]
This gene encodes an enzyme with hydroxypyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase, and D-glycerate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. The enzyme has widespread tissue expression and has a role in metabolism. Type II hyperoxaluria is caused by mutations in this gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: GRHPR glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9380| accessdate = [/tpl] GRHPR mutation analysis needs to pay attention to primer design, because allele dropout can cause false-positive result.[tpl]cite journal | author = Takaoka N, Takayama T, Miyazaki M, Nagata M, Ozono S. | title = Modification of primers for GRHPR genotyping: avoiding allele dropout by single nucleotide polymorphisms and homology sequence. | journal = Urol Res. | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 297–302 |date=Dec 2008 | pmid = 18982322 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00240-008-0159-z [/tpl]
