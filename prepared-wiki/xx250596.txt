==Education==

His novel Crabbe was partly inspired by his days as a student at Lakeshore Collegiate Institute. Bell has a master's degree in literature and a second master's in education curriculum and administration, both from the University of Toronto.

==Teaching career==

Bell has taught in a variety of settings. He has been a high school teacher and the head of the English department at Orillia District Collegiate & Vocational Institute. He was a teacher in China at the Harbin University of Science and Technology and the Foreign Affairs College. He has also worked at the University of British Columbia and the Simcoe County Board of Education. He has frequently been invited to give presentations at conferences and to speak to elementary and secondary school students on creative writing.

==Writing career==

The inspiration to become a writer came to Bell when he heard a speech by John Metcalf, author of one of his favourite short stories. Bell says he likes to write for young people because they are "the best audience: they are loyal to the writers they like and they are enthusiastic readers".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stellaraward.ca/author.php?id=23 |title=Stellar Award |author=Niki B. |accessdate=October 22, 2012[/tpl]
