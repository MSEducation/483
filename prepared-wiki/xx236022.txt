The Stillwater wetlands are well-known to birders, as this area has been designated a site of international importance by the Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network because of the hundreds of thousands of shorebirds, such as long-billed Dowitcher, Black-necked Stilt, and American Avocet passing through during migration.
Also listed as a 'Globally Important Bird Area' by the American Bird Conservancy, more than 280 species have been sighted in the area. These tremendously rich and diverse wetlands attract more than a quarter million waterfowl, as well as over 20,000 other water birds, including American White Pelicans, Double-crested Cormorants, White-faced Ibis, and several species of egrets, herons, gulls, and terns.
