The Minnesota Legislature is the bicameral legislature of the U.S. state of Minnesota consisting of two houses: the Minnesota House of Representatives and the Minnesota Senate.
Both houses of the Legislature meet between January and the first Monday following the third Saturday in May each year, not to exceed 120 days per biennium. Floor sessions are held in the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

==History==

Early on in the Minnesota's history, the Legislature had direct control over the city charters that set the groundwork for governments in municipalities across the state. In the early period, many laws were written for specific cities. The practice was outlawed in 1881, though attempts were still made.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f4UIAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=City Charter Making in Minnesota | publisher=University of Minnesota | author=Anderson, William | year=1922 | location=Minneapolis[/tpl] For instance, the long-standing Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and the city's now defunct Library Board were both created by the Legislature in the next several years.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.minneapolisparks.org/default.asp?PageID=1077 | title=History of MPRB | publisher=Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/data/revisor/law/1885/0/1885-SL-003.pdf | title=Laws of Minnesota 1885, chapter 3 | publisher=Office of the Revisor of Statutes | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl] The Minnesota Constitution was amended in 1896 to give cities direct control over their own charters.
In 1913, Minnesota legislators began to be elected on nonpartisan ballots. This was a historical accident that occurred when a bill to provide for no-party elections of judges, city, and county officers was amended to include the Legislature in the belief that it would kill the bill.[tpl]cite web | url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/33/v33i04p155-163.pdf | title=The Origin of Minnesota's Nonpartisan Legislature | publisher=Minnesota Historical Society | date=Winter 1952 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=Adrian, Charles R.[/tpl] Legislators ran and caucused as "Liberals" or "Conservatives," roughly the equivalent in most years to Democratic or Farmer–Labor (later Democratic–Farmer–Labor) and Republican, respectively. In 1974, House members again ran with party designation. In 1976, Senate members again ran with party designation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/histleg/caucus_table.aspx | title=Legislative Party Control: A Chart, 1901 to the Present | publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl]
Following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, women began to be elected to the Minnesota Legislature. In 1922, Mabeth Hurd Paige, Hannah Kempfer, Sue Metzger Dickey Hough and Myrtle Cain were elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives.[tpl]cite web|title=Women Wielding Power: Pioneer Female State Legislators|url=http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/legislators/Minnesota.html|publisher=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl]
In 1984, the Legislature ordered that all gender-specific pronouns be removed from the state laws. After two years of work, the rewritten laws were adopted.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/womenstimeline/details.aspx?recid=1 | title=1986 - Gender Revision in Minnesota Statutes | publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library | work=Minnesota Women's Legislative Timeline: Significant Legislation Passed by the Minnesota Legislature Since Suffrage (1919-2010) | accessdate=March 1, 2014[/tpl] Only 301 of 20,000 pronouns were feminine. "His" was changed 10,000 times and "he" was changed 6,000 times.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jjdI-5tfGOIC&lpg=PA181&ots=6KROe1Cbp3&dq=301%2020%2C000%20pronouns%20minnesota&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q=301%2020,000%20pronouns%20minnesota&f=false | title=The Information Please Girls' Almanac | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | author=McLoone, Margo and Alice Siegel | year=1995 | location=New York, New York | pages=181 | isbn=0-395-69458-2[/tpl]

===Recent history===

Governor Jesse Ventura advocated the idea of changing the Legislature to be unicameral while he was in office, but the concept did not obtain widespread support.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/issues/issues.aspx?issue=uni | title=Unicameral Legislatures | publisher=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library | work=Resources on Minnesota Issues | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl]
In 2004, the Legislature ended its regular session without acting on a majority of the planned legislation, largely due to political divisiveness on a variety of issues ranging from education to same-sex marriage (See same-sex marriage in the United States for related events during the year). A proper budget failed to pass, and major anticipated projects such as the Northstar Corridor commuter rail line were not approved.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/05/17_khoom_sessionwrap/ | title=Minnesota lawmakers have little to show for months of work | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=May 17, 2004 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=Khoo, Michael[/tpl] Governor Tim Pawlenty, an advocate of the line (formerly an opponent), was expected to request a special session, but ended up helping the coordination of other funds to continue development of the line.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/08/03_mccalluml_northstarmoney/ | title=Pawlenty finds money to jumpstart North Star rail line | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=August 3, 2004 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=McCallum, Laura[/tpl] The lack of action in the 2004 session is said to be one reason why a number of Republican House members lost their seats in the November election. The Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) minority grew from 53 to 66 and the Republican majority was reduced from 81 to 68.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/11/03_mccalluml_housefolo/ | title=DFL influence grows at Capitol | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=November 3, 2004 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=McCallum, Laura[/tpl]
The Senate was not up for election in 2004 so the DFL was able to maintain its five-seat majority in the upper house. One state senator, Sheila Kiscaden of Rochester, was an Independence Party member until December 2005 when she began caucusing with the DFL, although she had been an elected Republican in the past. The DFL majority increased to six senators when Kiscaden announced her re-affiliation with the DFL in preparation to run for lieutenant governor on a ticket with DFLer Kelly Doran.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2006/01/09_mccalluml_dorankiscaden/ | title=Doran taps Legislature's only Independent as running mate | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=January 9, 2006 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=McCallum, Laura[/tpl]
There is a mandatory adjournment date specified in the state constitution: "The legislature shall not meet in regular session, nor in any adjournment thereof, after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May of any year." In 2005, the regular session ended without passage of an overall budget and a special session was subsequently called by Governor Pawlenty.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/05/24_mccalluml_caplastday/ | title=Lawmakers go back to work as session ends without agreements | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=May 24, 2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=McCallum, Laura[/tpl] No overall budget passed by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, and much of the government shut down for the first time in the state's history. However, some essential services remained in operation and some departments received funding in legislation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/06/30_scheckt_court/ | title=Lawmakers fail to avert shutdown | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=July 1, 2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=Scheck, Tom[/tpl] A compromise budget was approved and signed into law two weeks later.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/07/14_zdechlikm_budgetfallout/ | title=Budget bills are signed; spin control continues | work=Minnesota Public Radio | date=July 14, 2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2014 | author=Zdechlik, Mark[/tpl]
