==History==

The first groups of organized OR nurses were concerned with many of the same issues AORN and the profession of OR nursing face today, including standardizing OR techniques and education programs and promoting friendship among OR nurses. Between 1916 and 1949, several OR nursing groups formed in various parts of the United States, leading to the formal recognition of AORN as a national association. Major milestones in the association's history include:
AORN is also involved in efforts that advance perioperative professionals and their profession. These activities include:

==Perioperative Nurse Week==

In 1979, the AORN House of Delegates approved a resolution that AORN designate a day each year to promote consumer education and enhance public knowledge regarding the role of the perioperative nurse. November 14 was designated as OR Nurse Day, and a few years later, the observation was expanded to a full week. Since 1979 individual members, AORN chapters, hospitals, and other medical facilities have organized special events and utilized other forms of publicity to help educate the public about the diverse roles performed by perioperative registered nurses. In 2000, OR Nurse Week was changed to Perioperative Nurse Week to more accurately reflect the broad spectrum of patient care services provided to surgical patients by perioperative nurses. It always occurs in the second week of November.
