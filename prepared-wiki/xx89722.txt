The distance that heliograph signals could be seen depended on the clarity of the sky and the size of the mirrors used. A clear line of sight was required, and since the Earth's surface is curved, the highest convenient points were used. Under ordinary conditions, a flash could be seen 30 miles (48 km) with the naked eye, and much farther with a telescope. The maximum range was considered to be 10 miles for each inch of mirror diameter. Mirrors ranged from 1.5 inches to 12 inches or more.  The record distance was established by a detachment of U.S. signal sergeants by the inter-operation of stations on Mount Ellen, Utah, and Mount Uncompahgre, Colorado, 183 miles (295 km)  apart on September 17, 1894, with Signal Corps heliographs carrying mirrors only 8 inches square.Coe, Lewis http://books.google.com/books?id=pzkZPIXm89UC  The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and Its Predecessors in the United States.

==History==

The German professor Carl Friedrich Gauss of the University of Göttingen developed and used a predecessor of the heliograph (the heliotrope) in 1821.[tpl]cite book|last=Dunnington|first=G.

For example, one author in 1919 chose to "hazard the theory"[tpl]cite news|last=Kingman|first=John|title=The Isle of Capri: An Imperial Residence and Probable Wireless Station of Ancient Rome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MXJIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA224&dq=hazard|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=The National Geographic Magazine|page=224|date=September 1919[/tpl] that the mainland signals Roman

no references in ancient writings to the use of signaling by mirrors", and that the documented means of ancient long-range visual telecommunications was by beacon fires and beacon smoke, not mirrors.
Similarly, the story that a shield was used as a heliograph at the Battle of Marathon is a modern myth,[tpl]cite book|last=Krentz|first=Peter|title=The Battle of Marathon|year=2010|publisher=Yale University|isbn=0300120850|pages=160|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ncT8JFn-ed8C&pg=PT160&dq=modern+myth[/tpl] originating in the 1800s.

Sir Henry Christopher Mance (1840–1926), of the British Army Signal Corps, developed the first widely accepted heliograph about 1869[tpl]cite journal|last=Mance|first=Henry|title=The Heliograph or Sun Telegraph|journal=United Service Institution of India|date=2/7/1872|volume=1|issue=5|pages=123–130|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015035103855?urlappend=%3Bseq=665|accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Goode|first=Samuel|title=Mance's Heliograph, or Sun-Telegraph|journal=Journal of the Royal United Service Institution|date=June 14, 1875|volume=XIX|issue=LXXXIII|pages=534–548|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sA5KDfwzI3MC&pg=PA533|accessdate=2011-06-21[/tpl]  while stationed at Karachi, in the Bombay Presidency in British India. Mance was familiar with heliotropes by their use for the Great India Survey. The Mance Heliograph was operated easily by one man, and since it weighed about seven pounds, the operator could readily carry the device and its tripod. The British Army tested the heliograph in India at a range of 35 miles with favorable results.[tpl]cite journal|last=Luck|first=George|title=Army Signalling, Heliograph|journal=United Service Institution of India|date=1872-05-24|volume=2|issue=7|pages=101–105|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015035103855?urlappend=%3Bseq=801[/tpl] During the Jowaki Afridi expedition sent by the British-Indian government in 1877, the heliograph was first tested in war.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Major A.S.|title=Heliography and Army Signalling Generally|journal=Journal of the Royal United Service Institution|date=March 15, 1880|volume=XXIV|issue=CV|pages=235–258|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JL6xU3TbfzkC&pg=235|accessdate=June 21, 2011[/tpl][ref]R.W.

The simple and effective instrument that Mance invented was to be an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times heliography was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as 100 miles with a lightweight portable instrument.
In the United States military, by January 1880, Colonel Nelson A. Miles had established a line of heliographs connecting Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, Montana, a distance of 140 miles.[tpl]cite journal|last=Reade|first=Lt. Philip|title=About Heliographs|journal=The United Service|date=January 1880|volume=2|pages=91–108|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nLCgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA91|accessdate=June 21, 2011[/tpl] Major W. J. Volkman of the US Army, demonstrated in Arizona and New Mexico the possibility of performing communication by heliograph over a range of 200 miles. The network of communication begun by General Miles in 1886, and continued by Lieutenant W. A. Glassford, was perfected in 1889 at ranges of 85, 88, 95, and 125 miles over a rugged and broken country, which was the stronghold of the Apache and other hostile Indian tribes.
By 1887, heliographs in use included not only the British Mance and Begbie heliographs, but also the American Grugan, Garner and Pursell heliographs.  The Grugan and Pursell heliographs used shutters, and the others used movable mirrors operated by a finger key. The Mance, Grugam and Pursell heliographs used two tripods, and the others one. The signals could either be momentary flashes, or momentary obscurations.[tpl]citation | publisher = The American Helio-Telegraph and Signal Light Company | year = 1887 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=Mc90ZgreC8QC | title = An Improved Method in the Art of Signalling for Military and Scientific Purposes | accessdate = 1 June 2008[/tpl]. In 1889, the US Signal Service reviewed all of these devices, as well as the Finley Helio-Telegraph, and finding none completely suitable, developed the US Signal Service heliograph, a two-tripod, shutter-based machine of 13 7/8 lb. total weight, and ordered 100 for a total cost of $4,205.[tpl]citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=88ctAAAAIAAJ | title = Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer of the Army to the Secretary of War | year = 1889 | publisher = Google Books | accessdate = 3 June 2008 | pages= 43–7[/tpl]. In 1893, the number of heliographs manufactured for the US Signal Service was 133.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Chief Signal Officer|year=1893|publisher=U.S. G.P.O.|pages=671|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aypHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA671[/tpl]
The heyday of the heliograph was probably the Second Boer War in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the Boers.  The terrain and climate, as well as the nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large Aldis lamps, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During the early stages of the war, the British garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, Ladysmith, and Mafeking. With land telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night.
In 1909, the use of heliography for forestry protection was introduced in the United States. By 1920 such use was widespread in the US and beginning in Canada, and the heliograph was regarded as "next to the telephone, the most useful communication device that is at present available for forest-protection services". D.P. Godwin of the US Forestry Service invented a very portable (4.5 lb) heliograph of the single-tripod, shutter plus mirror type for forestry use.
Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I,  the cavalry regiments of the Russian Imperial Army were still being trained in heliograph communications to augment the efficiency of their scouting and reporting roles.[tpl]cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=123|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5[/tpl] The Red Army during the Russian Civil War made use of a series of heliograph stations to disseminate intelligence efficiently about basmachi rebel movements in Turkestan in 1926.[tpl]citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qKnZtNHJrVAC | title = Central Asia: Aspects of Transition | first = Tom | last = Everett-Heath | accessdate = 3 June 2008 | page = 20[/tpl].
During WWII, South African and Australian forces used the heliograph against German forces in Libya and Egypt in 1941 and 1942.
The heliograph remained standard equipment for military signallers in the Australian and British armies until the 1960s, where it was considered a "low probability of intercept" type of communication. The Canadian Army was the last major army to have the heliograph as an issue item. By the time the mirror instruments were retired, they were seldom used for signalling. However, as recently as the 1980s, heliographs were used by Afghan forces during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.[tpl]cite book|last=Woods|first=Daniel|title=Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1851097325|page=208|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=RBC2nY1rp5MC&pg=PA211&dq=heliograph|authorlink=Heliograph and Mirrors|editor=Sterling, Christopher[/tpl]  Signal mirrors are still included in survival kits for emergency signaling to search and rescue aircraft.
