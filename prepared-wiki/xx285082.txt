CATEGORIES: Hydrozoa

Solanderiidae is a family of cnidarians within the class Hydrozoa. According to the World Register of Marine Species, Solanderia is the only genus in this family.

==Description==

The hydroid forms large colonies. The chitinous skeleton is internal, branches, and may form anastomoses. The skeleton is formed by coalescence and modification of adjacent hydrocauline tubes. The coenosarc covers the entire colony and penetrates skeletal interstices. The hydranths cover the whole colony surface. Hydranths are uniform in structure, cylindrical, with a single whorl of capitate tentacles around the mouth. Numerous similar tentacles are scattered over the body. Where known, gonophores are cryptomedusoid or eumedusoid, arising directly from the coenosarc.
