[[Pancreas transplantation]]

CATEGORIES: Organ transplantation, Accessory digestive gland surgery

A pancreas transplant is an organ transplant that involves implanting a healthy  pancreas (one that can produce insulin) into a person who usually has diabetes. Because the pancreas is a vital organ, performing functions necessary in the digestion process, the recipient's native pancreas is left in place, and the donated pancreas is attached in a different location.  In the event of rejection of the new pancreas which would quickly cause life-threatening diabetes, the recipient could not survive without the native pancreas still in place. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a partial pancreas from a living donor.Type 1 cures - pancreas transplants At present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes, who can develop severe complications. Patients with the most common- and deadliest- form of pancreatic cancer (pancreatic adenomas- which are usually always malignant, with a poor prognosis and high risk for metastasis- as opposed to more treatable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic insulinomas) are usually not eligible for valuable pancreatic transplantations, since the condition usually has a very high mortality rate and the disease, which is usually highly malignant and detected too late to treat, could and probably would soon return.

==Types==

There are four main types of pancreas transplantation:

==Indications==

In most cases, pancreas transplantation is performed on individuals with type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal disease, brittle diabetes and hypoglycaemia unawareness. The majority of pancreas transplantation (>90%) are simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation.[tpl]cite journal | author=Gruesomer AC, Sutherland DE | title=Pancreas transplant outcomes for United States (US) and non-US cases as reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNIS) and the International Pancreas Transplant Registry (SCRIPT) as of June 2004 | journal=Clint Transplant | year=2005 | pages=433–55 | volume=19 | issue=4  | pmid=16008587 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0012.2005.00378.x[/tpl] It may also be performed as part of a kidney-pancreas transplantation.

==Preservation until implantation==

Standard practice is to replace the donor's blood in the pancreatic tissue with an ice-cold organ storage solution, such as UW (Viaspan) or  HTK until the allograft pancreatic tissue is implanted.

==Complications==

Complications immediately after surgery include thrombosis, pancreatitis, infection, bleeding and rejection. Rejection may occur immediately or at any time during the patient's life. This is because the transplanted pancreas comes from another organism, thus the recipient's immune system will consider it as an aggression and try to combat it. Organ rejection is a serious condition and ought to be treated immediately. In order to prevent it, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Drugs are taken in combination consisting normally of cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids. But as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil instead of azathioprine.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis after pancreas transplantation is very good. Over the recent years, long-term success has improved and risks have decreased. One year after transplantation more than 95% of all patients are still alive and 80-85% of all pancreases are still functional. After transplantation patients need lifelong immunosuppression. Immunosuppression increases the risk for a number of different kinds of infection[tpl]cite journal | author=Fishman JA, Rubin RH | title=Infection in organ-transplant recipients | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1998 | pages=1741–51 | volume=338 | issue=24  | pmid=9624195 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199806113382407[/tpl] Full text and cancer.

==History==

The first pancreas transplantation was performed in 1966 by the team of Dr. Kelly, Dr. Lillehei, Dr. Merkel, Dr. Idezuki Y, & Dr. Goetz, three years after the first kidney transplantation.[tpl]cite journal | author=Kelly WD, Lillehei RC, Merkel FK, Idezuki Y, Goetz FC | title=Allotransplantation of the pancreas and duodenum along with the kidney in diabetic nephropathy | journal=Surgery | year=1967 | pages=827–37 | volume=61 | issue=6  | pmid=5338113[/tpl] A pancreas along with kidney and duodenum was transplanted into a 28-year-old woman and her blood sugar levels decreased immediately after transplantation, but eventually she died three months later from pulmonary embolism. In 1979 the first living-related partial pancreas transplantation was done.
