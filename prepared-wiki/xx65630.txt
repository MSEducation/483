Karl Wallenda (January 21, 1905 â€“ March 22, 1978) was a German-American high wire artist and founder of The Flying Wallendas, a daredevil circus act which performed dangerous stunts, often without a safety net. He was the great-grandfather of current performer Nik Wallenda.

==The Great Wallendas==

The Great Wallendas were  noted throughout Europe for their four-man pyramid and cycling on the high wire. The act moved to the United States in 1928, performing as freelancers. In 1947 they developed the unequaled three-tier 7-Man Pyramid. Karl Wallenda had the idea since 1938 but it took until 1946, when he and his brother Hermann developed it and had the right acrobats for it. The Great Wallendas, a 1978 made-for-TV movie starring Karl Wallenda, depicts the act's comeback after a fatal accident involving several family members during a performance.The New York Times movie review Wallenda was killed in a high wire accident just 38 days after it was first broadcast.The Great Wallendas  at the Internet Movie Database

On July 18, 1970, a 65-year-old Wallenda performed a high-wire walk, also known as a skywalk, across the Tallulah Gorge, a gorge formed by the Tallulah River in Georgia. An estimated 30,000 people watched Wallenda perform two headstands as he crossed the quarter-mile-wide gap.

==Death==

Despite being involved in several tragedies in his family's acts, Wallenda continued with his stunts. In 1978, at age 73, Wallenda attempted a walk between the two towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a wire stretched 121 ft (37 metres) above the pavement. Due to improper wiring support and high winds, he fell to his death during the attempt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wallenda-family-legacy-nik-wallendas-long-line-amazing/story?id=16557997#6|title=Wallenda Family Legacy: Nik Wallenda's Long Line of Amazing Ancestors|last=Gomstyn|first=Alice|last2=Deutsch|first2=Gail|last3=Lopez|first3=Ed|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=June 25, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20110621/ARTICLE/110629907|title=Nik Wallenda stars in 'Life on a Wire'|last=Cox|first=Billy|date=June 21, 2011|publisher=Herald-Tribune|accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] A film crew from WAPA-TV in San Juan taped the fall, and the video, featuring anchorman Guillermo Jose Torres' narration of the fall, circled the world.[tpl]fact|date=July 2012[/tpl]
