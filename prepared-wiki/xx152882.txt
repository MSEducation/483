==Community centre==

Philpstoun Community Education Centre is owned and maintained by West Lothian Council. The building was constructed around 1910, originally being referred to as "The Institute at Philpstoun." The building was commissioned by James Ross and Co., Philpstoun Oil Works Ltd, and was constructed along with the three rows of terraced houses to the north of the centre in a development referred to as the "Philpstoun Garden City."Theodore K.
