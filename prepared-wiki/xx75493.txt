Shangri-La is a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, and particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia — a permanently happy land, isolated from the outside world. In the novel Lost Horizon, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The word also evokes the imagery of exoticism of the Orient. In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, existence of seven such places is mentioned as Nghe-Beyul Khimpalung. Khembalung is one of several beyuls ("hidden lands" similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by Padmasambhava in the 8th century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard 1978).
Many scholars believe that Shangri-La is Shambhala, a mythical kingdom in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.[tpl]cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The phrase "Shangri-La" most probably comes from the Tibetan [tpl]lang-bo|ཞང་[/tpl],"Shang" - a district of Ü-Tsang, north of TashilhunpoChandra Das - Tibetan English Dictionary" + [tpl]lang-bo|རི[/tpl], pronounced "ri", "Mountain" = "Shang Mountain" + [tpl]lang-bo|ལ[/tpl], Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, "Shang Mountain Pass".

==Location==

In China, the poet Tao Yuanming (陶淵明) of the Jin Dynasty (265–420) described a kind of Shangri-La in his work The Tale of the Peach Blossom Spring ([tpl]zh|t=桃花源記|s=桃花源记|p=Táohuā Yuán Jì[/tpl]). The story goes that there was a fisherman from Wuling, who came across a beautiful peach grove, and he discovered happy and content people who lived completely cut off from the troubles in the outside world since the Qin Dynasty (221–207 BCE).[ref]
