Harold Fredrick ShipmanHarold Shipman: The killer doctor BBC News, 13 January 2004 (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004) was a British doctor and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history by proven murders with up to 250 murders being ascribed to him.
On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of 15 murders. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and the judge recommended that he never be released.
After his trial, The Shipman Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, began on 1 September 2000. Lasting almost two years, it was an investigation into all deaths certified by Shipman. About 80% of his victims were women. His youngest victim was a 41-year-old man.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |title=The Shipman Inquiry |publisher=The Shipman Inquiry |date= |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] Much of Britain's legal structure concerning health care and medicine was reviewed and modified as a direct and indirect result of Shipman's crimes.

Shipman died on 13 January 2004, after hanging himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire.

==Early life and career==

Harold Frederick Shipman was born on the Bestwood council estate[tpl]cite news|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=Portrait of a necrophiliac|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/13/shipman.health|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 January 2004[/tpl] in Nottingham, England, the second of the four children of Vera and Harold Shipman, a lorry driver.[tpl]cite news|last=Swan|first=Norman|coauthors=|title=Why Some Doctors Kill|pages=|publisher=The Health Report|date=29 July 2002|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2002/636389.htm|accessdate=1 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert M.|title=Medical Murder: Disturbing Cases of Doctors Who Kill|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=2009|pages=59–60|isbn=1-74175-610-3[/tpl] His working class parents were devout Methodists. Shipman was particularly close to his mother, who died of lung cancerBorn To Kill?, Channel 5, 2 August 2012 when he was 17.[tpl]cite news|last=Herbert|first=Ian|title=How a humble GP perverted his medical skill to become Britain's most prolific mass killer|date=14 January 2004|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-a-humble-gp-perverted-his-medical-skill-to-become-britains-most-prolific-mass-killer-573066.html|accessdate=2 September 2009|work=The Independent|location=London[/tpl] Her death came in a manner similar to what later became Shipman's own modus operandi: in the later stages of her disease, she had morphine administered at home by a doctor. Shipman witnessed his mother's pain subside despite her terminal condition, up until her death on 21 June 1963.http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/shipman/die_3.html The Early Life of Harold Shipman
Shipman studied medicine at Leeds School of Medicine and graduated in 1970. He started work at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 took his first position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. In 1975 he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine for his own use. He was fined £600, and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde near Manchester, in 1977.[tpl]cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Harold Shipman: Timeline|pages=|publisher=BBC News|date=18 July 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2136444.stm|accessdate=1 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Bunyan|first=Nigel|coauthors=|title=The Killing Fields of Harold Shipman|pages=|publisher=Telegraph|date=16 June 2001|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724155/The-Killing-Fields-of-Harold-Shipman.html|accessdate=1 April 2010 | location=London[/tpl]
Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s and founded his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993, becoming a respected member of the community. In 1983, he was interviewed on the Granada television documentary World in Action on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community.http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/shipman/uncovering[tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] A year after his conviction, the interview was rebroadcast on Tonight with Trevor McDonald.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1159420.stm |title=HEALTH | Shipman interview rebroadcast |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2014[/tpl]

==Detection==

In March 1998, Dr Linda Reynolds of the Brooke Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Son's funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; The Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/secondreport.asp|title=Second Report — The Police Investigation of March 1998 (Cm 5853)|date=14 July 2003|publisher=The Shipman Inquiry[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3064231.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Shipman inquiry criticises police|date=14 July 2003[/tpl] His last victim was Kathleen Grundy, a former Mayor of Hyde,[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. Shipman was the last person to see her alive, and later signed her death certificate, recording "old age" as the cause of death.
Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine (heroin), often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the type used to make the forged will.[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=The Shipman tapes I|date=31 January 2000|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/the_shipman_murders/the_shipman_files/613286.stm|work=BBC News|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008[/tpl]
The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of 15 specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health.[tpl]cite news|title=UK Doctor 'forged victim's medical history'|date=8 November 1999|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/510002.stm|work=BBC News|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008|language=[/tpl]
Prescription For Murder, a book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, reports two theories on why Shipman forged the will: one is that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control; the other theory put forward is that he planned to retire at age 55 and then leave the United Kingdom.

==Trial and imprisonment==

Shipman's trial, presided over by Mr Justice Forbes, began on 5 October 1999. Shipman was charged with the murders of Marie West, Irene Turner, Lizzie Adams, Jean Lilley, Ivy Lomas, Muriel Grimshaw, Marie Quinn, Kathleen Wagstaff, Bianka Pomfret, Norah Nuttall, Pamela Hillier, Maureen Ward, Winifred Mellor, Joan Melia and Kathleen Grundy, all of whom had died between 1995 and 1998.
On 31 January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of killing 15 patients by lethal injections of diamorphine, and forging the will of Kathleen Grundy. The trial judge sentenced him to 15 consecutive life sentences and recommended that he never be released. Shipman also received four years for forging the will. Two years later, Home Secretary David Blunkett confirmed the judge's whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers lost their power to set minimum terms for prisoners.
On 11 February 2000, ten days after his conviction, the General Medical Council formally struck Shipman off its register.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/gmc-strikes-shipman-off-medical-register-725618.html|work=The Independent|title=GMC strikes Shipman off medical register|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010|location=London|first1=Maxine|last1=Frith[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/638291.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman struck off|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010[/tpl]
Shipman consistently denied his guilt, disputing the scientific evidence against him. He never made any statements about his actions. His defence tried, but failed, to have the count of murder of Mrs Grundy, where a clear motive was alleged, tried separately from the others, where no obvious motive was apparent. His wife, Primrose, was apparently in denial about his crimes as well.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/16/gender.uk|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=He could do no wrong|date=16 January 2004|accessdate=4 May 2010|first=Corinne|last=Sweet[/tpl]
Although many other cases could have been brought to court, the authorities concluded it would be hard to have a fair trial, in view of the enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Also, given the sentences from the first trial, a further trial was unnecessary. The Shipman Inquiry concluded Shipman was probably responsible for about 250 deaths.The Shipman Inquiry — Sixth Report — Conclusions The Shipman Inquiry also suggested that he liked to use drugs recreationally.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4212627.stm|title=Shipman's 'reckless' experiments|date=27 January 2005|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]

According to historian Pamela Cullen, Adams had also been a serial killer—potentially killing up to 165 of his patients between 1946 and 1956, but as he "was found not guilty, there was no impetus to examine the flaws in the system until the Shipman case. Had these issues been addressed earlier, it might have been more difficult for Shipman to commit his crimes."[tpl]cite web|author=James Stovold|url=http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm|title=Strangerinblood.co.uk|publisher=Strangerinblood.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] H.

==Death==

Harold Shipman committed suicide by hanging in his cell at Wakefield Prison at 06:20 on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 08:10. A Prison Service statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3391871.stm|date=13 January 2004|title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell|publisher=BBC[/tpl]
Some British tabloids expressed joy at his suicide and encouraged other serial killers to follow his example; The Sun ran a celebratory front page headline, "Ship Ship hooray!"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004021004,00.html|date=14 January 2004|title=Ship Ship hooray!|publisher=The Sun|location=London|first=Philip|last=Cardy[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3392135.stm|date=13 January 2004|publisher=BBC News|title=No mourning from Shipman families[/tpl] as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession, and answers as to why he committed his crimes. The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3404041.stm|title=Blunkett admits Shipman error|date=16 January 2004 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
Despite The Sun's celebration of Shipman's suicide, his death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a "cold coward" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Independent, on the other hand, called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3395065.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shipman's death divides papers | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl] In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their committing suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.
Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, although he had reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide so that his widow could receive a National Health Service (NHS) pension and lump sum, even though he had been stripped of his own pension.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3611019.stm|date=8 April 2004|title=Shipman leaves his wife £24,000|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
His wife received a full NHS pension, which she would not have been entitled to if he had died after the age of 60.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4182730.stm|title=Shipman suicide 'not preventable'|publisher=BBC News|date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl] Shipman had been encouraged to take part in courses which would have had him confess his guilt.  After refusing, he became emotional and close to tears when privileges — including the opportunity to telephone his wife — were removed. Privileges had been returned the week before the suicide.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3391871.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell | date=13 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl] Additionally, Primrose, who had consistently believed that Shipman was innocent, might have begun to suspect his guilt. According to Shipman's ex-cellmate Tony Fleming, Primrose had recently written a letter to her husband, exhorting him to "tell me everything, no matter what".

==Aftermath==

In January 2001, Chris Gregg, a senior West Yorkshire detective, was selected to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths.[tpl]cite news |title=How many more did Shipman kill? |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-many-more-did-shipman-kill-630689.html |date=9 October 2001 |work=The Independent |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Following this, The Shipman Inquiry into Shipman's activities submitted in July 2002 concluded that he had killed at least 215 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practised in Todmorden, West Yorkshire (1974–1975), and Hyde, Greater Manchester (1977–1998). Dame Janet Smith, the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more suspicious deaths could not be definitively ascribed to him. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health.
In her sixth and final report, issued on 24 January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at  Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire. Smith concluded the probable number of Shipman's victims between 1971 and 1998 was 250. In total, 459 people died while under his care, but it is uncertain how many of those were Shipman's victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4210581.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Shipman 'killed early in career'|date=27 January 2005[/tpl]
The Shipman Inquiry also recommended changes to the structure of the General Medical Council.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4081425.stm |title=Shipman report demands GMC reform |date=9 December 2004|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
The General Medical Council charged six doctors who signed cremation forms for Shipman's victims with misconduct, claiming they should have noticed the pattern between Shipman's home visits and his patients' deaths. All these doctors were found not guilty. Shipman's widow, Primrose Shipman, was called to give evidence about two of the deaths during the inquiry. She maintained her husband's innocence both before and after the prosecution.
In October 2005, a similar hearing was held against two doctors who worked at Tameside General Hospital in 1994, who failed to detect that Shipman had deliberately administered a "grossly excessive" dose of morphine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4305366.stm|title=Shipman doctors deny misconduct|publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4331208.stm|title=Shipman doctor 'not good enough'|date=11 October 2005|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
A 2005 inquiry into Shipman's suicide found that it "could not have been predicted or prevented," but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined.
In 2005, it came to light that Shipman might have stolen jewellery from his victims. Over £10,000 worth of jewellery had been found stashed in his garage in 1998, and in March 2005, with Primrose Shipman  pressing for it to be returned to them, police wrote to the families of Shipman's victims asking them to identify the jewellery.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4357193.stm|title=Theft fears over 'Shipman gems'|publisher=BBC News|date=17 March 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4446593.stm|title=Twenty make Shipman jewels claims|publisher=BBC News|date=15 April 2005[/tpl]
