==Traditional Chinese medicine==

It is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name huáng qín ([tpl]zh|c=黄芩[/tpl]).[tpl]cite journal | author = Zhang XW, Li WF, Li WW, Ren KH, Fan CM, Chen YY, Shen YL | title = Protective effects of the aqueous extract of Scutellaria baicalensis against acrolein-induced oxidative stress in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells | journal = Pharm Biol | year = 2011 | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–261 | doi = 10.3109/13880209.2010.501803 | pmid = 20979538[/tpl]  As a Chinese traditional medicine, Huang Qin usually refers to the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, S. viscidula Bge., S. amoena C.H. Wright, and S. ikoninkovii Ju. 

==Chemistry==

Several chemical compounds have been isolated from the root; among them, baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, norwogonin, oroxylin AIsolation and purification of baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A from the medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis by high-speed counter-current chromatography.

==Etymology confusion==

It is important to note the Latin name of the Skullcap being used as there are over 200 varieties, some used for various ailments, each with varying degrees of effectiveness.  Sometimes Scutellaria lateriflora (North American Skullcap) is mistaken for Scutellaria baicalensis (Baikal Skullcap).  This confusion can result in the intake of the lateriflora variety which is often processed and contaminated with other plants with high enough levels of toxicity to be of concern.
