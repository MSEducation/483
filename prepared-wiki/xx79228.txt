Western Greece ([tpl]lang-el|Περιφέρεια Δυτικής Ελλάδος[/tpl]) is one of the thirteen regions of Greece. It comprises the western part of continental Greece and the northwestern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.

==Administration==

The Western Greece region was established in the 1987 administrative reform. With the 2010 Kallikratis plan, its powers and authority were redefined and extended. Along with Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands regions, it is supervised by the Decentralized Administration of the Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian Islands based at Patras. The region is based at Patras and is divided into three regional units (pre-Kallikratis prefectures), Aetolia-Acarnania in Central Greece and Achaea and Elis in the Peloponnese, which are further subdivided into 19 municipalities.
The region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, Apostolos Katsifaras, who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.

==Climate==

Its climate has hot summers and mild winters. Sunny days dominate during the summer months in areas within the beaches and partially cloudy and rainy in the mountains. Snow is very common during the winter in the mountains of Erymanthus, Panachaicus and Aroania. Winter high temperatures are around the 10 °C mark throughout the low lying areas.
