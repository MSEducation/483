</ref> visitors traveling up the volcano's flanks are advised to stop for at least half an hour and preferably longer at the visitor center to acclimate to the higher elevation. It is strongly recommended to use a [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle to drive all the way to the top.

There are no facilities, and winds can reach speeds of [tpl]convert|80|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl], but skiing remains a common pastime for some island residents.
