Santiago Méndez Ibarra (1798, Campeche, Campeche - 1872) was governor of Yucatán, Mexico 3 times from 1840 to 1857: 1840 - 1844; 1847–1848; 1855–1857, alternating that office with Miguel Barbachano mainly during his first and second terms. Méndez was a moderate who advocated a strict conservative financial policy for the government. He was noted for his honesty, and gained no personal fortune from his years in governmental power.Yucatan History and History of Mexico. Mexinsider.com. Accessed April 29, 2012. Santiago Méndez was more in favor of union with Mexico than Barbachano, but twice presided over Yucatán declaring its independence, due to frustration with Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.
Santiago Méndez was father of Concepción Méndez Echazarreta and grandfather of Justo Sierra Méndez. Justo Sierra O'Reilly, his son-in-law collaborated with him in policy.Casares G. Cantón, Raúl; Juan Duch Colell; Silvio Zavala et ál. Yucatán en el tiempo (1998) Mérida, Yucatán. ISBN 970-9071-04-1
