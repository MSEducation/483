Matthews is an Unincorporated community on the southeastern edge of Colorado County, in the U.S. state of Texas. The community is located south of Eagle Lake near the junction of FM 102 and FM 950. The settlement was named for a man who owned an area plantation before the American Civil War. By 2013, the school, post office, businesses and railroad line that once served Matthews were gone, but the number of silos in the neighborhood indicated that the land was still being intensively farmed.

==History==

In 1827, John Matthews purchased acreage from James Nelson, one of the Old Three Hundred who were granted land in Stephen F. Austin's colony. Matthews started a successful plantation that owned 140 slaves by 1860. The community that formed in the area served Matthews' and other nearby plantations. After the end of the Civil War, many of the freed slaves stayed in the area. The settlement boasted a blacksmith shop, a cotton gin and a store in 1880. The community acquired a post office in 1895 with Mary McRee serving as postmaster. In 1898 the Cane Belt Railroad was chartered.[tpl]cite web|title=A History of the Cane Belt Branch of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company |last=Osborn |first=William S. |publisher=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |page=305 |accessdate=August 10, 2013 |url=http://texassantafehistory.com/q%20cane%20belt.pdf |year=1998 [/tpl] By June 1899, the railroad stretched from Eagle Lake to Wharton. The Cane Belt was bought by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1904.Osborn (1998), p. 308
In 1900, Matthews had four commercial establishments, a school and 100 residents. The post office closed in 1905 and mail began to be delivered from Eagle Lake. The population remained steady until the 1960s when the hand-picked cotton harvests were replaced by mechanized rice and corn production. By the mid-1980s there was only one local business. The railroad through the area was abandoned in 1992 and the tracks removed.[tpl]cite web|last=Hudgins |first=Merle R. |title=Handbook of Texas Online: BONUS, TX |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnb60 |accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl] The former railroad right-of-way running parallel with FM 102 near Matthews can be easily seen in satellite views.
