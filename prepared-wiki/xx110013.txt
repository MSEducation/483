==History==

===Champions===

===2003 – 2008===

The league was formed after the collapse of the Korean ice hockey league and dissolution of the Japanese league. It was started with the goal of promoting hockey in Asia as well as helping the various participating countries develop their hockey programs and increase their showing in the Olympics. The first season was a shortened season of only five teams, and played as a tournament rather than a regular season. Four Japanese teams and a Korean team participated. The tournament lasted just two months and each team played four games, two at home and two away, against each other. Due to the shortened tournament format there were no playoffs and the winner was declared from the point tally. The Nippon Paper Cranes won the tournament with 39 points. and Joel Prpic from Kokudo was the assist and points leader with 25 assists and 33 points. Ryan Haruo Kuwabara, of the Cranes, was the scoring leader with 15 goals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/popup/1/point_rank.html|title=2003–2004 Point Ranking|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|accessdate=9 December 2009[/tpl]

The 2005–06 season saw a number of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to financial trouble. At the same time it was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/archive/al_com04_05/index.html|title=The Golden Amur (Russia) expressed to retreat from the League|date=7 June 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/archive/al_com05_06/index.html|title=Kangwon Land team withdrew their application to join to the season of 2005–2006|date=28 June 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060112224250/http://www.alhockey.com/news/050628/index.html|archivedate=12 January 2006[/tpl] The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/archive/al_com05_06/index.html|title=Anyang Hallawinia(South Korea)” changes its name to “Anyang Halla.|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20051023053546/http://www.alhockey.com/news/050708/index.html|archivedate=23 October 2005[/tpl] In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish/Chinese joint venture that saw the team based out of Beijing. As part of the venture Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/archive/al_com05_06/index.html|title=Asia League Ice Hockey 2005–2006 To Have 9 Participating Teams Entry of 2 New Teams Virtually Decided|date=22 July 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060105112318/http://www.alhockey.com/news/050722/index.html|archivedate=5 January 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Sports/GG21Dk06.html|title=Mainland braced for Viking invasion|work=The Standard |date=21 July 2005|accessdate=9 December 2009[/tpl] This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38. This resulted in an uneven schedule. For example the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings who they played five times. At the end of the regular season the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a second year in a row with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/popup/5/point_rank.html|title=2005–2006 Points Ranking|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|accessdate=9 December 2009[/tpl] The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla who was making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious claiming the title for the second year in a row.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/popup/6/standings.html|title=2005–2006 Playoff Standings|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|accessdate=9 December 2009[/tpl] Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs.

Further changes were seen in the league in the 2006–07 season.

The Chinese based teams, for example, played each other and the Korean teams each six times but only played the Japanese teams four times. The Paper Cranes easily won the regular season again finishing first with 86 points.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alhockey.com/popup/7/standings.html|title=2006–2007 Standings|work=Alhockey.com|publisher=Asia League Ice Hockey|accessdate=9 December 2009[/tpl] With the previous year's goal leader not participating the scoring race went to Tim Smith of Kangwon Land.

Kangwon Land swept Halla in three games and Oji Paper beat the Ice Bucks three games to one.

After a season with little change to the make-up of the league, the 2009–2010 saw further change. The San Jose Sharks ended their association with the Chinese team. They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent. The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost. The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon.

==Game==

Each Asia League Ice Hockey regulation game is an ice hockey game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions.[tpl]cite book |title=Fan Book & Media Guide Book |year=2009 |publisher= Anyang Halla Ice Hockey Club|location= South Korea|isbn= |pages=138 |url= |accessdate=10 December 2009[/tpl] While some teams have television broadcast contracts, they do not take television time-outs like the NHL. At the end of the 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime is five minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. In a playoff game the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.

==Imports==

Asia League was created primarily for the development of hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.
Several National Hockey League players have played in the league, including Greg Parks, Esa Tikkanen, Chris Lindberg, Tavis Hansen, Shjon Podein, Jason Podollan, Derek Plante, Steve McKenna, Jarrod Skalde, Joel Prpic, Tyson Nash, Jamie McLennan, Shane Endicott, Wade Flaherty, Kelly Fairchild, Brad Tiley, Ricard Persson, Bryan Young, Claude Lemieux, Brad Fast, Ric Jackman and Cole Jarrett.

==Teams==

Early in its existence the league hoped to quickly expand to 12 teams but due to some teams having financial difficulties they didn't attain it. In its 2013–14 season, the Asia League Hockey has 8 teams, comprising 4 teams from Japan; 3 teams from South Korea; and 1 from China.

==Season structure==

Asia League Ice Hockey season is divided into three parts. The late summer and early autumn comprise training camps and exhibition play. After that the regular season takes place, which lasts for several months dependent on the schedule. Finally several teams advance to a post-season playoff. This is an elimination tournament where teams play a "best-of" format to advance through the rounds. The final remaining team is crowned the champion for the year.
The regular season has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the amount of teams changing from season to season in the first few years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for a three game series and also play a three game series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.
The league ranks the teams by points. A regulation time win is worth three points. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, both teams receive one point. The team which is victorious either in the overtime period or overtime shoot-out receives an additional point. A regulation time loss is worth zero points.
At the end of the regular season the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past generally takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason. As with the regular season, the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled the end of the regular season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.

==Awards==

Asia League awards several awards each season in addition to The Championship Trophy. Prior to the 2008–09 season the awards were issued after the postseason but in that season they were issued during the break between the regular season and postseason. The league presents awards for:
All of the awards, except for Best Hockey Town, are sponsored by an organization or individual.
