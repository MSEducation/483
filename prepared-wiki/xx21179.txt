[[Tri-Cities, Washington]]

CATEGORIES: Columbia River, Tri-Cities, Washington

The Tri-Cities is a mid-sized metropolitan area in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Washington, consisting of three neighboring cities: Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland. The cities are located at the confluence of the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers in the semi-arid region of Southeastern Washington. A fourth neighboring city, West Richland, is generally included as part of the Tri-City area and region, as are a handful of unincorporated communities. Each city either borders another or one of the area's rivers, making the Tri-Cities seem like one uninterrupted mid-sized city.
The combined population of the three major cities was 193,567, whereas the population of the metropolitan area was 253,340 at the 2010 Census. As of April 1, 2013, the Washington State Office of Financial Management, Forecasting Division estimates the cities proper as having a population of 221,330 and the metropolitan area having a population of 268,200, thus making it the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Washington State, after Seattle-Tacoma, Spokane, and the Washington part of the Portland metropolitan area.
The Tri-Cities Airport located in Pasco provides the region with commercial and private air service. Pasco is the seat of Franklin County, while the other cities are located in Benton County.
In 2010, Kiplinger rated the Tri-Cities among the Top 10 best places to raise a family, and CNN/Money ranked the Tri-Cities one of the top 10 best bets for gains in housing value, due to its relatively stable economic conditions since the early 2000s.

==Area history==

===Founding===

Pasco was the first of the Tri-Cities to be incorporated, in 1891. Kennewick was incorporated in 1904, and Richland followed in 1910. West Richland was founded by dissatisfied residents of Richland, who wished to be home owners rather than renters of government-owned houses, after the arrival of Hanford. Despite attempts by Richland to annex the community, they remained separate and eventually became incorporated in 1955.

===Early history===

Pasco was the largest city in the Tri-Cities, mostly due to its railroad station. It also had the most land for easy irrigation and farming and was still the largest up until the founding of Hanford near Richland.
Farming was the basis of virtually every sector of the economy in the early years. Even today, agriculture is a big part of the Tri-Cities, Pasco in particular.

===1940s – 1970s===

After the founding of the Hanford Site in 1943, Richland became the largest city of the three overnight. Richland's Columbia High School adopted "Bombers" as its mascot (complete with mushroom cloud logo). In 1970, Kamiakin High School (in the neighboring city of Kennewick) was founded in response to the continued influx of people. The economy continued to grow, but not without some turbulence. Every time the federal government cut funding at Hanford, thousands of talented, credentialed people would suddenly become jobless and quickly leave for other jobs. During this time, other employers slowly made their way into the area, but they too would often be forced to cut jobs in the bad times. During the 1970s, Kennewick overtook Richland as the largest city (population-wise) of the three and has not surrendered the title since. The Columbia Center Mall was built on land newly incorporated into Kennewick, drawing growth to western Kennewick and south Richland.

===1980s – 1990s===

Completion of the Interstate 182 Bridge in 1984 made Pasco much more accessible, fueling the growth of that city.[tpl]cite news |first=Joel |last=Connelly |title=We have to live with our transit decisions |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/connelly/244857_joel17.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |date=2005-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl] With the end of the Cold War, many in the area feared a shutdown of Hanford, followed by the Tri-Cities quickly becoming a ghost town. These fears were allayed after the United States Department of Energy switched the facility's purpose from the creation of nuclear weapons to the effective sealing and disposal of radioactive waste. During the 1990s, several major corporations entered the Tri-Cities, which helped to begin diversifying the economy apart from the Hanford sector. In 1995, a sixth public high school, Southridge High, was founded in south Kennewick.

===2000s – present===

The 2000s saw continued rapid growth as the Hanford site hired hundreds of workers to help with the cleanup effort. Additionally, the Tri-Cities saw a large influx of retirees from various areas of the Northwest. During this time, and the corresponding nationwide housing boom, all three cities flourished and grew significantly. Pasco became the fastest growing city in Washington State (in terms of both percent increase and number of new residents). In 2005, the Census Bureau reported that Pasco's population had surpassed Richland's for the first time since pre-Hanford days.
Despite the economic recession of the late 2000s, the Tri-Cities area continued to maintain steady growth and a stable economic climate due in large part to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which directed funding and jobs to the Hanford site and its various cleanup efforts.

Thanks to the aforementioned rivers, a large amount of cheap irrigation is available.
Washington is the most northwest of the lower 48 states—consequently, the area is in the Pacific Standard Time Zone. The Tri-Cities makes up the largest metropolitan area in the southeastern quadrant of Washington. The large Cascade Mountain Range to the west contributes to the semi-arid climate, which is far drier than the famously wet western side of the state. See rain shadow for more information on this phenomenon. The region's climate results in a shrub-steppe ecosystem[ref]

Just west of Richland, the Fitzner/Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve was established to study the unique plants and animals found in the local shrub steppe ecosystem. It is the largest tract of shrub-steppe ecosystem remaining in the U.S. state of Washington.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/documents/alefactsheet.pdf|title=Fitzner/Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve Fact Sheet|publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Hanford Reach National Monument|date=August 2002|accessdate=2008-07-10|format=pdf|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081030044139/http://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/documents/alefactsheet.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-30[/tpl]
The Tri-Cities area offers many star gazing opportunities. Limited city lights and an absence of photopollution in the area allow for unadulterated naked eye and telescopic astronomy depending on the time, weather and season. The Tri-City Astronomy Club partners with LIGO to sponsor free LIGO Star Parties, which are open to the public and held at the Hanford Observatory. Prominent hiking locations, such as Badger Mountain and Jump Off Joe Butte, provide an expansive view of the Tri-Cities area—opportunities to see the sunrises and sets and study celestial bodies and stellar astronomy.  The aurora borealis (or northern lights) can be visible near Tri-Cities certain times of the year.[tpl]cite news|last=Tuthill|first=Samantha-Rae|title=Dazzling Northern Lights Anticipated Tonight|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/dazzling-northern-lights-antic-1/10107004|accessdate=2 June 2013|newspaper=AccuWeather|date=13 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Herald|first=Tri-City|title=Northern Lights may be visible today in Tri-Cities Read more here: http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2011/08/06/1595138/northern-lights-may-be-visible.html#storylink=cpy|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2011/08/06/1595138/northern-lights-may-be-visible.html|accessdate=2 June 2013|newspaper=Tri-City Herald|date=6 August 2011[/tpl]

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===

Current higher education opportunities in the Tri-Cities include:
In 2005, the State of Washington approved the transition of the existing Washington State University branch campus in Richland from a two-year to a four-year campus. In the fall of 2007 the campus admitted its first undergraduate students. Offering a wide range of programs, the campus focuses heavily on biotechnology, computer science, and engineering, due to the nearby Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Hanford site. The university is beginning to acquire a significant number of quality teachers and offers a fairly broad range of majors, including English, history, and other liberal arts and sciences.
Columbia Basin College also offers higher education opportunities for residents of the Tri-Cities, as well as the Columbia Basin from Mattawa, Washington (50 miles away) to Umatilla, Oregon (30 miles away).
The University of Phoenix also has a satellite campus in Kennewick, serving local online students.[tpl]Cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.phoenix.edu/campus-locations/wa/eastern-washington-campus/tri-cities-student-resource-center.html|title=Tri Cities Student Resource Center|work=|publisher=University of Phoenix, Inc|date=|accessdate=February 19, 2011|archiveurl=|archivedate=[/tpl]

===Primary and secondary schools===

Each city provides its own schooling services through their respective school districts—Kennewick's, Pasco's, and Richland's.
Public High Schools:
Kennewick
Pasco
Richland
The area also boasts two regional high schools, Tri-Tech and Delta High. Tri-Tech is a technical/vocational high school in the Kennewick School District that is attended by students from all over the Tri-Cities area. Just a few of the technical programs included in the curriculum are television/video production, automotive, and dental. Delta High is a science and technology focused high school located in Richland. It is sponsored by Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland's school districts, Battelle, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Columbia Basin College.
There are also several private and faith-based schools in the area.

==Industry==

===Early Hanford===

Since the 1940s, the Hanford site has employed a majority of residents. The United States government built a top-secret facility to produce and separate plutonium for nuclear weapons, and decided on an area just north of then-tiny Richland. The government built temporary quarters for the more than 45,000 workers and built permanent homes and infrastructure for other personnel in Richland. The city had an overnight population explosion, yet virtually no one knew what the purpose of Hanford was until the destruction of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 by an atomic weapon containing Hanford-produced plutonium. After World War II Hanford continued work on creating material for nuclear weapons during the Cold War. After the fall of the USSR in 1991, Hanford, the site of severe nuclear contamination, changed its mission from plutonium production to environmental cleanup and restoration.

===Modern Hanford===

The Hanford site is one of the largest cleanup projects in the United States costing over 1.4 million per dayLisa Stiffler, "Hanford cleanup cost soars to $11.3 billion ... if Congress will pay", Seattle Pi, April 30th 2006, to turn over 53 million gallons of nuclear waste into glass through a process called vitrification.Matthew Wald, [tpl]Wayback |date=20080611085657 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D71638F935A25752C0A96E958260 |title="Panel Details Management Flaws At Hanford Nuclear Waste Site" [/tpl], The New York Times, Jan 16th 1998 The process is proving to be one of the most dangerous in the world,Valeria Brown,"Hanford Nuclear Waste Cleanup Plant May Be Too Dangerous" but is essential to staving off nuclear contamination of the nearby Columbia River.Jim Snyder, "Leaking Nuclear Sludge Could Threaten Columbia River", Feb 19 2013, Bloomberg Original estimates were 2.8 billion dollars over five years to cleanup the waste,Keith Schneider, "Agreement Set For a Cleanup At Nuclear Site", New York Times, February 28th 1989 though estimates quickly grew in the early 90s to 50 billion with a completion date of thirty years.q=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.seattletimes.nwsource.com%2Farchive%2F%3Fdate%3D19930812%26slug%3D1715638&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEa0ePYoltlY9vA911eRG6FChjUIA Costs are now projected at 112 billion dollars and an estimated completion date of 2065.Anette Cary, "New cost for Hanford cleanup projected at $112 billion", Tri-City Herald, Feb 9th 2012 Over 18% of all jobs in the Benton Franklin County area are either nuclear related, research related, or engineering.http://www.tridec.org/site_selection/tri-cities_demographics/major_industry_employers/

===Columbia Generating Station===

The Columbia Generating station operates ten miles outside of Richland and is the only nuclear power station in the Pacific Northwest. It uses a boiling water reactor with a type 5 layouthttp://nuclear-power-plants.findthedata.org/l/20/Columbia-Generating-Station-Unit-2 and was relicensed 10 years to operate until 2043.John Pearson,"Columbia Generating Station: Why relicense a nuclear power plant 10 years early?"

===Agriculture===

The Tri-Cities economy has historically been based on farming and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. From Pasco's incorporation in 1891 to present day, the Tri-Cities have had a large degree of farming thanks to irrigation by the three nearby rivers. Wheat is the most commonly grown product; however, large amounts of apples, corn, grapes are also grown, along with potatoes, and other products including asparagus. Cherries are also grown in the region.
Grapes grown in the region are essential to the wine industry. Wineries draw a large population of tourists.  With 160 wineries in the Columbia Valley,[tpl]cite web|title=The Heart of Washington Wine Country|url=http://www.visittri-cities.com/visitors/wine/|work=Tri-Cities Visitor & Convention Bureau|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] this industry accounts for $1 billion annually in Benton County alone.[tpl]cite web|last=Perdue|first=Andy|title=New study shows Washington wine industry worth $8.6 billioin|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2012/04/24/1915381/wine-state-industry-worth-86-billion.html|work=Tri-City Herald|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] Many wineries such as Goose Ridge Estate Winery, Preston Premium Wines, and Tagaris Winery are open for wine tasting and special events. Often referred to as The Heart of Washington Wine Country, local and Tri-City wineries provide luxurious tours and give you the option of enrolling in their wine club membership.
The Tri-Cities’ unique climate allows the region to have a broad and sustainable agricultural economy. Local industries provide employment for thousands of people in the Tri-Cities area. Some of the top 20 employers in agriculture include ConAgra, Tyson Foods, and Broetje Orchards.[tpl]cite web|title=Major Industry Employers|url=http://www.tridec.org/site_selection/tri-cities_demographics/major_industry_employers/|work=Tri-City Development Council|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] Agriculture makes up 9.5% of employment in Tri-Cities[tpl]cite web|last=Pihl|first=Kristi|title=Washington No. 1 in ag - and the Mid-Columbia grows most of those crops|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2012/09/02/2083910/washington-no-1-in-ag-and-the.html|work=Tri-City Herald|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] and local businesses combined employ thousands of people. In 2012, the state of Washington was rated #1 in the nation when it comes to growing apples, hops, spearmint oil, sweet cherries, pears, concord grapes and processing carrots. The Mid-Columbia region including the Tri-Cities grows most of these crops. The regions climate and irrigation from nearby rivers, like the Columbia River, Snake, and Yakima River, allow farmers to produce an abundant amount of corn, hay, wheat and potatoes. In Washington State there are 39,500 farms, 1,630 of these farms are located in Benton County and 891 are located in Franklin County. Many farms can be seen from major highways and interstates.

===Local cuisine===

The Tri-Cities offers a wide range of locally owned and operated restaurants. These restaurants show the variety of cuisine offered to visitors and residents of the area. The Spudnut Shop, for example, located in downtown Richland, was opened in 1948 and has been family-run ever since. The Travel Channel featured The Spudnut Shop and their donuts “made from potato flour and then deep-fried to perfection.”[tpl]cite web|last=D'Agenais|first=Laurel|title=Donut Paradise|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/food-and-drink/articles/donut-paradise|accessdate=12 October 2013[/tpl] Carmine's, also a family owned restaurant in the region, serves Italian food in a historic home that was constructed in downtown Kennewick in 1929.[tpl]cite web|last=MR|title=Carmine's Restaurant Information|url=http://calendar.tri-cityherald.com/kennewick_wa/venues/show/935598-carmines[/tpl] Another addition to these local restaurants is Monterosso's Italian Restaurant which serves lunch and dinner in an antique railroad dining car.

===Wine and breweries===

In sharp contrast to Seattle, the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, and the rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula, the Columbia Valley enjoys long, warm, summer days, and crisp cool nights. The mild weather combined with rich volcanic soils and controlled irrigation produce near-perfect conditions for premium wine grapes.
The wide range of varietals grown throughout the region includes the noble Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Riesling, and Pinot Noir, among others. Unlike large established vineyards in other parts of the United States and Europe, the growers and winemakers of Washington will often devote personal attention to visitors, offering tastings and discussing their craft.
With more than 160 wineries within an hour’s drive, the Tri-Cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland is truly at the heart of the Columbia Valley which includes the Yakima Valley, Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain, Horse Heaven Hills, and Wahluke Slope appellations (areas with a distinctive growing climate that influences wine production). It is easy to conceive that Columbia Valley wineries would produce high-end, premium wines since the Tri-Cities area lies on the same latitude as the world-famous Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France. The region’s wonderful weather combines with the Columbia Valley’s volcanic soil, producing hot summer days and crisp, cool evening breezes which naturally stress the vines, creating conditions for making great wine.
The Tri-Cities region offers a multitude of wineries and microbreweries that attract crowds of tourists and visitors to the area. Some of the local microbreweries include: 
Ice Harbor Brewery Company, Atomic Ale Brewpub and Eatery, and White Bluff Brewing.
Ice Harbor Brewery Company was founded in 1996 and has two locations in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, one at 206 N Benton St., the other located at 350 Clover Island Dr. in Kennewick, WA. In 2010, Ice Harbor received a bronze award for their Sternwheeler Stout, Runaway Red Ale, Indian Pale Ale (IPA) and a Silver Award for their Tangerine “ExBEERience” Hefeweizen at the Washington Beer Awards competition.[tpl]cite news|last=Herald Stagg|title=National Beer Magazine Honors Ice Harbor Brewery|url=|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Tri-City Herald.com|date=15 October 2013[/tpl]

The franchise relocated to the Tri-Cities initially as the New Westminster Bruins and later changed its name to the “Americans” in 1988.[tpl]cite web|title=Tri-City Americans Statistics and History|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/tri-city-americans-8541.html|work=hockeyDB.com|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]  The Americans have advanced to the WHL finals one time in their tenure in the Tri-Cities, where they lost to the Calgary Hitmen 4-1 during the 2009-2010 season. The Americans currently play at the Toyota Center in Kennewick, Washington.
The Tri-City Dust Devils are a Single A, short-season minor league baseball team that is an affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. The Dust Devils came to the Tri-Cities in 2001, relocating from Portland and changing the team’s name from the Portland Rockies to the Tri-City Dust Devils. The Dust Devils took over as the primary tenants of Gesa Stadium, which previously housed the Tri-City Posse. The Dust Devils have been the Northwest League East Division Champions three times in their history in the Tri-Cities, namely 2007, 2009 and 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Dust Devils Team History|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t460&ymd=20060526&content_id=84113&vkey=team2|work=milb.com|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]
The most recent addition to the professional sports teams of the Tri-Cities is the Tri-Cities Fever. “The Fever” came to the Tri-Cities in 2005 as an expansion team for the National Indoor Football League. Since then, the Fever have switched to the AF2 in 2007, and then to their current home in the Indoor Football League.[tpl]cite web|title=Team History|url=http://www.tricitiesfever.com/team-history/|work=tricitiesfever.com|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]  The Fever are also currently housed in the Toyota Center in Kennewick, Washington proudly acquiring one division title and one league championship in their short history. The Fever won the Indoor Bowl in 2005 as a member of the NIFL, and in 2012 they were the Intense Division champions in the IFL where they ultimately proceeded to lose the United Bowl Championship game to the Sioux Falls Storm. During the 2012 season, the Fever were awarded the 2012 IFL Franchise of the Year.

==Culture and demographics==

The Tri-Cities gets most of its culture from its Cold War past, as well as agriculture and Native American culture. The Hanford Nuclear Site is home to many area landmarks and history, including the world's first full scale nuclear reactor.
Additionally, the people of the area are proud of the fact that the area hasn't changed much over time and that it is hard to find a $50 dinner and that Rolex watches are no longer sold in the TriCities.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/12/washingtons_tri-cities_boosted.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Tri-Cities combine for nation's fastest-growing metro area, boosted by federal money to mop up Hanford | date=5 December 2012[/tpl]

==Consolidation issues==

===Consolidation vs. staying "The Tri-Cities"===

Over the years, the cities have had difficulty establishing and projecting an identity that would attract and sustain business, tourism, and growth beyond the Hanford-related business sector. Much of this stems from the fact that the individual cities each have populations less than 75,000, and do not have much of a presence on their own. Additionally, the cities must compete independently to draw business, tourism, and establish an identity. In an effort to address this concern, there have been repeated efforts to consolidate all four cities into one united incorporated area. The idea driving this movement is that one larger city would create the presence needed to draw increased attention and focus to the region. As noted above, if the Tri-Cities were to consolidate into one city, it would become the fourth largest in the state, behind Seattle, Spokane, and Tacoma. To date, motions to consolidate have repeatedly failed.[tpl]Cite news |last=Trumbo |first=John |url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2009/01/28/460030/should-the-tri-cities-consolidate.html |title=Should the Tri-Cities consolidate? |work=Tri-City Herald |publisher=McClatchy |date=January 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 25, 2012 [/tpl]
Residents of West Richland and newcomers to the area often suggest that the area rename itself, since there are obviously four cities in the Tri-Cities. This suggestion is usually shunned by residents of the other cities, for the simple reason that "Quad-Cities" doesn't sound as good (as well as the fact that West Richland has a much smaller presence compared to the three major cities) as well as the fact that there is already a Quad Cities on the Mississippi River with Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa, Rock Island and Moline in Illinois. The name "Three Rivers" has recently come to be used more for the area (from the Columbia, Snake, and Yakima rivers), yet is rarely mentioned beyond professional settings.
West Richland is particularly struggling with a regional identity: it had recently considered renaming itself "Red Mountain" in an attempt to distinguish itself from Richland, as well as considering consolidating with the city of Richland. Additionally, the western half of the city of Pasco (locally referred to as West Pasco) has considered secession, in order to distinguish itself from the older, poorer part of town to the East. These considerations provide further complications with respect to consolidation and the "Tri-Cities" name.

===Small town vs. big city===

One of the current debates in the Tri-City area is whether to try to maintain a small-town-feel or to embrace its growth and become a larger metropolitan area. One of the biggest parts of this debate is to allow the surrounding Horse Heaven Hills to be subdivided into residential areas or to leave them alone. Although many of the mid to older generations would like to maintain the hills' natural beauty, housing is already starting to cover the hills.
