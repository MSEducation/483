Cathy de Monchaux (born 1960) is a British sculptor.
Born in London, de Monchaux studied first at the Camberwell School of Art (1980–1983), and later at Goldsmiths College in London (1985–1987).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artist/11978/cathy-de-monchaux.html|title=Cathy de Monchaux|work=artnet|year=2008|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl] 
Her sculptures use materials such as glass, paper, metal and leather. They frequently juxtapose seductive soft elements, often with strongly sexual overtones, with harder materials, often spikey or in some way appearing to constrain the softer parts, resulting in work which is both sensual and threatening. Her 1997 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in particular made reference to organic forms (crustacea, fossils), animals, erotic and fetishistic imagery, turn of the century decorative traditions, architectural detailing and saintly relics.Pennina Barnett  ' Materiality,Subjectivity & Abjection in the Work of Chohreh Feyzdjou,Nina Saunders and Cathy de Monchaux' issue 7 July 1998 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online pp.4-11  
de Monchaux's work from the early 1990s often achieves this effect by the combination of red velvet and steel in simple and strong constructions, but later works have tended to move towards lighter colours, and a more ornamental approach.
de Monchaux was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1998. She currently lives in London and is a part-time teacher at the Slade School of Art. However, she  has exhibited in the United States almost as much, if not more, as she has in England.
