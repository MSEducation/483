==Products==

===TRGpro===

HandEra's first handheld was the TRGpro. At the time of production HandEra was under the name TRG. The TRGpro was made to compete with Palm, Inc.'s Palm III Series. The TRGpro provided a competitive edge with a built in Compact Flash slot. The TRGpro is powered by AAA batteries. http://www.handera.com/Products/TRGpro.aspx

===Handera 330===

HandEra's second handheld was the Handera 330. The 330 introduced many new features which were not standard for other Palm OS devices at their time. The Handera was the first Palm to provide virtual graffiti input. In addition the 330 also featured a jog wheel, a microphone, an internal audio amplifier, an MMC / SD slot, and a Compact Flash slot. The 330 supports the use of four AAA batteries or a Li-Ion battery pack. The 330 also supported various add-ons such as a Wi-fi Card. http://www.handera.com/Products/HandEra330.aspx
The 330 was also the only Palm OS device to use QVGA. Because of this, compatibility and full use of the screen could become problematic. Both third- and first-party software is needed to launch applications from the expansion slots.

===Services===

While no longer producing handhelds, HandEra still provides their services. Their current services include Palm OS Development, OMAP Technology, Hardware Design, Software Design, EMC Testing, Mechanical Design, and individual projects. http://www.handera.com/Services/Default.aspx
