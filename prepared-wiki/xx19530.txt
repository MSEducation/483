An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint.  Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing [tpl]math|a .. b − 1[/tpl] ,  [tpl]math|a + 1 .. b[/tpl] , or  [tpl]math|a + 1 .. b − 1[/tpl].  Alternate-bracket notations like [tpl]closed-open|a .. b[/tpl] or [tpl]math|[a .. b[[/tpl] are rarely used for integer intervals[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl].

==Terminology==

An open interval does not include its endpoints, and is indicated with parentheses. For example [tpl]open-open|0,1[/tpl] means greater than [tpl]math|0[/tpl] and less than [tpl]math|1[/tpl]. A closed interval includes its endpoints, and is denoted with square brackets. For example [tpl]closed-closed|0,1[/tpl] means greater than or equal to [tpl]math|0[/tpl] and less than or equal to [tpl]math|1[/tpl].
A degenerate interval is any set consisting of a single real number.  Some authors include the empty set in this definition.  A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be  proper, and has infinitely many elements.
An interval is said to be left-bounded or right-bounded if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements.  An interval is said to be bounded if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be unbounded otherwise.  Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be half-bounded. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends.  Bounded intervals are also commonly known as finite intervals.
Bounded intervals are  bounded sets, in the sense that their diameter (which is equal to the absolute difference between the endpoints) is finite.  The diameter may be called the length, width, measure, or size of the interval.  The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as [tpl]math|+∞[/tpl], and the size of the empty interval may be defined as [tpl]math|0[/tpl] or left undefined.
The centre (midpoint) of bounded interval with endpoints [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] and [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] is [tpl]math|(a + b)/2[/tpl], and its radius is the half-length [tpl]math|[tpl]mabs|a − b[/tpl]/2[/tpl].  These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.
An interval is said to be left-open if and only if it has no minimum (an element that is smaller than all other elements);  right-open if it has no maximum; and open if it has both properties.  The interval [tpl]closed-open|0,1[/tpl] = [tpl]mset|x | 0 ≤ x < 1[/tpl], for example, is left-closed and right-open.  The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, for example, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals coincide with the open sets of the real line in its standard topology.
An interval is said to be left-closed if it has a minimum element, right-closed if it has a maximum, and simply closed if it has both.  These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and to the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with closed sets in that topology.
The interior of an interval [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl] is the largest open interval that is contained in [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl]; it is also the set of points in [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl] which are not endpoints of [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl].  The closure of [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl] is the smallest closed interval that contains [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl]; which is also the set [tpl]mvar|I[/tpl] augmented with its finite endpoints.
For any set [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] of real numbers, the interval enclosure or interval span of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is the unique interval that contains [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl].

==Classification of intervals==

===Intervals of the extended real line===

In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the extended real numbers, the set of all real numbers augmented with [tpl]math|−∞[/tpl] and [tpl]math|+∞[/tpl].
In this interpretation, the notations [tpl]closed-closed|−∞, b[/tpl] , [tpl]closed-open|−∞, b[/tpl] , [tpl]closed-closed|a, +∞[/tpl] , and [tpl]open-closed|a, +∞[/tpl] are all meaningful and distinct.  In particular, [tpl]open-open|−∞, +∞[/tpl] denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while [tpl]closed-closed|−∞, +∞[/tpl] denotes the extended reals.

==Properties of intervals==

==Dyadic intervals==

Dyadic intervals have the following properties:
The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite binary tree.
Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid methods and wavelet analysis. Another way to represent such a structure is p-adic analysis (for [tpl]math|1=p = 2[/tpl]).[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Sergey |year=2002 |title=Wavelet theory as [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl]-adic spectral analysis |journal=Izvestiya RAN.

==Generalizations==

===Multi-dimensional intervals===

===Complex intervals===

Intervals of complex numbers can be defined as regions of the complex plane, either rectangular or circular.Complex interval arithmetic and its applications, Miodrag Petković, Ljiljana Petković, Wiley-VCH, 1998, ISBN 978-3-527-40134-5

==Topological algebra==

Intervals can be associated with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can be associated with regions of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (x,y) taken from the direct product R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that y > x. For purposes of mathematical structure, this restriction is discarded,Kaj Madsen (1979) Review of "Interval analysis in the extended interval space" by Edgar Kaucher from Mathematical Reviews and "reversed intervals" where y − x Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its midpoint.  In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of "balanced intervals" −x is used along with the axis of intervals x,x that reduce to a point.
This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a ring isomorphism, provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as polar decomposition.
