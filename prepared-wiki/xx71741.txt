Lamotrigine, marketed in the US and most of Europe as Lamictal [tpl]IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|k|t|əl[/tpl] by GlaxoSmithKline, is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  It is also used off-label as an adjunct in treating clinical depression.  For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  Like many other anticonvulsant medications, lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective mood stabilizer, and has been the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. Chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants (due to lamotrigine being a phenyltriazine), lamotrigine has many possible side-effects. Lamotrigine is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs,[tpl]cite journal | author = Rogawski MA, Löscher W | title = The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 553–564 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15208697 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430[/tpl] but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lees G, Leach MJ | title = Studies on the mechanism of action of the novel anticonvulsant lamotrigine (Lamictal) using primary neurological cultures from rat cortex | journal = Brain Research | volume = 612 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 190–9 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 7687190 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(93)91660-K| url = [/tpl] Lamotrigine is inactivated by hepatic glucuronidation.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2147/TCRM.S3343 |author= Werz MA |title= Pharmacotherapeutics of epilepsy: use of lamotrigine and expectations for lamotrigine extended release |journal= Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1035–46 |date=October 2008|pmid= 19209284 [/tpl]

==Medical uses==

===Epilepsy and seizures===

Lamotrigine is approved in the US for the treatment of partial seizures. 
It is considered a first-line drug for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalised seizures), and as an adjuvant therapy in partial seizures (focal onset tonic-clonic, atypical absence, myoclonic, and due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). As well, it is used as an alternative drug for absence seizure and atypical absence, myoclonic, and atonic.[tpl]cite book |last= Kasper | first=D |editor-first=| editor= Fauci AS, Braunwald E, et al |title= eds.

Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. Typically developing before four years of age, LGS is associated with developmental delays. There is no cure, treatment is often complicated, and complete recovery is rare. Symptoms include the atonic seizure (also known as a "drop attack"), during which brief loss of muscle tone and consciousness cause abrupt falls. Lamotrigine significantly reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000123695.22623.32 |author=French JA, Kanner AM, Bautista J, et al. |title=Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy: report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee and Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society |journal=Neurology |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=1261–73 |date=April 2004|pmid=15111660 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/62/8/1261[/tpl] Combination with valproate is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced rash, and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.104.5.1106 |author=Pellock JM |title=Managing pediatric epilepsy syndromes with new antiepileptic drugs |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1106–16 |date=November 1999|pmid=10545555 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/104/5/1106[/tpl]

===Bipolar disorder===

Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of Bipolar I disorder. While traditional anticonvulsant drugs are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine is most effective for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective in the maintenance of current rapid-cycling, mania, or depression bipolar disorder; however, it is effective at prophylaxis or delaying the mania, depressive, or rapid cycle.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ghaemi, S.N., Shirzadi, A.A., Filkowski, M. | title=Publication Bias and the Pharmaceutical Industry: The Case of Lamotrigine in Bipolar Disorder |journal=Medscape J Med |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=211 |year=2008 |pmid=19008973 |pmc=2580079[/tpl] According to studies in 2007, lamotrigine may treat bipolar depression without triggering mania, hypomania, mixed states, or rapid-cycling.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.08m04381 |author=Goldberg JF, Calabrese JR, Saville BR, Frye MA, Ketter TA, Suppes T, Post RM, Goodwin FK. |title=Mood stabilization and destabilization during acute and continuation phase treatment for bipolar I disorder with lamotrigine or placebo |journal=Clinical Psychiatry |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=1273–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19689918[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

Lamotrigine is a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs.[tpl]cite book |last=Rogawski | first=M |editor-first=| editor=Levy RH, Mattson RH, Meldrum BS, Perucca E |title=Antiepileptic Drugs, Fifth Edition|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2002 |pages=3–22 |chapter=Chapter 1: Principles of antiepileptic drug action |isbn= 9780781723213[/tpl]
It is a triazine derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, leading to stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and has weak 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor inhibition. These actions are thought to inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas,[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.3109/09638230903469269| last= Thomas |first=SP|coauthors= Nandhra HS, Jayaraman A |title= Systematic review of lamotrigine augmentation of treatment resistant unipolar depression (TRD) |journal = J Ment Health |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=168–75 |date=April 2010|pmid= 20433324 [/tpl] and it has been pointed out this neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity.[tpl]cite journal |last= Ketter |first=TA|coauthors= Manji HK, Post RM |title= Potential mechanisms of action of lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar disorders |journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=168–75 |date=October 2003|pmid= 14520126 |doi=10.1097/01.jcp.0000088915.02635.e8[/tpl] Observations that lamotrigine reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala,[tpl]cite journal |last= Braga |first=MF|coauthors= Aroniadou-Anderjaska V, Post RM, Li H |title= .

Lamotrigine does not have pronounced effects on any of the usual neurotransmitter receptors (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-asparate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak.[tpl]cite journal|last= Southam |first=E|coauthors= Kirkby D, Higgins GA, Hagan RM |title= Lamotrigine inhibits monoamine uptake in vitro and modulates 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake in rats |date= Sep 1998|journal= Eur J Pharmacol |volume=25|issue=358(1)|pages=19–24|pmid= 9809864[/tpl] Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase,[tpl]Cite web|authorlink=GlaxoSmithKline LLC|title=LAMICTAL (lamotrigine) tablet|work=Daily Med|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=d7e3572d-56fe-4727-2bb4-013ccca22678 |accessdate=2013-12-26[/tpl] but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine inhibited the release of glutamate and aspartate evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or potassium evoked amino acid release.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-activated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.
It antagonises the following receptors with the following IC50 values:

==Pharmacokinetics==

The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 13.5 hours and volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0920-1211(91)90012-5 |author=Ramsay RE, Pellock JM, Garnett WR, et al. |title=Pharmacokinetics and safety of lamotrigine (Lamictal) in patients with epilepsy |journal=Epilepsy Res. |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=191–200 |year=1991 |pmid=1817959 [/tpl] Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available data indicate that its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.[tpl]cite journal |last= Cohen |first=AF|coauthors= Land GS, Breimer DD, Yuen WC, Winton C, Peck AW |title= Lamotrigine, a new anticonvulsant: pharmacokinetics in normal humans |date=Nov 1987|journal= Clin Pharmacol Ther |volume=42|issue=5|pages=535–41|pmid= 3677542[/tpl]
Lamotrigine is metabolised predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate.[tpl]cite journal |last= Goa |first=KL|coauthors= Ross SR, Chrisp P |title= A review of its pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy in epilepsy |date=Jul 1993|journal= Drugs |volume=46|issue=1|pages=152–76|pmid= 7691504[/tpl]
Lamotrigine has fewer drug interactions than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme inducing medications may shorten half-life.[tpl]cite journal |last= Anderson |first=GD |title= A mechanistic approach to antiepileptic drug interactions. |date=May 1998|journal= Pharmacother |volume=32|issue=5|pages=554–63|pmid= 9606477[/tpl] Dose adjustments should be made on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Side Effects==

Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, DRESS syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_lamictal.pdf|title=Lamictal Prescribing Information |date=May 2007|publisher=GlaxoSmithKline.|accessdate=2008-04-09|format=PDF[/tpl] The manufacturer states that nearly all cases appear in the first 2 to 8 weeks of therapy and if medication is suddenly stopped then resumed at the normal dosage. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side-effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 to 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash.   Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults.
There is also an increased incidence of these eruptions in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased.
As of December 2010, lamotrigine carries an FDA black box warning for aseptic meningitis.http://www.drugs.com/monograph/lamotrigine.html
Side-effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome or aseptic meningitis.
Other side-effects include loss of balance or coordination, double vision, crossed eyes, pupil constriction, blurred vision, dizziness and lack of coordination, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, vivid dreams or nightmares,  dry mouth, mouth ulcers,  memory and cognitive problems, mood changes, runny nose, cough, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss, missed or painful menstrual periods, and vaginitis. The side-effect profile is different for different patient populations.

===Effects in women===

In clinical trials women were more likely than men to have side-effects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] This is the opposite of most other anticonvulsants.
There is evidence showing interactions between lamotrigine and female hormones, which can be of particular concern for women on estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Ethinyl estradiol, the ingredient of such contraceptives, has been shown to decrease serum levels of lamotrigine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Reimers A|coauthors=Helde G, Brodtkorb E|date=September 2005|title=Ethinyl estradiol, not progestogens, reduces lamotrigine serum concentrations|journal=Epilepsia|publisher=Blackwell Science|volume=46|issue=9|pages=1414–7|pmid= 16146436|first1=A|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.10105.x[/tpl] Women starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive may need to increase the dosage of lamotrigine to maintain its level of efficacy. Likewise, women may experience an increase in lamotrigine side-effects upon discontinuation of the pill. This may include the "pill free" week where lamotrigine serum levels have been shown to increase twofold. Another study showed a significant increase in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in women taking lamotrigine with oral contraceptive compared to women taking oral contraceptives alone.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sidhu J|coauthors=Job S, Singh S, Philipson R|date=February 2006|title=The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of the co-administration of lamotrigine and a combined oral contraceptive in healthy female subjects|journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol. |volume=61|issue=2|pages=191–9|pmid=16433873|first1=J|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2005.02539.x|pmc=1885007[/tpl] However, these increases were not in conjunction with increased progesterone, indicating that oral contraceptives maintained suppression of ovulation.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===

Lamotrigine is rated Pregnancy  Category Risk C. Use during pregnancy is recommended only if benefits outweigh potential risks.

Myoclonic Jerk in the use of Lamictal. When used in the treatment of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can lead to induction of seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency.
