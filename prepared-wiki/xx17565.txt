The coelacanths ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=Coelacanth Pronunciation.ogg|ˈ|s|iː|l|ə|k|æ|n|θ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SEE|lə-kanth[/tpl]) constitute a rare order of fish that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1999PNAS...9612616H |title=Two Living Species of Coelacanths? |author1=Holder |first1=Mark T. |last2=Erdmann |first2=Mark V. |last3=Wilcox |first3=Thomas P. |last4=Caldwell |first4=Roy L. |last5=Hillis |first5=David M. |volume=96 |year=1999 |pages=12616–20 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.22.12616 |pmid=10535971 |issue=22 |pmc=23015 |jstor=49396[/tpl] Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered order of animals in the world.

Coelacanths belong to the subclass Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such as osteolepiforms, porolepiforms, rhizodonts, and Panderichthys.[tpl]cite book |last1=Forey |first1=Peter L |year=1998 |title=History of the Coelacanth Fishes |location=London |publisher=Chapman & Hall |isbn=978-0-412-78480-4[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Coelacanths were thought to have gone extinct in the Late Cretaceous, but were rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1975Sci...190.1105L |title=Latimeria, the Living Coelacanth, is Ovoviviparous |author1=Lavett Smith |first1=C. |last2=Rand |first2=Charles S. |last3=Schaeffer |first3=Bobb |last4=Atz |first4=James W. |volume=190 |year=1975 |pages=1105–6 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.190.4219.1105 |issue=4219[/tpl] Traditionally, the coelacanth was considered a “living fossil” due to its apparent lack of significant evolution over the past millions of years; and the coelacanth was thought to have evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0470 |title=Oldest coelacanth, from the Early Devonian of Australia |year=2006 |last1=Johanson |first1=Z. |last2=Long |first2=J.

==Etymology==

"Coelacanth" is an adaptation of Modern Latin Cœlacanthus "hollow spine," from Greek κοῖλ-ος koilos "hollow" + ἄκανθ-α  akantha "spine," referring to the hollow caudal fin rays of the first fossil specimen described and named by Louis Agassiz in 1839.

==Discovery==

The coelacanths, which are related to lungfishes and tetrapods, were believed to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous period.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] More closely related to tetrapods than even the ray-finned fish, coelacanths were considered transitional species between fish and tetrapods.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] The first Latimeria specimen was found off the east coast of South Africa, off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa) in 1938.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm |title='Discovery' of the Coelacanth[/tpl] Museum curator Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on 22 December 1938.  A local chemistry professor, J.L.B. Smith, confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".
The discovery of a species still living, when they were believed to have gone extinct 66 million years previously, makes the coelacanth the best-known example of a Lazarus taxon, an evolutionary line that seems to have disappeared from the fossil record only to reappear much later. Since 1938, Latimeria chalumnae have been found in the Comoros, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, and in iSimangaliso Wetland Park, Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Physical description==

Coelacanths are a part of the clade Sarcopterygii, or the lobe-finned fishes. Externally, there are several characteristics that distinguish the coelacanth from other lobe-finned fish. They possess a three-lobed caudal fin, also called a trilobate fin or a diphycercal tail. A secondary tail that goes along and extends past the primary tail separates the upper and lower halves of the coelacanth. Cosmoid scales act as thick armor that protects the exterior of the coelacanth. There also are several internal traits that aid in differentiating coelacanths from other lobe-finned fish. At the back of the skull, the coelacanth possesses a hinge, the intracranial joint, which allows it to open its mouth extremely wide. Coelacanths also retain an oil filled notochord, a hollow, pressurized tube which is replaced by the vertebral column early in embryonic development in most other vertebrates.What do we know about the coelacanths - Science in Africa The heart of the coelacanth is shaped differently from that of most modern fish; the heart's chambers are arranged in a straight tube. The coelacanth braincase is 98.5% filled with fat; only 1.5% of the braincase contains brain tissue. The cheeks of the coelacanths are unique because the opercular bone is very small and holds a large soft-tissue opercular flap. A spiracular chamber is present, but the spiracle is closed and never opens during development.Gaining Ground, Second Edition: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods The coelacanth also possesses a unique rostral organ within the ethmoid region of the braincase.[tpl]cite web |title=The Coelacanth – a Morphological Mixed Bag |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/classification/coelacanth.htm[/tpl] Also unique to extant coelacanths is the presence of a "fatty lung" or a fat-filled single-lobed vestigial lung, homologous to other fish's swim bladder.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.01015.x |title=The histological structure of the calcified lung of the fossil coelacanth Axelrodichthys araripensis (Actinistia: Mawsoniidae) |year=2010 |last1=Brito |first1=Paulo M. |last2=Meunier |first2=François J. |last3=Clément |first3=Gael |last4=Geffard-Kuriyama |first4=Didier |journal=Palaeontology |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=1281–90[/tpl] Due to its size, it is assumed to be responsible for the kidneys unusual relocation.

==General description==

Latimeria chalumnae and L. menadoensis are the only two known living coelacanth species.[tpl]cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Joseph S. |title=Fishes of the World |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |publisher=John Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-75644-6[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] The word coelacanth is derived from the Greek for “hollow spine”, because of its unique hollow spine fins. Coelacanths are large, plump, lobe-finned fish that grow up to 1.8 meters. They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1987Natur.329..331F |title=Locomotion of the coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae in its natural environment |author1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Reinicke |first2=Olaf |last3=Hofer |first3=Heribert |last4=Nachtigall |first4=Werner |volume=329 |year=1987 |pages=331–3 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/329331a0 |issue=6137[/tpl] The body is covered in cosmoid scales that act as armor. Coelacanths have 8 fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 pectoral fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin, and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up the caudal lobe of the tail. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by having rods that absorb mostly low wavelengths. The vision of coelacanths has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1999pnas...96.6279y |title=Adaptive Evolution of Color Vision of the Comoran Coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) |author1=Yokoyama |first1=Shozo |last2=Zhang |first2=Huan |last3=Radlwimmer |first3=F. Bernhard |last4=Blow |first4=Nathan S. |volume=96 |year=1999 |pages=6279–84 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.11.6279 |pmid=10339578 |issue=11 |pmc=26872 |jstor=47861[/tpl] Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth, which replace the maxilla, a structure that is absent in coelacanths. There are two nostrils along with four other external openings that appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The rostral organ of the coelacanth is contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase. It has three unguarded openings into the environment. The rostral organ is used as a part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system. The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear. The inner ear of the coelacanth is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1987Natur.327..153F |title=Inner ear of the coelacanth fish Latimeria has tetrapod affinities |author1=Fritzsch |first1=B. |volume=327 |year=1987 |pages=153–4 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/327153a0 |pmid=22567677 |issue=6118[/tpl]
Locomotion of the coelacanths is unique to their kind. To move around, coelacanths most commonly take advantage of up or downwellings of the current and drift. They use their paired fins to stabilize their movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use their paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths can create thrust for quick starts by using their caudal fins. Due to the high number of fins it possesses, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands and swimming belly up. It is thought that their rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in their movement around obstacles.

===DNA===

A group led by Chris Amemiya and Neil Shubin published the genome sequence of the coelacanth in the journal Nature. The African coelacanth genome was sequenced and assembled using DNA from a Comoros Islands Latimeria chalumnae specimen. It was sequenced by Illumina sequencing technology and assembled using the short read genome assembler ALLPATHS-LG.[tpl]cite journal | title = The African coelacanth genome provides insights into tetrapod evolution | journal = Nature | date = 18 April 2013 | doi = 10.1038/nature12027 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7445/pdf/nature12027.pdf | accessdate = 2013-04-20 | last1 = Amemiya | first1 = Chris T. | last2 = Alföldi | first2 = Jessica | last3 = Lee | first3 = Alison P. | last4 = Fan | first4 = Shaohua | last5 = Philippe | first5 = Hervé | last6 = MacCallum | first6 = Iain | last7 = Braasch | first7 = Ingo | last8 = Manousaki | first8 = Tereza | last9 = Schneider | first9 = Igor | volume = 496 | issue = 7445 | pages = 311–6 | pmid = 23598338 | pmc = 3633110|bibcode = 2013Natur.496..311A | display-authors = 9 | last10 = Rohner | first10 = Nicolas | last11 = Organ | first11 = Chris | last12 = Chalopin | first12 = Domitille | last13 = Smith | first13 = Jeramiah J. | last14 = Robinson | first14 = Mark | last15 = Dorrington | first15 = Rosemary A. | last16 = Gerdol | first16 = Marco | last17 = Aken | first17 = Bronwen | last18 = Biscotti | first18 = Maria Assunta | last19 = Barucca | first19 = Marco | last20 = Baurain | first20 = Denis | last21 = Berlin | first21 = Aaron M. | last22 = Blatch | first22 = Gregory L. | last23 = Buonocore | first23 = Francesco | last24 = Burmester | first24 = Thorsten | last25 = Campbell | first25 = Michael S. | last26 = Canapa | first26 = Adriana | last27 = Cannon | first27 = John P. | last28 = Christoffels | first28 = Alan | last29 = De Moro | first29 = Gianluca | last30 = Edkins | first30 = Adrienne L.
