==History==

Cambrex was founded in 1981, when the CasChem group acquired the castor oil and derivatives product lines from NL Industries.  In 1987, CasChem was renamed Cambrex Corporation and became listed on NASDAQ. Cambrex entered the pharmaceutical market in 1994 with the acquisition of Nobel Pharma Chemistry business, now known as Cambrex Karlskoga AB and Cambrex Profarmaco. Through multiple acquisitions during the late 1990s, Cambrex entered the bioscience and the chiral enzymatic catalyst markets.  In 1998, Cambrex was listed on the NYSE. Cambrex acquired two contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, in 2001, to bulk manufacture biologics and pharmaceutical ingredients from clinical to commercial scales. In 2007, Cambrex decided to focus on its core competencies and sold the biologics business to Lonza Group. In 2008, Prosyntest (now Cambrex Tallinn) was acquired, and Steve Klosk was appointed CEO, while remaining President. To broaden their biocatalysis platform, Cambrex acquired IEP, now known as Cambrex IEP. In November 2010, Cambrex acquired a 51% stake in Zenara Pharma, providing vertical integration with Zenara's cost-effective formulation and finished dosage form capabilities.

==Technologies==

===CF-MAOS===

Continuous Flow - Microwave Assisted Organic Synthesis (CF-MAOS) was developed in 2009 by Cambrex in cooperation with C-Tech Innovation.   The CF-MAOS dual technological breakthrough allows both the scale-up of microwave-assisted chemistry and the handling of heterogeneous mixtures in a continuous-flow arrangement.  Cambrexâ€™s current technology, the CaMWave KiloLAB flow reactor, is capable of manufacturing over 20 kilograms of product per day.  Cambrex is currently developing larger reactors that have the potential to manufacture more than one hundred metric tons of product per year.  This technology facilitates faster, cleaner, more reliable scale-up leading to improved productivity and lower manufacturing costs.
