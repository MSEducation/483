Alfred Hamish Reed [tpl]post-nominals|country=NZL-cats|Kt.|CBE[/tpl]  (1875-1975) was a New Zealand publisher, author and entrepreneur.  A. H. Reed was born at Hayes, Middlesex, England, on 30 December 1875, the son of James William Reed and Elizabeth Reed.  He migrated to New Zealand with his parents in 1887. After some experience in Northland as a kauri gum-digger, he moved to Dunedin where, in 1897, he became manager of the Typewriter Co. An early childhood leg problem denied him access to active duty during World War I, and he was retained at an army base as a clerk due to his shorthand skills. He entered the bookselling trade when he founded the firm of A. H. and A. W. Reed, a leading publisher of New Zealand-related non-fiction and reference works, in association with his nephew Alexander Wyclif Reed. In 1932, he branched out as a publisher and in 1935 he became an author.
Reed also undertook walking and mountain-climbing expeditions. He climbed Mount Taranaki/Egmont (aged 80), Mount Ruapehu (aged 83), Ngauruhoe (aged 85), walked from North Cape to Bluff, now known as the Te Araroa Trail (aged 85) and from East Cape to Cape Egmont (aged 86), walked through Marlborough (aged 87) and through Otago, Canterbury, Westland, and the Haast (aged 88).
In 1938 Reed and his wife established the Alfred and Isabel and Marian Reed Trust for the promotion of Christianity, education, literature and philanthropy for the people of New Zealand. The trust has amassed a collection of rare books and manuscripts for the Dunedin Public Libraries, including one of the most comprehensive collections of manuscripts and early printed Bibles in the Southern Hemisphere.
The A. H. Reed Memorial Kauri Park Scenic Reserve, near Whangarei, commemorates his association with the district.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.planmyplay.co.nz/play/whangarei-ah-reed-memorial-kauri-park-whangarei-falls | title=AH Reed Memorial Kauri Park | work=Plan My Play | date=Oct 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Julie Crean (Editor)[/tpl]
