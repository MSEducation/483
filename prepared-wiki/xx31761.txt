===Fluoropolymers===

Fluoropolymers are widely used commercially. There are two main classes, perfluorinated polyolefins, which are perfluoroalkanes.  A well known example is teflon. The second class of perfluorinated polymers contain ether groups. Such polymers are produced by free-radical polymerization from the perfluoroalkene and perfluorovinyl alkyl ethers.

==Fluoroalkenes and fluoroalkynes==

Unsaturated fluorocarbons are far more reactive than fluoroalkanes.  
Fluoroalkenes polymerize more exothermically than normal alkenes. Unsaturated fluorocarbons have a driving force towards sp3 hybridization due to the electronegative fluorine atoms seeking a greater share of bonding electrons with reduced s character in orbitals. The most famous member of this class is tetrafluoroethylene, which converts to Teflon. Hexafluorobenzene is robust.  
Although difluoroacetylene is unstable (as is typical for related alkynes, see dichloroacetylene), hexafluoro-2-butyne and related fluorinated alkynes are well known.

==Manufacture==

The development of fluorocarbon industry coincided with World War II.  Prior to that, fluorocarbons were prepared by reaction of fluorine with the hydrocarbon, i.e., direct fluorination. This highly exothermic process mainly affords smaller perfluorocarbons, such as tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane, and octafluoropropane.  The problem is that C-C bonds are cleaved by fluorine.G. Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B. McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

A major breakthrough was the Fowler process, which allowed the large scale manufacture of fluorocarbons.  This process uses cobalt fluoride in place of fluorine gas.  Illustrative is the synthesis of perfluorohexane:
The resulting cobalt trifluoride is then regenerated, often in a separate reactor:
Industrially, both steps are combined, for example in the manufacture of the Flutec range of fluorocarbons, using a vertical stirred bed reactor, with hydrocarbon introduced at the bottom, and fluorine introduced half way up the reactor. The fluorocarbon vapor is recovered from the top.

===Electrochemical fluorination===

Electrochemical fluorination (ECF) (also known as the Simons' process) involves electrolysis of a substrate dissolved in hydrogen fluoride. As fluorine is itself manufactured by the electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride, this is a rather more direct route to fluorocarbons. The process is run at low voltage (5 - 6 V) so that free fluorine is not liberated. The choice of substrate is restricted as ideally it should be soluble in hydrogen fluoride. Ethers and tertiary amines are typically employed. To make perfluorohexane, trihexylamine is used, for example:
The perfluorinated amine will also be produced:

==Applications==

Many fluorocarbons are useful. For example, fluorosurfactants powerfully reduce surface tension by concentrating at the liquid-air interface due to the lipophobicity of fluorocarbons,Mason Chemical Company: "Fluorosurfactant - Structure / Function" Accessed November 1, 2008. due to the polar functional group added to the fluorocarbon chain. Other groups or atoms for fluorocarbon based compounds the oxygen atom incorporated into an ether group for anesthetics, and the chlorine atom for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In a sharp contrast to true fluorocarbons, the chlorine atom produces a chlorine radical which degrades ozone.

==Environmental and health concerns==

Fluoroalkanes are generally very inert.  Fluoroalkenes and fluorinated alkynes are highly reactive and toxic.  
Although teflon and related fluoropolymers are nontoxic, their production often involved the use PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate), which bioaccumulates. Data on the human health effects of PFOA are however sparse.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Steenland |first1 = Kyle |last2 = Fletcher |first2 = Tony |last3 = Savitz |first3 = David A. |title = Epidemiologic Evidence on the Health Effects of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) |doi = 10.1289/ehp.0901827 |pmc = 2920088 |pmid = 20423814 |year = 2010 |pages = 1100â€“8 |issue = 8 |volume = 118 |journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|url = http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.0901827|accessdate=2011-05-11[/tpl]
