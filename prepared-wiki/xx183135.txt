The FAMU Gospel Choir was founded in 1957 on the campus of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. 
At the onset, things weren't easy for the choir and the student members. They were initially denied use of the school's pianos, organs as well as the auditorium. The Department of Music's Chairman, Dr. William P. Foster gave a mandate "Scholarships will be revoked if students studying voice participate in this gospel choir, their singing style is damaging to the voice, and is unacceptable for anyone desiring to gain a degree in vocal performance or choral arts".
In 1995, Evangelist Twinkie Clark Terrell became the guiding force behind the choir's latest musical milestone, their debut recording, entitled, Twinkie Clark Terrell Presents the Florida A&M Gospel Choir for Detroit, Michigan based Crystal Rose Records.
Until 2012,The FAMU Gospel Choir was a part of the Florida A&M University music department, along with the Incomparable Marching 100 and the FAMU Concert Choir. With the retiring of Dr. Julian E. White, the Gospel Choir is now a club on FAMU's campus.
