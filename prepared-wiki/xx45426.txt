[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]

CATEGORIES: Causal fallacies, Logical fallacies, Latin logical phrases

Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: "after this, therefore because of this") is a logical fallacy (of the questionable cause variety) that states "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened to simply post hoc. It is subtly different from the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc (correlation does not imply causation), in which two things or events occur simultaneously or the chronological ordering is insignificant or unknown. Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because temporal sequence appears to be integral to causality. The fallacy lies in coming to a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors that might rule out the connection.

==Pattern==

The form of the post hoc fallacy can be expressed as follows:
When B is undesirable, this pattern is often extended in reverse:  Avoiding A will prevent B.

==Examples==

"I can't help but think that you are the cause of this problem; we never had any problem with the furnace until you moved into the apartment." The manager of the apartment house, on no stated grounds other than the temporal priority of the new tenant's occupancy, holds that the tenant's presence has some causal relationship to the furnace's becoming faulty.[tpl]cite book |title= Attacking Faulty Reasoning: A Practical Guide to Fallacy-Free Arguments|last= Damer|first= T Edward|authorlink= T.
