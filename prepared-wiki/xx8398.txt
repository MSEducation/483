Vimoksha means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering, and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana, a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and deliverance.The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, vimoksha See also Thiện Châu (Thích.)

In the Buddhist context nirvana refers to the imperturbable stillness of mind after the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion have been finally extinguished. In Hindu philosophy, it is the union with the divine ground of existence Brahman (Supreme Being) and the experience of blissful egolessness.[tpl]sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=268[/tpl]

Each of the five aggregates is called a skandha, which means "tree trunk." All five skandha serve to inform the study of experience, or else missing their causal relations leads away from the path to nirvana.  Skandha also means "heap" or "pile" or "mass," which is the nature of their interdependence, like an endless knot's path, or a forest.

The idea of moksha is connected to the Vedic culture, which had notion of amrtam, "immortality",[tpl]sfn|Collins|2010|p=29[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Collins|1998|p=136[/tpl] and also a notion of a timeless, an "unborn", "the still point of the turning world of time".[tpl]sfn|Collins|2010|p=29[/tpl] It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time".[tpl]sfn|Collins|2010|p=29[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|The  wheel is a typical Vedic, or Indo-European, symbol, which is manifested in various symbols of the Vedic religion and of Buddhism and Hinduism.

Although the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism. It was later adopted in the Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharata.[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl]

==Jainism==

The terms moksa and nirvana are often used interchangeably in the Jain texts.[tpl]cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 [/tpl]: "Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism". p.168Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521365058: "Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa." p.297 In Jainism, moksha (liberation) follows nirvāṇa. Nirvana means final release from the karmic bondage. An arhat becomes a siddha ("one who is accomplished") after nirvāṇa.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] When an enlightened human, such as an arihant or a Tirthankara, extinguishes his remaining aghatiya karmas and thus ends his worldly existence, it is called nirvāṇa. Jains celebrate Diwali as the day of nirvāṇa of Mahavira.

==Buddhism==

In the Buddhist tradition, nirvana is described as the extinguishing of the fires that cause suffering. These fires are typically identified as the fires of attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha) and ignorance (moha or avidya). When the fires are extinguished, suffering (dukkha) comes to an end. The cessation of suffering is described as complete peace.

==Hinduism==

According to Zaehner and "many commentators",[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl] nirvana is a Buddhist term rather than a Hindu term.[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl] The term nirvana was not used in Hinduism prior to its use in the Bhagavad Gita,[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl] though according to van Buitenen the use of the term was not confined to Buddhism at the time the Bhagavad Gita was written.[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl] According to Johnson the use of the term nirvana is borrowed from the Buddhists to link the Buddhist state of liberation with Brahman, the supreme or absolute principle of the Upanishads and the Vedic tradition.[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48[/tpl]

===Moksha===

In Hinduism, moksha is the liberation from the cycle of birth and death and one's worldly conception of self. According to Hindson & Caner, when a person achieves moksha, they have reached nirvana;[tpl]Cite book | last1 = Hindson| first1 = Ed| last2 = Caner| first1 = Ergun| title = The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics: Surveying the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity| publisher = Harvest House Publishers| year = 2008| page = 264| url = http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yipXIHcteRsC&pg=PA264| isbn = 978-0-7369-2084-1[/tpl] while according to Flood, "The attainment of nirvana is thus moksa."
Moksha is derived from the root mu(n)c ([tpl]lang-sa|मुच्[/tpl]), which means free, let go, release, liberate.मुच Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)Sten Rohde, Deliver us from Evil: studies on the Vedic ideas of salvation, Ejnar Munksgaard, Copenhagen, pp 25-35 In Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate ([tpl]lang-sa|मुच्यते[/tpl]) appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.
According to Aurobindo, the last bondage is the passion for liberation itself, which must be renounced before the soul can be perfectly free, and the last knowledge is the realisation that there is none bound, none desirous of freedom, but the soul is for ever and perfectly free, that bondage is an illusion and the liberation from bondage is an illusion too.[tpl]Citation|first=sri|last=Aurobindo Ghosh |title=The life divine|publisher=Lotus Press|year=1990[/tpl]

===Brahmanirvana in the Bhagavad Gita===

Brahma nirvana (nirvana in Brahman) is the state of release or liberation; the union with the divine ground of existence (Brahman) and the experience of blissful ego-lessness.[tpl]sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=268[/tpl] The term brahmanirvana is used 5 times in the Bhagavad Gita:[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
According to Helena Blavatsky, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains that Brahma nirvana can be attained by one who is capable of cognizing the essence of Brahman; by getting rid of vices, becoming free from duality, free from the worldly attractions and anger, dedicated to spiritual pursuits, having subdued thoughts and cognized Atman, and dedicating oneself to the good of all.Bhagavad Gita 5.24, 5,25, 5.26[tpl]Citation|title=Lucifer: A Theosophical Magazine, March to August 1893|last=H. P. Blavatsky|page=11[/tpl]
According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of nirvana are different:

According to Gavin Flood, 

===Brahma Kumaris===

In Brahma Kumaris philosophy, nirvana is reaching the meta world called paramdham (supreme abode) or shantidham (abode of peace) and is the highest of the three worlds. It is the original home of the soul and Supreme Soul, Shiva.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
