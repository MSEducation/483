</ref> North America can be considered to have five major drainage systems: into the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, plus Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Within this system there are four continental divides and three triple points, the two mentioned previously and a third near [[Hibbing, Minnesota]] where the [[Northern Divide]] intersects the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] divide.<ref>

</ref> Since there is no true consensus on what a continental divide is, there is no real agreement on where the triple points are.<ref>

</ref> However, the main Continental Divide described in this article is a far more distinctive geological feature than the others and its two main triple points are much more prominent.

===Hiking trail===

The Continental Divide Trail follows the divide through the U.S. from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. A less-developed Canadian extension called the Great Divide Trail continues through five national parks and six provincial parks, ending at Kakwa Lake in east-central British Columbia.[ref]

==Exceptions==

Many endorheic regions in North America complicate the simple view of east or west, "ocean-bound" water flow. Several endorheic basins appear to straddle the Continental Divide, including the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming, the Plains of San Agustin in New Mexico, the Guzmán Basin in New Mexico and Chihuahua, Mexico, and the Bolsón de Mapimí in Mexico. However, such a basin can be conceptually assigned to one side of the Divide or the other by its lowest perimeter pass; in other words, the proper assignment can be made by determining how the drainage would occur if the basin were to overflow. In line with this, USGS topographic maps show a unique path for the Divide even when a basin is adjacent.
Another kind of exception occurs when a stream falling onto the Divide splits and flows in both directions, or a lake straddling the divide overflows in both directions. Examples of these are, respectively, North Two Ocean Creek and Isa Lake, both located on the Continental Divide in Wyoming. The Panama Canal has this same feature, being man made. The Chagres and Gatun rivers flow into Gatun Lake, which empties to both oceans.
