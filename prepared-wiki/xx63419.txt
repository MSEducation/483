Martinscroft is a part of the civil parish of Woolston in Warrington, Cheshire, England.
It is rumoured that Battery Lane in the village got its name from where Oliver Cromwell stored his weapons during his visit in the civil war.
Martinscroft Green is the village green and is also a popular place for recreational activities.
It recently has been enlarged by new housing estates and the building of a hotel, although it has a few old cottages still along the village green.
Hidden in the trees at the back  of the village green is a school gate post which  is from when there was a school on the village green and also horse mounting steps which are from when there was a pub on the village green.
