Abgar V the Black or Abgarus V of Edessa ([tpl]lang-syr|ܐܒܓܪ ܚܡܝܫܝܐ ܐܘܟܡܐ‏[/tpl]; ʾAḇgar Ḥəmīšāyā ʾUkkāmā, [tpl]lang-hy|Աբգար Ե[/tpl]; Abgar E, [tpl]lang-grc|Ἄβγαρος[/tpl] Abgaros) BC 4 – AD 7 and AD 13–50) was a historical Syriac ruler of the kingdom of Osroene, holding his capital at Edessa.Vailhé, Siméon. "Edessa." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 19 Dec. 2012 (Compare to the region that was referred to as Armenian Mesopotamia by the Greeks and Ashur in the Old Testament). 
According to an ancient Christian legend, first documented by Eusebius, he was converted to Christianity by Addai,[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Doctrine of Addai[/tpl] one of the Seventy-two Disciples. According to Armenian historian Moses of Khorene he was Sanatruk's relative.

==The legend of King Abgar==

Abgar V was, according to Syriac tradition, one of the first Christian kings in history, having been converted to the faith by the Apostle Thaddeus of Edessa.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2_eAKmK7KkYC&pg=PA22&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Lesser Eastern Churches | isbn = 978-0-9715986-2-1 | author1 = Fortescue | first1 = Adrian | date = December 2001[/tpl] Other accounts regard this as mere legend, equating the Abgar in the story with the Syrian Abgar IX, a late 2nd-century convert to Christianity. Moses of Khoren suggests that the name of the legendary figure is a corruption of an individual's title: "…Because of his uncommon modesty and wisdom, and his old age, this Abgaros was given the title of "Avag Hair" (Senior Father in Armenian). The Greeks and Arameans, unable to articulate his name correctly, called him Abgar."[tpl]cite web |title=Abgar, in Armenian History glossary |url=http://www.armenianhistory.info/abgar.htm |work=ArmenianHistory.info |accessdate=23 January 2009[/tpl]
The legend tells that Abgar, king of Edessa, afflicted with an incurable sickness, probably leprosy,[tpl]cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abgar legend|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=30[/tpl] had heard the fame of the power and miracles of Jesus and wrote to him, acknowledging his divinity, craving his help, and offering him asylum in his own residence; the tradition states that Jesus wrote a letter, commending Abgar on his faith, but declining to go, but promising that after his ascension, he would send one of his disciples, endowed with his power. 
The 4th-century church historian Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, records a traditionIn his Historia Ecclesiastica, I, xiii, ca AD 325. concerning a correspondence on this occasion, exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus. Eusebius was convinced that the original letters, written in Syriac (Aramaic), were kept in the archives of Edessa. Eusebius also states that in due course, after Christ's ascension, Thaddeus, namely Addai (called Addaï), or one of the seventy-two Disciples, called Thaddeus of Edessa, was sent by Thomas the Apostle in AD 29. Eusebius copies the two letters into the text of his history.
The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. As the legend later expanded, a portrait of Jesus painted from life began to be mentioned. This portrait, purportedly painted by the court archivist Hannan during his visit to Jesus, is first mentioned in the Syriac text called the "Doctrine of Addai" (or Doctrina Addai; the name Addaei or Addaeus = Thaddaeus or Thaddeus), from the second half of the 4th century. Here it is said that the reply of Jesus was given not in writing, but orally, and that the event took place in 32 AD.[tpl]EB1911|wstitle=Abgar|volume=1|pages=61-62|inline=1[/tpl] This  Teaching of Addai is also the earliest account of an image of Jesus painted from life, enshrined by the ailing King Abgar V in one of his palaces. Greek forms of the legend are found in the Acta Thaddaei, the "Acts of Thaddaeus".
The story of the "letter to Abgar", including the portrait made by the court painter Hannan, is repeated, with some additions, in the mid-5th century History of the Armenians of Moses of Chorene, who remarked that the portrait was preserved in Edessa. 
The story was later elaborated further by the church historian Evagrius, Bishop of Edessa (c. 536-600), who declared for the first time (as far as is known) that the image of Jesus was "divinely wrought," and "not made by human hands." In sum, the documented legend developed from no image in Eusebius, to an image painted by Hannan in "Addai" and Moses of Chorene, to a miraculously-appearing image not made by human hands in Evagrius.
On August 15, 944, the Church of Saint Mary of Blachernae in Istanbul received the letter and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.[tpl]cite book|last=Janin|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Janin|title=La Géographie ecclésiastique de l'Empire byzantin. 1.

This latter concept of an "image not made by hands" (acheiropoietos) formed the foundation on which the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of icons was later created in the 8th century. This doctrine held that Jesus made the first icon of himself by pressing a wet towel to his face, miraculously imprinting the cloth with his features — thus creating the prototype for all icons of Jesus, and an implied divine approval for their creation.
John of Damascus, the leading architect of the church dogma favoring icons, specifically mentioned that Jesus "is said to have taken a piece of cloth and pressed it to his face, impressing on it the image of his face, which it keeps to this day" (On the Divine Images I).
The Abgar legend enjoyed great popularity in the East, and also in the West, during the Middle Ages: Jesus' letter was copied on parchment, inscribed in marble and metal, and used as a talisman or an amulet. Of this pseudepigraphical correspondence, there survive not only a Syriac text, but an Armenian translation as well, two independent Greek versions, shorter than the Syriac, and several inscriptions on stone.
A curious legendary growth has arisen from this supposed event, with scholars disputing whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus, and so forth.
Albany James Christie, a nineteenth-century writer on Greek and Roman legend questions the authenticity of the letters. [ref]
