Fr. Friedrich Erxleben SJ was a Jesuit Priest and member of the "Solf Circle" German Resistance group.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p 1025-6 
The purpose of the Solf Circle was to seek out humanitarian ways of countering the Nazi regime. It met at either Frau Solf or Elizabeth von Thadden's home. Von Thadden was a Christian educational reformer and Red Cross worker.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.160 The activities of "Frau Solf Tea Party" were discovered by Himmler and most of the group were executed.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p 1025-6 Erxleben, along with fellow Jesuit resistor Augustin RÃ¶sch, was among the survivors of the German Resistance who narrowly escaped execution in the dying days of the war by convincing the prison governor the Lehrter Strasse prison that they should be set free. The prisoners told the governor that he would be likely to be executed by the Red Army if he did not release them, and he relented on 25 April 1945.
