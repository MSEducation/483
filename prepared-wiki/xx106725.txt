American Memorial Park on the island of Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, was created as a living memorial honoring the sacrifices made during the Marianas Campaign of World War II.  Recreational facilities, a World War II museum, and flag monument keep alive the memory of over 4,000 United States military personnel and local islanders who died in June 1944.
The park has baseball, bicycling, running, tennis, picnicking, and swimming.
The park is owned by the Government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and is managed in cooperation with the National Park Service.
