Primitive Quendian (Quenya: Quenderin) is a constructed language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the many fictional language set in his Secondary world, often called Middle-earth. 
It was the proto-language of the Elves, which they invented after their Awakening.

==Origin==

According to the Elvish tale Cuivienyarna:
The stars were the first thing seen by the three Elves as they awoke. The first spoken word was ele, according to Elvish legend and originally it was an exclamation "lo! behold!" in Quenderin.J.R.R. Tolkien, The War of the Jewels, p. 360. It gave rise to the first Elvish root ever invented: EL-, from which the Common Eldarin word ēl ('star') is derived.This has a striking parallel to the Sun Language Theory of Turkish nationalism, which claims that the first word was Aa meaning "Sun", and coined in the same fashion.
In The Silmarillion (chapter 3), it is told that the Elves devised a language while living in Cuiviénen:
An important PQ word was *kwende. It was made from PQ *kwene "person" by primitive fortification of the medial n to nd. It was used in PQ only in the plural, *kwendī, with the sense "the people as a whole", sc. embracing all the three Elven clans.
Over time the Elves modified their language, adding to it words and grammatical rules to their liking. Later still the god or Vala Oromë came to them and invited them to come with him to Valinor, his marvellous land in the West.

==The first division==

The first division of the Elvish tongues befell when a large group of Elves left their first abode and followed the Vala Orome westward. Thus
Primitive Quendian split into Common Eldarin and the many Avari languages of the Elves who refused to follow Orome.
