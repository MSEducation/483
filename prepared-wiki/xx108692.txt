The G20, also known as the Group of 20 (and, occasionally, the G21, G23 or G20+) is a bloc of developing nations established on 20 August 2003. Distinct and separate from the G-20 major economies, the group emerged at the 5th Ministerial WTO conference, held in  Cancún, Mexico, from 10 September to 14 September 2003. The G-20 accounts for 60% of the world's population, 70% of its farmers and 26% of world’s agricultural exports.http://www.g-20.mre.gov.br/history.asp

==History==

Its origins date back to June 2003, when foreign ministers from Brazil, India and South Africa signed a declaration known as the Brasilia Declaration, on June 6, 2003 by Ministers of Brazil, South Africa and India http://www.ibsa-trilateral.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=16&limit=1&limitstart=0)IBSA – trilateral, developmental initiative between India, Brazil and South Africa in which they stated that "major trading partners are still moved by protectionist concerns in their countries’ less competitive sectors ... and emphasized how important it is that the results of the current round of trade negotiations provide especially for the reversal of protectionist policies and trade-distorting practices ... Furthermore, Brazil, India and South Africa decided to articulate their initiatives of trade liberalization".
Nonetheless, the "official" appearance of the G20 occurred as a response to a text released on 13 August 2003 by the European Communities (EC) and the United States with a common proposal on agriculture for the Cancún Ministerial. On 20 August 2003 a document signed by twenty countries and re-issued as a Cancún Ministerial document on 4 September proposed an alternative framework to that of the EC and the United States on agriculture for the Cancún Meeting. This document marked the establishment of the G-20. The original group of signatories of the 20 August 2003 document went through many changes, being known as such different names as the G-21 or the G-22. The title G20 was finally chosen, in honor of the date of the group's establishment.
Since its creation, the group has had a fluctuating membership. Previous members have included: Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, and Turkey. As of October 2008, the group had 23 members.
