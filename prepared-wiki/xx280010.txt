==Plot==

Woo Shin-hye is a divorcee who lives with her mother and two beautiful, airhead daughters. They are filthy rich thanks to their beauty salon. Yeol Suk-hwan is a widowed single father to a poor but hardworking family. He lives with his mother-in-law and three children -- two sons and a smart but homely daughter. 
Shin-hye and Suk-hwan unexpectedly fall in love and marry. Now that the two families live under the same roof, conflicts constantly arise due to differences in personality. But they eventually become a real family.

==Title change==

The series premiered in August 2012 with the title Shut Up Family, but the words "shut up" received criticism from some viewers, including a warning from the Korean Communication Standards Commission, which stated that the title "lowered the dignity" of public television broadcasting. The production yielded to pressure, and starting from December 10, 2012, the title was changed to simply Family.[tpl]cite web|last=Hong|first=Grace Danbi|title=Sitcom Shut Up Family Changes its Name to Family|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/23398|work=enewsWorld|accessdate=2013-08-21|date=8 December 2012[/tpl]
