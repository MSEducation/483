[[Bhavacakra]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist symbols, Tibetan Buddhist art and culture, Buddhist philosophical concepts

The bhavacakra (Sanskrit; Pali: bhavacakka; Tibetan: srid pa'i 'khor lo) is a symbolic representation of samsara (or cyclic existence) found on the outside walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region. In the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, it is believed that the drawing was designed by the Buddha himself in order to help ordinary people understand the Buddhist teachings. 
The bhavacakra is popularly referred to as the wheel of life. This term is also translated as wheel of cyclic existence or wheel of becoming.

==Origin==

Legend has it that the Buddha himself created the first depiction of the bhavacakra, and the story of how he gave the illustration to King Rudrāyaṇa appears in the anthology of Buddhist narratives called the Divyavadana.
The bhavacakra is painted on the outside walls of nearly every Tibetan Buddhist temple in Tibet and India.Dalai Lama (1992), p. 1 Dzongsar Khyentse states:

==Explanation of the diagram==

===Overview===

The meanings of the main parts of the diagram are: 
Symbolically, the three inner circles, moving from the center outward, show that the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion give rise to positive and negative actions; these actions and their results are called karma. Karma in turn gives rise to the six realms, which represent the different types of suffering within samsara.
The fourth and outer layer of the wheel symbolizes the twelve links of dependent origination; these links indicate how the sources of suffering—the three poisons and karma—produce lives within cyclic existence.
The fierce being holding the wheel represents impermanence; this symbolizes that the entire process of samsara or cyclic existence is impermanent, transient, constantly changing.  The moon above the wheel indicates liberation. The Buddha is pointing to the moon, indicating that liberation from samsara is possible.Dalai Lama (1992), p. 41-43.Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 8-9.

===Hub: the three poisons===

In the hub of the wheel are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They represent the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.Ringu Tulku (2005), p. 30.Dalai Lama (1992), p. 4, 42.
In many drawings of the wheel, the snake and bird are shown as coming out of the mouth of the pig, indicating that aversion and attachment arise from ignorance. The snake and bird are also shown grasping the tail of the pig, indicating that they in turn promote greater ignorance.
Under the influence of the three poisons, beings create karma, as shown in the next layer of the circle.

===Second layer: karma===

The second layer of the wheel shows two-half circles:
These images represent karma, the law of cause and effect. The light half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of positive actions. The dark half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of negative actions.
Ringu Tulku states:
Propelled by their karma, beings take rebirth in the six realms of samsara, as shown in the next layer of the circle.

===Third layer: the six realms of samsara===

====Overview====

The third layer of the wheel is divided into six sections that represent the six realms of samsara. These six realms are divided into three higher realms and three lower realms.

====What is samsara?====

The six realms are six different types of rebirth that beings can enter into, each representing different types of suffering. Samsara, or cyclic existence, refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another.
Patrul Rinpoche states:

====A brief description of the six realms====

Six realms of existence are identified in the Buddhist teachings: gods, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hells. These realms can be understood on a psychological level, or as aspects of Buddhist cosmology.[tpl]refn|group=lower-alpha|"In the Buddhist system of the six realms, the three higher realms are the god realm, the jealous-god realm, and the human realm; the three lower realms are the animal realm, the hungry ghost realmm, and the hell realm. These realms can refer to psychological states or to aspects of Buddhist cosmology."Chögyam Trungpa (2009), p. 127.[/tpl]
These six realms can be divided into three higher realms and three lower realms. The three higher realms are:
The three lower realms are:
Generally speaking, each realm is said to be the result of one of the six main negative emotions: pride, jealousy, desire, ignorance, greed, and anger. Dzongsar Khyentse states:
Among the six realms, the human realm is considered to offer the best opportunity to practice the dharma. Dzongsar Khyentse states:
Sometimes, the wheel is represented as only having five realms because the God realm and the Demi-god realm are combined into a single realm.
In some representations of the wheel, there is a buddha or bodhisattva depicted within each realm, trying to help sentient beings find their way to nirvana.

====Sanskrit terms for the six realms====

The Sanskrit terms for the six realms are:

===Outer rim: the twelve links===

The outer rim of the wheel is divided into twelve sections that represent the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. As previously stated, the three inner layers of the wheel show that the three poisons lead to karma, which leads to the suffering of the six realms. The twelve links of the outer rim show how this happens—by presenting the process of cause and effect in detail.Dalai Lama (1992), p. 8 (from the Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins) 
These twelve links can be understood to operate on an outer or inner level.Thrangu Rinpoche (2001), pp. 3, 32  
By contemplating on the twelve links, one gains greater insight into the workings of karma; this insight enables us to begin to unravel our habitual way of thinking and reacting.Goodman, Location 1492 (Kindel edition)Simmer-Brown (1987), p. 28
The twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are: 

===The figure holding the wheel: impermanence===

The wheel is being held by a fearsome figure who represents impermanence. The Dalai Lama states:
This figure is most commonly depicted as Yama, the lord of death. Regardless of the figure depicted, the inner meaning remains the same–that the entire process of cyclic existence (samsara) is transient; everything within this wheel is constantly changing.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | authorlink1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: Guide to the Collection | publisher = GILES | year = 2010 | location = London, UK | pages = 32 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html | accessdate = 2011-07-12 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5[/tpl] 
Yama has the following attributes:

===The moon: liberation===

Above the wheel is an image of the moon; the moon represents liberation from the sufferings of samsara.Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 9.Dalai Lama (1992), p. 43.Thubten Chodron (1993), Part 2 of 5, p. 5
Thubten Chodron states:
Chögyam Trungpa states:
Some drawings may show an image of a "pure land" to indicate liberation, rather than a moon.

===The Buddha pointing to the moon: the path to liberation===

The upper part of the drawing also shows an image of the Buddha pointing toward the moon; this represents the path to liberation.
Thubten Chodron states:
Chögyam Trungpa states:
Mark Epstein states:
According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha told his followers:
 I have shown you the path that leads to liberation
 But you should know that liberation depends upon yourself.

===Inscription===

Drawings of the Bhavacakra usually contain an inscription consisting of a few lines of text that explain the process that keeps us in samara and how to reverse that process.

==Psychological interpretation==

From a psychological point of view, different karmic actions contribute to one's metaphorical existence in different realms, or rather, different actions reinforce personal characteristics described by the realms.
Mark Epstein states:

==Within the Theravada tradition==

T. B. Karunaratne states:
{{quote|Though in Theravāda literature there is no mention of an actual pictorial execution of a "Wheel of Life," yet the concept of comparing Dependent Origination to a wheel is not unknown. In the Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga), the famous commentator Buddhaghosa Acariya says:
