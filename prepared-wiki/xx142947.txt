It is found from Delaware to southern Florida and eastern Louisiana, usually in coastal areas.

==Description==

Hyla gratiosa is the largest native tree frog in the United States. It is [tpl]convert|5|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in head-body length.

The barking tree frog is known for its loud, strident, barking call. It may also utter a repetitive single-syllable mating call. It has been known to chorus with other frogs of the same and similar species.
The barking tree frog burrows in the sand, especially when the temperature is hot. It also spends time high up in trees, especially during the day when it is less active. 
It breeds in shallow pools or ponds from March to August. It is a polygynous species, the female choosing the male on the basis of his call. Tadpoles can be nearly [tpl]convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.
