In domestic politics, the SDUSA leadership emphasized the role of the American labor movement in advancing civil rights and economic justice. The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article "From Protest to Politics". In it, Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban Black working-class, particularly in the northern US. The needs of the Black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where Blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin. A particular danger facing the Black community was the chimera of identity politics, particularly the rise of "Black power" which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class African-Americans that repeated the political and moral errors of previous black nationalists, while alienating the white allies needed by the Black community.
SDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle-class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated  role of "middle-class" peace activists in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the "New Politics" of Senator George McGovern, whose Presidential candidacy was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the USA. In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.
In foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the Vietnam War. However, the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor-unions and of the political opposition.These positions had been advanced by organizations like  "Negotiations Now!" since the 1960s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Gershman|title=Totalitarian menace (Controversies: Detente and the left after Afghanistan)|journal=Society|date=3 November 1980|publisher=Transactions (purchased by Springer)|location=New York|issn=0147-2011|pages=9–15|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02694835[/tpl] After the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and the victory of the Vietnamese Communists, SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator McGovern for his failure to support such assistance.[tpl]cite journal|title=The View from Washington|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=6|number=2|date=November–December 1978|pages=134–135|publisher= Taylor & Francis, Ltd.|jstor=30171704|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00927678.1978.10553935[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first=Carl|last=Gershman|url=http://www.archive.org/details/AfterTheDominoesFell|title=After the dominoes fell|journal=Commentary (May 1978)|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1978|series=SD papers|volume=3|ref=harv|authorlink=Carl Gershman[/tpl]

==Organizational activities==

SDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers. These gatherings featured discussions and debates over proposed resolutions, some of which were adopted as organizational statements. The group frequently made use of outside speakers at these events: Non-SDUSA intellectuals ranged from neoconservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick on the right to democratic socialists like Paul Berman on the left; similarly, a range of academic, political, and labor-union leaders were invited.  These meetings also functioned as reunions for political activists and intellectuals, some of whom worked together for decades.[tpl]cite journal|first=Harold|last=Meyerson|authorlink=Harold Meyerson|date=Fall 2002|volume=49|number=4|title=Solidarity, Whatever|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=552|journal=Dissent|page=16|ref=harv[/tpl] SDUSA also published a newsletter and occasional position papers.
SDUSA issued statements supporting labor unions and workers' interests at home and overseas. It supported the existence of Israel and the Israeli labor movement.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TheAmericanChallengeASocial-democraticProgramForTheSeventies|title=The American challenge: A social-democratic program for the seventies|location=New York|publisher=SDUSA|year=1973|author=Social Democrats, USA||ref=harv[/tpl] It opposed many of the G. W. Bush administration[tpl]'s[/tpl] domestic policies.[tpl]harvtxt|Muravchik|2006[/tpl]: [tpl]cite journal|first=Joshua|last=Muravchik|authorlink=Joshua Muravchik|url=http://www.aei.org/article/23700|title=Comrades|journal=Commentary Magazine|date=January 2006|accessdate=15 June 2007[/tpl] From 1979–1989, SDUSA members were active providing support of Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the independent labor-union of Poland.
 The organization also attempted to exert influence through endorsements of Presidential candidates. The group's 1976 National Convention, held in New York City, formally endorsed the Democratic ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale and pledged the group to "work enthusiastically" for the election of the pair in November."Freedom, Economic Justice Themes of SD Convention," New America York, vol. 13, no. 15 (Aug.-Sept. 1976), pg. 1. The organization took a less assertive approach during the divisive 1980 campaign, marked as it was by a heated primary challenge to President Carter by Senator Edward Kennedy; SDUSA chose not to hold its biannual convention until after the termination of the fall campaign. The election of conservative Ronald Reagan was chalked up to the failure of the Democrats to "appeal to their traditional working class constituency.""Social Democracy Faces Crucial Era," New America York, vol 17, no. 11 (December 1980), pg. 1.
Early in 1980 long-time National Director Carl Gershman resigned his position, to be replaced by Rita Freedman."Rita Freedman New SD Director," New America York, vol. 17, no. 2 (Feb. 1980), pg. 12. Freedman previously had served as organizer and chair of SDUSA's key New York local.
Dues in Social Democrats, USA were paid annually in advance, with members receiving a copy of the organization's official organ, the tabloid-sized newspaper New America. The dues rate was $25 per year in 1983."Wanted: Dues Cheaters" (ad), New America York, vol. 20, no. 5 (Sept.-Oct. 1983), pg. 7.

==Member activities==

Small organizations associated with the Debs–Thomas Socialist Party have served as schools for the leadership of social-movement organizations, including the civil-rights movement and the sixties radicalism. These organizations are now chiefly remembered because of their members' leadership of large organizations that directly influenced USA and international politics.Aldon Morris, The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement: Black Communities Organizing for Change (New York: The Free Press, 1994) After 1960 the Party also functioned "as an educational organization" and "a caucus of policy advocates on the left wing of the Democratic Party".[tpl]harvtxt|Hamby|2003|p=25|loc=footnote 5[/tpl]: [tpl]cite journal|first=Alonzo L.|last=Hamby|year=2003|title=Is there no democratic left in America? Reflections on the transformation of an ideology|doi=10.1017/S0898030600000695|journal=Journal of Policy History|volume=15|pages=3–25|doi=10.1353/jph.2003.0003|ref=harv[/tpl] Similarly, SDUSA was known mainly because of the activities of its members, many of whom publicly identified themselves as members of SDUSA. Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private, and not-for-profit organizations. A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Norman Hill were leaders of the African American civil rights movement. Tom Kahn, Sandra Feldman, and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and Penn Kemble served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher Sidney Hook was a public intellectual.
Writing after the death of Tom Kahn, Ben Wattenberg commented that SDUSA members seemed to be
 
 "ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleagues—Penn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many more—ran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more. 
 I never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straight—YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL—but the key words were "democratic", "labor", "young" and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, "socialist". Ultimately, the umbrella group became "Social Democrats, U.S.A", and Tom Kahn was a principal "theoretician". 
 They talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say "anti-communist" and "pro-democracy" in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those "Yipsels" (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large. 
 On the conservative side, foreign policy used to be anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both. 
 It was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be "anti-communist" in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as "Cold Warriors" who saw "Commies under every bed" and being labeled as—the unkindest cut—"right-wingers".[tpl]Cite news|date=22 April 1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|ref=harv|id=Syndicated: (Thursday 23 April 1993).

===Service in Democratic and Republican administrations===

SDUSA members have served in government since the 1970s, and the service of some members in Republican administrations has been associated with controversy. SDUSA members like Gershman were called "State Department socialists" by [tpl]harvtxt|Massing|1987[/tpl], who wrote that the foreign policy of the Reagan administration was being run by Trotskyists, a claim that was called a "myth" by [tpl]harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34[/tpl].[ref]
"A 1987 article in The New Republic described these developments as a Trotskyist takeover of the Reagan administration" wrote [tpl]harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34[/tpl].[/ref] This "Trotskyist" charge has been repeated and even widened by journalist Michael Lind in 2003 to assert a takeover of the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration by former Trotskyists; Lind's "amalgamation of the defense intellectuals with the traditions and theories of 'the largely Jewish-American Trotskyist movement' Lind's words" was criticized in 2003 by University of Michigan professor Alan M. Wald,[tpl]cite journal|date=27 June 2003|title=Are Trotskyites Running the Pentagon?|first=Alan|last= Wald|authorlink=Alan M. Wald|journal=History News Network|url=http://hnn.us/articles/1514.html|ref=harv[/tpl]  who had discussed Trotskyism  in his history of "the New York intellectuals".[tpl]cite book|last=Wald|first=Alan M.|title=The New York intellectuals: The rise and decline of the anti-Stalinist left from the 1930s to the 1980s'|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1987|isbn=0-8078-4169-2|ref=harv[/tpl] SDUSA and allegations that "Trotskyists" subverted Bush's foreign policy have been  mentioned by "self-styled" paleoconservatives (conservative opponents of neoconservatism).[ref][tpl]harvtxt|Muravchik|2006|[/tpl]. Addressing the allegation that SDUSUA was a "Trotskyist" organization, Muravchik wrote that in the early 1960s, two future members of SDUSA, Tom Kahn and Paul Feldman
 
 "became devotees  of a former Trotskyist named Max Shachtman—a fact that today has taken on a life of its own. Tracing forward in lineage through me and a few other ex-YPSL’s of the Young Peoples Socialist League turned neoconservatives, this happenstance has fueled the accusation that neoconservatism itself, and through it the foreign policy of the Bush administration, are somehow rooted in 'Trotskyism.'
 
 I am more inclined to laugh than to cry over this, but since the myth has traveled so far, let me briefly try once more, as I have done at greater length in the past, to set the record straight."The Neoconservative Cabal," Commentary, September 2003 The alleged connective chain is broken at every link. The falsity of its more recent elements is readily ascertainable by anyone who cares for the truth—namely, that George Bush was never a neoconservative and that most neoconservatives were never YPSL’s. The earlier connections are more obscure but no less false. Although Shachtman was one of the elder statesmen who occasionally made stirring speeches to us, no YPSL of my generation was a Shachtmanite. What is more, our mentors, Paul and Tom, had come under Shachtman’s sway years after he himself had ceased to be a Trotskyite.

===A. Philip Randolph===

The long-time leader and intellectual architect of the civil rights movement, A. Philip Randolph was also a visible member of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas. He remained with the organization when it changed its name to SDUSA. Along with ILGWU President David Dubinsky, Randolph was honored at the 1976 SDUSA convention.[tpl]citation|first=Sidney|last=Hook|authorlink=Sidney Hook|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TheSocialDemocraticProspect|title=The social democratic prospect: Social democracy and America|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1976|ref=harv[/tpl]
A. Philip Randolph came to national attention as the leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Randolph proposed a march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in the armed forces. Meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that Negroes would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur. The planned march was canceled after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (the Fair Employment Act), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.
In 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at Madison Square Garden to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies, and in labor unions.  Following the act, during the Philadelphia Transit Strike of 1944, the government backed African-American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.
In 1947, Randolph, along with colleague Grant Reynolds, renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent Civil Disobedience.  On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman abolished racial segregation in the armed forces through Executive Order 9981.
Randolph was the nominal leader of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was organized by Bayard Rustin and his younger associates. At this march, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech. Soon aferwords, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.

===Bayard Rustin===

Bayard Rustin was National Chairman of SDUSA. He also was President of the A. Philip Randolph Institute.[tpl]citation|first1=Bayard|last1=Rustin|first2=Carl|last2=Gershman|title=Africa, Soviet imperialism and the retreat of American power|authorlink1=Bayard Rustin|authorlink2=Carl Gershman|url=http://www.archive.org/details/AfricaSovietImperialismAndTheRetreatOfAmericanPower|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1978|series=SD papers|volume=2|ref=harv[/tpl][ref]Rustin's selected writings have been republished as Time on two crosses: the collected writings of Bayard Rustin (San Francisco : Cleis Press, 2003). Rustin's writings had appeared in an earlier collection>
Rustin had had a long association with A. Philip Randolph and with pacifist movements. In 1956 Rustin advised Martin Luther King Jr. who  was organizing the Montgomery bus boycott.  According to Rustin, "I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began.  In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns."  Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection.Bayard Rustin – Who Is This Man, State of the Reunion, radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40–2:10, accessed March 16, 2011.[ref]
Rustin wrote the following reports:
Rustin and Randolph organized the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. On September 6, 1963 Rustin and Randolph appeared on the cover of Life magazine as "the leaders" of the March.Life Magazine, September 6, 1963.

====From protest to politics====

After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act, Rustin advocated closer ties between the civil rights movement and the Democratic Party and its  base among the working class.
With the assistance of Tom Kahn, Rustin wrote the 1965 article "From protest to politics",[tpl]cite journal|title=From protest to politics: The future of the civil rights movement|first=Bayard|last=Rustin|date=February 1965|journal=Commentary|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/from-protest-to-politics-the-future-of-the-civil-rights-movement/|ref=harv[/tpl] which analyzed the changing economy and its implications for American Negroes. This article stated that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban Negro working-class, particularly in the northern US. To pursue its economic agenda, the Negro community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.). As its agenda shifted from civil rights to economic justice, the Negro community's tactics needed to shift from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.[ref]Rustin wrote the following reports:
[/ref]
A particular danger facing the Negro community was the chimera of identity politics, particularly the rise of "Black power", for which Rustin expressed contempt:
 
 "Wearing my hair Afro style, calling myself an Afro-American, and eating all the chitterlings I can find are not going to affect Congress."[tpl]cite journal|title=From protest to patronage|first=Randall|last=Kennedy|month=29 September 29|year=2003|journal=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage|ref=harv[/tpl]

Rustin wrote that "Black power" repeated the moral errors of previous black nationalists, while alienating the white allies needed by the Negro community.[ref]Rustin wrote the following reports:
[/ref]

=====Influence on William Julius Wilson=====

Rustin's analysis was supported by the later research by William Julius Wilson. Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the Black community, following educated Blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor, as industry declined in the Northern USA. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on "affirmative action", a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the Black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working-class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.[ref]Wilson's
The Declining Significance of Race won the American Sociological Association's Sydney Spivack Award. In The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions (1978) Wilson argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances.
His The Truly Disadvantaged, which was selected by the editors of the New York Times Book Review as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received The Washington Monthly Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the "spatial mismatch" theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global economic restructuring, and hence urban unemployment increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners.
His When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor, which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of the New York Times Book Review and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award.
His The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested.
In Wilson's most recent book, More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans.  He asks the question, "Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?"  In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education.  Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers.  In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors.  He tries "to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality."  Wilson's goal is to "rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena."  http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf

====Labor movement: unions and social democracy====

Rustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the Negro community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.
He was the founder and became the Director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.
On the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American social democracy. He was a founding National Co-Chairman of Social Democrats, USA.

====Human rights, especially ending discrimination against gays====

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and election monitor for Freedom House. He also testified on behalf of New York State's Gay Rights Bill.  In 1986, he gave a speech "The new 'niggers' are gays," in which he asserted,
[tpl]bquote|Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change. Blacks are in every segment of society and there are laws that help to protect them from racial discrimination. The new "niggers" are gays.... It is in this sense that gay people are the new barometer for social change.... The question of social change should be framed with the most vulnerable group in mind: gay people.[tpl]cite web |title=Gays Are the New Niggers |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/damnation/gays-are-the-new-niggers/ |date=June 26, 2009 |author=Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou |publisher=Killing the Buddha |accessdate=2 July 2009[/tpl][/tpl]
Rustin also helped to write a report on peaceful means to end Apartheid (racial segregation) in South Africa.[ref]

===Norman Hill===

Norman Hill (born April 22, 1933 in Summit, New JerseyStaff. "Calm Battler for Rights; Norman Spencer Hill Jr.", The New York Times, September 14, 1964. Accessed February 19, 2011. "Norman Hill was born in Summit, N.J.") is an influential African-American administrator, activist and labor leader.
Graduating in 1956, he was one of the first African-Americans to graduate from Haverford College. Joining the civil rights movement and working in Chicago, Hill was an organizer for the Youth March for Integrated Schools, and then Secretary of Chicago Area Negro American Labor Council, and Staff Chairman of the Chicago March Conventions. In the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Hill was first the East Coast Field Secretary and then National Program Director.  He assisted Bayard Rustin with organizing the 1963 March on Washington. As National Program Director of CORE, Hill coordinated the route 40 desegregation of restaurants, the Waldorf campaign, and illustrated the civil rights demonstration that took place at the 1964 Republican National Convention.
From 1964 to 1967, Norman Hill served as the Legislative Representative and Civil Rights Liaison of the Industrial Union department of the AFL-CIO. He was involved in the issue of raising minimum wage and the labor delegation on the Selma to Montgomery marches against racial discrimination in politics and voting in the southern United States.
In 1967, Hill became active in the A. Philip Randolph Institute. He began as Associate Director, but later became Executive Director, and finally President. As Associate Director, Hill coordinated and organized the Memphis March in 1968, after Martin Luther King’s assassination. In his career at the A. Philip Randolph Institute, Hill created over two hundred local chapters of this organization across the United States.[ref]

===Tom Kahn===

Tom Kahn was a leader of SDUSA, who made notable contributions to the Civil Rights movement and to the labor movement.

====Civil rights====

Kahn helped Bayard Rustin organize the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington and the 1958 and 1959 Youth March for Integrated Schools.Isserman, Maurice If I had a hammer New York, Basic Books 1987 As a white student at historically black Howard University, Kahn and Norman Hill helped Rustin and A. Philip Randolph to plan the 1963 March on Washington, at which Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his I have a dream speech.Jervis Anderson, A. Philip Randolph: A Biographical Portrait (1973; University of California Press, 1986).  ISBN 978-0-520-05505-6[ref]

====Support of Solidarity, the Polish union====

When he became an assistant to the President of the AFL-CIO from 1972–1986, Kahn developed an expertise in international affairs.
Kahn was deeply involved with supporting the Polish labor movement.  The trade union Solidarity (Solidarność) began in 1980. The Soviet-backed communist regime headed by General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in December 1981. Lane Kirkland appointed Kahn to organize the AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity. Politically, the AFL-CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL-CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund, which raised almost $300,000 by 1981. These funds purchased printing presses, and office supplies. The AFL-CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.[tpl]harvtxt|Puddington|2005[/tpl]: [tpl]cite journal|title=Surviving the underground: How American unions helped solidarity win|first=Arch|last=Puddington||journal=American Educator|issue=Summer|year=2005|publisher=American Federation of Teachers|url=http://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/summer2005/puddington.cfm|accessdate=4 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=31[/tpl].
 The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. On September 12, Lech Walesa welcomed  international donations with this statement: "Help can never be politically embarrassing. That of the AFL-CIO, for example. We are grateful to them. It was a very good thing that they helped us. Whenever we can, we will help them, too."[tpl]harvtxt|Puddington|2005[/tpl] quotes "Polish Strike Leader Thanks U.S. Labor," Associated Press, September 12, 1980. Kahn explained the AFL–CIO position in a 1981 debate:
 
 "Solidarity made its needs known,Emboldening added. with courage, with clarity, and publicly. As you know, the AFL-CIO responded by establishing a fund for the purchase of equipment requested by Solidarity and we have raised about a quarter of a million dollars for that fund.
 
 This effort has elicited from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
Bulgaria the most massive and vicious propaganda assault on the AFL–CIO ... 
 in many, many years. The ominous tone of the most recent attacks leaves
no doubt that if the Soviet Union invades, it shall cite the aid of the AFL-CIO as evidence of outside anti-Socialist intervention aimed at overthrowing the Polish state. Opening statement by Tom Kahn in  [tpl]harvtxt|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008|p=234[/tpl]

 
 "
All this is by way of introducing the AFL–CIO’s position on economic aid to Poland. In formulating this position, our first concern was to consult our friends
in Solidarity ...
. We did consult with them ...
 and their views are reflected in the statement unanimously adopted by
the AFL–CIO Executive Council.
 
 '
The AFL-CIO will support additional aid to Poland only if it is conditioned on the adherence of the Polish government to the 21 points of the Gdansk Agreement. Only then could we be assured that the Polish
workers will be in a position to defend their gains and to struggle for a fair
share of the benefits of Western aid.'"[ref]Opening statement by Tom Kahn in  [tpl]harvtxt|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008|p=235[/tpl]
[/ref]

In testimony to the Joint Congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Kahn suggested policies to support the Polish people, in particular by supporting Solidarity's demand that the Communist regime finally establish legality, by respecting the twenty-one rights guaranteed by the Polish constitution.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Tom|title=Moral duty|journal=Society |date=March 3, 1982 |publisher=Transactions Publishers (purchased by Springer)|location=New York|issn=0147-2011|page=51|volume=19|number=3|doi=10.1007/BF02698967[/tpl]
The AFL-CIO provided the most aid to Solidarity, but substantial additional aid was provided by Western-European labor unions, including the U. K.[tpl]'s[/tpl] Trades Union Congress and especially the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.

=====Criticism of AFL–CIO=====

The AFL-CIO's support enraged the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Its support worried the Carter Administration, whose Secretary of State Edmund Muskie told Kirkland that the AFL-CIO's continued support of solidarity could trigger a Soviet invasion of Poland.[ref][tpl]harvtxt|Puddington|2008[/tpl] wrote:
 
 "Kirkland's embrace of Solidarity brought him into immediate conflict with the Carter administration. Despite the administration's avowed commitment to human rights, Edmund Muskie, secretary of state, decided that quiet diplomacy was the most prudent course to follow in the Polish crisis. He summoned Kirkland to his office for lunch on September 3, 1980, during which he gave a 'negative assessment' of the Polish aid fund that the AFL-CIO had just launched and declared that the federation's open support for Solidarity could be 'deliberately misinterpreted' by the Kremlin in order to justify military intervention. Muskie was not alone in deploring labor's Polish initiative. In a New York Times column, Flora Lewis called the Workers Aid Fund 'most unfortunate.' Flora Lewis, "Let the Poles Do It," New York Times, September 5, 1980.]"
[/ref] After Kirkland refused to withdraw support to Solidarity, Muskie met with the USSR's Ambassador, Anatoly Dobyrnin, to clarify that the AFL-CIO's aid did not have the support of the US government.
Aid to Solidarity was also opposed by neo-conservative Jeane Kirkpatrick, who argued that communism could not be overthrown and that Solidarity was doomed.[ref]The prospects of Solidarity and the morality of aiding Solidarity were debated by neo-conservative Podhoretz, who opposed aid to Solidarity as aiding the Soviet Union and failing to help the Polish people, and Kahn, who favored U.S. financial support of Poland only if Poland agreed to allow free labor-unions and freedom of the press, among other demands.

=====Aid through the 1980s=====

Later, the National Endowment for Democracy provided $1.7 million for Solidarity, which was transferred via the AFL-CIO. In both 1988 and 1989, the U.S. Congress allocated $1 million yearly to Solidarity via the AFL-CIO.
In total, the AFL-CIO channeled 4 million dollars to Solidarity."The AFL-CIO had channeled more than $4 million to it, including computers, printing presses, and supplies" according to [tpl]harvtxt|Horowitz|2005[/tpl].

===Sandra Feldman===

Sandra Feldman (October 13, 1939 – September 18, 2005) was an American civil rights activist, educator and labor leader who served as president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) from 1997 to 2004.[tpl]Cite news|title=Sandra Feldman, scrappy and outspoken labor leader for teachers, dies at 65|newspaper=New York times|first=Joseph|last=Berger |date=September 20, 2005 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/nyregion/20feldman.html?sq=Sandra%20Feldman&st=cse&scp=2&pagewanted=all|ref=harv[/tpl]
She helped to organize and was the keynote speaker at the 1999 SDUSA workshop on "American Labor in the New Economy: A Day of Dialogue,"January 22, 1999.

====Socialist activism====

She became active in socialist politics and the civil rights movement. When she was 17 years old, she met civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, who became her mentor and close friend. During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate Howard Johnson's restaurants in Maryland. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the Congress of Racial Equality in Harlem. She also participated in several Freedom Rides, and was arrested twice.

====Teaching====

Upon graduation from Brooklyn College in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in East Harlem. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland. She participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a master's degree program in literature at New York University. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the American Federation of Teachers, which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won collective bargaining rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year. During this time, Feldman became an associate of Albert Shanker, then an organizer for the United Federation of Teachers.

====United Federation of Teachers (UFT)====

In 1966, on the recommendation of Rustin, Shanker—now executive director of the UFT—hired Feldman as a full-time field representative. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.
After just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs. The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in due process proceedings.
A protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being "Jewish-dominated". Feldman was often at the center of the strike.Carter, Pickets, Parents, and Power, 1971. The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever, and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.
Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but retained his post as president of the UFT. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT president, and Feldman was elected president.

====UFT President after Shanker====

Feldman was known for being a quiet but very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that Robert F. Wagner, Jr., President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.
She was instrumental in helping David Dinkins win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters. But once mayor, Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union. Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to Rudy Giuliani.

====American Federation of Teachers (AFT)====

Feldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,See the list of AFT vice presidents at serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.
After Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT's president in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent).
With Feldman as President, in 2002, AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a "culture of organizing" throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work, and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.
In May 1997, Feldman was elected to the AFL-CIO executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of Education International and was a board member of the International Rescue Committee and Freedom House.
Sandra Feldman died in 2005 at the age 65.[ref]

===Sidney Hook===

Sidney Hook (December 20, 1902 – July 12, 1989) was an American pragmatic philosopher known for his contributions to public debates. A student of John Dewey, Hook continued to examine the philosophy of history, of education, politics, and of ethics. He was known for his criticisms of totalitarianism (fascism and Marxism–Leninism). A pragmatic social democrat, Hook sometimes cooperated with conservatives, particularly in opposing communism. After WWII, he argued that  members of conspiracies, like the Communist Party USA and other Leninist conspiracies,  ethically could be barred from holding offices of public trust.[ref]
Hook was a public intellectual for more than five decades:
Hook wrote many books and his writings have often been republished:
[/ref]
Hook gave the keynote speech to the July 17–18, 1976 convention of SDUSA.
 
 For the Social Democrat, democracy is not merely a political concept but a moral one. It is democracy as a way of life. What is "democracy as a way of life." It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected. 

When it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.

I want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.

We are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.

===Penn Kemble===

Richard Penn Kemble (January 21, 1941 — October 15, 2005), commonly known as "Penn," was an American political activist and a founding member of SDUSA. He supported free labor unions and democracy in the USA and internationally, and so was active in the civil rights movement, the labor movement, and the social-democratic opposition to communism. He founded organizations including Negotiations Now!, Frontlash, and Prodemca. Kemble was appointed to various government boards and institutions throughout the 1990s, eventually becoming the Acting Director of the U.S. Information Agency under President Bill Clinton.[tpl]Cite news|newspaper=The Times |location=London |title=Penn Kemble: Dapper Democratic Party activist whose influence extended across the spectrum of US politics (21 January 1941 –15 October 2005) |date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article584709.ece|ref=harv[/tpl]
After moving to New York, Kemble stood out as a neatly dressed, muscular Protestant youth, in an urban political setting that was predominantly Catholic and  Jewish. He worked at The New York Times but was fired for refusing to cross a picket line during a typesetters' strike. A leader in the East River chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Kemble helped to organize a non-violent blockade of the Triborough Bridge during rush hour, to raise consciousness among suburbanites of the lives of Harlem residents. Kemble was a founder of Negotiation Now!, a group which called for an end to the bombing of North Vietnam and a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam War. He was opposed to a unilateral withdrawal of U.S forces from Vietnam.
In 1972, Kemble was a founder the Coalition for a Democratic Majority (CDM), an association of centrist Democrats that opposed the "new politics" liberalism  exemplified by Senator George McGovern, who suffered the worst defeat of a Presidential candidate in modern times, despite the widespread dislike of Nixon. Kemble was Executive Director of CDM from 1972–76, at which time he left to become a special assistant and speechwriter for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  He remained with Moynihan until 1979. Concerned about the direct and indirect role of the Communist Party USA and of sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist politics in the US Peace Movement and in the National Council of Churches, Kemble helped found the Institute on Religion and Democracy. From 1981 until 1988 was the President of the Committee for Democracy in Central America (PRODEMCA), which opposed the Sandinistas and related groups in Central America.
He supported the Bill Clinton's campaign for the Presidency. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, Kemble served first in 1993 as the Deputy Director and then in 1999 as Acting Director of the U.S. Information Agency. He was also made a special representative of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to the Community of Democracies Initiative."Social democrat neocon (sic.)", Washington Times, October 18, 2005.
In 2001, Kemble was appointed to the Board of International Broadcasting by President George W. Bush. He also became the Washington, D.C. representative of Freedom House; in his last years, he was especially involved in supporting peace efforts in the Middle East. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell appointed Kemble to be the Chairman of the International Eminent Persons Group on Slavery, Abduction and Forced Servitude in Sudan. Despite being diagnosed with brain cancer, Kemble spent his last months organizing a conference on the contributions of Sidney Hook, the late pragmatic philosopher and SDUSA spokesperson; Carl Gershman took over the leadership of the conference after Kemble's cancer made it impossible for him to continue.

===Carl Gershman===

Carl Gershman was the Executive Director of the SDUSA from 1975 to 1980.
