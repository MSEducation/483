.</ref> The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf of those who have died, such as [[baptism for the dead]]. The church teaches that all will have the opportunity to hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings that come to those who faithfully adhere to it, in this life or the next. Ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, sealings, and [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowments]] are performed in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] that are built and dedicated specifically for these purposes.
The LDS faithful observe a health code called the "Word of Wisdom," in which they abstain from the consumption of alcohol, coffee, tea, and tobacco. The Word of Wisdom also encourages the use of wholesome herbs and fruits within season, moderate consumption of meat, and consumption of grains.Doctrine and Covenants 89.
Latter-day Saints follow a moral code, called the "law of chastity," which prohibits adultery, all homosexual behavior, and any sexual relations outside of marriage.
LDS faithful donate a ten percent tithe on their annual income, which is used to carry out the operations of the church, including construction of temples, meetinghouses and other buildings, as well as other church uses.[tpl]citation |contribution= Tithing |contribution-url= https://www.lds.org/topics/tithing?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church[/tpl] Faithful members also set aside the first Sunday of each month to abstain from food and drink for at least two consecutive meals, and prayerfuly dedicate the fast to a purpose of the individuals' choosing. They donate at least the cost of the two skipped meals as a fast offering, which the church uses to assist the poor and needy and expand its worldwide humanitarian efforts.[tpl]citation |contribution= Fasting and Fast Offerings |contribution-url= https://www.lds.org/topics/fasting-and-fast-offerings?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church[/tpl] Members are further instructed to set aside one night a week, typically Monday, for a "Family Home Evening," where they gather together as a family to study gospel principles and participate in wholesome activities.

====Missionary service====

The LDS Church expects all male members to serve a two-year mission unless physical, mental, or emotional health issues prevent their service.[tpl]cite web|last=Monson|first=Thomas S.|title=Welcome to Conference|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/welcome-to-conference?lang=eng&media=video|authorlink=Thomas S.

Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Prior to October 2012 the minimum age for full-time missionary service was generally 19 for men and 21 for women.[tpl]Citation|author=Joseph Walker|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765609643/LDS-Church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service.html|title=LDS Church lowers age requirement for missionary service|work=Deseret News|date=October 6, 2012[/tpl]. Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months.  However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision. There is no maximum age for missionary service for women.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=22472472 |title= LDS Church members respond to new mission age rules |first= David Self |last= Newlin |first2= Jennifer |last= Stagg |date= October 8, 2012 |publisher= KSL |accessdate= 2013-03-07 [/tpl] Retired couples are encouraged to serve missions, and may serve for either 6-, 12-, 18-, or 23-month terms."Missionary Policy Changes Give More Seniors Opportunity to Serve", LDS Church News Release, June 2, 2011.

===Comparisons with mainstream Christianity===

The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible (excluding parts the LDS people believes to be translated incorrectly, Joseph Smith inserting the annotation that “The Songs of Solomon are not inspired writings.”),Adherents believe in the Bible "as far as it is translated correctly" See [tpl]lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8[/tpl]. the divinity of Jesus, and his atonement and resurrection. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, restorationism[tpl]lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6[/tpl]. (via a restoration of Christ's church revealed through Joseph Smith, Jr.), millennialism, continuationism, penal substitution,Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8–16. and a form of apostolic succession. The practices of baptism by immersion and the eucharist (referred to as the sacrament) are also held in common. However, the Catholic Church considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr.

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31 percent of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian.

Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement with aspects of the Nicene Creed, belief in a unique theory of human salvation that includes three heavens (referred to as "degrees of glory", its interpretation of I Cor. 15:35 et.seq.),Spencer W. Kimball, "An Eternal Hope in Christ", Ensign, November 1978, p. 71 ("Then he taught and testified that even as Christ is risen from the dead, so will all men come forth from the grave; each will then be judged according to his works, and each will receive his appointed place in the mansions which are prepared.  In that resurrected state, Paul said, there are "celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial, and bodies telestial; but the glory of the celestial, one; and the terrestrial, another; and the telestial, another" (JST, 1 Cor. 15:40)). a doctrine of "exaltation" which includes the ability of humans to become gods and goddesses in the afterlife,[tpl]citation | last=Carter | first=K.

Officially, major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from creedal Christianity.See, for example, [tpl]Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|accessdate=January 30, 2007[/tpl] (Presbyterian Church USA, stating that "Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church"); [tpl]Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|accessdate=August 15, 2006[/tpl] (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, stating that LDS Church doctrine regarding the Trinity is "substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity"; [tpl]Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|accessdate=August 15, 2006[/tpl] (United Methodist Church, stating that the LDS Church, "by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith"). Leaders of the LDS Church assert that the LDS Church is the only true church and that other churches do not have the authority to act in Jesus' name.According to Joseph Smith, Jesus told him that the other churches claiming to be Christian creeds "were an abomination in the Lords sight; that those professors religion were all corrupt".  Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith—History 1:19.
From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a Trinity of three separate persons in "one essence". LDS Church theology includes the belief in a "Godhead" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint movement faiths===

The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these smaller groups is the Community of Christ (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in Independence, Missouri, followed by the The Church of Jesus Christ, based in Monongahela, Pennsylvania. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the Doctrine and Covenants. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.
The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith. Other branches may be considered later off-shoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly due to disagreements about plural marriage. The practice of plural marriage has continued among the fundamentalist groups, who believe the practice is a requirement for exaltation. The LDS Church teaches today that a single celestial marriage is sufficient.

===Name and legal entities===

In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the Edmunds–Tucker Act because of the church's practice of polygamy. (The Edmunds–Tucker Act was repealed in 1978.) The church has continued to operate under what remains its formal name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Accepted informal names include the LDS Church, the Latter-day Saints, and the Mormons. The term Mormon Church is in common use,The Associated Press continues to says that "Mormon Church" is a proper second reference in its Style Guide for journalists. [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.westminster-mo.edu/academics/resources/library/resources/Pages/GuidetoAPStyle.aspx |title=?

The church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of Utah to acquire, hold, and dispose of real property. In 1923, the church incorporated the Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated Intellectual Reserve, Inc. to hold all the church's copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property. The church also holds several non-tax-exempt corporations, such as Bonneville International and the Deseret News.

===Geographic distribution and membership===

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults (between the ages of 18 and 30), single adults aged 31 to 45,[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook 2: Administering the Church|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/single-members?lang=eng[/tpl]  or for speakers of alternate languages. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as wards, or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a chapel, the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse, of which the church maintains a virtual tour of a typical example and also an online meetinghouse locator which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations encompassing multiple congregations include stakes, missions, districts, areas, and regions.
The church reports a worldwide membership of 15 million[tpl]citation |contribution= Facts and Statistics |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/15-million-member-milestone-announced-at-churchs-general-conference |title= 15 Million Member Milestone Announced at Church's General Conference |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church |date= October 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl].

The church continues to seek recognition in regions where it has had little or no influence. On August 30, 2010, church leaders announced that they were making significant progress on "regularized operations for the Church in China."Church in Talks to "Regularize" Activities in China. Retrieved August 30, 2010.

===Priesthood hierarchy===

The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called "the Prophet" or President of the Church, as his spokesman on the earth. The current president is Thomas S. Monson. While there have been exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained apostles and form the First Presidency, the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.Haight, David B., "A Prophet Chosen of the Lord", Ensign, May 1986, p. 7. When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve (the one who has been an apostle the longest), who then reconstitutes a new First Presidency. These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two Quorums of Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric) are called general authorities. They exercise both ecclesiastical and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and mission presidents work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, ch. 32.
At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See D. Michael Quinn (1997), Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power, Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.
 Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their families or home congregations; however, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.
All worthy males are generally considered for the priesthood and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 12. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where hands are laid on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into an Aaronic priesthood for young men 12 and up and a Melchizedek priesthood for men 18 and up.

===Programs and auxiliary organizations===

Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: Relief Society (a women's organization),The Relief Society was founded in 1842 in Nauvoo, Illinois, and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in more than 165 countries. [tpl]Citation|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society[/tpl]. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society. the Young Men and Young Women organizations (for adolescents ages 12 to 18), Primary (an organization for children up to age 12), and Sunday School (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). Women serve as presidents and counselors in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents and counselors of the Young Men and Sunday School.[tpl]cite web|title=How the Church Is Organized|url=http://www.lds.org/church/organization/how-the-church-is-organized?lang=eng|work=lds.org|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=May 21, 2012[/tpl] The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as LDS Humanitarian Services. Many of these auxiliaries and programs are coordinated by the Priesthood Correlation Program, which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.
The church operates a Church Educational System which includes Brigham Young University (BYU) (and its associated Jerusalem Center), BYU–Idaho, BYU–Hawaii, and LDS Business College. The church also operates Institutes of Religion and an LDS Student Association near the campuses of many colleges and universities. For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year Seminary program, which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education. The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the Perpetual Education Fund, which provides educational opportunities to students from developing nations.
The church's welfare system, initiated during the Great Depression, provides aid to the poor. It is financed by fast offerings: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of forgoing two meals on monthly Fast Sundays. Money from the program is used to operate Bishop's storehouses, which package and store food at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local bishops. The church also distributes money through its LDS Philanthropies division to disaster victims worldwide.
Other church programs and departments include LDS Family Services, which provides assistance with adoption, marital and family counseling, psychotherapy, and addiction counseling; the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large family history efforts, including the world's largest family history library and organization (FamilySearch).[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |title=AAG International Research |author=AAG International Research |publisher=AAG |accessdate=October 31, 2009 [/tpl] The church is also a major sponsor of Scouting programs for boys, particularly in the United States, where it provides more members of the Boy Scouts of America than any other church.[tpl]Citation|title=Boy Scouts of America Membership Report – 2007 |date=January 7, 2008 |url=http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=P.R.A.Y. |accessdate=May 22, 2008[/tpl]

===Finances===

Although the church has not released church-wide financial statements since 1959, in 1997, Time magazine called it one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita.Biema, David Van. Kingdom Come. Time Magazine, Vol. 150 No. 5, August 4, 1997 (estimating the church's value at over $30 billion). In a June 2011 cover story, Newsweek stated that the LDS Church "resembles a sanctified multinational corporation—the General Electric of American religion, with global ambitions and an estimated net worth of $30 billion."Mormons Rock! by Walter Kirn, Newsweek, June 5, 2011.

Based upon audits performed, the Church Auditing Department is of the opinion that, in all material respects, contributions received, expenditures made, and assets of the church for the year 2006 have been recorded and administered in accordance with appropriate accounting practices, approved budgets, and church policies and procedures.[/tpl]
The church receives significant funds from tithes and fast offerings. According to the church, tithing and fast offering moneys collected are devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and not used in for-profit ventures.
The church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as Bonneville International, Deseret Book Company, and cattle ranches in Utah, Florida, Nebraska, Canada and other locations.Winter, Caroline (July 18, 2012). "How the Mormons Make Money". Bloomberg Businessweek

==Culture==

Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the LDS Church. It is primarily concentrated in the Intermountain West, but as membership of the church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and illegal drugs. As a result of the Word of Wisdom, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS tends to  be reflected.Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author= Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2010[/tpl]
Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Media and arts===

The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include cinema, fiction, websites, and graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called Deseret Book, which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including The Work and the Glory and The Other Side of Heaven have found acceptance both within and outside the church; BYU TV, the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces six pageants annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its Easter pageant Jesus the Christ has been identified as the "largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world."[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 | title = Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant |work=East Valley Tribune |date=March 24, 2007 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths | accessdate =November 30, 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
 No question the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is "having a moment" ... The Twilight vampire novels of Mormon Stephenie Meyer sell tens of millions of copies, Mormon convert Glenn Beck inspires daily devotion and outrage with his radio show, and HBO generated lots of attention with the Big Love finale. Even Broadway has gotten in on the act, giving us The Book of Mormon, a big-budget musical about Mormon missionaries by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and Avenue Q writer Robert Lopez that, with 14 nominations, is expected to clean up at the (2011) Tony Awards on June 12.| Newsweek magazine, June 2011 

===Home and family===

In 1995, the church's First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve issued "The Family: A Proclamation to the World", which stresses the importance of the family. The proclamation states that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." The document further says that "gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose," that the father and mother have differing but equal roles in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation |title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher=LDS Church |year=1995[/tpl] This document is widely cited by LDS members as a statement of principle.Douglas E. Brinley, Together forever: Gospel perspectives for marriage and family p. 48 ISBN 1-57008-540-4.
The adult women (members of the church's Relief Society) in a congregation meet at least quarterly for additional instruction and service. The meetings may consist of a service project, conferences, or of various classes being offered.
After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith writes, "in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience .... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best."Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton, Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers, p. 261 (Oxford University Press 2005).

===Social events and gatherings===

In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's Young Men and Young Women organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on Duty to God, Scouting, or Personal Progress. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve meetinghouses at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.

===Political involvement===

The LDS Church will take no partisan role in politics, stating that it will not "endorse, promote or oppose political parties, candidates or platforms; allow its church buildings, membership lists or other resources to be used for partisan political purposes; attempt to direct its members as to which candidate or party they should give their votes to ... or attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality|title=Church Reemphasizes Political Neutrality|date=December 6, 2007|publisher=LDS Newsroom|accessdate=February 6, 2012[/tpl] While the church takes an apolitical approach to the candidates themselves, it encourages its members to play a role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections, and it actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 Pew Center on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the Republican Party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl] Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|title=Liberal Mormons: A Minority Within a Minority|date=October 30, 2012|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=November 13, 2012[/tpl] Referring to the 2012 U.S Republican Presidential Primary, Michael Otterson, the LDS Church's managing director for public affairs stated, "We now have two Latter-day Saints running, and the potential for misunderstanding or missteps is therefore twice what it was before."[tpl]cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=Mormons Duck Political Duel|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 3, 2011|pages=A1, A6|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904772304576470442390289196.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_5&mg=reno-wsj[/tpl] However, the official church stance on staying out of politics does not include what church leaders deem to be moral issues. It has previously opposed same-sex marriage in California Prop 8, supported a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination against homosexual persons in housing and employment,[tpl]citation |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/us/12utah.html |title= Mormon Support of Gay Rights Statute Draws Praise |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 11 November 2009 |first= Kirk |last= Johnson [/tpl][tpl]citation |url= http://newsroom.lds.org/article/statement-given-to-salt-lake-city-council-on-nondiscrimination-ordinances |title= Statement Given to Salt Lake City Council on Nondiscrimination Ordinances |date= 1 January 2009 |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church [/tpl] opposed gambling, and supported the Utah Compact.
In United States politics, there were 15 members of the church serving in the 112th United States Congress, including the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid,Sarah Jane Weaver, "15 Mormons serving in U.S. Congress"  Church News, January 8, 2011. and one member serving as a state governor (Gary Herbert, Utah). Church member Mitt Romney was the Republican Party's nominee in the U.S. 2012 presidential election and was defeated by incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama. Jon Huntsman, Jr. also sought the Republican nomination until his withdrawal in early 2012.Mormon Mission: Mitt Romney, Jon Huntsman Challenged by Stereotypes video report & article by Lauren Vance, ABC News, June 25, 2011.

==Humanitarian services==

The LDS Church is widely known for its worldwide humanitarian services.[tpl]cite web|title=The Mormons: Humanitarian Programs|url=http://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/humanitarian.html|work=American Experience website|publisher=PBS|accessdate=18 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Riley|first=Naomi Schaefer|title=A Welfare System That Works|url= http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/a_welfare_system_that_works |journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2012|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable[/tpl] The church's welfare and humanitarian efforts are coordinated by LDS Philanthropies (LDSP), a church department under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric. Welfare efforts, originally initiated during the Great Depression, provide aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. LDSP is also responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the Church History Library, the Church Educational System—which includes Brigham Young University, the Perpetual Education Fund, and the Polynesian Cultural Center—the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and efforts dedicated to providing funds for LDS missionaries and temple construction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/ |title=LDS Philanthropies: Helping Change and Save Lives |publisher=LDS Philanthropies[/tpl][tpl]nonspecific|date=March 2014[/tpl] Donations are also used to operate bishop's storehouses, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local bishops. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a specified form. Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's welfare program. The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are typically run by senior-aged missionaries as store managers.[tpl]cite web |url=https://apps.lds.org/welfareoperations/overview.jsf?operation=bishops.storehouses |title=Overview of Bishops’ Storehouses |publisher=LDS Church[/tpl]
The church also distributes money through its Humanitarian Services division to natural disaster victims worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/annual-report-highlights-church-emergency-relief |title=Annual Report Highlights Church Emergency Relief |date=March 9, 2011 |publisher=LDS Newsroom[/tpl] The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for worldwide shipment to disaster victims, works to establish a global sense of self-reliance, and offers service opportunities to both church members and non-members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, one million hygiene kits, and one million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lds.org/service/humanitarian/center?lang=eng |title=Humanitarian Center |publisher=LDS Church[/tpl] When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the immediate needs, and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours. Missionaries are then sent to help alleviate other long-term damages by assisting injured persons and reconstructing damaged buildings. The church carries out these efforts without regard to the nationality or religion of the recipients, and 100 percent of the financial contributions donated to the church by members and non-members are used for humanitarian purposes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/topic/humanitarian-services |title=Humanitarian Services |publisher=LDS Newsroom[/tpl]

==Controversy and criticism==

The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and sometimes discrimination since its early years in New York and Pennsylvania. In the late 1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.
In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a banking failure in Kirtland, Ohio, and the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the 1838 Mormon War. In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on the church's theocratic aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of plural marriage and other doctrines taught by Smith appeared in the Nauvoo Expositor, which led to a series of events culminating in Smith's murder in 1844.
As the church began openly practicing plural marriage under Brigham Young during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nation-wide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under significant media criticism after the Mountain Meadows massacre in southern Utah.
Academic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include Jerald and Sandra Tanner and Fawn Brodie. Evangelical Christians continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or delusional. Mormon apologetics organizations, such as the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR) and the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon, and much of it features criticism of the perceived lack of honesty when it comes to the scholarship of non-Mormon critics. Scholars and authors such as Hugh Nibley, Daniel C. Peterson, Jeff Lindsay, Orson Scott Card, and James E. Talmage are well-known apologists within the church.
In recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.[ref]
