As a publication of the U.S. Government, prepared by an agency of the U.S. Government, it appears to be mostly available as a public domain resource, but a few items are derived from copyrighted sources: where this is the case, there is an attribution to the source.
This standard was superseded in 2001 by American National Standard T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary 2000, which is published by  ATIS.  The old standard is still frequently used, because the new standard is not in the public domain.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
A newer proposed standard is the 'ATIS Telecom Glossary 2011', ATIS-0100523.2011.
