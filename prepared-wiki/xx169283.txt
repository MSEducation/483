[[Europe Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Wisconsin, Geography of Door County, Wisconsin

Europe Lake, is a lake near Gills Rock in Door County, Wisconsin. It is the northeastern most lake in Wisconsin. The lake is mainly a shallow lowland marsh, similar to nearby Kangaroo Lake. It is suspected that the lake was once part of Lake Michigan until a drop in Lake Michigan's water levels closed off the bay and made it a lake.
