The White-billed Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) is a resident breeding bird species in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert.
This common weaver occurs in open country, especially cultivation and scrub. It is a communal breeder, building massive untidy stick nests in tree colonies, each of which may have several spherical woven nests within. Two to four eggs are laid.
The White-billed Buffalo Weaver is large and stocky, commonly measuring 23 to 24 centimeters[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]. The adult is mainly black with white flecking on the back and wings. The conical bill is very thick, and appears more so because it is surmounted by a white frontal shield. The bill is white in breeding males.
The adult female and non-breeding male are similar, but the bill is black. Young birds are dark brown in plumage.
The White-billed Buffalo Weaver is a gregarious species which feeds on grain and insects. This is a noisy bird, especially in colonies, with a range of cackles and squeaks.
