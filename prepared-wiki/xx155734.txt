==Biography==

He won the bronze medal in the individual dressage with his horse Maggie.
He was the twin brother of Bror von Blixen-Finecke, a famed professional hunter in Africa, and was thus brother-in-law of writer Karen Blixen, who was also their second cousin.  Hans's son, Hans von Blixen-Finecke, Jr., won two gold medals at the 1952 Summer Olympics in the three-day event.
