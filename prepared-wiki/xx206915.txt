The Olivetti Envision (400/P75) was an Italian multimedia personal computer produced in 1995. It came with a choice of 2 processors: one based on the Intel 486 DX4 100mhz processor and one based on the Intel Pentium P75 processor. It had an infrared keyboard and an internal modem, and it was compatible with audio CDs, CD-ROMs, Photo CDs and Video CDs.[tpl]cite news |title=On the sofa with your favourite program |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/on-the-sofa-with-your-favourite-program-1579008.html|work=The Independent |date=23 October 1995 |accessdate=2010-12-24 [/tpl] It came with preinstalled programs that would allow it work as a fax, an answering machine when connected to the telephone line.[tpl]cite web | url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/settembre/08/Olivetti_rilancia_sui_computer_co_0_95090810333.shtml | title=Olivetti rilancia sui computer | language=Italian | publisher=Corriere della Sera, Rcs Quotidiani S.p.A. | accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl] It had three possible operating modes: simple mode (limited to the use of an infrared remote control to control the volume and the reproduction of photo, video or audio CDs); intermediate mode (with a simplified Windows shell replacement called Olipilot that gave access to a limited set of programs); advanced (the standard Windows 95 graphical user interface).
The declared goal for this device was to convince non-computer-savvy people that computers are not impossibly hard to use and can be bought and used like normal home appliances. For this reason, it was intentionally designed to resemble a videocassette recorder more than a computer and it was equipped with two SCART sockets (to connect it to a TV set), a TV-like remote control and a slot that would host a satellite decoder card.[tpl]cite web | url=http://issuu.com/adpware/docs/mc157 | title=MC Microcomputer, issue 157 | language=Italian | publisher=Technimedia | accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]
The Olivetti Envision was discontinued in 1996 due to poor sales, caused by its excessive price, many software bugs and limited expandability.[tpl]cite web | url=http://faberp.tripod.com/Envision.htm | title=The Strange (and Rare) Videogame Pics Page | publisher=Fabrizio Pedrazzini | accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]
