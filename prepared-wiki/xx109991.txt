==Background==

The tracks feature samples from each of the group's major '80s albums. However, they run in reverse chronological order, starting with songs from the band's 1988 masterwork Daydream Nation, and ending with a track from their eponymous first album from 1982. The release of this compilation coincided with the release of a music video collection of the same name, featuring all of Sonic Youth's music videos from the 1980s.
