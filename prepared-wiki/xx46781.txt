 Top''': The gene is essentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the repressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and making lactase. 
Bottom: The gene is turned on. Lactose is inhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter, and express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will digest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.]]
An operon is made up of 4 basic DNA components:
Not always included within the operon, but important in its function is a regulatory gene, a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins. The regulatory gene does not need to be in, adjacent to, or even near the operon.[tpl]cite web|last=Mayer|first=Gene|title=BACTERIOLOGY – CHAPTER   NINE    GENETIC REGULATORY MECHANISMS|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/geneticreg.htm|work=Microbiology and Immunology Online|publisher=University of South Carolina School of Medicine|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]

==Regulation==

Control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions. Operon regulation can be either negative or positive by induction or repression.
Negative control involves the binding of a repressor to the operator to prevent transcription.
Operons can also be positively controlled. With positive control, an activator protein stimulates transcription by binding to DNA (usually at a site other than the operator).

==The lac operon==

The lac operon of the model bacterium Escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. This is an example of the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.

==The trp operon==

Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in E. coli was the first repressible operon to be discovered.  While the lac operon can be activated by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan).  This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase.  It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator.  In the lac operon, lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription.  Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation.[tpl]cite book |author=Cummings MS, Klug WS |title=Concepts of genetics |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2006 |pages=394–402 |isbn=0-13-191833-8 |edition=8th[/tpl] This is an example of the corepressible model.

==Predicting the number and organization of operons==

The number and organization of operons has been studied most critically in E. coli. As a result, predictions can be made based on an organism's genomic sequence.
One prediction method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames as a primary predictor of the number of operons in the genome. The separation merely changes the frame and guarantees that the read through is efficient. Longer stretches exist where operons start and stop, often up to 40–50 bases.[tpl]cite pmid|10823905[/tpl]
An alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes.[tpl]cite pmid|11222772[/tpl]
Operon prediction is even more accurate if the functional class of the molecules is considered. Bacteria have clustered their reading frames into units, sequestered by co-involvement in protein complexes, common pathways, or shared substrates and transporters. Thus, accurate prediction would involve all of these data, a difficult task indeed.
Pascale Cossart's laboratory was the first to experimentally identify all operons of a microorganism, Listeria monocytogenes.  The 517 polycistronic operons are listed in a 2009 study describing the global changes in transcription that occur in L. monocytogenes under different conditions.[tpl]cite pmid| 19448609[/tpl]
