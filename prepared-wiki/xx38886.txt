[[Bank holiday]]

CATEGORIES: Public holidays in the United Kingdom, British culture, Irish culture, Holidays

A bank holiday is a public holiday in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries, other European countries such as Switzerland, and a colloquialism for a public holiday in Ireland. There is no automatic right to time off on these days, although banks close and the majority of the working population is granted time off work or extra pay for working on these days, depending on their contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741 |title=Bank holidays and British Summer Time : Directgov - Government, citizens and rights |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110515020958/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741| archivedate= 15 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The first official bank holidays were the four days named in the Bank Holidays Act 1871, but today the term is colloquially (albeit incorrectly) used for public holidays which are not officially bank holidays, for example Good Friday and Christmas Day.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays |title=UK bank holidays - GOV.UK |publisher=gov.uk |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl]

==History==

Prior to 1834, the Bank of England observed about 33 saints' days and religious festivals as holidays, but in 1834 this was reduced to four: 1 May (May Day), 1 November (All Saints Day), Good Friday, and Christmas Day. In 1871, the first legislation relating to bank holidays was passed when Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871, which specified the days in the table below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130603185926/http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/bankholidays.pdf|title=Bank Holiday Fact File|last=Anon|date=22 May 2007|work=TUC press release|publisher=TUC|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] Under the Act, no person was compelled to make any payment or to do any act upon a bank holiday which he would not be compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday.[tpl]EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bank Holidays |volume=3[/tpl] The English people were so thankful that some called the first Bank Holidays St Lubbock's Days for a while.Olmert, Michael (1996).

Scotland was treated separately because of its separate traditions: for example, New Year is a more important holiday there.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The Act did not specify Good Friday and Christmas Day as bank holidays in England, Wales, or Ireland because they were already recognised as common law holidays: they had been customary holidays since before records began.
In 1903, the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act added 17 March, Saint Patrick's Day, as a bank holiday for Ireland only.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/bills/bank-holidays-ireland-bill|title=Bank Holidays (Ireland) Bill|accessdate=26 March 2010|publisher=UK Parliament|work=Hansard, the Official Report of debates in Parliament| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100224034545/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/bills/bank-holidays-ireland-bill| archivedate= 24 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] New Year's Day did not become a bank holiday in England until 1 January 1974.

===Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971===

Commencing in 1965, on an experimental basis, the August Bank Holiday weekend was observed at the end of August "to give a lead in extending British holidays over a longer summer period".[tpl]cite web|title=Bank Holiday On The Last Monday In August|date=5 Mar 1964|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|accessdate=21 June 2013|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=cam_earl&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS202466917&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0[/tpl] Each year's date was announced in Parliament on an ad-hoc basis, to the despair of the calendar and diary publishing trade.[tpl]cite web|title=1969 Dilemma on Diary Dates|date=27 Jan 1967|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|accessdate=21 June 2013|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=cam_earl&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS152398907&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0[/tpl] The rule seems to have been to select the weekend of the last Saturday in August, so that in 1968[tpl]cite web|title=Bank Holiday Dates For 1967 And 1968|date=4 June 1965|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|accessdate=21 June 2013|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=cam_earl&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS202991812&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0[/tpl] and 1969[tpl]cite web|title=1969 Bank Holidays|date=22 Mar 1967|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|accessdate=21 June 2013|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=cam_earl&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS52128886&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0[/tpl] Bank Holiday Monday actually fell in September.
A century after the 1871 Act, the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which currently regulates bank holidays in the UK, was passed.[tpl]citation | last1=Ready | first1=Nigel P. | year=2002 | title=Brooke's notary | last2=Brooke | first2=Richard | edition=12 | publisher=Sweet & Maxwell | isbn=978-0-421-67280-2  | page=479 [/tpl] The majority of the current bank holidays were specified in the 1971 Act, but New Year's Day and May Day were introduced after 1971.[tpl]citation | last1=Scrope | first1=Henry | year=2008 | title=Employment Law Handbook | last2=Barnett | first2=Daniel | edition=4 | publisher=Henry Scrope | isbn=978-1-85328-674-2  | page=135 [/tpl] The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August, and the Whitsun bank holiday (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late Spring Bank Holiday, fixed as the last Monday in May.[tpl]citation | last1=McWhirter | first1=Norris | year=1980 | title=The Guinness book of answers: a handbook of general knowledge | last2=Stowe | first2=Moira F. | edition=3 | publisher=Guinness Superlatives | isbn=978-0-85112-202-1  | page=7 [/tpl] In 1978 the first Monday in May in the UK, and the final Monday of May in Scotland, were designated as bank holidays.[tpl]cite web|last=Morrow|first=Thomas|title=Bank Holidays a history|url=http://www.ukbankholidays2012.com/bankholidaysinfo.html|work=Bank Holidays a history by Thomas Morrow|accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl]
In January 2007, the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007 was given royal assent, making 30 November (or the nearest Monday if a weekend) a bank holiday in Scotland.[tpl]citation | author=Great Britain Parliament House of Lords European Union Committee | year=2007 | title=Modernising European Union labour law: has the UK anything to gain?, report with evidence, 22nd report of session 2006-07 | publisher=The Stationery Office | isbn=978-0-10-485171-5  | page=100 [/tpl]

===Royal proclamation===

Under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, bank holidays are proclaimed each year by the legal device of a royal proclamation. Royal proclamation is also used to move bank holidays that would otherwise fall on a weekend. In this way, public holidays are not 'lost' in years when they coincide with weekends. These deferred bank holiday days are termed a 'bank holiday in lieu' of the typical anniversary date. In the legislation they are known as 'substitute days'. The movement of the St Andrew's Day Scottish holiday to the nearest Monday when 30 November is a weekend day is statutory and does not require a proclamation.

===In Scotland===

A number of differences apply in Scotland relative to the rest of the United Kingdom. For example, Easter Monday is not a bank holiday. Also, although they share the same name, the Summer Bank Holiday falls on the first Monday of August in Scotland, as opposed to the last Monday in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Bank holidays do not, however, assume the same importance in Scotland as they do elsewhere. Whereas they have effectively become public holidays elsewhere in the United Kingdom, in Scotland there remains a tradition of public holidays based on local tradition and determined by local authorities (for example, the Glasgow Fair and the Dundee Fortnight). In 1996, Scottish banks made the business decision to harmonise their own holidays with the rest of the United Kingdom, with the result that 'bank holidays' in Scotland are neither public holidays nor the days on which banks are closed.

===Campaigns for extra bank holidays===

The number of holidays in the UK is relatively small compared to many other European countries. However, direct comparison is inaccurate since the 'substitute day' scheme of deferment does not apply in most European countries, where holidays that coincide with a weekend (29% of fixed-date holidays) are 'lost'. In fact, the average number of non-weekend holidays in such countries is only marginally higher (and in some cases lower) than the UK. Worth mentioning is that public holidays in Europe which fall on Thursday or Tuesday typically become "puente" or "bridge" four-day or even six-day extended holiday weekends as people tend to use one or two days from their holiday entitlement to take off Monday and/or Friday.
There have been calls for more bank holidays.Union leaders are campaigning for an extra bank holiday BBC News 27 October 2004 Among the most notable dates absent from the existing list are the feast days of patron saints; 23 April (St George's Day and the birthday of William Shakespeare) in England and 1 March (St David's Day) in Wales are not currently recognised. 17 March (St Patrick's Day) is a public holiday in Northern Ireland and, since 2008, 30 November (St Andrew's Day) is a bank holiday in Scotland. St Piran's Day (patron saint of Cornwall) on 5 March is already given as an unofficial day off to many government and other workers in the county, and there are renewed calls for the government to recognise this as an official bank holiday there.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7925480.stm | work=BBC News | title=Renewed call for St Piran holiday | date=5 March 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5850736.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Cornwall workers given an unofficial day off for St Pirans Day | first=Ruth | last=Gledhill | date=5 March 2009 | accessdate=31 March 2010[/tpl]

===Proposed move of May Day Bank Holiday (England and Wales)===

After the election of the Coalition Government in May 2010, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport launched a pre-consultation in 2011 which included the suggestion of moving the May Bank Holiday to October, to be a "UK Day" or "Trafalgar Day" (21 October) or to St David's Day and St George's Day.http://www.culture.gov.uk/consultations/8068.aspx
It is suggested that a move from the May bank holiday to a St Piran's Day bank holiday in Cornwall, on 5 March, would benefit the Cornish economy by £20-35 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Cornish-national-holiday-worth-pound-35m/story-13929647-detail/story.html|work=Western Morning News|title=Cornish National Holiday worth £35m|date=23 November 2011[/tpl]

===1968 Emergency Bank Holiday===

During the sterling crisis of 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson convened a meeting of the privy council in the early hours of 14 March to declare 15 March a non-statutory bank holiday. This allowed the UK government to close the London gold market in order to stem the losses being suffered by Sterling.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/book-review--statesman-who-bottled-out-tired-and-emotional-the-life-of-lord-george-brown--peter-paterson-chatto-20-pounds-2321916.html|work=The Independent|title=Statesman who bottled out: 'Tired and Emotional: The Life of Lord George Brown'|date=9 May 1993[/tpl] It was this meeting that triggered the resignation of Foreign Secretary George Brown.
