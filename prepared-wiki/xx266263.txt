From the 2007 NRL season onwards the National Rugby League decided to introduce Monday Night Football (MNF). The kick off time for these games was scheduled to be 7pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time). The NRL also decided to play the last MNF game of a season on a Sunday night rather than on a Monday night.
