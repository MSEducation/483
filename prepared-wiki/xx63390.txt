In addition, major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes (p.&nbsp;154): "Though tens of thousands of Rorschach tests have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time (of a previous review), and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized, the vast majority of these relationships ''have never been validated empirically'', despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test."<ref>

A 2003 report by Wood and colleagues had more mixed views:  "More than 50 years of research have confirmed Lee J.

"Its value as a measure of thought disorder in schizophrenia research is well accepted. It is also used regularly in research on dependency, and, less often, in studies on hostility and anxiety.  Furthermore, substantial evidence justifies the use of the Rorschach as a clinical measure of intelligence and thought disorder."[ref]

===Test materials===

The basic premise of the test is that objective meaning can be extracted from responses to blots of ink which are supposedly meaningless. Supporters of the Rorschach inkblot test believe that the subject's response to an ambiguous and meaningless stimulus can provide insight into their thought processes, but it is not clear how this occurs. Also, recent research shows that the blots are not entirely meaningless, and that a patient typically responds to meaningful as well as ambiguous aspects of the blots. Reber (1985) describes the blots as merely ".. the vehicle for the interaction .." between client and therapist, concluding: ".. the usefulness of the Rorschach will depend upon the sensitivity, empathy and insightfulness of the tester totally independently of the Rorschach itself. An intense dialogue about the wallpaper or the rug would do as well provided that both parties believe."[tpl]Cite book|isbn=978-0-14-051079-9|page=653|author=Arthur S. Reber|year=1985|publisher=Penguin Books|title=Penguin Dictionary of Psychology[/tpl]

===Illusory and invisible correlations===

In the 1960s, research by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman showed that at least some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion.[tpl]Harvnb |Sutherland|2007|pp=117–120[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=164–166[/tpl] At that time, the five signs most often interpreted as diagnostic of homosexuality were 1) buttocks and anuses; 2) feminine clothing; 3) male or female sex organs; 4) human figures without male or female features; and 5) human figures with both male and female features.[tpl]Harvnb |Hardman|2009|p=57[/tpl] The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality. At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology, and the Rorschach was the most popular projective test. The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men.[tpl]Harvnb |Fine|2006|pp=66–70[/tpl] Despite these beliefs, analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were just as likely to report these signs, which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality. The five signs did, however, match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality.
The Chapmans investigated the source of the testers' false confidence. In one experiment, students read through a stack of cards, each with a Rorschach blot, a sign and a pair of "conditions" (which might include homosexuality). The information on the cards was fictional, although subjects were told it came from case studies of real patients. The students reported that the five invalid signs were associated with homosexuality, even though the cards had been constructed so there was no association at all. The Chapmans repeated this experiment with another set of cards, in which the association was negative; the five signs were never reported by homosexuals. The students still reported seeing a strong positive correlation. These experiments showed that the testers' prejudices could result in them "seeing" non-existent relationships in the data. The Chapmans called this phenomenon "illusory correlation" and it has since been demonstrated in many other contexts.
A related phenomenon called "invisible correlation" applies when people fail to see a strong association between two events because it does not match their expectations. This was also found in clinicians' interpretations of the Rorschach. Homosexual men are more likely to see a monster on Card IV or a part-animal, part-human figure in Card V. Almost all of the experienced clinicians in the Chapmans' survey missed these valid signs.[tpl]Cite book |editor1-last=Kahneman |editor1-first=Daniel |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos |editor3-last=Tversky |year=1982 |title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-28414-7|chapter=Test results are what you think they are|first1=Loren J. |last1=Chapman |first2=Jean |last2=Chapman|pages=238–248| ref=harv |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] The Chapmans ran an experiment with fake Rorschach responses in which these valid signs were always associated with homosexuality. The subjects missed these perfect associations and instead reported that invalid signs, such as buttocks or feminine clothing, were better indicators.
In 1992, the psychologist Stuart Sutherland argued that these artificial experiments are easier than the real-world use of the Rorschach, and hence they probably underestimated the errors that testers were susceptible to. He described the continuing popularity of the Rorschach after the Chapmans' research as a "glaring example of irrationality among psychologists".

===Tester projection===

Some critics argue that the testing psychologist must also project onto the patterns. A possible example sometimes attributed to the psychologist's subjective judgement is that responses are coded (among many other things), for "Form Quality": in essence, whether the subject's response fits with how the blot actually looks. Superficially this might be considered a subjective judgment, depending on how the examiner has internalized the categories involved. But with the Exner system of scoring, much of the subjectivity is eliminated or reduced by use of frequency tables that indicate how often a particular response is given by the population in general. Another example is that the response "bra" was considered a "sex" response by male psychologists, but a "clothing" response by females.[tpl]harvnb|Wood|2003[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In Exner's system, however, such a response is always coded as "clothing" unless there is a clear sexual reference in the response.
Third parties could be used to avoid this problem, but the Rorschach's inter-rater reliability has been questioned. That is, in some studies the scores obtained by two independent scorers do not match with great consistency.[tpl]harvnb|Wood|2003|pp=227–234[/tpl]
This conclusion was challenged in studies using large samples reported in 2002.[tpl]cite journal | author = Meyer G. J., Hilsenroth M. J., Baxter D., Exner J. E., Fowler J. C., Piers C. C., Resnick J. | year = 2002 | title = An examination of interrater reliability for scoring the Rorschach comprehensive system in eight data sets | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 219–274 | doi = 10.1207/S15327752JPA7802_03 | pmid = 12067192 [/tpl]

===Validity===

When interpreted as a projective test, results are poorly verifiable. The Exner system of scoring (also known as the "Comprehensive System") is meant to address this, and has all but displaced many earlier (and less consistent) scoring systems. It makes heavy use of what factor (shading, color, outline, etc.) of the inkblot leads to each of the tested person's comments. Disagreements about test validity remain: while the Exner proposed a rigorous scoring system, latitude remained in the actual interpretation, and the clinician's write-up of the test record is still partly subjective.[tpl]harvnb|Goldman|2000|p=159[/tpl]
Reber (1985) comments ".. there is essentially no evidence whatsoever that the test has even a shred of validity."
Nevertheless, there is substantial research indicating the utility of the measure for a few scores. Several scores correlate well with general intelligence. Interestingly, one such scale is R, the total number of responses; this reveals the questionable side-effect that more intelligent people tend to be elevated on many pathology scales, since many scales do not correct for high R: if a subject gives twice as many responses overall, it is more likely that some of these will seem "pathological". Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity, Complexity, Form Quality, and Human Figure responses.[tpl]harvnb|Wood|2003|loc=Table 9.4[/tpl]
The same source reports that validity has also been shown for detecting such conditions as schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders; thought disorders; and personality disorders (including borderline personality disorder). There is some evidence that the Deviant Verbalizations scale relates to bipolar disorder. The authors conclude that "Otherwise, the Comprehensive System doesn't appear to bear a consistent relationship to psychological disorders or symptoms, personality characteristics, potential for violence, or such health problems as cancer".[tpl]harvnb|Wood|2003|pp=249–250[/tpl]
(Cancer is mentioned because a small minority of Rorschach enthusiasts have claimed the test can predict cancer.)[tpl]cite journal | author = Graves P.L., Thomas C.B., Mead L.A. | year = 1991 | title = The Rorschach Interaction Scale as a potential predictor of cancer | url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/reprint/48/8/549.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 549–563 | pmid = 3809367 [/tpl]

===Reliability===

It is also thought that the test's reliability can depend substantially on details of the testing procedure, such as where the tester and subject are seated, any introductory words, verbal and nonverbal responses to subjects' questions or comments, and how responses are recorded. Exner has published detailed instructions, but Wood et al. cites many court cases where these had not been followed. Similarly, the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time-consuming leaving them very subject to the author's style and the publisher to the quality of the instructions (such as was noted with one of Bohm's textbooks in the 1950s(1958) Journal of personality assessment Volumes 22–23; Page 462) as well as clinic workers (which would include examiners) being encouraged to cut corners.Lowrey, Lawson Gentry (1946) American journal of orthopsychiatry, Volume 16 American Orthopsychiatric Association pg 732Buros, Oscar Krisen (1975) Personality tests and reviews: including an index to The mental measurements yearbooks, Volume 1. Gryphon Press, pg Page 411
United States courts have challenged the Rorschach as well. Jones v Apfel (1997) stated (quoting from Attorney's Textbook of Medicine) that Rorschach "results do not meet the requirements of standardization, reliability, or validity of clinical diagnostic tests, and interpretation thus is often controversial".Gacono, Carl B., F. Barton Evans (2007) "The Handbook of Forensic Rorschach Assessment" pg 83  In State ex rel H.H. (1999) where under cross examination Dr. Bogacki stated under oath "many psychologists do not believe much in the validity or effectiveness of the Rorschach test" and US v Battle (2001) ruled that the Rorschach "does not have an objective scoring system."

===Population norms===

Another controversial aspect of the test is its statistical norms. Exner's system was thought to possess normative scores for various populations. But, beginning in the mid-1990s others began to try to replicate or update these norms and failed.  In particular, discrepancies seemed to focus on indices measuring narcissism, disordered thinking, and discomfort in close relationships.[tpl]Cite journal| author= Lillenfeld, S.O., Wood, J.M., Garb, H.N.| title=The scientific status of projective techniques, Psychological Science in the Public Interest v. 1, pp. 27–66, 2000| ref= harv[/tpl]
Lillenfeld and colleagues, who are critical of the Rorschach, have stated that this proves that the Rorschach tends to "overpathologise normals". Although Rorschach proponents, such as Hibbard,[tpl]Cite journal| author= Hibbard, S. | title=A Critique of Lilienfeld et al.'s (2000) The Scientific status of Projective Techniques, Journal of Personality Assessment v. 80, pp. 260–271, 2003| ref= harv[/tpl] suggest that high rates of pathology detected by the Rorschach accurately reflect increasing psychopathology in society, the Rorschach also identifies half of all test-takers as possessing "distorted thinking",Rorschach Test: Discredited But Still Controversial. July 31, 2009 a false positive rate unexplained by current research.
The accusation of "over-pathologising" has also been considered by Meyer et al. (2007). They presented an international collaborative study of 4704 Rorschach protocols, obtained in 21 different samples, across 17 different countries, with only 2% showing significant elevations on the index of perceptual and thinking disorder, 12% elevated on indices of depression and hyper-vigilance and  13% elevated on persistent stress overload—all in line with expected frequencies among nonpatient populations.[tpl]Cite journal| author= Meyer, G.J., Erdberg, P., & Shaffer, T.W. | title=Toward international normative reference data for the Comprehensive System, Journal of Personality Assessment v. 89(S1), S201–S206, 2007| ref= harv[/tpl]

===Applications===

The test is also controversial because of its common use in court-ordered evaluations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]  This controversy stems, in part, from the limitations of the Rorschach, with no additional data, in making official diagnoses from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).American Psychiatric Association. (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). Washington, DC.
Irving B. Weiner (co-developer with John Exner of the Comprehensive system) has stated that the Rorschach "is a measure of personality functioning, and it provides information concerning aspects of personality structure and dynamics that make people the kind of people they are. Sometimes such information about personality characteristics is helpful in arriving at a differential diagnosis, if the alternative diagnoses being considered have been well conceptualized with respect to specific or defining personality characteristics".[tpl]Cite book|last=Weiner|first=Irving B.|authorlink=Irving B. Weiner|title=What the Rorschach Can do for you: Incremental validity in clinical applications. Assessment 6|year=1999|pages=327–338[/tpl]
In the vast majority of cases, anyway, the Rorschach test wasn't singled out but used as one of several in a battery of tests, and despite the criticism of usage of the Rorschach in the courts, out of 8,000 cases in which forensic psychologists used Rorschach-based testimony, the appropriateness of the instrument was challenged only six times, and the testimony was ruled inadmissible in only one of those cases. One study has found that use of the test in courts has increased by three times in the decade between 1996 and 2005, compared to the previous fifty years.  Others however have found that its usage by forensic psychologists has decreased.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Garb HN, Wood JM, Lilienfeld SO, Nezworski MT |title=Roots of the Rorschach controversy |journal=Clin Psychol Rev|volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–118 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15596082 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.09.002 |url=|ref=harv[/tpl]

===Protection of test items and ethics===

Psychologists object to the publication of psychological test material out of concerns that a patient's test responses will be influenced ("primed") by previous exposure. The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that, "Publishing the questions and answers to any psychological test compromises its usefulness" and calls for "keeping psychological tests out of the public domain."[tpl]Cite web| url= http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/advocacy/2009%20CPA%20Psychological%20test%20statement%20.pdf|title= Canadian Psychological Association Position on Publication and Dissemination of Psychological Tests |publisher=  Canadian Psychological Association | date=August 4, 2009|quote=Publishing the questions and answers to any psychological test compromises its usefulness.|accessdate=2010-07-08| format=PDF[/tpl] The same statement quotes their president as saying, "The CPA's concern is not with the publication of the cards and responses to the Rorschach test per se, for which there is some controversy in the psychological literature and disagreement among experts, but with the larger issue of the publication and dissemination of psychological test content".
From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test images have been in the public domain for many years in most countries, particularly those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris. They have been in the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.eucopyright.org/copyright-durations-worldwide/|title=Copyright Durations Worldwide – EU Copyright|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|accessdate=2009-08-26[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=https://www.ige.ch/en/copyright/copyrights.html|title=Copyrights – Terms of Protection|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|accessdate=2009-08-26[/tpl] They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/276688|title=Rorschach Personality Test: Did Wikipedia Leak a ‘Cheat Sheet’|author=Carol Forsloff|date=30 July 2009|work=Digital Journal[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/technology/internet/29inkblot.html|title=Has Wikipedia Created a Rorschach Cheat Sheet?

It claims that its goals include "the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work", and it requires that psychologists "make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and security of test materials". The APA has also raised concerns that the dissemination of test materials might impose "very concrete harm to the general public".

Controversy ensued in the psychological community in 2009 when the original Rorschach plates and research results on interpretations were published in the "Rorschach test" article on Wikipedia. Hogrefe & Huber Publishing, a German company that sells editions of the plates, called the publication "unbelievably reckless and even cynical of Wikipedia" and said it was investigating the possibility of legal action.
