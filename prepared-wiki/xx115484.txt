Thianella is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only species, T. disjuncta, occurs only on Java.
The male of the species was assumed to be close to Thiania by Roewer (1954), but his placements of salticids is often questionable. No drawings exist.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 273
