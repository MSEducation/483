==Overview==

Most of the population lives in an urbanized belt between the coast of Køge Bay and the E47 motorway, developed in the 1970s. The northern part of the belt is Solrød Stand; this is the site of the municipal council. The southern part is Jersie Strand.
The coastal belt is connected by S-train to central Copenhagen to the north, and to the city of Køge to the south, with stations at Solrød Strand and Jersie Strand.
Further inland lies fertile farmland, dotted with the old villages of Karlstrup, Solrød, Jersie, Kirke Skensved, and Gammel Havdrup. The town of Havdrup has a station on the Lille Syd railway between Roskilde and Køge.
Neighboring municipalities are Greve to the north, Roskilde to the west, and Køge to the south.  To the east is Køge Bay (Køge Bugt).
There are popular beaches along the Køge Bay coast, and the municipality is a popular summer house area.  The area attracts both local day visitors and summer vacationers who are interested in boating, beaches and sunshine.
