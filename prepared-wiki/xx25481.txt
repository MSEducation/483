Sin City is the title for a series of neo-noir comics by Frank Miller. The first story originally appeared in "Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special" (April, 1991), and continued in Dark Horse Presents #51–62 from May 1991 to June 1992, under the title of Sin City, serialized in thirteen parts.  Several other stories of variable lengths have followed. The intertwining stories, with frequently recurring characters, take place in Basin City.
A movie adaptation of Sin City, co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, was released on April 1, 2005.  A sequel was confirmed by Miller in 2011. Miller has stated that the film will be based primarily on Miller's original story A Dame to Kill For, and two new stories. However it will be an open storyline so that characters that appeared in the previous film could return.

==Setting==

Basin City, almost universally referred to by the nickname Sin City, is a fictional town in the American west.  The climate is hot and arid, although Sacred Oaks is characterized as being heavily wooded.  A major river runs through the city, which has an extensive waterfront.  Usually twice a year, a major downpour comes, and the city is prone to heavy snowfall in the winter.  In the comics, Basin City has a surreal, Pan-American feel.  Desert lizards and palm trees are common, while tar pits, desert areas, mountain ranges and flat farmland make up the landscape around the city.
The Basin City Police are more or less along the lines of paramilitary or SWAT, as they have to deal with incredibly high crime rates among criminals and civilians alike, which is why they have access to what most would consider "heavy weaponry" and full body armor.  Those who make up the force have been described as commonly being lazy, cowardly and/or corrupt.  Only a handful of the cops are honest, though frequently the wealthy of the city bribe the corrupt members of the police into performing their duty (usually as a result of some crime being committed (or threatened)  against a member of their family).
During the California Gold Rush, the Roark family "imported" a large number of attractive women to keep the miners happy, making a fortune and turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city.  Over the years, as the Roark family migrated into other areas of business and power, these women ended up forming the district of Old Town, the prostitute quarter of the city where they rule with absolute authority.  In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit.
As the various yarns progress, the audience gradually becomes familiar with key locations in and around Basin City.

===Organizations===

Because a large majority of the residents of Basin City are criminals, there are several organizations and cartels central to the stories who are vying for monopoly over the various criminal enterprises in the city.  Listed below are crime syndicates, gangs and other low-lifes who figure heavily in the Sin City mythos.
Other groups that have been seen or mentioned in the comics include:

===Chronology===

While The Hard Goodbye was the first story written, the first section of That Yellow Bastard is the first story chronologically.  The Dwight-related stories fall in between these, with the short stories fleshing out the time between the main stories.  Here is a rough chronology of the "Yarns":
The short stories Rats, The Customer is Always Right and Daddy's Little Girl do not contain any of the series' regular characters, are not connected to the other stories, or do not give an idea of when the stories occur. Silent Night takes place sometime before The Hard Goodbye during the winter, as Marv is still quite alive and seen lumbering through one of Basin City's rare snow-storms.  Robert Rodriguez stated that The Customer is Always Right occurs in between "That Yellow Bastard" and "The Hard Goodbye" on the Sin City: Recut and Extended DVD Edition.
Hell and Back does not fit into any particular time period. Manute is seen, alive with his false eye, suggesting that the events take place between A Dame to Kill For and The Big Fat Kill however, it is established that Hell and Back takes place over several cool nights in September; The Big Fat Kill took place on a hot summer night during a thunderstorm. (Potential reconciliation: Hell and Back AND The Big Fat Kill take place before September 21st, if Miller is using any date before that as still, technically, "the summer".)

==Awards==

Sin City: The Big Fat Kill won the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Limited Series for 1996.  Sin City: Family Values won the 1997 Eisner Awards.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

==Style==

Sin City is famous for its artwork, which draws heavily from film noir, including its use of shadow and stark backgrounds. Black and white are the sole colors most of the time with exception of red, yellow, blue, and pink in some stories. Partial color usage is designed to draw attention to a certain character in the story.
The writing style also draws heavily on detective and crime pulp fiction.  Strange metaphors and similes are often used.  This gives the narration a very "pulpy" feel.
Miller's Sin City work challenges some conventions of comic book form. The letters of onomatopoeic words like "blam" are often incorporated into scenes via lighting effects, or are suggested by the negative space between panels, or are created by the outline of the panels themselves. This is especially evident in early "yarns," such as The Hard Goodbye, although later installments of the series became less experimental.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arnott|first=Luke|title=BLAM!
