[[Maxwell (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: Units of magnetic flux, Centimetre–gram–second system of units, James Clerk Maxwell

The maxwell, abbreviated as Mx, is the compound derived CGS unit of magnetic flux. The unit was previously called a line. The unit name honours James Clerk Maxwell, who presented the unified theory of electromagnetism, and was established by the IEC in 1930.
In a magnetic field of strength one gauss, one maxwell is the total flux across a surface of one square centimetre perpendicular to the field.
