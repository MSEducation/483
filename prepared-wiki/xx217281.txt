===Inspection and modification of source code===

Vendors typically distribute proprietary software in compiled form, usually the machine language understood by the computer's central processing unit. They typically retain the source code, or human-readable version of the software, written in a higher level programming language.[ref]
</ref> This scheme is often referred to as closed source.<ref name="dwheeler">

By withholding source code, the software producer prevents the user from understanding how the software works and from changing how it works.[ref]
