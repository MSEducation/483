The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is an intergovernmental organization with a membership of 191 Member States and Territories. It originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873. Established in 1950, WMO became the specialised agency of the United Nations for meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and is a member of the United Nations Development Group.[tpl]cite web|title=UNDG Members|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13|publisher=United Nations Development Group|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl] The current Secretary-General is Michel Jarraud.[tpl]cite web|title=Secretary-General|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/sec/jarraud_en.html|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl] The current president is David Grimes.[tpl]cite web|title=President|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/governance/president/president_en.html|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]

==The organization==

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations. It is the UN system's authoritative voice on the state and behavior of the Earth's atmosphere, its interaction with the oceans, the climate it produces and the resulting distribution of water resources.WMO in Brief – World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Wmo.int (1 January 2013). Retrieved on 22 August 2013.
WMO has a membership of 191 member states and territories, as of February 2014. The Convention of the World Meteorological Organization was signed 11 October 1947Convention of the World Meteorological Organization. and established upon ratification in 1950. WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations in 1951 for meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873.

==Activities==

WMO provides a framework for international cooperation in the development of meteorology and operational hydrology and their practical application.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/|title=WMO in Brief – World Meteorological Organization (WMO)|author=PWMU|publisher=wmo.int|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl]
Since its establishment, WMO has played a unique and powerful role in contributing to the safety and welfare of humanity. Under WMO leadership and within the framework of WMO programs,WMO.int National Meteorological and Hydrological ServicesWMO.int contribute substantially to the protection of life and property against natural disasters, to safeguarding the environment and to enhancing the economic and social well-being of all sectors of society in areas such as food security, water resources and transport.
The WMO and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) jointly created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is also directly responsible for the creation of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW). The IPCC has received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."[tpl]cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/press.html|title=IPCC Nobel Peace Prize|date=12 October 2007|publisher=Nobel Prize Committee|accessdate=20 February 2010[/tpl]
WMO promotes cooperation in the establishment of networks for making meteorological, climatological, hydrological and geophysical observations, as well as the exchange, processing and standardization of related data, and assists technology transfer, training and research. It also fosters collaboration between the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of its Members and furthers the application of meteorology to public weather services, agriculture, aviation, shipping, the environment, water issues and the mitigation of the impacts of natural disasters.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
WMO facilitates the free and unrestricted exchange of data and information, products and services in real- or near-real time on matters relating to safety and security of society, economic welfare and the protection of the environment. It contributes to policy formulation in these areas at national and international levels.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
In the specific case of weather-, climate and water-related hazards, which account for nearly 90% of all natural disasters, WMO's programs provide vital information for the advance warnings that save lives and reduce damage to property and the environment. WMO also contributes to reducing the impacts of human-induced disasters, such as those associated with chemical and nuclear accidents, forest fire and volcanic ash. Studies have shown that, apart from the incalculable benefit to human well-being, every dollar invested in meteorological and hydrological services produces an economic return many times greater, often ten times or more.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
WMO plays a leading role in international efforts to monitor and protect the environment through its programs. In collaboration with other UN agencies and the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, WMO supports the implementation of a number of environmental conventionsWMO.int and is instrumental in providing advice and assessments to governments on related matters. These activities contribute towards ensuring the sustainable development and well-being of nations.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
WMO publishes the International Cloud Atlas, the international standard cloud atlas since 1896.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Meteorological codes===

In keeping with its mandate to promote the standardization of meteorological observations, the WMO maintains numerous code forms for the representation and exchange of meteorological, oceanographical, and hydrological data. The traditional code forms, such as SYNOP, CLIMAT and TEMP, are character-based and their coding is position-based. Newer WMO code forms are designed for portability, extensibility and universality. These are BUFR, CREX, and, for gridded geo-positioned data, GRIB.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

==WMO conference on climate prediction and information for decision-making==

World Climate Conference-3 (WCC-3) was held from 31 August to 4 September 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland, under the auspices of WMO. Its goal was to address advancements in seasonal to multi-decadal climate predictions and to spur their applications to decision-making in socio-economic sectors, including food, water, energy, health, tourism and development sectors. The Conference aimed to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and broader UN climate goals through support for climate adaptation.WCC-3
