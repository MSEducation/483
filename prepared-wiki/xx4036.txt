Houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of Buffalo Bayou (now known as Allen's Landing)[tpl]Handbook of Texas | author=Kleiner, D.J | name=Allen's Landing | id=AA/hvabg| retrieved=2007-06-10|date=2005-02-03[/tpl] and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city was named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had commanded and won at the Battle of San Jacinto [tpl]convert|25|mi|km[/tpl] east of where the city was established. The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-twentieth century, Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, where the Mission Control Center is located.Texas Medical Center.

Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters.Fortune 500 2010: Cities Accessed May 25, 2011 The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.[tpl]cite web | title = 2010 Port Industry Statistics, American Association of Port Authorities | url = http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/Statistics/2010%20U%2ES%2E%20PORT%20RANKINGS%20BY%20CARGO%20TONNAGE.pdf[/tpl] The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community.

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased [tpl]convert|6642|acre|km2[/tpl] of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city.[tpl]cite news|title=Brief history of Houston|last=Coutinho|first=Juliana|url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/13/news/news-index.html|work=The Daily Cougar|date=2000-09-13|accessdate=2007-02-06[/tpl] The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836.
Houston was granted incorporation on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor.Houston, Texas. Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved on 2007-01-10.

By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston.[tpl]cite book|last=Cotham|first=Edward T.|title=Sabine Pass: The Confederacy's Thermopylae|year=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-70594-8[/tpl] After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.
In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated.J.H.W. Stele to Sayers, September 11–12, 1900. Texas State Library & Archives Commission, Retrieved on August 31, 2007 The following year, oil discovered at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry.[tpl]cite book|title=Oil in Texas: The Gusher Age, 1895–1945|last=Olien|first=Diana Davids|coauthors=Olien, Roger M.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=0-292-76056-6[/tpl] In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910 the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African-Americans formed a large part of the city's population, numbering 23,929 people, or nearly one-third of the residents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.houstonhistory.com/decades/history5h.htm|title=Marvin Hurley, 1910–1920, Houston History|accessdate=2008-04-06[/tpl]
President Woodrow Wilson opened the deep-water Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. By 1930, Houston had become Texas' most populous city and Harris the most populous county.[ref]

When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products during the war.[ref]
