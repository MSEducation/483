On 2 September 2007, Miranda scored the only goal for St. Mirren in a match against Celtic but scored an own goal as the club was defeated 5–1 heavily. The next game could have been more worse for Miranda when he was sent off for second bookable offense in a 2–0 loss against Dundee United. But after a fine season with the Buddies, his loan spell was extended by a further season in June 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/st_mirren/7466401.stm|title=New Saints loan deal for Miranda|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 June 2008 | date=20 June 2008[/tpl] Miranda would score twice against Hamilton and Rangers respectively.
