[[Joint Mathematics Meetings]]

CATEGORIES: American Mathematical Society, Mathematics conferences

The Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) are a mathematics conference hosted annually in early January by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Frequently, several other national mathematics organizations also participate. The meeting is the largest gathering of mathematicians in the United States, with several thousand talks, panels, minicourses, and poster sessions each year.
The JMM also hosts an Employment Center which is a focal point for the hiring process of academic mathematicians, especially for liberal arts colleges. Many employers conduct their preliminary interview process at the meeting.  Often these interviews take place outside the confines of the conference, so the employers may not appear on the official Employment Center listing.
