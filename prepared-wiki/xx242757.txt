==History==

In 1912, the Ministry of Basic Industries was created after the establishment of the Provisional Government of the ROC. The ministry was in charge for agriculture, forestry, industry and commerce in China. After the Beiyang Government was established in the same year, the ministry was divided into two office, one is to oversee the agriculture and forestry, and the other is to oversee the industry and commerce. In 1914, the two offices reemerged to become the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.  In 1925, the Ministry of Basic Industries was installed but renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery. In 1930, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery and Ministry of Industry and Commerce were combined to formed the Ministry of Basic Industries. In 1938, the ministry was changed to Ministry of Economic Affairs with the Department of Agriculture and Forestry was placed under it. In 1940, the department was expanded to become Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1941, the ministry was changed to Agriculture and Forestry Administration. In 1949, the Department of Agriculture was created under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in which it was later renamed to Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In November 1981, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry was upgraded to Agriculture Bureau of the MOEA. 
On the other hand, there was the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR) established in Nanking in 1948. After the Chinese civil war, the JCRR moved to Taiwan.
