==Lyrics==

Dimebag Darrell has said that this song "Is about a lifetime of dealing with people that you can't tell what they're really comin' at you for, or what their motives really are. You've got to drag the waters to get to the bottom and find out the truth."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.officialpantera.com | last = Kaye | first = Don | title = Pantera: A Vulgar Display of Metal | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2008-01-16 | publisher = Warner Music Group[/tpl] 
'"Drag the Waters" is a warning to the listener to always question other peoples' motives. In fact, the music video starts off with a warning by an unknown male voice that says 'In everyday life, there is more than meets the eye. To reach the depths of truth, we must drag the waters'.

==Release and reception==

The song was the band's first single released for The Great Southern Trendkill album. It was the only song from the album to have a video made for it.
