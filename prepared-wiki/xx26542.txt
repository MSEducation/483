</ref> "Rainbow" has connotations that recall [[hippies]], [[New Age]] movements, and organizations like [[Jesse Jackson]]'s [[Rainbow/PUSH|Rainbow/PUSH Coalition]] in the United States.
The portrayal of an all-encompassing "LGBT community" or "LGB community" is also disliked by some lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.[ref]
</ref><ref name="The Political Edge">
[/ref] Some do not subscribe to or approve of the political and social solidarity, and visibility and human rights campaigning that normally goes with it including gay pride marches and events. Some of them believe that grouping together people with non-heterosexual orientations perpetuates the myth that being gay/lesbian/bi makes a person deficiently different from other people. These people are often less visible compared to more mainstream gay or LGBT activists. Since this faction is difficult to distinguish from the heterosexual majority, it is common for people to assume all LGBT people support LGBT liberation and the visibility of LGBT people in society, including the right to live one's life in a different way from the majority. In the 1996 book Anti-Gay, a collection of essays edited by Mark Simpson, the concept of a 'one-size-fits-all' identity based on LGBT stereotypes is criticized for suppressing the individuality of LGBT people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/anti_gay.html |title=Anti-Gay |publisher=Marksimpson.com |accessdate=2011-10-23[/tpl][tpl]clear[/tpl]
