CATEGORIES: 2011 elections in Switzerland, Swiss Federal Council elections

An election for all seven members of the Federal Council, the government of Switzerland, was held on 14 December 2011, following the federal election on 23 October 2011.http://www.angelfire.com/ma/maxcrc/elections.html Micheline Calmy-Rey announced she will not run for re-election to the council. According to a traditional informal convention, the successor has to come from the French-speaking or Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. The candidates for her post announced by their respective cantonal sections are Alain Berset (Fribourg), Pierre-Yves Maillard (Vaud), Stéphane Rossini (Valais), and Marina Carobbio (Ticino).http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/das_sp-kandidatenquartett_steht_1.13176587.html
Berset and Maillard were favourites. Jean Studer, Liliane Maury Pasquier and Elisabeth Baume-Schneider declined to stand in the election.http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/neuenburger_regierungsrat_studer_will_calmy-rey_nicht_beerben_1.13126006.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/das_sp-kandidatenquartett_steht_1.13176587.html In the end, the SP decided to nominate Berset and Maillard.http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/selbstbewusste_genossen_1.13421470.html
Apart from Calmy-Rey's successor, the controversial aspects of the election included, whether the SVP would hold their seat or gain another, which they had lost after one of their incumbents defected to the BDP; and whether the CVP or the FDP would gain the second seat held by the FDP, which both lay claim to.
The SVP's possible candidates are Heinz Tännler (Zug), Bruno Zuppiger (Zürich), Jakob Stark (Thurgau), Guy Parmelin (Vaud) and Hannes Germann (Schaffhausen). Jean-François Rime (Fribourg) was unofficially nominated, as well.http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/bruno_zuppiger_praesentiert_sich_als_kandidat_zur_wiederherstellung_der_konkordanz_1.13446045.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/bundesratswahlen_guy_parmelin_1.13348513.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/ein_konsenspolitiker_steigt_fuer_die_svp_in_den_ring_1.13414856.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/auch_in_der_welschen_svp_heissts_hie_freiburg_hie_waadt_1.13448442.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/bundesratswahlen_zuppiger_und_taennler_1.13460622.htmlhttp://www.suedostschweiz.ch/politik/sechs-svp-politiker-mochten-auf-das-bundesrats-ticket Rime and Zuppiger were nominated as the SVP's candidates; after a scandal involving Zuppiger's professional activities emerged very shortly after the nomination meeting, Hansjörg Walter (Thurgau) was nominated in his stead.http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/schweiz_svp_zuppiger_bruno_kandidat_bundesrat_weltwoche_artikel_1.13561941.htmlhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/der_lueckenbuesser_1.13567355.html
