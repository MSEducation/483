[[Fuamnach]]

CATEGORIES: Irish mythology

Fúamnach, or Fuamnach, is Midir's first wife and a witch of the Tuatha Dé Danann in the medieval Irish text Tochmarc Étaíne ("The Wooing of Étaín"). The text describes her as being intelligent (gáeth), cunning (trebar) and "versed in the knowledge and power of the Túatha Dé Danand", explaining that her fosterfather had been the wizard druid Bresal Etarlám.Gantz, Early Irish Myths and Sagas. pp. 44-5. Óengus warns Midir that she is "a woman of dreadful sorcery, a woman of all the knowledge and skill and power of her people." p. 44. She is said to be of the progeny (clann) of Béothach son of Iardanél, who is probably identical with Béothach son of Iarbonel, the father of the Túatha Dé Danann in the Lebor Gabála Érenn.

==Summary==

When Midir fell in love with Étaín and married her, Fúamnach got so jealous that she cast several spells on her as soon as the couple arrived in Midir's residence in Brí Léith: 
Fúamnach did not live long to see the fruits of her work. When Mac Óc met Midir at Brí Léith, he discovered what deceptive scheme had led him there. Mac Óc followed Fúamnach's trail to the house of her fosterfather Bresal and there struck off her head, which he carried as a trophy back to the Brug.

==Name==

The name Fúamnach may be an adjective noun derived from fúaimm "noise, sound".Dictionary of the Irish Language. To cite one example, the dindsenchas poem on Nás speaks of fáidiud find-gel fúamnach Fáil ("the lamentation of the fair-skinned vocal women of Fáil").E.J. Gwynn (ed. and tr. ), The Metrical Dindsenchas. Vol. 3. 48-53. The form fúaimnech is also attested as a personal name for Fúaimnech, daughter of Conn Cétchathach, who appears in the legal tract Mellbretha.CIH 1589.1-48 and 1338.5-1341.7, tr. William Sayers, "Games, Sport and Para-Military Exercise in Early Ireland." Aethlon: The Journal of Sport Literature 10 (1992): 105-23.
