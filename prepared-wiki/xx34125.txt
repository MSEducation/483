The Broads Authority is the agency which has statutory responsibility for the Broads in England. Originally, the Nature Conservancy Council (now Natural England), pressed for a special authority to manage the Broads which had been neglected for a long time. In 1978, the forerunner to the present-day Broads Authority was established by the Countryside Commission (now also Natural England). Ten years later, it had become clear that a statutory body was needed, and a special Act of Parliament, The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (referred to as the Broads Act) made the Broads Authority into a Special Statutory Authority which gave it parity with national park authorities.

The Broads Authority was formerly represented by one member on the East of England Regional Assembly, now defunct.
