==Background==

"Koero! Rakuten Eagles" was the fourth official cheer song of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. In the past few years, Hello! Project had annually issued official fight songs for the team. In the 2008 season, it was Cute who were chosen to record a new song. The lively upbeat number contained a powerful message, inspiring players.
