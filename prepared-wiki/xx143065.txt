He began his professional career at Manchester United in 1993 as an 18-year-old, but played just two competitive games for the club before signing for Everton in January 1998. His most recent appearance for United was more than two years earlier on 19 August 1995, when he came on as a substitute against Aston Villa on the opening day of the 1995–96 Premier League season.
O'Kane was a member of United's FA Youth Cup winning side in the 1991–92 season. On the introduction of squad numbers in the FA Premier League for the 1993–94 season, he was issued with the number 30 shirt, and then with the number 24 shirt from the start of the 1996–97 season.
He finally exited Old Trafford in the 1997–98 season, more than two years after his last appearance, when Howard Kendall signed him for Everton. He had more chance of first team football at Goodison Park, but still only managed 14 games in three years, during which time he was loaned out twice. 
He joined Bolton Wanderers in November 1999, along with Everton team mate Gareth Farrelly and after both made the move to the Reebok Stadium permanent they helped Wanderers back to the Premier League, via the Play Offs.
He made his final senior appearance at the age of 28 for Blackpool in the 2002–03 Division Two campaign before signing for non-league Hyde United, where he remained until retiring completely in 2006.
