Cycloguanil is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor,[tpl]cite journal |author=Srivastava IK, Vaidya AB |title=A mechanism for the synergistic antimalarial action of atovaquone and proguanil |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1334â€“9 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10348748 |pmc=89274 |doi= |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10348748[/tpl] and is a metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of proguanil.[tpl]cite pmid|6385887[/tpl]  However, more recent work has indicated that, while proguanil is synergistic with the drug atovaquone (as in the combination Malarone), cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic to the effects of atovaquone, suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, proguanil may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.[tpl]cite pmid|15228254[/tpl]
Although cycloguanil is not currently in general use as an antimalarial, the continuing development of resistance to current antimalarial drugs has led to renewed interest in studying the use of cycloguanil in combination with other drugs.[tpl]cite pmid|8363372[/tpl]
