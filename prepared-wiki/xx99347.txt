They called it 'ereng balam' or 'egree belum', meaning 'home of the eagle hawk'.[tpl]cite web |work=Place Names Online |publisher=Government of South Australia Land Services Group |title=Other information |url=http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/pno/other.phtml?recno=SA0025397 |accessdate=2006-10-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930203301/http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/pno/other.phtml?recno=SA0025397  |archivedate = 2007-09-30[/tpl]

==Geography==

Mt Gambier's urban area is located mainly along the northern slopes and plain of a maar volcano of the same name, Mount Gambier.  Comprising several craters, it is part of the Newer Volcanics Province complex of volcanoes. One of these contains a huge lake of high-quality artesian drinking water which changes colour with the seasons. In winter, it is a steel grey and then changes to a spectacular cobalt blue in the summer, giving rise to its name, Blue Lake. This 70-metre deep lake also accommodates a range of unusual aquatic flora and fauna, in particular fields of large stromatolites.  There are several other craters in the city including Valley Lake.  The region surrounding the city also includes other volcanic features such as Mount Schank, along with many karst features such as water-filled caves and sinkholes.
The urban area extends outside of the City of Mt Gambier into the District Council of Grant where the following suburbs now exist: Suttontown, Mil Lel and Worrolong to the north of the city, Glenburnie to the east, Compton to the west, and Moorak and OB Flat to the south.[tpl]cite web|title=Council Area Map|url=http://www.dcgrant.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=446|publisher=District Council of Grant|accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl]

==Demographics==

The government in the south-east area of the state, consisting of three local councils, was based around a single administration, many residents of Victoria used to look across the border to Mount Gambier as their centre. Consequently, during the 1970s many elderly locals relocated to Victor Harbor and Moonta, both rural areas but with more resources available to cope with an ageing population. A 1976 study found that less than 10 per cent (around 160 people) of residents aged over 65 had lived in the area for less than 5 years, leading to a lack of specific aged-care facilities.[ref]
