[[Metre]]

CATEGORIES: Metrology, SI base units, Units of length

The metre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or meter (American spelling), (SI unit symbol: m), is the fundamental unit of length (SI dimension symbol: L) in the International System of Units (SI). Originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole (at sea level), its definition has been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology. Since 1983, it has been defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of [tpl]sfrac|299,792,458[/tpl]  of a second."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/17/1/ |title=17th General Conference on Weights and Measures (1983), Resolution 1. |accessdate=2012-09-19[/tpl]

==History==

A  decimal-based unit of length, the universal measure or standard was proposed in an essay of 1668 by the English cleric and philosopher John Wilkins.Wilkins c. 2007  In 1670 Gabriel Mouton, Bishop of Lyon, also suggested a universal length standard with decimal multiples and divisions, to be based on a one minute angle of the Earth's meridian arc or (as the Earth's circumference was not easy to measure) on a pendulum with a one second period. In 1675, the Italian scientist Tito Livio Burattini, in his work Misura Universale, used the phrase [tpl]lang|it|metro cattolico[/tpl] (lit. "catholic universal measure"), derived from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|μέτρον καθολικόν[/tpl] (métron katholikón), to denote the standard unit of length derived from a pendulum.[tpl]cite journal | author = George Sarton | title = The First Explanation of Decimal Fractions and Measures (1585).

The metre was in fact defined as one ten millionth of one quarter of the earth's circumference at sea-level.'

The National Convention adopted the proposal in 1793. The first occurrence of metre in this sense in English dates to 1797.Oxford English Dictionary, Clarendon Press 2nd ed.1989, vol.IX p.697 col.3.

===Meridional definition===

In 1668, Wilkins proposed using Christopher Wren's suggestion of a pendulum  with a half-period of one second to measure a standard length that Christiaan Huygens had observed to be 38 Rijnland inches or [tpl]frac|39|1|4[/tpl] English inches (997[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]mm) in length.Wilkins c. 2007 In the 18th century, there were two favoured approaches to the definition of the standard unit of length. One approach followed Wilkins in defining the metre as the length of a pendulum with a half-period of one second, a 'seconds pendulum'. The other approach suggested defining the metre as one ten-millionth of the length of the Earth's meridian along a quadrant; that is, the distance from the Equator to the North Pole. In 1791, the French Academy of Sciences selected the meridional definition over the pendular definition because the force of gravity varies slightly over the surface of the Earth, which affects the period of a pendulum.
To establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of the metre, more accurate measurements of this meridian would have to be made. The French Academy of Sciences commissioned an expedition led by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain, lasting from 1792 to 1799, which measured the distance between a belfry in Dunkerque and Montjuïc castle in Barcelona to estimate the length of the meridian arc through Dunkerque. This portion of the meridian, assumed to be the same length as the Paris meridian, was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian connecting the North Pole with the Equator.
The exact shape of the Earth is not a simple mathematical shape (sphere or oblate spheroid) at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length. The irregular and particular shape of the Earth (smoothed to sea level) is called a geoid, which means "Earth-shaped". Despite this fact, and based on provisional results from the expedition, France adopted the metre as its official unit of length in 1793. Although it was later determined that the first prototype metre bar was short by a fifth of a millimetre because of miscalculation of the flattening of the Earth, this length became the standard. The circumference of the Earth through the poles is therefore slightly more than forty million metres (40,007,863 m).Humerfelt 2010

===Prototype metre bar===

In the 1870s and in light of modern precision, a series of international conferences was held to devise new metric standards. The Metre Convention (Convention du Mètre) of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France. This new organisation would preserve the new prototype metre and kilogram standards when constructed, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation created a new prototype bar in 1889 at the first General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM: Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures), establishing the International Prototype Metre as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of ninety percent platinum and ten percent iridium, measured at the melting point of ice.[ref]National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter)
[/ref]
The original international prototype of the metre is still kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified in 1889.  A discussion of measurements of a standard metre bar and the errors encountered in making the measurements is found in a NIST document.Beers & Penzes 1992

===Standard wavelength of krypton-86 emission===

In 1893, the standard metre was first measured with an interferometer by Albert A. Michelson, the inventor of the device and an advocate of using some particular wavelength of light as a standard of length. By 1925, interferometry was in regular use at the BIPM. However, the International Prototype Metre remained the standard until 1960, when the eleventh CGPM defined the metre in the new International System of Units (SI) as equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum.[tpl]cite book |last=Marion |first=Jerry B. |title=Physics For Science and Engineering |year=1982 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |isbn=4-8337-0098-0 |page=3[/tpl]

===Speed of light===

To further reduce uncertainty, the 17th CGPM in 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition, thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of the second and the speed of light:
This definition fixed the speed of light in vacuum at exactly 299,792,458 metres per second. An intended by-product of the 17th CGPM's definition was that it enabled scientists to compare their lasers accurately using frequency, resulting in wavelengths with one-fifth the uncertainty involved in the direct comparison of wavelengths, because interferometer errors were eliminated. To further facilitate reproducibility from lab to lab, the 17th CGPM also made the iodine-stabilised helium–neon laser "a recommended radiation" for realising the metre. For the purpose of delineating the metre, the BIPM currently considers the HeNe laser wavelength, [tpl]nowrap|λ[tpl]sub|HeNe[/tpl][/tpl], to be 632.99121258 nm with an estimated relative standard uncertainty (U) of [tpl]val|2.1|e=-11[/tpl].The term "relative standard uncertainty" is explained by NIST on their web site: [tpl]cite web |title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty |work=The NIST Reference on constants, units, and uncertainties: Fundamental physical constants |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html |publisher=NIST |accessdate=19 December 2011[/tpl]National Research Council 2010 This uncertainty is currently one limiting factor in laboratory realisations of the metre, and it is several orders of magnitude poorer than that of the second, based upon the caesium fountain atomic clock ([tpl]nowrap|1=U = [tpl]val|5|e=-16[/tpl][/tpl]).National Institute of Standards and Technology 2011. Consequently, a  realisation of the metre is usually delineated (not defined) today in labs as [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1579800.762042|(33)[/tpl] wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in a vacuum, the error stated being only that of frequency determination.[tpl]cite web |title=Iodine ([tpl]lambda[/tpl]≈633 nm) |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/mep/M-e-P_I2_633.pdf |work=MEP (Mise en Pratique) |year=2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=16 December 2011[/tpl] This bracket notation expressing the error is explained in the article on measurement uncertainty.
Practical realisation of the metre is subject to uncertainties in characterising the medium, to various uncertainties of interferometry, and to uncertainties in measuring the frequency of the source. A commonly used medium is air, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology has set up an online calculator to convert wavelengths in vacuum to wavelengths in air.The formulas used in the calculator and the documentation behind them are found at [tpl]cite web |url=http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp |title=Engineering metrology toolbox: Refractive index of air calculator |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=16 December 2011[/tpl] The choice is offered to use either the modified Edlén equation or the Ciddor equation. The documentation provides a discussion of how to choose between the two possibilities. As described by NIST, in air, the uncertainties in characterising the medium are dominated by errors in measuring temperature and pressure. Errors in the theoretical formulas used are secondary.[tpl]cite web |url=http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp#UncertaintyandRangeofValidity |title=§VI: Uncertainty and range of validity |work=Engineering metrology toolbox: Refractive index of air calculator |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=16 December 2011[/tpl] By implementing a refractive index correction such as this, an approximate realisation of the metre can be implemented in air, for example, using the formulation of the metre as [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1579800.762042|(33)[/tpl] wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in vacuum, and converting the wavelengths in a vacuum to wavelengths in air. Of course, air is only one possible medium to use in a realisation of the metre, and any partial vacuum can be used, or some inert atmosphere like helium gas, provided the appropriate corrections for refractive index are implemented.[tpl]cite book |title=Atomic, molecular, and optical physics: electromagnetic radiation, Volume 29, Part 3 |chapter=Physical limits on accuracy and resolution: setting the scale |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FV4Y39AGYuYC&pg=PA316 |page=316 |first=F. B. |last=Dunning |first2=Randall G. |last2=Hulet |isbn=0-12-475977-7 |publisher=Academic Press |year=1997 |quote=The error by using air can be reduced tenfold if the chamber is filled with an atmosphere of helium rather than air.[/tpl]

====Length measurement in metres====

Although the metre is now defined as the path length travelled by light in a given time, the practical laboratory length measurements in metres are determined by counting the number of wavelengths of laser light of one of the standard types that fit into the length,[tpl]#tag:ref|The BIPM maintains a list of recommended radiations on their web site.[tpl]cite web |title=Recommended values of standard frequencies |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mep.html |publisher=BIPM |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl]National Physical Laboratory 2010[/tpl] and converting the selected unit of wavelength to metres. Three major factors limit the accuracy attainable with laser interferometers for a length measurement:[ref]
A more detailed listing of errors can be found in [tpl]cite web |work=NIST length scale interferometer measurement assurance; NIST document NISTIR 4998 |title=§4 Re-evaluation of measurement errors |first=John S |last=Beers |first2=William B |last2=Penzes |url=http://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/4998.pdf  |format=PDF |accessdate=17 December 2011 |date=December 1992 |pages=9 ff [/tpl]
[/ref]Zagar, 1999, pp. 6–65ff
Of these, the last is peculiar to the interferometer itself. The conversion of a length in wavelengths to a length in metres is based upon the relation:
which converts the unit of wavelength [tpl]lambda[/tpl] to metres using c, the speed of light in a vacuum in m/s. Here n is the refractive index of the medium in which the measurement is made; and f is the measured frequency of the source. Although conversion from wavelengths to metres introduces an additional error in the overall length due to measurement error in determining the refractive index and the frequency, the measurement of frequency is one of the most accurate measurements available.

===Timeline of definition===

==SI prefixed forms of metre==

SI prefixes are often employed to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of the metre, as shown in the table below. As indicated in the table, some are commonly used, while others are not. Long distances are usually expressed in km, astronomical units (149.6 Gm), light-years (10 Pm), or parsecs (31 Pm), rather than in Mm, Gm, Tm, Pm, Em, Zm or Ym; "30 cm", "30 m", and "300 m" are more common than "3 dm", "3 dam", and "3 hm", respectively.
The term micron is often used instead of micrometre, but this practice is officially discouraged.Taylor & Thompson 2003, p. 11.

==Spelling==

Metre is used as the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in all English-speaking nations except the USA, which uses meter.Naughtin 2008
The most recent official brochure, written in 2006, about the International System of Units (SI), Bureau international des poids et mesures, was written in French by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. An English translation (using the spelling: metre) is included to make the SI standard "more widely accessible".BIPM, 2006, p. 130ff.
In 2008, the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology chose to use meter in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual.The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Turner). In 2008, NIST published the US version (Taylor and Thompson, 2008a) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication Le Système international d'unités (SI) (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings "meter", "liter" and "deka" are used rather than "metre", "litre" and "deca" as in the original BIPM English text (Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with Taylor and Thompson (2008b), as the "legal interpretation" of the SI for the United States (Turner).
Measuring devices (such as ammeter, speedometer) are spelt  "-meter" in all countries.[ref]

, s.v. ammeter, meter, parking meter, speedometer.[/ref] The word "meter", signifying any such device, has the same derivation as the word "metre", denoting the unit of length.[ref]

, s.v. meter.[/ref]

==Equivalents in other units==

Within this table, "inch" and "yard" mean "international inch" and "international yard",Astin & Karo 1959. respectively, though approximate conversions in the left-hand column hold for both international and survey units.
One metre is exactly equivalent to [tpl]sfrac|10,000|254[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]inches and to [tpl]sfrac|10,000|9,144[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]yards.
A simple mnemonic aid exists to assist with conversion, as three "3":
The ancient Egyptian cubit was about [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m (surviving rods are 52.3–52.9[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]cm.) Scottish and English definitions of ell (two cubits) were 0.941[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m and 1.143[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m, respectively. The ancient Paris toise (fathom) was slightly shorter than 2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m, and was standardised at exactly 2[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m in the mesures usuelles system, such that 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m was exactly [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]toise. The Russian versta was 1.0668[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]km. The Swedish mil was 10.688[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]km, but was changed to 10[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]km when Sweden converted to metric units.
