In an interview with Univision, Jesse commented "We're happy with how the album turned out, we're very satisfied with it, we've been experimenting for about eighteen months with sounds and everything and now here in the last five months we managed to assemble those parts in Los Angeles and from that came the single 'Adiós'".[tpl]cite web|last=Manjarrez|first=Beatriz|publisher=Univision|title=High-Voltage Pop|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=2075572|language=Spanish|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]
