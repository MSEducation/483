[[Pharmaceutical Management Agency]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand Crown agents, Organisations based in New Zealand, Health in New Zealand

The Pharmaceutical Management Agency or Pharmac is a New Zealand Crown entity that decides, on behalf of District Health Boards, which medicines and related products are subsidised for use in the community and public hospitals.
Pharmac was created in 1993 to ensure that New Zealanders get the best possible health outcomes from the money the Government spends on medicines. Trying to meet the public's growing demand for new medicines within a defined budget is challenging. PHARMAC has made a wider range of subsidised medicines available while staying within an agreed budget each year.
Pharmac has four main roles in New Zealand:
Pharmac's role has been expanded to include all medicines used in DHB hospitals, and in preparation for the national management of medical devices. On 1 July 2012, the management of the national immunisation schedule, and assessment of new vaccines, transferred to Pharmac from the  Ministry of Health.

==Performance and Political Status==

Pharmac has been hailed for its success in controlling New Zealand's expenditure on pharmaceuticals. A British Medical Journal article from 2010 cites Pharmac as the key reason for New Zealand’s low pharmaceutical prices."“How New Zealand has contained expenditure on drugs” BMJ 2010;340:c2441. Published 18 May 2010." http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2441
Pharmac has been a regular point of contention in debates around potential free-trade agreements which could affect its ability to operate, particularly the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership."

Opponents of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership say US corporations are hoping to weaken Pharmac's ability to get inexpensive, generic medicines by forcing New Zealand to pay for brand name drugs.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/US-companies-out-to-get-Pharmac/tabid/1607/articleID/279216/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= US companies 'out to get Pharmac| date=December 5, 2012[/tpl] Doctors and organisations like Medicins Sans Frontieres have also expressed concern.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Doctors-warn-TPP-could-threaten-access-to-medicine/tabid/1607/articleID/279062/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Doctors warn of TPP risks| date=December 5, 2012[/tpl] The New Zealand Government denies the claims, Trade Negotiations Minister Tim Groser saying opponents of the deal are "fools" who are "trying to "wreck this agreement".[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/War-of-words-in-TPP-public-perception-battle/tabid/421/articleID/278907/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= War of words in TPP public perception battle| date=December 3, 2012[/tpl]
