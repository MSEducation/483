Benoît "Benny" Hogue (born October 28, 1966) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey left wing. He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, 35th overall, in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft.
After playing three seasons with the Saint-Jean Castors of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), Hogue joined the Sabres' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, for the 1986–87 season. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Sabres in the 1987–88 season, and remained with the Sabres until early in the 1991–92 season. Three games into the season, he was part of a blockbuster trade between the Sabres and the New York Islanders which involved seven players, including Pierre Turgeon and Pat LaFontaine.
Hogue's time in New York was the most productive of his career, as he scored 105 goals in three-plus seasons with the Islanders before joining the Toronto Maple Leafs. Hogue was a journeyman for the remainder of his career, playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Phoenix Coyotes, Boston Bruins, and three separate stints with the Dallas Stars. He joined the Washington Capitals late in the 2001–02 season and played the final nine games of his NHL career there.
In his NHL career, Hogue appeared in 863 games. He scored 222 goals and added 321 assists and won the Stanley Cup in 1999 with Dallas.
