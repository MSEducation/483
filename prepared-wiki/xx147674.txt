Tom Craft (born November 12, 1953) is the head football coach at Riverside Community College in Riverside, CA, and was the head football coach at San Diego State University (SDSU) from 2002-2005 and at Palomar College in San Marcos, CA from 1983-2000. Craft has also been the associate head coach and offensive coordinator at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, CA.
Under his tenure, SDSU developed a reputation of playing the tough teams well but lacked consistency and never had a winning season. In 2004, SDSU lost to Michigan 24-21, and in 2005, where it pushed Ohio State at home, and lost 24-21 to Texas Christian University. SDSU fired Craft at the end of the 2005 season.[tpl]cite news | title=SDSU fires Craft: Athletic director says program needs more energy, confidence | first=Mick | last=McGrane | publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=December 6, 2005 | accessdate=2012-11-13 | url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051206/news_1s6azfoot.html[/tpl]
Craft is a graduate of Pacific Grove High School, in Pacific Grove, California, and thereafter played quarterback at SDSU.
Craft is considered by many[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] to be the greatest Junior College football coach for building a quarterback dynasty at this level. As head coach at Palomar College, Craft's stint can only be referred to as an "era." After serving as an assistant coach at the school from 1977 to 1982 and with the school openly questioning its commitment to football, he took over head coaching duties in 1983. After a pair of 4-6 seasons, the Comets' fortunes began to improve. By the time Craft left the San Marcos school for the Aztec coordinator's job, Palomar was coming off a three-year stretch of 31-2, had an offense ranked among the nation's top five for five consecutive years and was sporting two national championships. Craft compiled an overall record of 115-56 and three national Junior College football championships at Palomar.
While at Palomar, Craft taught and coached 7 All-American Quarterbacks, which include: Duffy Daughtery, Scott Barrick, Brett Salisbury, Andy Loveland, Tom Luginbill, Greg Cicero, and Andy Goodenough. No other Junior College coach in history has produced so many All-Americans.
