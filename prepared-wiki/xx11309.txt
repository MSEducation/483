In the geographical area of Sápmi, the Sami are a small population. According to some, the estimated total Sami population is about 70,000.According to the Swedish Sami parliament One problem when attempting to count the population of the Sámi is that there are few common criteria of what "being a Sámi" constitutes. In addition, there are several Sámi languages and additional dialects, and there are several areas in Sapmi where few of the Sami speak their native language due to the forced cultural assimilation, but still consider themselves Sami. Other identity markers are kinship (which can be said to, at some level or other, be of high importance for all Sámi), the geographical region of Sápmi where their family came from, and/or protecting or preserving certain aspects of Sami culture.Institut de Sociolingüística Catalana, Retrieved January 4, 2009.
All the Nordic Sámi Parliaments have included as the "core" criterion for registering as a Sámi the identity in itself – one must declare that one truly consider oneself a Sámi. Objective criteria vary, but are generally related to kinship and/or language.
Still, due to the cultural assimilation of the Sami people that had occurred in the four countries over the centuries, population estimates are difficult to measure precisely.Virtual Finland The Saami: An ancient population on the northern edge of Europe. Retrieved January 4, 2009. Retrieved from Internet Archive January 2014. The population has been estimated to be between 80,000 and 135,000[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]Norway.org.uk[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] across the whole Nordic region, including urban areas such as Oslo, Norway, traditionally considered outside Sápmi. The Norwegian state recognizes any Norwegian as Sámi if he or she has one great-grandparent whose home language was Sámi, but there is not, and has never been, any registration of the home language spoken by Norwegian people.
Roughly half of all Sámi live in Norway, but many live in Sweden, with smaller groups living in the far north of Finland and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sámi in Russia were forced by the Soviet authorities to relocate to a collective called Lovozero/Lujávri, in the central part of the Kola Peninsula.

===Division by geography===

Sápmi is traditionally divided into:
It should also be noted that many Sami now live outside Sápmi, in large cities such as Oslo in Norway.

===Division by language===

There are also two extinct Sami languages: Kemi Sami and Akkala Sami.
Note that many Sami do not speak any of the Sami languages any more due to historical assimilation policies, so the number of Sami living in each area is much higher.

===Division by occupation===

A division often used in Northern Sami is based on occupation and the area of living. This division is also used in many historical texts:
Historical texts often divide the Sami into: Forest Sami, Mountain Sami, River Sami, and Eastern Sami.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?sladja=25&vuolitsladja=11&giella1=eng |title=Veli-Pekka Lehtola.

===Division by country===

According to the Swedish Sami Parliament, the Sami population of Norway is 40,000. If all people who speak Sami or have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who speaks or spoke Sami are included, the number reaches 70,000. As of 2005, 12,538 people were registered to vote in the election for the Sami Parliament in Norway.Norwegian Sami parliament web page on registered voters[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] The bulk of the Sami live in Finnmark and Northern Troms, but there are also Sami populations in Southern Troms, Nordland and Trøndelag. Due to recent migration, it has also been claimed that Oslo is the municipality with the largest Sami population. The Sami are in a majority only in the municipalities of Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino, Karasjohka-Karasjok, Porsanger, Deatnu-Tana and Unjargga-Nesseby in Finnmark, and Gáivuotna (Kåfjord) in Northern Troms. This area is also known as the Sami core area. Sami and Norwegian are equal as administrative languages in this area.
According to the Swedish Sami Parliament, the Sami population of Sweden is about 20,000.
According to the Finnish Population Registry Center and the Finnish Sami Parliament, the Sami population living in Finland was 7,371 in 2003.Regional division of Sami people in Finland by age in 2003. Retrieved from Internet Archive 12 January 2014. As of 31 December 2006, only 1776 of them had registered to speak one of the Sami languages as the mother tongue.Finnish Population Registry Center 31.12.2006.
According to the 2002 census, the Sami population of Russia was 1,991.
Since 1926, the number of identified Sami in Russia has gradually increased:

===Sami immigration outside of Sapmi===

There are an estimated 30,000 people living in North America who are either Sami, or descendants of Sami.Baiki: The International Sami Journal http://www.baiki.org/content/about.htm Retrieved February 22, 2008  Most have settled in areas that are known to have Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish immigrants. Some of these concentrated areas are Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Illinois, California, Washington, Utah and Alaska; and throughout Canada, including the Canadian territories of the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and the territory now known as Nunavut.
Descendants of these Sami immigrants typically know little of their heritage, because their ancestors purposely hid their indigenous culture to avoid discrimination from the dominating Scandinavian or Nordic culture. Though some of these Sami are diaspora that moved to North America in order to escape assimilation policies in their home countries, many continued to downplay their Sami culture in an internalization of colonial viewpoints about indigenous peoples and in order for them to try to blend into their respective Nordic cultures.  There were also several Sami families that were brought to North America with herds of reindeer by the U.S. and Canadian governments as part of the "Reindeer Project" designed teach the Inuit about reindeer herding.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Following the Reindeer: an Inuit-Sami Chronology in Alaska |author1=Faith Fjeld |author2= Nathan Muus|year= |publisher=Baiki: The International Sami Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=[/tpl]
Some of these Sami immigrants and descendants of immigrants are members of the Sami Siida of North America.
There are Sami whose history is known, and also ones with histories that are not known.  Back in the 1600s Sweden began the settlement of its New Sweden Colony (now Delaware). This included Sami families rounded up in winter time.  This continued for a number of years and included hundreds of trips between Sweden and America.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
For a variety of reasons some of these Sami relocated to the Chesapeake Bay area and to roughly what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  Later, with the arrival of the Quakers, they relocated to York County, Pennsylvania – just one of the reasons the county has the same township names as Lancaster.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Over time that community expanded and moved West, leaving behind a legacy in a series of towns, townships, villages and small cities typified by having names that include the word "Deer."

==Organization==

Sápmi demonstrates a distinct semi-national identity that transcends the borders between Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. There is no movement for complete autonomy.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Sami Parliaments===

The Sami Parliaments (Sámediggi in Northern Sami, Sämitigge in Inari Sami, [tpl]unicode|Sää´mte´ǧǧ[/tpl] in Skolt Sami) founded in Finland (1973), Norway (1989) and Sweden (1993) are the representative bodies for peoples of Sami heritage. Russia has not recognized the Sami as a minority and, as a result, recognizes no Sami parliament.  There is no single, unified Sami parliament that spans across the Nordic countries. Rather, each of the aforementioned three countries has set up their own separate legislatures for Sami people, even though the three Sami Parliaments often work together on cross-border issues.  In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.

===Norwegian organizations===

The main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the siidas. They cover northern and central Norway.

===Swedish organizations===

The main organisations for Sami representation in Sweden are the siidas. They cover northern and central Sweden.

===Finnish organizations===

In contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a siida (paliskunta in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of EEA countries,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 |title=FINLEX ® - Ajantasainen lainsäädäntö: 14.9.1990/848 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl] i.e., the European Union and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, are allowed to join a paliskunta.

===Russian organizations===

In 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the  Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage - Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no[/tpl]

===Border conflicts===

Sápmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day Sápmi. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern Sápmi but areas that are beyond today's Sápmi that reflect older territories. Today's "borders" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.
Owning land within the borders or being a member of a siida (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with large skepticism and anger amongst the siidas.
Court proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one siida has introduced a sponsorship "Reindeer Godfather" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These "internal conflicts" are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the Sami in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.[tpl]Cite report|title=Draft report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review |year=3–14 May 2010, submitted 14 May 2010 |publisher=UN Human Rights Council Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, Eighth Session, Geneva|location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/SE/A_HRC_WG.6_8_L.10_Sweden.pdf[/tpl]
The question whether the fjeld's territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the Sami population is not answered.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
From an indigenous perspective, people "belong to the land", the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.

==National symbols==

Although the Sami have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of Sápmi, a Sami nation, first gained acceptance among the Sami in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.

===Flag===

[tpl]Main|Sami flag[/tpl]thumb|Sami flag
The Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in Åre, Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist Astrid Båhl from Skibotn, Norway.
The motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem "Paiven parneh" ("Sons of the Sun") by the South Sami Anders Fjellner describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).

===The Sami People's Day===

The Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the first Sami congress was held in 1917 in Trondheim, Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.

==="Song of the Sami People"===

"Sámi soga lávlla" ("Song of the Sami People", lit. "Song of the Sami Family") was originally a poem written by Isak Saba that was published in the newspaper Sagai Muittalægje for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the national anthem of the Sami. Arne Sørli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in Helsinki in 1992. "Sámi soga lávlla" has been translated into all of the Sami languages.

==Religion==

Widespread Shamanism persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century. Most Sami today belong to the state-run  Lutheran churches of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Some Sami in Russia belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, and similarly, some Skolt Sami resettled in Finland are also part of an Eastern Orthodox congregation, with an additional small population in Norway.

===Traditional Sami religion===

Traditional Sami religion was a type of polytheistic paganism. (See Sami deities.) There was some diversity due to the wide area that is Sápmi, allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The old beliefs are closely connected to the land, animism, and the supernatural. Sami spirituality is often characterized by pantheism, a strong emphasis on the importance of personal spirituality and its interconnectivity with one's own daily life, and a deep connection between the natural and spiritual "worlds".[tpl]Cite book|title=An Introduction to Shamanism  |last=DuBois |first=Thomas |date=June 2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-69536-7 |page= |pages=| url=[/tpl] Among other roles, the Sami Shaman, or noaidi, enabled ritual communication with the supernatural[tpl]cite web|title=Sami Shamanism from a diachronic point of view |last=Kasten |first=Erich |year=1989 |publisher=Fullerton |location=Los Angeles |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http:// www.siberian-studies.org[/tpl] through the use of tools such as drums, chants, and sacred objects.[tpl]cite web|title=Sámi Drums – Then and Now |last=Gusto |first=Ken Emerson Jr. |authorlink= |year=, |publisher= University of Texas |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/giella/music/noaidi.htm[/tpl] Some practices within the Old Sami religion included natural sacred sites such as mountains, springs, land formations, as well as man-made ones such as petroglyphs and labyrinths.[tpl]Cite book|title=Sami potatoes: living with reindeer and perestroika |author1=Michael Robinson|author2= Karim-Aly S. Kassam|year=1998 |publisher=Bayeux Arts |location= |page=73 | isbn=9781896209210[/tpl]
Sami religion shared some elements with Norse mythology, possibly from early contacts with trading Vikings (or vice versa). Through a mainly French initiative from Joseph Paul Gaimard as part of his La Recherche Expedition, Lars Levi Læstadius began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in Fragments of Lappish Mythology, since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed Theory of Gods, Theory of Sacrifice, Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic and Sami sagas. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well — such as those in Siberia and North America.

===Missionary efforts===

The term Sami religion usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most Sámi until approximately the 18th century. Christianity was introduced by Roman Catholic missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the Protestant Reformation, and rune drums were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess "witchcraft" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.[tpl]Cite book|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |year=1997 |publisher=Scandinavian journal of history |location= |issn=0346-8755   |page= |pages=| url=[/tpl]
In Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when Thomas von Westen, the "Apostle of the Sami", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people.[tpl]cite web|title=The Decline of the Sámi People’s Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan “Ivvár”|authorlink= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm[/tpl] Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe. Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), álda and sáivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.
In the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century. Today, St. George's chapel in Neiden, Norway (1565), testifies to this effort.

===Laestadius===

Around 1840 Swedish Sami Lutheran pastor and administrator Lars Levi Laestadius initiated among the Sami a puritanical pietist movement emphasizing complete abstinence from alcohol. This movement is still very dominant in Sami-speaking areas. Laestadius was a natural linguist, and he became fluent and preached in Finnish and Northern Sami in addition to his native Southern Sami and Swedish,L. Laestadius,  Fragments of Lappish Mythology , Trans. Börje Vähämäki, Aspasia Books, Beaverton, Ont. Canada. (2002), p.24 (introduction by Juha Pentikäinen). the language he used for scholarly publications.
Two great challenges Laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his Sami parishioners, who had been forced by the Swedish government to convert from their shamanistic religion to Lutheranism, and the misery caused them by alcoholism.  The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons "filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand, ... about a God who cared about the lives of the people" had a profound positive effect on both problems.  One account from a Sami cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sami to learn to read and a "bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness... abuse and the theft of Samis' reindeer diminished, which had a positive influence on the Sami's relationships, finances and family life."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eng.samer.se/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=1208 | title=Lars Levi Laestadius and the Sami | date=August 6, 2006 | accessdate=July 7, 2013[/tpl]

===Neo-shamanism and traditional healing===

Today there are a number of Sami who seek to return to the traditional Pagan values of their ancestors. There are also some Sami who claim to be noaidi and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in New Age arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan prejudice has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Traditional Sámi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. Sámi animism is manifested in the Sámi’s belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional Sámi beliefs include a multitude of spirits. Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of neo-paganism, as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.
A very different religious idea is represented by the numerous "wise men" and "wise women" found throughout the Sami area. They often attempt to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional  elements, such as older Sami teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their  ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.

==Language==

There is no single Sami language, but a group of ten distinct Sami languages. Six of these languages have their own written standards. The Sami languages are relatively closely related, but not mutually intelligible; for instance, speakers of Southern Sami cannot understand Northern Sami. Especially earlier, these distinct languages were referred to as "dialects", but today, this is considered misleading due to the deep differences between the varieties. Most Sami languages are spoken in several countries, because linguistic borders do not correspond to national borders.
All Sami languages are endangered. This is due in part to historic laws prohibiting the use of Sami languages in schools and at home in Sweden and Norway. Sami languages, and Sami song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to Sami instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the Sami into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, Sami children were taken away when aged 1–2 and returned when aged 15–17 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all Sami viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking Sami has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Survivance" in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |year=(Summer/Fall) 2003 |publisher=American Indian Quarterly 27 |location= |isbn= |pages=697–726| url=[/tpl]
The Sami languages belong to the Uralic language family, linguistically related to Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. Due to prolonged contact and import of items foreign to Sami culture from neighboring Scandinavians, there are a number of Germanic loanwords in Sami, particularly for "urban" objects. The majority of the Sami now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of Sami languages among Sami and persons of Sami origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.  Many older Sami still refuse to speak Sami.  In addition, Sami parents still feel alienated from schools and hence do not participate as much as they could in shaping school curricula and policy.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Norway’s Sami Language Act’: Emancipatory Implications for the World’s Aboriginal Peoples. |last=Corson |first=David |year=1995|publisher=Language in Society 24 |location= |isbn= |pages=493–513 | url=[/tpl]
In Norway, the name of the language and the people is often spelled Saami; in Finland, the name of the language is spelled Saame and the name of the people Saamelainen.

==Genetic studies==

Anthropologists have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans. Recent genetic studies have indicated that the two most frequent maternal lineages of the Sámi people are the haplogroups V and U5b, ancient in Europe.  "The Y-chromosomal variety in the Saami is also consistent with their European ancestry. It suggests that the large genetic separation of the Saami from other Europeans is best explained by assuming that the Saami are descendants of a narrow, distinctive subset of Europeans." [tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1181943/?tool=pubmed |title=Kristiina Tambets, Siiri Rootsi, Toomas Kivisild, Hela Help, Piia Serk et al., The Western and Eastern Roots of the Saami—the Story of Genetic "Outliers" Told by Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosomes, American Journal of Human Genetics, vol. 74 (2004), pp. 661–682 |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl] Other haplogroups suggest additional input from other populations at various times. This tallies with archeological evidence suggesting that several different cultural groups made their way to the core area of Sami from 8000 to 6000 BC,Esihistorian vuosiluvut, ajoitukset ja kronologia, Carpelan, in "Ennen, muinoin", SKS, Helsinki 2002 presumably including some of the ancestors of present-day Sami.

===History of scientific research carried out on the Sami===

The genetic makeup of Sami people has been extensively studied for as long as such research has been in existence, although until recent times, the purpose of this research has mostly been at best ethnocentric, at worst discriminatory and defamatory. Ethnographic photography of the Sami began with the invention of the camera in the 19th century.[tpl]Cite news|title=Individual and type: Early ethnographic photography |last=Larsen |first=Peter |authorlink= |year= |publisher=University of Bergen |location=Norway |isbn= |page= 54 | url=[/tpl] This continued on into the 1920s and 1930s, when Sami were photographed naked and anatomically measured by scientists, with the help of the local police — sometimes at gunpoint — to collect data that would justify their own racial theories.Give Us Our Skeletons documentary film.  Paul-Anders Simma, director (1999) Thus, there is a degree of distrust by some in the Sami community towards genetic research.
