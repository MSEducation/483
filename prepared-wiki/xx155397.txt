==Playing career==

In 2004 Atkins made his National Rugby League debut for the New Zealand Warriors. His single game from the interchange bench was against the Sydney Roosters in a brief but impressive debut. 
Atkins came on midway through the second spell and was subsequently smashed in two massive tackles from Roosters enforcer Adrian Morley with his first two touches. The lightweight winger or fullback made the mistake of carting the ball straight up at one of the hardest hitters in the NRL but got straight to his feet on both occasions to his credit. Earning the praise of coach Tony Kemp. "Kids come out of the Bartercard Cup and the one thing I know they have in abundance is courage," Kemp said.
"He has got the courage of a lionheart. I knew he has been one of the toughest kids I have been watching for two years so he obviously relished his opportunity but he left his step on the bench". "He definitely gave the players a lift when he went on,' Kemp said. "They took one look at him - the kid's only 80kgs - and he didn't take a backward step. This is what we are trying to build."[tpl]cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/444724 |title=Kemp pleased with baby Warriors |date=30 August 2004 |work=Television New Zealand |accessdate=2 November 2011[/tpl]
