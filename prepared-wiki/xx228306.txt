==Content==

"Like the Rain" is a country ballad, backed mainly by acoustic guitar and piano, with heavy snare drum accents. The narrator tells of how he "never liked the rain" until he walked through it with his lover. In the chorus, he adds that he "can't believe he never liked the rain", and then elaborates that he is "falling for her now, just like the rain". The album version features the sounds of rain and thunder at the beginning and end. These sound effects were removed from the radio edit.
Black also re-recorded the song, at a slightly slower tempo, for his 2007 compilation The Love Songs.

Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably by saying that the song is a "moody offering with a driving melody and strong lyric." She goes on to say that Black "turns in his reliably potent vocal performance."Billboard, September 14, 1996
