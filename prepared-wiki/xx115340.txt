[[Pselcis]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Pselcis is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species, P. latefasciata, occurs only on the Philippines.
The species was described from a single immature male, which was about 8 mm long. Eugène Simon placed it near Laufeia, although drawings by Proszynski (1987) suggest it is closer to Thiania.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 272

==Name==

The genus name is probably derived from "Pselcis", a Graeco-Roman location in Nubia, today known as Dakkeh.
