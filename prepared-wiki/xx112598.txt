[[1945–46 in English football]]

The 1945–1946 season was the 66th season of competitive football (soccer) in England.

==Overview==

1945–1946 was the first football season since the 1939–1940 season was cut short due to World War II. The FA Cup was the main competition to be played this season along with the Football League North and Football League South. To make up for the lack of quality matches, all FA Cup rounds from round one up to and including the quarter-finals were made two-legged ties (rather than the traditional single matches) with the aggregate score determining who went through to the next round. Derby County eventually won the Cup.
From the next season, a full football programme was restored, including The Football League and international matches.
