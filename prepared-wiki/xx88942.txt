[[Ps (Unix)]]

CATEGORIES: Unix SUS2008 utilities, Unix process and task management-related software

In most Unix-like operating systems, the ps program (short for "process status") displays the currently-running processes.  A related Unix utility named top provides a real-time view of the running processes.
In Windows PowerShell, ps is a predefined command alias for the Get-Process cmdlet which essentially serves the same purpose.

==Examples==

For example:
Users can also utilize the ps command in conjunction with the grep (see the pgrep and pkill commands) command to find information about one process, such as its process id:
and the easier and non-racy version with pgrep:
To see every process running as root in user format:

==Options==

ps has many options. On operating systems that support the SUS and POSIX standards, ps commonly runs with the options -ef, where "-e" selects every process and "-f" chooses the "full" output format. Another common option on these systems is -l, which specifies the "long" output format.
Most systems derived from BSD fail to accept the SUS and POSIX standard options because of historical conflicts
(for example, the "e" or "-e" option will cause the display of environment variables).
On such systems, ps commonly runs with the non-standard options aux, where "a" lists all processes on a terminal, including those of other users, "x" lists all processes without controlling terminals and "u" adds a column for the controlling user for each process. Note that, for maximum compatibility when using this syntax, there is no "-" in front of the "aux". Also you can add 'ww' after aux, like "ps auxww" for complete information about the process including all parameters.
