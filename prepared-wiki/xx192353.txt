"Glory Box" is a single by English trip hop group Portishead, released in 1995. The title song samples "Ike's Rap II" by Isaac Hayes (as does Tricky's "Hell Is Around The Corner" from Maxinquaye, released the same year). The song is a love song, featuring the frequent refrain, "I just want to be a woman.". The main repeating melody of the song is sampled from the 1960s TV series The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.
The music video is set in the 1950s, featuring lead singer Beth Gibbons as a jazz singer at a club while various office workers watch her perform. Sexual tension begins to rise between certain characters, as eventually, all of the workers, as separate couples, attend the club where Beth is performing. Apart from the band members, the entire cast of the video appear in drag.
