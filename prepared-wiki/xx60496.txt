[[Renin–angiotensin system]]

CATEGORIES: Human homeostasis, Cardiovascular physiology, Endocrinology

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and water (fluid) balance.
When blood volume is low, juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys activate their prorenin and secrete renin directly into circulation. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of angiotensinogen released by the liver to angiotensin I.[tpl]cite book|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5|page=493|author=Kumar, Abbas,Fausto, Aster|edition=Eighth|chapter=11[/tpl]  Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme found in the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent vaso-active peptide that causes blood vessels to constrict, resulting in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of sodium and water into the blood. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, which also increases blood pressure.
If the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is abnormally active, blood pressure will be too high. There are many drugs that interrupt different steps in this system to lower blood pressure. These drugs are one of the main ways to control high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, kidney failure, and harmful effects of diabetes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec03/ch022/ch022a.html |title=High Blood Pressure: Heart and Blood Vessel Disorders |work=Merck Manual Home Edition [/tpl]

==Activation==

The system can be activated when there is a loss of blood volume or a drop in blood pressure (such as in hemorrhage or dehydration). This loss of pressure is interpreted by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus. In alternative fashion, a decrease in the filtrate NaCl concentration and/or decreased filtrate flow rate will stimulate the macula densa to signal the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin.

==Cardiovascular effects==

It is believed that angiotensin I may have some minor activity, but angiotensin II is the major bio-active product. Angiotensin II has a variety of effects on the body:
These effects directly act in concert to increase blood pressure and are opposed by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).

==Local renin-angiotensin systems==

Locally expressed renin-angiotensin systems have been found in a number of tissues, including the kidneys, adrenal glands, the heart, vasculature and nervous system, and have a variety of functions, including local cardiovascular regulation, in association or independently of the systemic renin-angiotensin system, as well as non-cardiovascular functions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kobori|first=H.|coauthors=Nangaku, M.; Navar, L.

In the adrenal glands, it is likely involved in the paracrine regulation of aldosterone secretion, in the heart and vasculature, it may be involved in remodeling or vascular tone, and in the brain where it is largely independent of the circulatory RAS, it may be involved in local blood pressure regulation.[tpl]cite journal|last=McKinley|first=MJ|coauthors=Albiston, AL; Allen, AM; Mathai, ML; May, CN; McAllen, RM; Oldfield, BJ; Mendelsohn, FA; Chai, SY|title=The brain renin-angiotensin system: location and physiological roles|journal=The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology|date=June 2003|volume=35|issue=6|pages=901–18|pmid=12676175|doi=10.1016/S1357-2725(02)00306-0[/tpl] In addition, both the central and peripheral nervous systems can use angiotensin for sympathetic neurotransmision.[tpl]cite journal |author=Patil J, Heiniger E, Schaffner T, Mühlemann O, Imboden H |title=Angiotensinergic neurons in sympathetic coeliac ganglia innervating rat and human mesenteric resistance blood vessels |journal=Regul.

Medications aimed at the systemic system may affect the expression of those local systems, beneficially or adversely.

==Fetal renin-angiotensin system==

In the fetus, the renin-angiotensin system is predominantly a sodium-losing system[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl], as angiotensin II has little or no effect on aldosterone levels. Renin levels are high in the fetus, while angiotensin II levels are significantly lower; this is due to the limited pulmonary blood flow, preventing ACE (found predominantly in the pulmonary circulation) from having its maximum effect.
