Ernests Gulbis (pronounced [tpl]IPA-lt|ˈærnəsts ˈɡulbis|[/tpl], born August 30, 1988, and nicknamed "The Gull" or "Ernie"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allsportspeople.com/tennis/people/Ernests_Gulbis|work=AllSportsPeople.com|title=Tennis: Ernests Gulbis|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]) is a Latvian professional tennis player. In 2008, Gulbis won his first ATP Tour doubles title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, teaming with Rainer Schüttler, and in 2010 won his first ATP Tour singles title in the Delray Beach, defeating Ivo Karlović in the final. In total, Gulbis has 5 ATP titles to his name. His career highlights also include a fourth-round appearance at the 2007 US Open and a quarterfinal appearance at the 2008 French Open, as well as several other ATP World Tour semifinal appearances. Gulbis' career-high singles ranking is World No. 18, achieved in February 2014.
Gulbis' professional training in tennis began at the age of 12, when he was enrolled at the Niki Pilić Tennis Academy in Croatia.  Beginning after Wimbledon 2011, Gulbis is now coached by Austrian specialist Gunther Bresnik. Previously, he was coached by Guillermo Canas, and before that by Hernán Gumy (who before that was Marat Safin's coach), but their partnership ended due to Gumy's schedule; during that time, Darren Cahill served as Gulbis' consultant for several tournaments. Before Gumy, Ernests was coached by Karl Heinz Wetter and subsequently Nikola Pilić, the former professional Croatian tennis player and Croatian and German Davis Cup captain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=tennis/07/05/28/TENNIS_French_Henman_Nightle.html |title='Gulbis has weight on his shoulders' Ernests is now coached by Argentine coach Hernán Gumy, once mentor to former world number one Marat Safin |publisher=Sportinglife.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Gulbis comes from a very wealthy family. His book-collecting parents named him after Ernest Hemingway.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/sports/tennis/2011-us-open-ernests-gulbis-forgoes-partying-well-for-playing-well.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Pennington | title=Ernests Gulbis Forgoes Partying Well for Playing Well | date=2011-08-30[/tpl] His father, Ainārs, is an investment businessman, while his mother, Milēna Gulbe-Kavace, is a theater actress. His maternal grandfather, Uldis Pūcītis, was a popular actor and film director.
The second of five children, Gulbis has three sisters and one brother, who is training in Florida to become a professional golfer.  
Gulbis comes from a sporting family in general, and his paternal grandfather, Alvils Gulbis, was one of the starting five players on ASK Rīga, the Soviet Union basketball team that won the European Championships."An Interview with Ernests Gulbis: Round 4 US Open" 2007[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] He first started playing tennis with his grandmother and considers basketball, association football, and ice hockey to be his favorite sports.
Gulbis is known, both by his fellow tennis players and the media, as one of the funnier personalities on the tour. When Gulbis stunned World No. 1 Roger Federer at the 2010 Italian Open, 7–5 in the third after throwing away six previous match points, he told reporters after the match, "I shit my pants a little bit there . . . excuse my language", and has also bragged about his racquet-throwing "skills" in an on-court interview.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.gaeatimes.com/2010/05/01/gulbis-win-prevents-spanish-sweep-in-rome-98012/ |title=Gulbis win prevents Spanish sweep in Rome |publisher=Blog.taragana.com |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] On a telecast during the 2010 Western and Southern Financial Group Masters from Cincinnati, broadcasters Brad Gilbert, Patrick McEnroe and Chris Fowler all compared Gulbis to former world no. 1 Marat Safin, in terms of both playing style and attitude on and off court.  Also like Safin, Gulbis often comments about his own lack of discipline and/or interest in practicing, but is very forthcoming about his aspirations of entering the top 10, 5, or even No. 1 in the ATP rankings.
In 2009, Gulbis was arrested in Sweden for allegedly soliciting prostitutes.[tpl]cite news|last=Hodgkinson |first=Mark |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/7737319/Ernests-Gulbis-see-the-ATP-Tour-as-just-fun-and-games.html |title=Ernests Gulbis see the ATP Tour as just fun and games |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2011-09-24 |location=London[/tpl] He called it a misunderstanding. After paying a small fine, he was released in time to play in the Stockholm Open.
Gulbis speaks Russian, Latvian, English, some French and German. He is keen on reading.

In his next tournament, the Sarajevo Challenger, Gulbis emerged victorious in both the singles and doubles events.
In the first week of October, he won the Mons Challenger in Belgium (d. Kristof Vliegen) as the top seed, breaking into the ATP Top 50 for the first time in his career and surpassing Juan Martín del Potro as the highest-ranked player born in 1988. This win also meant a fourth consecutive title.

====Grand Slam debut====

Gulbis announced his arrival on the Grand Slam stage in the 2007 French Open by defeating the British veteran, Tim Henman in straight sets to advance to the second round. It was heralded by the British Davis Cup captain, John Lloyd, as "... a brilliant performance from Gulbis, that is just pure and utter talent."[tpl]cite news|last=Orlovac |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6700439.stm |title='Gulbis vs Henman: as it happens...' from BBC Sports |work=BBC News |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Gulbis' run was halted in the second round by Spaniard Álbert Montañés in a four set, rain-interrupted match.

At the US Open, Gulbis defeated Thomas Johansson in the first round, before losing to Andy Roddick in the second, again after winning the first set. Coincidentally, it was both his and Andy's birthday on the day they played.

===2009===

Gulbis began the year strongly by defeating former training partner Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the first round of the Brisbane International tournament, before falling in the second round to Paul-Henri Mathieu. He lost in the second round of the 2009 Australian Open to Igor Andreev in five sets, after beating Albert Montañés in the first round in straight sets.

Gulbis had a poor clay-court season compared to 2008, failing to go deep in any of the tournaments preceding the French Open. Gulbis also failed to defend his quarterfinal appearance at the French Open, causing his ranking to drop to World No. 67, the lowest it had been since the summer of 2007.
At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Gulbis, unseeded, defeated Italian Riccardo Ghedin in the first round, before falling to third seeded Andy Murray.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8117634.stm|title= Masterful Murray crushes Gulbis |date=2009-06-25|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-06-25|first=Caroline|last=Cheese[/tpl]

===2010===

To begin the year, Gulbis claimed wins in the first two rounds of the Australian Open precursor tournament, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, defeating sixth-seeded Spaniard Albert Montañés and Italian Andreas Seppi. Gulbis progressed to the third round, where he was defeated in a tight three set match against World No. 1 Roger Federer.  At the 2010 Australian Open itself, Gulbis was ousted in the first round by 30th seed Argentine Juan Mónaco in straight sets.
In February, Gulbis reached his second career semifinal at an ATP 500 event, the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, Tennessee.  In the second round, he defeated third seed Radek Štěpánek, facing two consecutive Czech players as he ousted fifth seed Tomáš Berdych in the third round in a tight, three set match.  He lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Sam Querrey.
At the end of February, he then competed in the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, an outdoor hard-court tournament, where he won his maiden ATP tour title. In the final, he faced 6' 11" Croatian and second seed Ivo Karlović, winning convincingly. With this victory, his ranking rose back into the top 50.
Gulbis' next tournament was the 2010 BNP Paribas Open, an ATP 1000 Tier tournament. Gulbis defeated Swiss player Marco Chiudinelli in the first round, but succumbed to fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko in the second round. Davydenko later withdrew from the tournament due to a wrist injury exacerbated during the match. Ernests did not compete in the Sony Ericsson Open, instead returning to Europe to train for the clay season.
At his first clay-court tournament of the season, the ATP 1000 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, Gulbis again defeated Swiss Marco Chiudinelli in the first round, this time in straight sets, but lost to 13th seed Stanislas Wawrinka in the second round, also in straight sets. At his next tournament, the ATP 500 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell, Ernests reached the quarterfinals, defeating Peter Luczak, Jérémy Chardy, and Albert Ramos-Viñolas, all in straight sets. He lost to in-form, eventual champion Fernando Verdasco in the quarterfinals.  With this result, Gulbis' ranking rose back into the top 40 and also pushed his career win-loss record past 50% for the first time in his career, his year-to-date win-loss record at 15–7.
At his next tournament, the 2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, Gulbis was drawn to face Marcos Baghdatis in the first round of a tournament for the fifth time in his career, although for the first time on clay. He defeated Baghdatis for the loss of only four games, which set up a match with top seed and World No. 1 Roger Federer. After losing the first set, Gulbis rallied to win the match 7–5 in the third, converting his seventh match point for his biggest career win to date.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/27/roger-federer-rome-masters-ernests-gulbis|title=Roger Federer dumped out of Rome Masters by wild card Ernests Gulbis|date=2010-04-27|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2010-04-27 | location=London | first=Kevin | last=Mitchell[/tpl] In the third round, he backed up his win over Federer, with a battling final set tiebreak victory over Italian qualifier Filippo Volandri. In the next round, Gulbis defeated Feliciano López to reach his first semifinal at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, where he lost to Rafael Nadal in a tight, three-set match, hitting 50 winners and 59 errors throughout. This made Gulbis the first player to take a set off Nadal on clay in 2010. With his semifinal appearance, he assured himself a seeded position at the 2010 French Open.
At the 2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open, Gulbis got off to a winning start in the first round against 2010 Estoril Open champion Albert Montañés. He carried on his good vein of form, defeating 10th seed Mikhail Youzhny and Feliciano López. In the quarterfinals he again faced World No. 1 Roger Federer, which ended in the opposite result: Gulbis losing after taking the first set.
Expectations were high for Gulbis as the former quarterfinalist came into the 2010 French Open seeded 23rd (ranked World No. 27), after having an incredible clay-court season. However, Gulbis retired during the first round citing a hamstring injury against the veteran Frenchman and World No. 38, Julien Benneteau.
Due to his injury sustained during the clay-court season, Gulbis withdrew from Wimbledon and its precursor tournaments, effectively missing the entire grass season.
Gulbis returned to the ATP in July, first competing in the Farmers Classic in Los Angeles, California. He defeated Lukáš Lacko in the first round in straight sets, but lost to the in-form Alejandro Falla in the round of 16 in three sets. He next played in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, where he received a first-round bye, but quickly retired in the second round to Ukrainian Illya Marchenko, citing fatigue.
His next tournament was the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Rogers Cup. He defeated World No. 26 Thomaz Bellucci in the first round easily, but fell to World No. 5 Robin Söderling in the second round in a tight match. He then played the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Western & Southern Open, defeating Donald Young in the first round and 13th seed Jürgen Melzer in the second, both in close matches. However, he fell in the third round to World No. 4 Andy Murray in another tight encounter, decided by a final set tiebreak.
Gulbis lost in the first round of the US Open to Jérémy Chardy of France in three sets, marking the fourth consecutive first-round lost at a Grand Slam tournament. Gulbis then took three weeks off to play for the Latvian Davis Cup team against Poland, winning both of his singles rubbers against Jerzy Janowicz and Michał Przysiężny. His next tournament was the PTT Thailand Open.  He received a bye through the first round and defeated Rainer Schüttler in three sets, advancing to the quarterfinals, where he fell to Guillermo García-López, also in three sets. He then played the Japan Open Tennis Championships, but suffered an upset defeat at the hands of World No. 432 Dmitry Tursunov.
Gulbis suffered two more consecutive first-round losses at the hands of Richard Gasquet, at the Shanghai Rolex Masters, and Novak Djokovic, at the Swiss Indoors. However, in his final tournament of the season, he bounced back at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 even in Paris, where he dispatched World No. 40 Juan Ignacio Chela and World No. 10 Mikhail Youzhny, both in straight sets. He then fell to Andy Roddick, also in straight sets.
Ernests Gulbis ended the year at a then-career-high of World No. 24.

===2011===

To begin the year, Gulbis claimed wins in the first two rounds of the Australian Open precursor tournament, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, defeating Victor Hănescu and Antonio Veić, both in straight sets. Gulbis progressed to the quarterfinals, equaling his 2010 run, where he was defeated in a tight match against World No. 1 Rafael Nadal.  Gulbis next played in the 2011 Medibank International Sydney. He received a bye through the first round due to being seeded third for the tournament and defeated Russian Igor Andreev in the second round in three sets. He then defeated Sergiy Stakhovsky in the quarterfinals, before losing to eventual champion Gilles Simon of France in the semifinals, citing fatigue as a cause for his low intensity.
His next tournament was the 2011 Australian Open, where he lost in the first round to unseeded German Benjamin Becker in straight sets, again citing fatigue and illness for his poor showing. It marked his fifth consecutive loss at a Grand Slam event. Gulbis then withdrew from his next three tournaments, his ranking momentarily rising to his personal best of World No. 21 due to Marin Čilić failing to defend his points from the 2010 Australian Open.
Gulbis returned to the tour in late February. His next tournament was the Dubai Tennis Championships, an outdoor hard-court tournament, which was held simultaneously with the Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, the tournament at which Gulbis attained his first ATP title. In the first round, seeded 8th, Gulbis won against wild card entrant and former doubles partner Michael Berrer, despite having trouble with his first serve, giving away seven double faults throughout the match. Gulbis fell to Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine in the second round in three sets.
Gulbis' season did little to improve as he next played in the 2011 BNP Paribas Open, receiving a bye through the first round, before struggling with Lu Yen-Hsun, but ultimately prevailing, with the first two sets going to tiebreaks. In the third round, he was swiftly defeated by eventual winner Novak Djokovic, winning one game.  He then proceeded to play the 2011 Sony Ericsson Open, receiving a bye through the first round, but losing in the second round to World No. 72 Carlos Berlocq. Ranked World No. 30 going into the Monte-Carlo Masters, he defeated the Ukrainian World No. 21 Alexandr Dolgopolov in his first round in straight sets, before losing to Milos Raonic in the second round, also in straight sets. Gulbis proceeded to lose in the first round of the 2011 Serbia Open to Ukrainian Illya Marchenko, in straight sets.
From late April to mid-May, Gulbis took three weeks off due to fatigue before competing in the 2011 Open de Nice Côte d'Azur. In his first two rounds, he defeated Fabio Fognini and Denis Istomin, both in three sets, before falling to World No. 6 Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals. From there, Gulbis' playing deteriorated further as his ranking dropped from No. 30 to No. 85 during the clay-court season, failing to defend his deep runs in 2010. He proceeded to lose his next four matches in a row: against Blaž Kavčič at the French Open, against Adrian Mannarino at the Queen's Club Championships, against Dmitri Tursunov at Wimbledon (which marked his seventh, consecutive first-round exit at a Grand Slam, and after which he took nearly a month off from tennis to train with his new coach), and against former World No. 4 James Blake at the Atlanta Tennis Championships.
However, Gulbis won his second ATP title at the Farmers Classic in Los Angeles, where he snapped his five-match losing streak by defeating fifth seed Belgian Xavier Malisse in a final set tiebreak in the first-round. He then defeated American qualifier Daniel Kosakowski in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Juan Martín del Potro with relative ease, before defeating Russian Alex Bogomolov, Jr. in the semifinals. He faced top seed and World No. 9 Mardy Fish in the finals; after double-faulting to hand Fish the first set, he rallied to win the championship match in a close three setter.
Gulbis received a wildcard entry into the 2011 Rogers Cup. He defeated former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in three sets in the first round, and proceeded to defeat Michaël Llodra in the second round after Llodra retired, trailing in the second set. In the third round, he fell to eventual finalist Mardy Fish, whom he had recently defeated, in another tight three-setter. He then qualified for the 2011 Cincinnati Masters, where he lost to Croatian Ivan Dodig in two sets. Gulbis reached the second round of the US Open, but lost to Gilles Müller in the third round. He was later fined  for improper coaching by the USTA.[tpl]cite news|last=Levinson |first=Mason |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-13/serena-williams-is-fined-2-000-after-u-s-open-outburst-won-t-be-banned.html |title=Serena Williams Is Fined  After U.S. Open Outburst, Won’t Be Banned |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]

==Playing style and equipment==

Gulbis primarily employs an offensive baseline playing style. Gulbis' most consistent shot is his backhand, which is taken with rapid pace, relatively flat execution and is difficult to read.    Gulbis is also known for his finesse shots, including the offensive topspin lob and drop shot, both of which he can strike from any position, including from deep in the court.  Gulbis employs the drop shot consistently and often, sometimes to the point of derision. Gulbis plays an extremely aggressive, winner-driven game, which often leads to a high unforced error count, making his consistency an issue in tough matches, often causing him to be likened to Marat Safin.  His aggressive baseline game is coupled with an extremely powerful serve, often reaching the upper 130's and low 140's in mph; however, Gulbis has struggled with his second serve, and often has high double fault statistics across the ATP leader board.  Despite playing a style more attuned to fast surfaces, his strong showing at the 2008 French Open and his win over Federer on clay are attributed to his powerful and flat strokes which can play through the surface.  Gulbis' primary weaknesses are his second serve, his consistency and his nerves; despite a strong serve and return, Gulbis has poor break point conversion, break point save and tie-break statistics, having on numerous occasions made strings of uncharacteristic unforced errors when serving or returning for sets or matches, as well as hitting numerous "easy" slams well out in tough situations, something he has become known for and often jokes about in interviews.
As of February 2013, Gulbis uses a Wilson Steam 99 paintjob racquet after switching from Head. His strings are Pacific Poly Force 17 strung at 62 lbs. Gulbis uses Tourna grip on a white Hydrocontrol grip. He is endorsed by adidas for his attire.
