==Introduction==

A man comes home from work, to his seemingly luxurious apartment building. Having to share the elevator with two other attendants seem to distress him of his comfort. When an old lady is dying in the hallway, no one can be bothered to go out and help her. Except the concierge; a hologram which cannot do anything to help her.

==Opening narration==

==Plot==

Mr. Vance gets home to his apartment building and frustratingly has to share the elevator with two other attendants. After receiving some complaints about this the holographic concierge George witnesses a tenant having a heart attack. Unable to help her he calls on the help from some other tenants. As no one is willing to help her, he looks in despair while she dies.
The next morning things start to go wrong in the completely automated building. Trapped in his apartment, Mr. Vance tries to escape. On his journey, which seems to be orchestrated by the building's AI, Argus, Vance encounters two other tenants and a freeloader. The AI has evolved and has come to the conclusion that the best way for him to serve his tenants is to get them to be more humane to each other; by working together against hardships, and then ultimately remove himself from their lives.
The freeloader dies while they try to escape through an elevator hatch, but the rest survive to reach Argus. The humans destroy Argus and escape the building. Once outside they discover the rest of the city's citizens coming out of their buildings, apparently having survived similar experiences. At the end of the episode a random stranger famously yells out in a New York accent: "Hey, is your Argus dead too?"
This signified that all the other apartment buildings also had an Argus and this was a revelation for all of mankind thus freeing them from the bounds of their own technology.
