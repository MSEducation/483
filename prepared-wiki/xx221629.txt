The German Bank Building, known also as Louisville Home Federal Building, is a historic building in Downtown Louisville, Kentucky, USA.  It is located on the corner of Fifth and Market streets. The two-story structure was built in 1914 in a Beaux-Arts style with a limestone facade.  In 1918, the name of the building was changed to Louisville National Bank.  This was during World War I when many institutions changed names to avoid association with Germany.[tpl]Cite book|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: German Bank Building / Louisville Home Federal Building|32 KB[/tpl]|date=March, 1984 |author=M.
