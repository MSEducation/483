CATEGORIES: Government of California, State governments of the United States

The government of California is the governmental structure of the state of California as established by the California Constitution. It is composed of three branches: the executive, consisting of the Governor of California and the other constitutionally elected and appointed officers and offices; the legislative, consisting of the California State Legislature, which includes the Assembly and the Senate; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts. There is also local government, consisting of counties, cities, special districts, and school districts, as well as government entities and offices that operate independently on a constitutional, statutory, or common law basis. The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall and ratification.

===State agencies===

State government is organized into many departments, of which most are grouped together into several huge Cabinet-level agencies. These agencies are sometimes informally referred to as superagencies, especially by government officials, to distinguish them from the general usage of the term "government agency."[tpl]cite book|first=David G.|last=Lawrence|title=California: The Politics of Diversity|year=2012|page=156|publisher=Wadsworth[/tpl] The Cabinet-level agencies (superagencies) are the:[tpl]cite web|title=Governor Brown's Government Reorganization Plan Becomes Law|publisher=Office of the Governor of California|url=http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17617|date=3 July 2012[/tpl]
The independently elected officers run separate departments not grouped within the superagencies, and there are other Cabinet-level departments:

===Independent entities===

There are many government entities and offices that are under neither executive, legislative, judicial, or local control, but operate independently on a constitutional, statutory, or common law basis.
Examples include the:

==Legislative branch==

The  California State Legislature is the state legislature. It is a bicameral body consisting of the California State Assembly, the lower house with 80 members, and the California State Senate, the upper house with 40 members.Constitution of California, article 4, section 2(a) Members of the Assembly serve two-year terms; members of the Senate serve four-year terms, with half of the seats up for election on alternate (two year) election cycles.
The Speaker of the California State Assembly presides over the State Assembly. The Lieutenant Governor is the ex officio President of the Senate and may break a tied vote, and the President pro tempore of the California State Senate is elected by the majority party caucus. The Legislature meets in the California State Capitol in Sacramento. Its session laws are published in the California Statutes and codified into the 29 California Codes.

==Judicial branch==

The Judiciary of California interprets and applies the law, and is defined under the Constitution, law, and regulations. The judiciary has a hierarchical structure with the Supreme Court at the apex. The Superior Courts are the primary trial courts, and the Courts of Appeal are the primary appellate courts. The Judicial Council is the rule-making arm of the judiciary.Constitution of California, Article 6, Section 6(d)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/policyadmin-jc.htm|title=Judicial Council|publisher=Judicial Council of California[/tpl]
The California Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of California and six Associate Justices. The Court has original jurisdiction in a variety of cases, including habeas corpus proceedings, and has discretionary authority to review all the decisions of the California Courts of Appeal, as well as mandatory review responsibility for cases where the death penalty has been imposed. The Courts of Appeal are the intermediate appellate courts. The state is geographically divided into six appellate districts.Constitution of California, Article 6, § 3California Government Code § 69100 Notably, all published California appellate decisions are binding on all Superior Courts, regardless of appellate district.Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court,, 57 Cal. 2d 450, 369 P.2d 937, 20 Cal. Rptr. 321 (1962).
The California superior courts are the courts of general jurisdiction that hear and decide any civil or criminal action which is not specially designated to be heard before some other court or governmental agency. As mandated by the Constitution, each of the 58 counties has a superior court.Constitution of California, Article 6, § 4

==Local government==

California is divided into counties which are legal subdivisions of the state.Constitution of California, article 11, section 1 There are 58 counties, about 482 California cities,[tpl]cite web|title=Learn About Cities|publisher=League of California Cities|accessdate=13 March 2014|url=http://www.cacities.org/Resources/Learn-About-Cities[/tpl] about 1,102 school districts,[tpl]citation|title=Individual State Descriptions: 2007|pages=25-26|series=2007 Census of Governments|date=November 2012|publisher=United States Census Bureau|url=http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/isd_book.pdf|ref=[tpl]harvid|Census|2007[/tpl][/tpl] and about 3,400 special districts.[tpl]cite book|title=What’s So Special About Special Districts?

Special Districts deliver specific public programs and public facilities to constituents, and are defined as "any agency of the state for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries."California Government Code § 16271(d) Counties and incorporated cities may promulgate local ordinances, which are usually codified in county or city codes, respectively, and are misdemeanor crimes unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code §§ 25132, 36900 et seq.
