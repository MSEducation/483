==Plot==

The series follows Keith Church (David Walliams), a socially inept chemistry teacher at the fictional Greybridge Secondary  School, near Watford North London, who falls for new French teacher Sarah Postern (Catherine Tate), who believes herself to be an inspirational teacher, in tune with youth culture and a beautiful woman. However she is also getting attention from uncouth and cocky sports teacher Trevor Gunn (Philip Glenister).
Other characters include:
The pupils at the school are portrayed as being mainly interested in social networking, texting and partying and as being bored by the attempts of Mr Church and Miss Postern to engage with them. The most prominent of them is a streetwise pupil called Manyou, played by Joivan Wade, who is asked for advice on how to succeed with women by Mr Church.

==Reception==

The series was met with mixed feedback. Christopher Stevens of the Daily Mail commented: "If we were expecting old-fashioned comedy, we're certainly getting it. The traditional approach brings benefits. There's no wobbly handheld camera work, no improvised dialogue, no barrage of foul language, no filthy single entendres. Instead, there's a brisk script with plenty of jokes. This has the feel of a sitcom that will win viewers over."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2395233/Big-School-review-David-Walliams-comedy-masterclass-says-Christopher-Stevens.html|title=Big School review: David Walliams' show is a comedy masterclass, says Christopher Stevens | Mail Online|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] Dan Owen of MSN described it as "An amusing and pleasant way to spend 30 minutes",[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/what-to-watch/big-school-decent-david-walliams-and-catherine-tate-sitcom|title=Big School: decent David Walliams and Catherine Tate sitcom|publisher=tv.uk.msn.com|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] and The Guardian said of Walliams: "This performance, and his writing, gives the show good jokes and heart."
There was negative feedback to the opening of the series, with The Daily Telegraph stating: "A bit tired, perhaps, the school thing, but surely a straightforward setting for a sitcom" before concluding "Let's just put it this way: amusing it was not. Mission aborted."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10242298/Big-School-BBC-One-review.html|title=Big School, BBC One, review - Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] MSN UK said, "Like most BBC comedies aiming to please mass audiences, there were plenty of moments that didn't work, but the writing avoided being outright terrible. A family show like this (even one inexplicably broadcast post-watershed) simply can't please everyone all the time".
The series opened to 4.2m viewers. The second instalment scored 3.63m (17.4%) for BBC One, making it the most watched programme of primetime outside of the soaps and news for the night.

==DVD release==

The first series of Big School was released onto DVD on 23 September 2013.
