The FDF was founded on 11 May 1964 and until 1982, dominated Brussels' municipal politics. Until January 2010 the party was known as the Democratic Front of Francophones ([tpl]lang-fr|Front Démocratique des Francophones[/tpl]).[tpl]cite book|author=Philippe de Riemaecker|title=Quand les singes se prennent pour des dieux|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_ZODLYRKp5gC&pg=PA212|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=978-2-7483-9789-5|pages=212–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Els Witte|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n4Em8G76kbkC&pg=PA372|year=2009|publisher=Asp / Vubpress / Upa|isbn=978-90-5487-517-8|pages=372–[/tpl]
On the national level the FDF was a constituent part of the Reformist Movement (MR), an alliance of Francophone liberal parties from 2002 until 25 September 2011. On that day, the FDF decided to leave the coalition. They did not agree with the manner in which president Charles Michel defended the rights of the French-speaking people in the agreement concerning the splitting of the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district, during the 2010–2011 Belgian government formation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deredactie.be/permalink/1.1119060 |title=FDF almost unanimously votes in favour of split with MR |publisher=deredactie.be |accessdate=2011-09-25 |language=Dutch [/tpl]

==Policies==

The party advocates extension of the bilingual status of the Brussels-Capital Region to many currently officially Dutch-speaking municipalities around Brussels (in Flemish Brabant), where a majority of the population is French-speaking. This is strongly opposed by all Flemish parties, who say that these newer inhabitants should respect and learn the language of their new region.
This would expand the public services in French to all French-speakers who live in those areas. The FDF advocates also the dismantling of several measures hindering the French-speaking citizens of those municipalities from using French in their contacts with the administration. This is opposed by all Flemish parties, who argue that the linguistic border and federal structure is fixed since the state reforms in recent decades, and that the Frenchification of Brussels should not further itself into the Flemish Region.
