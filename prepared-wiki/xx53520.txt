Dennis John Kucinich ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|uː|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|tʃ[/tpl]; born October 8, 1946) is a former U.S. Representative, serving from 1997 to 2013. He was also a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wral.com/news/political/story/2350974/ |title=Kucinich abandons White House bid |first=Joe |last=Milicia |date=January 24, 2008 |publisher=WRAL-TV |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080127142007/http://www.wral.com/news/political/story/2350974/ |archivedate=January 27, 2008[/tpl]
He was a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
From 1977 to 1979, Kucinich served as the 53rd mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, a tumultuous term in which he survived a recall election and was successful in a battle against selling the municipal electric utility before being defeated for reelection by George Voinovich.
Through his various governmental positions and campaigns, Kucinich attracted attention for consistently delivering "the strongest liberal" perspective.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5548952/ |title=Democrats make it official - Politics- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2004-07-29 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]
This perspective has been shown by his actions, such as bringing articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, and being the only Democratic candidate in the 2008 election to have voted against invading Iraq.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0712/S00192.htm |title=Kucinich Excluded From Des Moines Register Debate |publisher=Scoop |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] (Eventual nominee Barack Obama also opposed the Iraq War when it started, but he was not in Congress at the time.)
Because of redistricting following the 2010 state elections, Ohio's 9th congressional district absorbed part of Cuyahoga County, abolishing Kucinich's district and pitted him against 9th district incumbent Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 Democratic primary, which he lost.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73713.html | title=Ohio House primaries: Reps.

==Personal life==

Kucinich was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 8, 1946, as the eldest of the seven children of Virginia (née Norris) and Frank J. Kucinich."About Dennis Kucinich." Dennis for President. July 24, 2007. http://www.sanduskyregister.com/obituary/28573 His father, a truck driver, was of Croat ancestry; his Irish American mother was a homemaker. Growing up, his family moved 21 times and Dennis was often charged with the responsibility of finding apartments they could afford.
He attended Cleveland State University from 1967 to 1970.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politics1.com/kucinich.htm|title=Presidency 2004 DENNIS J.

Congressman Dennis Kucinich. July 25, 2007 http://kucinich.house.gov/Biography/  Kucinich was baptized a Roman Catholic. Kucinich married Sandra Lee McCarthy in 1977; they had a daughter named Jackie in 1981 and divorced in 1986.[tpl]cite news|title=Recommend E-MAIL Dennis J.

The two met while Harper was working as an assistant for the Chicago-based American Monetary Institute, which brought her to Kucinich's House of Representatives office for a meeting.
Kucinich was raised with four brothers, Larry, Frank, Gary and Perry; and two sisters, Theresa and Beth Ann. On December 19, 2007, Perry Kucinich, the youngest brother, was found dead in his apartment.Kucinich's brother found dead in home, CNN, December 19, 2007Dennis Kucinich's brother found dead, MSNBC, December 19, 2007Perry Kucinich, Dennis' younger brother, found dead in apartment, December 19, 2007, Alana Baranik, Cleveland Plain Dealer On November 11, 2008, his youngest sister, Beth Ann Kucinich, also died.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2008/11/beth_ann_kucinich_48_musician.html|title=Beth Ann Kucinich, 48, musician, artist, sister of Congressman Dennis Kucinich|last=McRae|first=Sarena|date=2008-11-11|work=Cleveland Plain Dealer|accessdate=2009-03-26[/tpl]

==Early career==

Kucinich's political career began early. After running unsuccessfully in 1967, Kucinich was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1969 at the age of twenty-three. In 1972, Kucinich ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing narrowly to incumbent Republican William E. Minshall, Jr. After Minshall's retirement in 1974 Kucinich sought the seat again, this time failing to get the Democratic nomination, which instead went to Ronald M. Mottl. Kucinich ran as an Independent candidate in the general election, placing third with about 30% of the vote. In 1975, Kucinich became clerk of the municipal court in Cleveland and served in that position for two years.

==Cleveland mayoralty==

Kucinich was elected Mayor of Cleveland in 1977 and served in that position until 1979.The Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History by Cleveland Bicentennial Commission (Cleveland, Ohio), David D. Van Tassel (Editor), and John J. Grabowski (Editor) ISBN 978-0-253-33056-7 At thirty-one years of age, he was the youngest mayor of a major city in the United States, earning him the nickname "the boy mayor of Cleveland". Kucinich's tenure as mayor is often regarded as one of the most tumultuous in Cleveland's history.The Plain Dealer, August 1, 1999. Our Century: 'Boy Mayor' Leads Battle Into Default by Fred McGunagle.The Crisis of Growth Politics: Cleveland, Kucinich, and the Challenge of Urban Populism by Todd Swanstrom ISBN 978-0-87722-366-5 After Kucinich refused to sell Muni Light, Cleveland's publicly owned electric utility, the Cleveland mafia put out a hit on Kucinich. A hit man from Maryland planned to shoot him in the head during the Columbus Day Parade, but the plot fell apart when Kucinich was hospitalized and missed the event. When the city fell into default shortly thereafter, the mafia leaders called off the contract killer.[tpl]cite news | first=James | last=Renner | title=The Mafia Plot To Kill Dennis Kucinich |date=2007-07-04 | url =http://www.freetimes.com/stories/15/9/the-mafia-plot-to-kill-dennis-kucinich | work =The Cleveland Free Times | pages =Cover story | accessdate = 2007-07-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070708205903/http://www.freetimes.com/stories/15/9/the-mafia-plot-to-kill-dennis-kucinich| archivedate = July 8, 2007[/tpl]
Specifically, it was the Cleveland Trust Company that suddenly required all of the city's debts be paid in full, which forced the city into default, after news of Kucinich's refusal to sell the city utility. For years, these debts were routinely rolled over, pending future payment, until Kucinich's announcement was made public. In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored him for having had the "courage and foresight" to stand up to the banks, which saved the city an estimated $195 million between 1985 and 1995.http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0123-04.htm'Boy Mayor' Kucinich Took Charge in Utility Debt Crisis, From LA Times, January 23, 2003

==Post-mayoralty==

After losing his re-election bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept a low profile in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl][/ref] During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, "When I was growing up in Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through."
In 1982, Kucinich moved back to Cleveland and ran for Secretary of State; however, he lost the Democratic primary to Sherrod Brown. In 1983, Kucinich won a special election to fill the seat of a Cleveland city councilman who had died.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Dennis_Kucinich |title=Dennis Kucinich - Congresspedia |publisher=Sourcewatch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] His brother, Gary Kucinich, was also a councilman at the time.
In 1985, there was some speculation that Kucinich might run for mayor again. Instead, his brother Gary ran against (and lost to) the incumbent Voinovich. Kucinich, meanwhile, gave up his council position to run for Governor of Ohio as an independent against Richard Celeste, but later withdrew from the race. After this, Kucinich, in his own words "on a quest for meaning," lived quietly in New Mexico until 1994, when he won a seat in the Ohio State Senate.

==House of Representatives==

In 1996, Kucinich was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 10th district of Ohio. He defeated two-term Republican incumbent Martin Hoke by three percentage points. However, he has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has since been re-elected six times.[tpl]cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Statistics |accessdate=2008-01-10 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives [/tpl]

===Domestic policy voting record===

Kucinich helped introduce and is one of 93 cosponsors (as of Feb. 22, 2010) in the House of Representatives of the United States National Health Care Act or HR 676 proposed by Rep. John Conyers in 2003,[tpl]USBill|110|HR|676[/tpl] The Library of Congress which provides for a universal single-payer public health-insurance plan.
In 2008, Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives against President George W. Bush for the invasion and occupation of Iraq.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/07/dennis-kucinich-suffers-defeat-in-ohio-primary-race/| title=Dennis Kucinich suffers defeat in Ohio primary race| publisher=The National Post| date=March 7, 2012[/tpl]
Although his voting record is not always in line with that of the Democratic Party, on March 17, 2010, after being courted by President Barack Obama, his wife and others, he reluctantly agreed to vote with his colleagues for the Healthcare Bill without a public option component.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2010/03/16/michelle-obama-gets-backup-from-scarlett-johansson-on-healthful-eating.html |title=Michelle Obama Gets Backup From Scarlett Johansson on Healthful Eating - Washington Whispers |publisher=usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]

Kucinich criticized the flag-burning amendment and voted against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. His congressional voting record has leaned strongly toward a pro-life stance, although he noted that he has never supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion altogether. In 2003, however, he began describing himself as pro-choice and said he had shifted away from his earlier position on the issue.Marc Sandalow, "Ohio Presidential Hopeful Pivots Over to Pro-Choice Camp", San Francisco Chronicle, February 23, 2003. Press releases have indicated that he is pro-choice and supports ending the abstinence-only policy of sex education and increasing the use of contraception to make abortion "less necessary" over time. His voting record since 2003 has reflected mixed ratings from abortion rights groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=318|title=Interest Group Ratings|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=23 November 2009[/tpl]
He has criticized Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions) for promoting voting machines that fail to leave a traceable paper trail."Kucinich Calls for Suspension of Electronic Voting", Common Dreams, April 23, 2004. He was one of the thirty-one who voted in the House to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the United States presidential election, 2004."Final Vote Results for Role Call 7", January 6, 2005.

===Foreign policy record===

Kucinich has criticized the foreign policy of President Bush, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and what he perceives as growing American hostility towards Iran. He has always voted against funding it. In 2005, he voted against the Iran Freedom and Support Act, calling it a "stepping stone to war".[tpl]cite web|url=http://kucinich.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=42687 |title=Kucinich Speaks Out Against House Bill That Lays The Ground Work For War Against Iran |publisher=Kucinich.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]  He also signed a letter of solidarity with Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 2004.[tpl]cite web |title=Former Democratic Presidential Candidates Rev.

Kucinich advocates US withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because, in his view, it causes the loss of more American jobs than it creates, and does not provide adequate protections for worker rights and safety and environmental safeguards. He is against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for the same reason.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kucinich.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=1466#cafta |title=Kucinich's House website |publisher=Kucinich.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]
Kucinich is also in favor of increased dialog with Iran in order to avoid a militaristic confrontation at all costs. He expressed such sentiments at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey which included Chuck Hagel, Javad Zarif, Nicholas Kristof, and Anders Liden to discuss Iranian-American relations, and potential ways to increase dialog in order to avoid conflict.[tpl]cite web|author=Posted on September 27, 2007 12:47 PM |url=http://american-iranian.org/publications/articles/2007/09/distinguished-speakers-series-senator-chuck-hagel-congressman-dennis-kucinich.html#more |title=American Iranian Council website |publisher=American-iranian.org |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]

Kucinich and Ron Paul are the only two congressional representatives who votedCalling on the United Nations Security Council to charge Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the United Nations Charter because of his calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, June 20, 2007  against the

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the genocide convention of the United Nations Charter based on statements that he has made. Kucinich defended his vote by saying that Ahmadinejad's statements could be translated to mean that he wants a regime change in Israel, not death to its people and supporters, and that the resolution is an attempt to beat "the war drum to build support for a US attack on Iran."[tpl]cite web|url=http://2008central.net/2007/07/13/kucinich-and-paul-vote-again-ahmadinejad-resolution-kucinich-slammed-by-ohio-jewish-leaders/ |title=Kucinich and Paul Vote Against Ahmadinejad Resolution - Kucinich Slammed By Ohio Jewish Leaders |publisher=2008Central.net |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] In October 2009, Kucinich and Ron Paul were the only two congressional representatives to vote against H.Res.175 condemning the government of Iran for “state-sponsored persecution of its Bahá’í minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights.”
On January 9, 2009, Kucinich was one of the dissenters in a 390-5 vote with 22 abstentions for a resolution recognizing Israel's "right to defend itself Hamas rocket attacks" and reaffirming the U.S.'s support for Israel.

Kucinich was criticized during his 2004 campaign for changing his stance on the issue of abortion. His explanation was "I've always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women to be able to have an abortion if they need to protect their health. So when I saw the direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose."Democratic 2004 Primary Presidential Debate in Durham, New Hampshire, December 9, 2003.
Ralph Nader praised Kucinich as "a genuine progressive",[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] and most Greens were friendly to Kucinich's campaign, some going so far as to indicate that they would not have run against him had he won the Democratic nomination. However, Kucinich was unable to carry any states in the 2004 Democratic Primaries, and John Kerry eventually won the Democratic nomination at the Democratic National Convention.

===Press coverage===

On December 10, 2003, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced the removal of its correspondents from the campaigns of Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton."Kucinich & Braun Blast ABC For Reducing Campaign Coverage." Democracy Now! December 12, 2003. Retrieved July 24, 2007.
The announcement came one day after a Democratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News' Ted Koppel, in which Koppel asked whether the candidacies of Kucinich, Moseley Braun and Sharpton were merely "vanity campaigns", and Koppel and Kucinich exchanged uncomfortable dialog.[tpl]cite web |title=How the Media Picks the Candidates author=Robinson, Josh and Lorna Tychostup |date=February 2004 |publisher=Z Magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103230928/http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Feb2004/tychostup0204.html |archivedate=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2011|url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Feb2004/tychostup0204.html [/tpl]
Kucinich, previously critical of the limited coverage given his campaign, characterized ABC's decision as an example of media companies' power to shape campaigns by choosing which candidates to cover and questioned its timing, coming immediately after the debate.
ABC News, while stating its commitment to give coverage to a wide range of candidates, argued that focusing more of its "finite resources" on those candidates most likely to win would best serve the public debate.

===Polls and primaries===

In the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination race, national polls consistently showed Kucinich's support in single digits, but rising, especially as Howard Dean lost some support among peace activists for refusing to commit to cutting the Pentagon budget. Though he was not viewed as a viable contender by most, there were differing polls on Kucinich's popularity.
He placed second in MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, particularly Internet-based ones. This led many activists to believe that his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls had been saying. However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.
In the Iowa caucuses, he finished fifth, receiving about 1% of the state delegates from Iowa; far below the 15% threshold for receiving national delegates. He performed similarly in the New Hampshire primary, placing sixth among the seven candidates with 1% of the vote. In the Mini-Tuesday primaries, he finished near the bottom in most states, with his best performance in New Mexico where he received less than 6% of the vote, and still no delegates. Kucinich's best showing in any Democratic contest was in the February 24 Hawaii caucus, in which he won 31% of caucus participants, coming in second place to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and winning Maui County, the only county won by Kucinich in either of his presidential campaigns. He also saw a double-digit showing in Maine on February 8, where he got 16% percent in that state's caucus.
On Super Tuesday, March 2, Kucinich gained another strong showing with the Minnesota caucus, where 17% of the ballots went to him. In his home state of Ohio, he gained 9% in the primary.
Kucinich campaigned heavily in Oregon, spending 30 days there during the two months leading up to the state's May 18 primary. He continued his campaign because "the future direction of the Democratic Party has not yet been determined"Rick Lyman, "Down But Not Out, Kucinich Keeps Fighting", The New York Times, May 17, 2004. and chose to focus on Oregon "because of its progressive tradition and its pioneering spirit."[tpl]cite news |title=Kerry visits spotlights Oregon's state primary |date=May 18, 2004 |publisher=KGW news |url=http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_051704_news_election_roundup.1d1202a0b.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103192805/http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_051704_news_election_roundup.1d1202a0b.html |archivedate=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] He won 16% of the vote.
Even after Kerry won enough delegates to secure the nomination, Kucinich continued to campaign until just before the convention, citing an effort to help shape the agenda of the Democratic Party. He was the last candidate to end his campaign. He endorsed Kerry on July 22, four days before the start of the Democratic National Convention.David Halbfinger, "The 2004 Campaign: Campaign Briefing -- The Democrats; Kucinich Endorses Kerry", The New York Times, July 23, 2004.

==2008 Presidential campaign==

On December 11, 2006 in a speech delivered at Cleveland City Hall, Kucinich announced he would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party for President in 2008.

Kucinich told his supporters in Iowa that if he did not appear on the second ballot in any caucus that they should back Barack Obama:
 
 "I hope Iowans will caucus for me as their first choice ... because of my singular positions on the war, on health care and trade," Kucinich said. "But in those caucus locations where my support doesn't reach the necessary threshold, I strongly encourage all of my supporters to make Barack Obama their second choice."[tpl]cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gDC1l7fRNVdFdgW4JsjBd03lUOIAD8TTD8M00 |title=Kucinich Asks Supporters to Back Obama |accessdate=2008-01-02 |agency=Associated Press |work=Google News |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105114348/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gDC1l7fRNVdFdgW4JsjBd03lUOIAD8TTD8M00 |archivedate = January 5, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dennis4president.com/go/newsroom/kucinich-urges-supporters-to-back-obama-on-second-iowa-ballot/ |title=Kucinich Urges Supporters to Back Obama on Second Iowa Ballot |accessdate=2008-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102195213/http://www.dennis4president.com/go/newsroom/kucinich-urges-supporters-to-back-obama-on-second-iowa-ballot/| archivedate = January 2, 2008[/tpl]

At a debate of Democratic presidential candidates in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC's Tim Russert cited a passage from a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO from her home in Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine's assertion was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former US president Jimmy Carter has.[tpl]cite web |last=Eaton |first=Sabrina |title=Kucinich at debate: I did see a UFO |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2007/10/kucinich_at_debate_i_did_see_a.html |accessdate=2007-11-28 |postscript=[/tpl] Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans say they have witnessed a UFO.
On November 16, 2007, Larry Flynt hosted a fundraiser for Kucinich at the Los Angeles-based Hustler-LFP headquarters, attended by Kucinich and his wife, which has drawn criticism from Flynt's detractors. Attendees included such notables as Edward Norton, Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, Melissa Etheridge, Tammy Etheridge, Stephen Stills, Kristen Stills, Frances Fisher, and Esai Morales.

Kucinich's 2008 presidential campaign was advised by a steering committee including Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) Founder Steve Cobble, long-time Kucinich press secretary Andy Junewicz, former RFK, McCarthy, Humphrey, McGovern and Carter political consultant Michael Carmichael, former Carter Fundraiser Marcus Brandon, Ani DiFranco Tour Manager Susan Alzner, West Point Graduate and former Army Captain Mike Klein, former Communications Director of Democrats Abroad Sharon Manitta and New Jersey-based political consultant Vin Gopal. The campaign was seen as a platform to push progressive issues into the Democratic Party, including a not-for-profit health care system, same-sex marriage, increasing the minimum wage, opposing capital punishment, and impeachment.

==Congressional campaigns==

Until 2012, Kucinich had always been reelected to Congress by sound margins in his strongly Democratic-leaning districts, and had up until this election far won primary challenges against him for the Democratic nomination convincingly.

===2006===

Kucinich defeated another Democratic primary challenger by a wide margin and defeated Republican Mike Dovilla in the general election with 66% of the vote.

===2008===

His opponents included Cleveland City Councilman Joe Cimperman and North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O'Grady. In February 2008 Kucinich raised around $50,000 compared to Cimperman's $228,000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2008/02/congressional_candidate_rosema.html |title=10th Congressional candidate Palmer raised $133,300 in '07 - OPENERS - Ohio Politics Blog by The Plain Dealer |publisher=Blog.cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]  but through a YouTube money raising campaign he managed to raise $700,000, surpassing Cimperman's $487,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/1203672761265370.xml&coll=2 |title=Dennis Kucinich raised nearly $700,000 in six weeks in bid to keep seat in Congress |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl][tpl]youtube|id=LehCxhHPXQ8[/tpl]
Cimperman, who was endorsed by the Mayor of Cleveland and The Plain Dealer, criticized Kucinich for focusing too much on campaigning for president and not on the district. Kucinich accused Cimperman of representing corporate and real estate interests. Cimperman described Kucinich as an absentee congressman who failed to pass any major legislative initiatives in his 12-year House career. In an interview, Cimperman said he was tired of Kucinich and Cleveland being joke fodder for late-night talk-show hosts, saying "It's time for him to go home."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/52064 |title=Is Dennis Kucinich Getting McKinney´d |publisher=American Chronicle |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Davis |first=Susan |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB120364487659384883-V6ua29cOYO_J_kQ_X_vD15fLe1Y_20080322.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top |title=Long Shots Could Pay High Price - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] An ad paid for by Cimperman's campaign stated that Kucinich has missed over 300 votes, but by checking the ad's source, the actual number was 139.[tpl]cite news|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/house/vote-missers/ |title=House members who missed votes, 110th Congress (Congress votes database) | publisher=Projects.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl] However, Kucinich is well known for his constituency service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/03/03/kucinich/print.html |title=Cleveland to Dennis Kucinich: Phone home |publisher=Salon.com |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]

Kucinich took part in a debate with the other primary challengers. Barbara Ferris criticized him for not bringing as much money back to the district as other area legislators and authoring just one bill that passed during his 12 years in Congress. Kucinich responded "It was a Republican Congress and there weren't many Democrats passing meaningful legislation during a Republican Congress."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/1202808813169900.xml&coll=2 |title=U.S. Rep.

Kucinich introduced the first Space Preservation Act, on October 2, 2001, with no cosponsors. The bill was designed to "preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind." The bill was referred to the House Science, the House Armed Services, and the House International Relations committees.

Kucinich held a press conference on the evening of April 24, 2007, revealing House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Cheney. He charges Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence, and stated: "I believe the Vice President's conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation.

During the first Democratic Presidential debate at South Carolina State University,[tpl]cite web| last =Johnson| first =Alex| title =Democrats seek to seize initiative on Iraq| publisher =MSNBC|date=April 26, 2007 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18326264 | accessdate =2007-05-01[/tpl] none of the other candidates' hands went up when the moderator, Brian Williams, asked if they would support Kucinich's plan to impeach Cheney. In response, Kucinich retrieved a pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution from his coat and expressed the importance of protecting and defending constitutional principles.
[tpl]quote|This is a pocket copy of the Constitution which I carry with me, because I took an oath to defend the Constitution. We've spent a lot of time talking about Iraq here tonight and America's role in the world. This country was taken into war based on lies. This country was taken into war based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and Al Qaeda's role with respect to Iraq, which there wasn't one at the time we went in. I want to state that Mr. Cheney must be held accountable. He is already ginning up a cause for war against Iran. Now, we have to stand for this Constitution, we have to protect and defend this Constitution. And this vice president has violated this Constitution. So I think that while my friends on the stage may not be ready to take this stand, the American people should know that there's at least one person running for president who wants to reconnect America with its goodness, with its greatness, with its highest principles, which currently are not being reflected by those who are in the White House.|Dennis Kucinich|New York Times, April 27, 2007[tpl]cite news| title =The Democrats' First 2008 Presidential Debate| publisher= The New York Times|date=April 27, 2007| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/us/politics/27debate_transcript.html?pagewanted=18&_r=1[/tpl][/tpl]

====Cheney impeachment articles introduced====

On November 6, 2007, Kucinich used special parliamentary procedure and moved for a vote on impeaching the Vice President.[tpl]cite web| title =Brady Supports Kucinich Move to Impeach Cheney| publisher= The Philadelphia Bulletin|date=November 7, 2007| url=http://www.thebulletin.us/site/news.cfm?newsid=18997962&BRD=2737&PAG=461&dept_id=576361&rfi=6[/tpl] House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Pelosi opposed the measure and stood by previous comments that, "impeachment is not on our agenda," and they initially moved to table the bill. When that attempt failed, Mr. Hoyer quickly moved to refer the bill to the House Judiciary Committee. That motion succeeded.

===Opposition to H1B/L1 visa programs===

Kucinich has been a vocal opponent of the H1B and L1 visa programs. In an article on his campaign website, he states:[tpl]cite web |url=http://workersrights.kucinich.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=34 |title=Dennis on outsourcing American jobs |work=Dennis Kucinich on H-1B and L-1 Visas[/tpl]

===Support for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine===

Kucinich was involved in efforts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he and other critics of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, Vermont's independent Senator Bernie Sanders, and others have joined him in this effort.[tpl]cite news |title=Democrats' New 'Fairness' Push May Silence Conservative Radio Hosts, Critics Say |author=Fred Lucas |date=January 17, 2007 |publisher=CBS News |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200701/NAT20070117a.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329083302/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200701/NAT20070117a.html |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=17793 |title=John Berlau: Is the Fairness Doctrine on its Way Back?, October 31, 2006 |publisher=Humanevents.com |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=960F8E19-3048-5C12-0091F4C92C213AF7 |author=Hunter, Derek |title='Fairness Doctrine' Anything but Fair |date=2007-05-17 |publisher=The Politico [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/35081 |first=George F. |last=Will |title=Fraudulent 'Fairness' |publisher=Newsweek |date=2007-05-07 [/tpl]

===Animal welfare and rights===

Kucinich addressed the issue of factory farming in his policy encouraging independent, family-owned, and organic farming.

===Free Market Drug Act===

Kucinich believes that the prices for patented drugs are unreasonably high, and that patent monopolies have created a restricted, unfree drug market. "Simply put, if drug manufacturers were operating in a free market like most other businesses in the US, drug prices would be significantly lower." On September 29, 2004, he introduced H.R. 5155, the Free Market Drug Act; a system where the National Institutes of Health would fund research, thus disconnecting the manufacturing of drugs from research and increasing competition among private manufacturers.[tpl]cite web|title=Health: Free Market Drug Act|url=http://kucinich.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=1461#Free%20Market%20Drug%20Act|publisher=Congressman Dennis J.

===Youth rights===

In a Democratic debate during the 2008 Presidential Election, Kucinich and Mike Gravel were the only two candidates who favored lowering the legal drinking age to 18 as it is in the vast majority of the world.  Kucinich further said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.

===Military intervention in Libya===

Kucinich objected to the 2011 military intervention in Libya missile strikes and questioned whether they weren't impeachable offenses. Kucinich also questioned why Democratic leaders didn’t object when President Barack Obama told them of his plan for US participation in enforcing the Libyan no-fly zone. He said Obama's action in Libya was "a grave decision that cannot be made by the president alone", and stated that failing to first seek approval of Congress was in violation of the Constitution.Liberal Democrats in uproar over Libya action; Politico; March 19, 2011Dennis Kucinich: Obama's Libya Attack An Impeachable Offense; Talking Points Memo; March 21, 2011
On August 31, Al Jazeera reported that a document had been found in the headquarters of the Libyan intelligence agency which according to the author appears to be a summary of a conversation between Kucinich and an intermediary for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in which the congressman asked for information about the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC), possible links of it to al-Qaeda and corruption evidences, to lobby US lawmakers to put an end to NATO airstrikes and suspend their support for the NTC.Elshayyal, Jamal (August 31, 2011). Secret files: US officials aided Gaddafi. Al Jazeera. Accessed August 31, 2011 It also listed information necessary to defend Saif al-Islam against International Criminal Court war crimes charges. Kucinich defended himself in a message to The Atlantic Wire, saying that the document in question is simply a summary of Kucinich's public positions on the Libyan campaign by a Libyan bureaucrat who never consulted with Kucinich himself. "Al Jazeera found a document written by a Libyan bureaucrat to other Libyan bureaucrats. All it proves is that the Libyans were reading the Washington Post... Any implication I was doing anything other than trying to bring an end to an unauthorised war is fiction."Uri Friedman (August 31, 2011).

==Recognition==

In 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award, an annual award bestowed by the Religious Society of Friends-affiliated organization Promoting Enduring Peace.
After Kucinich lost to Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 Democratic primary, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said of Kucinich, "At the end of the day, we’re really going to miss Dennis. Dennis is a transformative leader. He stood up and spoke eloquently, passionately about Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran. He was a consistent voice for peace... He almost didn’t vote for the health care bill because it wasn’t good enough."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73757_Page2.html| author=Jonathan Allen and Alex Isenstadt| title=Dennis Kucinich loss is end of an era| publisher=Politico| date=March 7, 2012[/tpl]
