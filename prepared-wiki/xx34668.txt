Emo [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|oʊ[/tpl] is a style of rock music characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as "emotional hardcore" or "emocore" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.
As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.
Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre "screamo". In recent years the term "emo" has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds.
In addition to music, "emo" is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior.

==History==

===Precursors===

In the 1980s, many DC hardcore bands formed. Many of them were hardcore punk bands with as well as some post-hardcore bands. Post-hardcore is a subgenre of hardcore punk, only like post-punk is more melodic and experimental. Some of the styles of hardcore punk bands such as Minor Threat,Greenwald pg 12 The Faith,[tpl]cite web | url = http://files.nyu.edu/cch223/public/usa/albums/faith_subjecttochange.html | title = Subject to Change 12" EP | work = Kill from the Heart[/tpl] Black Flag,[tpl]cite web |url=http://punkmusic.about.com/od/punktionary/g/posthardcore.htm |title=Post-Hardcore - A Definition |author=Cooper, Ryan |work=About.com[/tpl] and Hüsker Dü[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rites-of-spring-mn0000282800/biography |title=Rites of Spring  Biography |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] were influential bands which influenced many emocore bands.

===Origins: 1980s===

Emo began off as a style of post-hardcore[tpl]cite web |url=http://punkmusic.about.com/od/punktionary/g/posthardcore.htm |title=Post-Hardcore - A Definition |author=Cooper, Ryan |work=About.com |accessdate=April 5, 2011[/tpl] and emerged from the hardcore punk scene of early-1980s Washington, D.C., both as a reaction to the increased violence within the scene and as an extension of the personal politics espoused by Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat, who had turned the focus of the music from the community back towards the individual.[tpl]cite book|last =Greenwald|first =Andy|authorlink =Andy Greenwald|title =Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo|publisher =St. Martin's Griffin|year =2003|location =New York|isbn =0-312-30863-9|pages=9–11[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Blush|first = Steven|authorlink = Steven Blush|title = American Hardcore: A Tribal History|publisher = Feral House|year = 2001|location = New York|isbn = 0-922915-71-7|page=157[/tpl] Minor Threat fan Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics.Greenwald, p. 12. Many of the band's themes would become familiar tropes in later generations of emo music, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation.Greenwald, pp. 12–13. Their performances became public emotional purges where audience members would sometimes weep.Greenwald, p. 13. MacKaye became a huge Rites of Spring fan, recording their only album and serving as their roadie, and soon formed a new band of his own called Embrace which explored similar themes of self-searching and emotional release.Greenwald,  p. 14. 
Similar bands soon followed in connection with the "Revolution Summer" of 1985, a deliberate attempt by members of the Washington, D.C. scene to break from the rigid constraints of hardcore in favor of a renewed spirit of creativity. Bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, Fire Party, Dag Nasty, Soulside, and Kingface were connected to this movement.
The exact origins of the term "emo" are uncertain, but date back to at least 1985. According to Andy Greenwald, author of Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo, "The origins of the term 'emo' are shrouded in mystery ... but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore." Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, also traces the word's origins to this time: 
"The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested, although the term and the approach thrived for at least another fifteen years, spawning countless bands."[tpl]cite book|last =Azerrad|first = Michael|authorlink =Michael Azerrad|title =Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981–1991|publisher =Little, Brown and Company|year =2001|location =New York|page =380|isbn =0-316-78753-1[/tpl] MacKaye also traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in Thrasher magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as "emo-core", which he called "the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my entire life."[tpl]cite web|last = Khanna| first = Vish|date = February 2007|url = http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=107|title = Timeline: Ian MacKaye - Out of Step|publisher = Exclaim.ca|accessdate = 2009-04-19[/tpl] Other accounts attribute the term to an audience member at an Embrace show, who yelled that the band was "emocore" as an insult.[tpl]cite web|last = DePasquale|first = Ron|title = Embrace: Biography|url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12874|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher = Allmusic|accessdate = 2009-04-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last = Popkin|first = Helen|title = What Exactly Is 'Emo,' Anyway?|date = 2006-03-26|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11720603/|work = MSNBC.com|publisher = MSNBC|accessdate = 2009-04-21[/tpl] Others contend that MacKaye coined the term when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.
The Oxford English Dictionary, however, dates the earliest usage of "emo-core" to 1992 and "emo" to 1993, with "emo" first appearing in print media in New Musical Express in 1995.[tpl]cite web|title = emo-core, n|url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00341634?query_type=word&queryword=emo-core&first=1&max_to_show=10&single=1&sort_type=alpha|work = Oxford English Dictionary|publisher  = Oxford University Press|accessdate = 2009-04-18[/tpl]
The "emocore" label quickly spread around the Washington, D.C. punk scene and became attached to many of the bands associated with Ian MacKaye's Dischord Records label. Although many of these bands simultaneously rejected the term, it stuck nonetheless. Scene veteran Jenny Toomey has recalled that "The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. of Spring existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music 'grunge,' where you were using the term even though you hated it."Greenwald, pp. 14–15.
The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years. By 1986 most of the major bands of the movement—including Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter, and Beefeater—had broken up.Greenwald, p. 15. Even so, the ideas and aesthetics originating from the scene spread quickly across the country via a network of homemade zines, vinyl records, and hearsay.Greenwald, pp. 15–17. According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for all subsequent incarnations of emo:
MacKaye and Picciotto, along with Rites of Spring drummer Brendan Canty, went on to form the highly influential band named Fugazi who, despite sometimes being connected with the term "emo", are not commonly recognized as an emo band.Greenwald, pp. 17–18. "Fugazi is one of the best and most influential groups of the last thirty years—and yet, despite some opinion to the contrary, they are not an emo band. Fugazi's fan base is too varied, too diffuse—its themes likewise. Fugazi is a living blueprint for a truly committed, punk/DIY artistic life once both the rage and the tears have faded. Making the group, perhaps, an emo doctoral program, but not emo. People have their preconceived ideas crushed by Fugazi, they don't have crushes on its members."

===Reinvention: Early 1990s===

As the ideals of the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, many bands in numerous local scenes began to emulate the sound as a way to marry the intensity of hardcore with the complex emotions associated with growing older.Greenwald, p. 18. The style combined the fatalism, theatricality, and outsiderness of The Smiths with the uncompromising and dramatic worldview of hardcore. Although the bands were numerous and the locales varied, the aesthetics of emocore in the late 1980s remained more or less the same: "over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music."
However, in the early 1990s, several new bands reinvented the emo style and carried its core characteristic, the intimacy between bands and fans, into the new decade.Greenwald, p. 19. Chief among these were Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate, both of whom fostered cult followings, recontextualized the word "emo", and brought it a step closer to the mainstream. According to Andy Greenwald:
In the wake of the 1991 success of Nirvana's Nevermind, underground music and subcultures in the United States became big business. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts were able to access the national stage. Teenagers across the country declared themselves fans of independent music, and being punk became mainstream. In this new musical climate, the aesthetics of emo expanded into the mainstream and altered the way the music was perceived: "Punk rock no-nos like the cult of personality and artistic abstraction suddenly become de rigueur", says Greenwald. "If one definition of emo has always been music that felt like a secret, Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate were cast in the rolls of the biggest gossips of all, reigning as the largest influences on every emo band that came after them."Greenwald, p. 20.

Jawbreaker has been referred to as "the Rosetta Stone of contemporary emo". Emerging from the San Francisco punk rock scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, their songwriting combined the heft of hardcore punk with pop punk sensibilities and the tortured artistry of mid-1980s emocore. Singer/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach focused his lyrics on topics that were personal, immediate, and lived, often lifting them directly from his journal.Greenwald, p. 21. Though they were often obscure and cloaked in metaphors, their specificity to Schwarzenbach's own concerns gave the words a bitterness and frustration that made them universal and magnetic to audiences.Greenwald, pp. 21–22.
Schwarzenbach became emo's first idol as listeners related to the singer more than the songs themselves. Jawbreaker's 1994 album 24 Hour Revenge Therapy became their most-loved amongst fans and is a touchstone of mid-1990s emo.Greenwald, pp. 24–25. "24 Hour Revenge Therapy is arguably Jawbreaker's best album, but it is also far and away its most loved". The band signed to major label Geffen Records and toured with Nirvana and Green Day, but their 1995 album Dear You sold poorly and they broke up soon after, with Schwarzenbach later forming Jets to Brazil.Greenwald, pp. 25–26. Their influence lived on, however, through later successful emo and pop punk bands openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound.Greenwald, p. 26.
