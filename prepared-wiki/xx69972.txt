Anthrocon (abbreviated AC) is the world's largest furry convention, taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania each June or July. Its focus is on furries: fictional anthropomorphic animal characters in art and literature. The convention was first held in 1997 in New York State, and draws over 5,000 attendees annually. Attendance in 2013 was 5,577, with a fursuit parade of 1,300 and an economic impact of $6.2 million.http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/furries-leave-visible-prints-downtown-and-in-pittsburghs-coffers-694266/

==Background and History==

Anthrocon was founded in 1997 as Albany Anthrocon (AAC) in New York State, with a membership of about 500. The convention was renamed to 'Anthrocon' and moved to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1999 and 2000; then to a larger hotel, the Adams Mark, on the outskirts of Philadelphia in 2001. Attendance grew each year, Anthrocon becoming the largest furry convention in 2001 with an attendance of 1,457; It has retained that position of the largest furry convention since. In 2004 it had climbed to 2,404 attendees in its final year at the Adams Mark.
Due to the unforeseen sale of the Adams Mark Hotel in November 2004, Anthrocon chose the Wyndham Franklin Plaza in Philadelphia as the site for its 2005 convention. Attendance that year dropped slightly to 2,373, due in part to higher parking fees, a different and unfamiliar hotel (the Wyndham Franklin Plaza in downtown Philadelphia), and possibly due to Hurricane Dennis's effect on the southern United States which closed many airports and prevented people from traveling. In June 2005, a contract with the Westin Convention Center Hotel in Pittsburgh was signed, and Anthrocon was scheduled to be held at the adjoining David L. Lawrence Convention Center between June 15 and 18, 2006. Despite concerns that the move to Pittsburgh would decrease attendance, it actually rose to 2,489, which was enough to ensure the future of the convention in Pittsburgh.
In 2007 Anthrocon was featured in the Guinness World Records (2008 Edition) as the "largest furry fan club" in the world. In 2008, Anthrocon became the first furry convention to have an attendance exceeding 3,000 members, the official count reaching 3,390. In 2009, attendance rose 11% to 3,776, and the Fursuit Parade count jumped to 640—a 41% increase.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/anthrocon/692864.html|title=Anthrocon 2009 – A Final Look Back|date=2009-07-07|author=John Cole[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/anthrocon/683660.html|title=A Bunch Of Anthrocon News Coverage In One Convenient Post!|author=Karl Jorgensen|date=2009-07-06[/tpl] Anthrocon 2009 brought approximately $3 million to the Pittsburgh economy.[tpl]Cite news| last = Brandolph | first = Adam  | title = Furry Convention $3 Million Cash Cow for City Businesses | publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date = June 28, 2008 | url = http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_575023.html | accessdate = 2009-04-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090414201132/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_575023.html| archivedate= 14 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Anthrocon 2010 had an attendance of 4,238, the first furry convention to exceed 4,000 members; and by 2012 saw 5,179 attendees, with a Fursuit Parade exceeding 1,000. The admission price was also set overall at $60 for a four day pass, though pre-registered attendees paid $50.[tpl]cite news |title=Are Furries Really So Bad? |author=Katie Notopoulos |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/are-furries-really-so-bad |newspaper=Buzzfeed |date=June 20, 2012 |accessdate=June 21, 2012[/tpl] In 2013, Anthrocon contracted roomspace with seven of Pittsburgh's ten downtown hotels.
The chairman of the convention since 1999, Dr. Samuel Conway (nicknamed "Kagemushi" or "Uncle Kage" among attendees), oversees the operations of Anthrocon, with the help of convention staff and volunteers who donate their time and energy throughout the weekend to assist the multitude of small tasks which arise. Since 1997, Anthrocon has raised more than $170,000 for animal-related charities.[tpl]Cite web|title=Anthrocon History|url=http://www.anthrocon.org/history|author=Anthrocon, Inc.|date=2006-03-29|accessdate=2007-04-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070404162720/http://www.anthrocon.org/history| archivedate= 4 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
