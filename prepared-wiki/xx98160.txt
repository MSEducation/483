==History==

OpenText originated in 1991 as a small four-person consulting operation. The company was a spin-off of a University of Waterloo project that developed technology used to index the Oxford English Dictionary. In partnership with colleagues from Oxford University, participants in the project included two professors of Computer Science, Dr. Frank Tompa and Dr. Gaston Gonnet, an undergrad Computer Science co-op student, Michael Knowles, along with their Faculty of Arts colleague, John Stubbs. Later founders of the business application of the technology developed during the course of this project include Tom Jenkins, who joined the company as COO in 1994 and Tim Bray. Tom Jenkins later became President and Chief Executive Officer. John Shackleton served as President from 1998–2011, and as CEO from 2005 - 2011. Today, Mark Barrenechea serves as President and CEO of OpenText, and Tom Jenkins as Executive Chairman.
