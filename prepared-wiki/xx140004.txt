The Hunt-Morgan House, historically known as Hopemont, is a Federal style residence in Lexington, Kentucky built in 1814 by John Wesley Hunt, the first millionaire west of the Alleghenies. The house is included in the Gratz Park Historic District. The Alexander T. Hunt Civil War Museum is located on the second floor of the Hunt-Morgan House.
Other notable people that resided at Hopemont include John Wesley Hunt's grandson, General John Hunt Morgan, a general in the Confederate Army. Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan, the first Kentuckian to win the Nobel Prize, was born in the house in 1866.
The House has many beautiful architectural features, including the Palladian window with fan and sidelights that grace its front fa√ßade. In 1955 the Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation was formed to save this home from impending demolition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluegrasstrust.org |title=Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation |accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation[/tpl] The organization restored the home to its Federal appearance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluegrasstrust.org/hunt-morgan.html |title=The Hunt-Morgan House |accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation[/tpl]
