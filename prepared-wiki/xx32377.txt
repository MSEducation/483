==Name==

Early meaning and usage of the name was a direct reference to Cannon Mills Corporation, or James William Cannon himself.  Early published name variations include Cannon-opolis and Cannapolis. A widely accepted origin of the word Kannapolis comes from the combination of the Greek words "kanna" (reeds, not looms) and "polis" (city), which some believed meant "City of Looms".[ref]
