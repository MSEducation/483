==History==

The old district office of Ongkharak was located in Tambon Bang O (now in Ban Na district). In 1889 King Chulalongkorn ordered to build Khlong Rangsit that link the Chao Phraya and Nakhon Nayok Rivers. The water gate in the Chao Phraya River was named Chulalongkorn Water Gate (ประตูน้ำจุฬาลงกรณ์), and its corresponding gate in the Nakhon Nayok River was named Saovabha Bhongsi Water Gate (ประตูน้ำเสาวภาผ่องศรี). The district office was moved to nearby the 16th Khlong of Khlong Rangsit. 20 years later, the office was moved to a place next to the Saovabha Bhongsi Water Gate. Now the district office is located behind Saovabha Market, 500 m from the old office.
