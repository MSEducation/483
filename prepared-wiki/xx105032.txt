[[Workweek and weekend]]

CATEGORIES: Working time, Weeks, Labor rights, Labour relations, Labor history

The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively.  The legal working week (British English), or workweek (U.S. English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most Western countries it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is a time period including Saturday and Sunday. Some people extend the weekend to Friday nights as well. In some Christian traditions, Sunday is the "Lord's Day" and the day of rest and worship. Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday, leading to a Friday-Saturday weekend in Israel. Muslim-majority countries usually have a Thursday-Friday or Friday-Saturday weekend. The French Revolutionary Calendar had ten-day weeks (called décades) and allowed décadi, one out of the ten days, as a leisure day.
The present-day concept of the weekend first arose from the Dies Solis (Day of the Sun) decreed by Emperor Constantine and from the Biblical Sabbath.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  The Christian Sabbath itself was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. Proposals have continued to be put forward for further reductions in the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.

==History==

In cultures with a six-day workweek, the day of rest derives from the culture's main religious tradition: Friday (Muslim), Saturday (Jewish and Seventh-day Adventist), and Sunday (most Christian). However, numerous countries have adopted a two day weekend over the past several decades, i.e. either Thursday-Friday, Friday-Saturday, or Saturday-Sunday.
The first five-day workweek in the United States was instituted by a New England cotton mill in 1908 to afford Jewish workers the ability to adhere to the Sabbath."Waiting for the Weekend" by Witold Rybczynski
In 1926 Henry Ford began shutting down his automotive factories for all of Saturday and Sunday. In 1929 the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first union to demand a five-day workweek and receive it. After that, the rest of the United States slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act mandating a maximum 40 hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.
Over the succeeding decades, particularly in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, an increasing number of countries adopted either a Friday-Saturday or Saturday-Sunday weekend to harmonize with international markets. For example, a series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the Middle East in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world, in terms of working hours, the length of the workweek, and the dates of the weekend.

==Reform==

Actual workweek lengths have been falling in the developed world. Every reduction of the length of the workweek has been accompanied by an increase in real per-capita income.Gapminder Foundation (2011) "Gapminder World" graph of working hours per week plotted against purchasing power- and inflation-adjusted GDP per capita over time gapminder.org
In the United States, the workweek length reduced slowly from before the Civil War to the turn of the 20th century. A rapid reduction took place from 1900 to 1920, especially between 1913 and 1919, when weekly hours fell by about eight percent.Hunnicutt, B.K. (1984) "The End of Shorter Hours" Labor History 25:373-404 In 1926, Henry Ford standardized on a five-day workweek, instead of the prevalent six days, without reducing employees' pay.Lombardo, C.N. (February 4, 2010) "Shorter Workweek in a Tough Economy" Wisconsin Employment Law Letter (hrhero.com) Hours worked stabilized at about 49 per week during the 1920s, and during the Great Depression fell below 40. During the Depression, President Herbert Hoover called for a reduction in work hours in lieu of layoffs. Later, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established a five-day, 40-hour workweek for many workers. The proportion of people working very long weeks has since risen, and the full-time employment of women has increased dramatically.Rones et al. (1997) "Trends in Hours of Work since the Mid-1970s" Monthly Labor Review 120(3):3-12 Hours worked per capita in the US increased 20 percent from 1970 to 2002.Horowitz, C.F. (August 30, 2004) "The Wrong Way to Shorten the Work Week" Mises Daily (The Ludwig von Mises Institute)
The New Economics Foundation has recommended moving to a 21 hour standard workweek to address problems with unemployment, high carbon emissions, low well-being, entrenched inequalities, overworking, family care, and the general lack of free time.Coote, A. et al. (2012) 21 Hours: Why a Shorter Working Week Can Help Us All to Flourish in the 21st Century (London: New Economics Foundation)Stuart, H. (January 7, 2012) "Cut the working week to a maximum of 20 hours, urge top economists" The GuardianSchachter, H. (February 10, 2012) "Save the world with a 3-day work week" Globe and MailBaker, D. (January 27, 2009) "Pass the stimulus - then help shorten the work week" New York Daily NewsAbate, T. (July 11, 2010) "Get to Work: Want more jobs? Shorten the workweek" San Francisco Chronicle page D-3 Other economists are concerned that shortening the work week will unfairly limit individual earning potential and weaken developed economies due to competition from the less regulated developing world. The Center for Economic and Policy Research states that reducing the length of the work week would slow climate change and have other environmental benefits."Reduced Work Hours as a Means of Slowing Climate Change" David Rosnick, February 2013

In Sweden, the standard working week is Monday to Friday, both for offices and industry workers. The standard workday is eight hours, although it may vary greatly between different fields and businesses. Most office workers have flexible working hours and can largely decide themselves on how to divide these over the week. The working week is regulated by Arbetstidslagen (Work time law) to a maximum of 40 hours per week.[tpl]cite web|title=Arbetstidslagen|url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/kapitel02.aspx|publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] The 40-hour-week is however easily bypassed by overtime. The law allows a maximum of 200 hours overtime per year.[tpl]cite web|title=Arbetstidslagen - Övertid|url=http://www.av.se/lagochratt/atl/Kapitel03.aspx|publisher=Arbetsmiljöverket|accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] There is however no overseeing government agency; the law is often cited as toothless[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]. In Sweden the workers are not paid for the standard 1 hour total break. Using the standard way of counting the hours, Sweden actually has a 45-hour working week.
Shops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays, supermarkets and shopping centres, so that employees there have to work. Traditionally, restaurants were closed on Mondays if they were opened during the weekend, but this has in recent years largely fallen out of practice. Many museums do however still remain closed on Mondays.

====United Kingdom====

The normal business working week is from Monday to Friday (35 to 40 hours depending on contract).
Laws for shop opening hours differ between Scotland and the rest of the UK. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, many shops and services are open on Saturdays and increasingly so on Sundays as well.  In England and Wales, stores' hours on a Sunday are determined by the total floor space of a store.http://www.bizhelp24.com/law/business-trading-hours-law.html In Scotland however there is no restriction in law on shop opening hours on a Sunday.
The EU Working Time Directive regulates that workers cannot be forced to work for more than 48 hours per week on average (although the UK allows individuals to opt out if they so choose). The minimum holiday entitlement is now 28 days per year but that does not have to include public holidays depending on the employee's contract.http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10029788 England & Wales have eight, Scotland has nine, and Northern Ireland has ten permanent Public Holiday days per year.http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_073741Directgov: Working time limits (the 48-hour week), business trading hours law.

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, there is no longer any official distinction between the working week and weekend, the former six-day working week having been abandoned in 2006.

Most office jobs work on Monday to Friday 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (1:00 to 2:00 p.m. for lunch break) usually. However, it is noted that employees have to work unpaid overtime for several hours per day in common.

===India===

The standard working week in India for most office jobs begins on Monday and ends on Saturday. Work schedule is 48 hours per week, Sunday being rest day. Due to power shortages in some states, industrial areas have power shutdowns on staggered days of the week across the state. Hence each area may follow a different rest day for industry. Almost all industries follow a standard 48 hour workweek. All major industries along with services like transport, hospitality, healthcare etc. work in shifts.
Central government offices follow a 5 day week. State governments follow half day work on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays of each month and rest on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays, except West Bengal's government which follows a Monday - Friday workweek. There is usually no half working day in the private sector. The software industry follows a 5 day week at 40 or 44 hours a week.
Generally establishments other than those having pure desk jobs are open till late evening in most cities, offering more flexibility of time to visitors. Most stores are open for 6 or 7 days a week. Retail shops in malls are open on all days. Doctors are mostly available in morning and evening in their clinics and at hospitals during day. Doctors usually work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Senior doctors and surgeons work more. Most visiting doctors attached to hospitals visit on all days.

Most eateries close between 9 to 11 p.m. Many highway restaurants called dhabas are open for 24 hours a day. Dhabas are available in large numbers on all major state and national highways; outside city or village limits. Some highway fuel stations are open for 24 hours. Overall India works longer hours in most areas than most of the world and offers more flexibility of time for visitors.

===Muslim countries===

====Thursday–Friday weekend====

Friday is the Muslim holy day when Jumu'ah prayers take place. After Saudi Arabia changed its weekend to Friday-Saturday in 2013, only Afghanistan still adheres to this weekend scheme.

====Friday weekend (One day weekend)====

Only two countries in the world, have Friday as the only weekend day and have a six-day working week.

====Friday–Saturday weekend====

Following reforms in a number of Arab states in the Persian Gulf in the 2000s and 2010s, the Thursday–Friday weekend was replaced by the Friday–Saturday weekend. This change provided for the Muslim offering of Friday Jumu'ah prayers and afforded more work days to coincide with the working calendars of international financial markets.

====Saturday–Sunday weekend====

Other countries with Muslim-majority populations or significant Muslim populations follow the Saturday–Sunday weekend, such as Lebanon, Turkey, and Tunisia. While Friday is a working day, a long midday break is given to allow time for worship. Those countries are:

====Non-contiguous working week====

Brunei Darussalam has a non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday to Thursday plus Saturday. The days of rest are Friday and Sunday.
Some non-government companies in Brunei adopted the working week of Monday to Friday, while the weekend starts on Saturday until Sunday. Depending on the company rules, employees may required to work half-day on Saturday.

===Israel===

For most Israelis, the working week begins on Sunday and ends on Thursday or Friday midday to accommodate Jewish Sabbath, which begins Friday night.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amcham.co.il/categoryblog/461-facts-about-israel |title=Facts About Israel |publisher=Israel-America Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl] The standard working week is 43 hours per week.

===Japan===

The standard business office working week in Japan begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week. This system became common between 1980 and 2000. Before then, most workers in Japan worked full-time from Monday to Friday and a half day on Saturday (called "Han don", means half-holiday. "don" from the Dutch word "Zondag"), 45–48 hours per week. On Friday many people say "HanaKin," which means "flowery Friday." Public schools and facilities (excluding city offices) are also open on Saturdays. 
However, it should be noted that most Japanese company staff will work in excess of 60 hours a week, through mainly unpaid overtime.

===Mexico===

Mexico has a 40 hour workweek running from Monday to Friday. However, it is a custom in most industries and trades to work half day on Saturday, which is the day workers get paid. Shops and retailers open on Saturday and Sunday in most large cities.

===Mongolia===

Mongolia has a Monday to Friday working week, with a normal maximum time of 40 hours. Most shops are also open on weekends, many large retail chains having full opening hours even on Sunday. Private enterprises conduct business from 9:00 to 18:00, and government institutions may have full working hours.

===Nepal===

Nepal follows the ancient Vedic calendar, which has the resting day on Saturday and the first day of the working week on Sunday.Vedic Books, The Vedic Week. Schools in Nepal are off on Saturdays, so it is common for pupils to go to school from Sunday to Friday.
In November 2012, the home ministry proposed a two day holiday per week plan for all government offices except at those providing essential services like electricity, water, and telecommunications.http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=44273 This proposal followed a previous proposal by the Nepali government, i.e. Load-shedding Reduction Work Plan 2069 BS, for a five working day plan for government offices as part of efforts to address the problem of load-shedding. The proposal has been discussed in the Administration Committee; it is not yet clear whether the plan includes private offices and educational institutions.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand the working week is typically Monday to Friday 8:30 to 17:00, but it is not uncommon for many industries (especially construction) to work a half day on Saturday, normally from 8:00 or 9:00 to about 13:00. Supermarkets, malls, independent retailers, and increasingly, banks, remain open seven days a week.

===Russia===

In Russia the common working week begins on Monday and ends on Friday with 8 hours per day.
Federal law defines a working week duration of 5 or 6 days with no more than 40 hours worked. In all cases Sunday is a holiday. With a 5-day working week the employer chooses which day of the week will be the second day off. Usually this is a Saturday, but in some organizations (mostly government), it is Monday. Government offices can thereby offer Saturday service to people with a normal working schedule.
There are non-working public holidays in Russia; all of them fall on a fixed date. By law, if such a holiday coincides with an ordinary day off, the next work day becomes a day off. An official public holiday cannot replace a regular day off. Each year the government can modify working weeks near public holidays in order to optimize the labor schedule. For example, if a five-day week has a public holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the calendar is rearranged to provide a reasonable working week.
Exceptions include occupations such as transit workers, shop assistants, and security guards. In many cases independent schemes are used. For example, the service industry often uses the X-through-Y scheme (Russian: X через Y) when every worker uses X days for work and the next Y days for rest.

====Soviet Union====

In the Soviet Union the standard working week was 41 hours: 8 hours, 12 min. Monday to Friday.
Before the mid-1960s there was a 42 hour 6-day standard working week: 7 hours Monday to Friday and 6 hours on Saturday.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, the common working week is 5-day work week, which runs from Monday to Friday beginning 8.30am and end at 5pm - 6pm. Some companies work a half day on Saturdays. Shops, supermarkets and malls are open seven days a week and on most public holidays.

===South Africa===

In South Africa the working week traditionally was Monday to Friday with a half-day on Saturday and Sunday a public holiday. However since 2013 there have been changes to the working week concept based on more than one variation. The week can be 5 days of work, or more. The maximum number of hours someone can work in a week remains 45. http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/legislation/acts/basic-guides/basic-guide-to-working-hours

===Thailand===

In Thailand, the working week is Monday to Saturday for a maximum of 44 to 48 hours per week (Saturday is usually a half or full day).
However, government offices and some private companies have modernised through enacting the American and European standard of working Monday through Friday.
Currently, 50% of the luxury beach resorts in Phuket have a five-day working week. 23% of the remaining 50% have taken steps to reform their 6-day workweek through such measures as reducing the working week from 6 days to 5.5 days.

===United States===

The standard working week in the United States begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week, with Saturday and Sunday being weekend days. Most stores are open for business on Saturday and may be open a full or half-day on Sunday as well, except where prohibited by law (see Blue law). Increasingly, employers are offering compressed work schedules to employees.  Many government and corporate employees now work 80 hours over 9 days during a two-week period (commonly 9 hour days Monday to Thursday, 8 hours on one Friday, and off the following Friday).  Jobs in healthcare, law enforcement, transportation, retail, and other service positions commonly require employees to work on the weekend or to do shift work.http://blog.tnsemployeeinsights.com/?p=2013
