Sæberht, Saberht or SæbertHis name is alternatively written as Saebert, Sabert or Sebert. (d. c. 616) was a King of Essex (r. c. 604 – c. 616), in succession of his father King Sledd. He is known as the first East Saxon king to have been converted to Christianity.
The principal source for his reign is the early 8th-century Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum by Bede (d. 735), who claims to have derived his information about the missionary work of Mellitus among the East Saxons from Abbot Albinus of Canterbury through the London priest Nothhelm, later Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 739).Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Book 2, chapters 3, 5 and 6. Other sources include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, an imperfectly preserved genealogy possibly of the late 9th century (London, BL MS Add. 23211) and a handful of genealogies and regnal lists written down by Anglo-Norman historians.

==Family==

The genealogies and regnal lists are unanimous in describing Sæberht as the son of Sledd, who may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon dynasty.Yorke, "The Kingdom of the East Saxons", pp. 15-6. According to Bede, Sæberht's mother was Ricula, a sister of King Æthelberht of Kent.Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Book 2, chapter 3.
Bede omits the names of Sæberht's sons,Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. but one name is given in the genealogy of MS Add. 23211 as Saweard.Yorke, "The Kingdom of the East Saxons", p. 4.

==Conversion and succession==

In 604, the Gaulish churchman Mellitus was consecrated by AugustineFryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 219. as bishop in the province of the East Saxons, which had a capital at London, making him the first Bishop of London.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 11–13a 
Bede tells that Sæberht converted to Christianity in 604Hindley, Geoffrey A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons: The beginnings of the English nation New York: Carrol & Graf Publishers 2006 ISBN 978-0-7867-1738-5 p. 33-36 and was baptised by Mellitus, while his sons remained pagan.Bede,  Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MSS A,B and C) s.a. 604. Sæberht then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church which was built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht, though a charter which claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a forgery.

==Death==

Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died in 616, leaving the Gregorian mission without strong patrons. Sæberht's pagan sons drove Mellitus from London.Hindley A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 36 According to Bede's explanation, this happened because Mellitus refused the brothers' request for a taste of the sacramental bread.Brooks "Mellitus (d. 624)" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 
Later medieval legend claimed that Sæberht and his wife Ethelgoda had founded the original abbey building at the site of the present Westminster Abbey, and that they had been buried in the church.[tpl]cite book |title= Westminster Abbey and its people, c.1050-c.1216|last= Mason|first= Emma |authorlink= |year= 1996 |page= 2|publisher=Boydell & Brewer[/tpl] In the reign of Henry III their supposed remains were transferred into a tomb which the king had especially erected for them close to the entrance of the Royal Chapels.[tpl]cite book |title= Old and New London |last= Thornbury |first= Walter |authorlink= George_Walter_Thornbury |year= 1878 |volume= 3 |location= London |pages= 431–450 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45166 |accessdate= 25 January 2011[/tpl] There is however, no genuine evidence to support this tradition.[tpl]cite book |title= Westminster Abbey|last= Jenkyns|first= Richard |authorlink= |year= 2004 |page= 10|publisher= Harvard University Press[/tpl]

===Prittlewell burial===

In 2003 a high-status Anglo-Saxon tomb was discovered at Prittlewell in Essex. The artefacts found were of a quality that it is likely that Prittlewell was a tomb of one of the Kings of Essex and the discovery of golden foil crosses indicates that the inhabitant was an early Christian. As the evidence points to an early seventh century date, Sæberht is considered the most likely candidate for the burial,Channel 4 Time Team, Prittlewell Southend, The name of the king Holland, Jennifer S., 2005, "Crossing Over," National Geographic "Geographica," March 2005  although other possibilities such as his Christian grandson Sigeberht the Good, or an unknown individual of high status, cannot be ruled out.Blair, I., Barham, E., and Blackmore, L.
