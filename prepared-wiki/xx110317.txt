==History==

KJRB has had a long and colorful history showcasing many famous announcers  including Randy Evans and Treasure Goodtimes (now known as Ichabod Caine and Scallops), Larry Lujack, Charlie Brown, Jim Kampmann, Joe Michaels, Commander Dunk (Jack Gordon), Ross Woodward, Norm Gregory, Brian Gregory, Rick Shannon, Suds Coleman, Rick Rydell, Marie McCallister, Steve West, Ralph Koal, Frank Hanel and Sunshine Shelly Monahan.  KJRB's call letters originally reflected the fact that it had been owned by Kaye-Smith Enterprises, the owners of Top 40 KJR in Seattle. KJRB moved towards an oldies format in the 1980s, a news/talk station in the early 1990s, and sports as 790 The Fan, from 1999 until April 2008, when the sports format was moved to sister station KGA. In return, KGA's news/talk format moved to KJRB. During the station's tenure as a sports station, KJRB also broadcast "hot talk" shows such as Don and Mike, Tom Leykis, and, until his retirement, Phil Hendrie, and featured programing from Fox Sports Radio, Sporting News Radio and Westwood One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=KJRB |title=KJRB Facility Record |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division [/tpl]
