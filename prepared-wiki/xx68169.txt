The United Confederate Veterans (UCV) was an American Civil War veterans organization in the United States.

==History==

===Formation===

The UCV was born in 1889, in New Orleans, Louisiana, at a meeting of fifty-two delegates from nine separate local organizations. There had been numerous local veterans associations in the South, and many (but not all) of these became part of the UCV. The organization grew rapidly throughout the 1890s culminating with 1,555 camps represented at the 1898 reunion. The next few years marked the zenith of UCV membership, lasting until 1903 or 1904, when veterans began to die off rather rapidly and the organization went into a gradual but continuous decline.Hattaway, p. 214.

===Purpose===

The UCV, like any other proper American organization, felt it had to outline its purposes and structure in a written constitution. The veterans based their pattern upon military lines. Members holding appropriate UCV "ranks" officered and staffed echelons of command from General Headquarters at the top to local camps (companies) at the bottom. Their announced purpose was emphatically nonmilitary-to foster "social, literary, historical, and benevolent" ends.Hattaway, p. 215.

===Reunions===

The national organization assembled annually in a general convention and social reunion, presided over by the Commander-in-Chief. These annual reunions served the UCV as an aid in achieving its goals. Convention cities made elaborate preparations and tried to put on bigger spectacles than the previous hosts. The gatherings continued to be held long after the membership peak had passed and despite fewer veterans, they gradually grew in attendance, length and splendor. Numerous veterans brought family and friends along too, further swelling the crowds. Many Southerners considered the occasions major social events. Perhaps thirty thousand veterans and another fifty thousand visitors attended each of the mid and late 1890 reunions, and the numbers increased. In 1911 an estimated crowd of 106,000 members and guests crammed into Little Rock, Arkansas-A city of less than one-half that size. Then the passing years began taking a telling toll and the reunions gre smaller. But still the meetings continued until finally in 1950 at the sixtieth reunion only onemember could attend, 98-year-old Commander-in-Chief James Moore of Selma, Alabama.Hattaway, p. 215.

===Confederate Veteran===

In addition to national meetings, another prominent factor contributed to the growth and popularity of the UCV. This was a monthly magazine which became the official UCV organ, the Confederate Veteran. Founded as  an independent publishing venture in January 1893, by Sumner Cunningham, the UCV adopted it the following year. Cunningham personally edited the magazine for twenty-one years and bequeathed almost his entire estate to insure its continuance. The magazine was of a very high quality and circulation was wide. Many veterans penned recollections or articles for publication in its pages. Readership always greatly exceeded circulation because numerous camps and soldiers' homes received one or two copies for their numerous occupants. An average of sixty-five hundred copies were printed per issue during the first year of publication, for example, but Cunningham estimated that fifty thousand people read the twelfth issue.Hattaway, pp. 215â€“16.
