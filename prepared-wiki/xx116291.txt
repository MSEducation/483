==Production background==

The film, featuring James Kirkwood, Sr., Bessie Love and Lucille Ricksen, portrayed the dangers of drug addiction, and was shown across the country by Davenport herself, billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid, in an early example of what would later be called a roadshow engagement. The film was co-produced with Thomas Ince and distributed by Film Booking Offices of America.
Four days before Wallace Reid's death, the movie studios appointed Will H. Hays as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. Although it took some years for the Hays Code to be finalized, the Code did set certain standards for movies early on, including a ban on any reference to drug use. Despite this, Davenport received a dispensation from Hays allowing her to produce Human Wreckage because of its anti-drug message.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=VoRog0VP0J0C | first = Karen Ward | last = Mahar | title = Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood | location= Baltimore | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8018-8436-5 | page = 150 [/tpl]
According to the website SilentEra, the film was banned by the British Board of Film Censors in 1924.
In 1924, again billed as "Mrs. Wallace Reid", Davenport produced, starred in and toured with a film about excessive mother-love called Broken Laws. The following year's The Red Kimona dealt with white slavery, a film over which Davenport was successfully sued.
