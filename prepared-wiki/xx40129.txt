This is the list of the Presidents of the Italian Republic with the title [tpl]lang|it|Presidente della Repubblica[/tpl] since 1948. The Quirinal Palace (known in Italian as the [tpl]lang|it|Quirinale[/tpl]) in Rome is the official residence of the President of the Italian Republic. 
The eleven Presidents came from only five Regions: three from Campania (all born in Naples) and Piedmont, two from Sardinia (both born in Sassari) and Tuscany, and one from Liguria.

==Election==

The President of the Republic is elected by Parliament in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. In addition, the 20 regions of Italy appoint 58 representatives as special electors. Three representatives come from each region, save for the Aosta Valley, which appoints one, so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities. 
According to the Constitution, the election must be held in the form of secret ballot, with the 315 Senators, the 630 Deputies and the 58 regional representatives all voting. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting; after that, a majority suffices. The election is presided over by the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the Palazzo Montecitorio, home of the Chamber of Deputies, which is expanded and re-configured for the event. 
The President assumes office after having taken an oath before Parliament and delivering a presidential address.

Traditionally, Presidents have not been members of any political party during their tenure, in order to be considered above partisan interests. The parties shown are those to which the President belonged at the time they took office.

==Substitution of the Head of State==

In various occasions, in the history of the Italian republic, officials had to step in in the absence of a Head of State (e.g. in the case of a President's resignation or ill health). Only Enrico De Nicola, who was elected as Provisional Head of State by the Constitutional Assembly on 28 June 1946, had an official title and took residence in the Quirinal Palace. All the other men took only the powers, but not the title, of Head of State. After the adoption of the Italian Constitution in 1948, the President of the Senate is eligible to take the powers of Head of State in case of absence of the President of the Republic.
