==Theoretical contributions==

Woodford's early research topics included sunspot equilibria,[tpl]cite journal |last=Woodford |first=Michael |year=1990 |title=Learning to believe in sunspots |journal=Econometrica |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=287–307 |jstor=2938205 [/tpl] and imperfect competition.[tpl]cite book |last=Rotemberg |first=Julio |first2=Michael |last2=Woodford |year=1995 |chapter=Dynamic general equilibrium models with imperfectly competitive product markets |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Cooley |title=Frontiers of Business Cycle Research |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-04323-X [/tpl] Thereafter he began to work on macroeconomic models with sticky prices; together with Julio Rotemberg he developed one of the first  microfounded New Keynesian macroeconomic models.[tpl]cite journal |last=Rotemberg |first=Julio J. |first2=Michael |last2=Woodford |year=1997 |title=An optimization-based econometric framework for the evaluation of monetary policy |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=12 |issue= |pages=297–346 |jstor=3585236 [/tpl] Since then he has used this framework to study many topics related to monetary policy, including the fiscal theory of the price level,[tpl]cite journal |last=Woodford |first=Michael |year=2001 |title=Fiscal requirements for price stability |journal=Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=669–728 |jstor=2673890 [/tpl] the effectiveness of monetary policy as consumers use more credit and less cash,[tpl]cite journal |last=Woodford |first=Michael |year=1998 |title=Doing without money: controlling inflation in a post-monetary world |journal=Review of Economic Dynamics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=173–219 |doi=10.1006/redy.1997.0006 [/tpl] and inflation targeting rules.[tpl]cite book |last=Giannoni |first=Marc P. |last2=Woodford |first2=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=Optimal inflation targeting rules |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Bernanke |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Woodford |title=The Inflation-Targeting Debate |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |pages=93–172 |isbn=0-226-04472-6 [/tpl] Michael Woodford has especially praised Knut Wicksell's advocacy of using the interest rate to maintain price stability, noting that this was a remarkable insight at a time when most monetary policy was based on the gold standard (Woodford, 2003, p. 32). Woodford calls his own framework 'neo-Wicksellian', and he titled his textbook on monetary policy in homage to Wicksell's work.

==Interest and Prices==

Woodford is probably best known as the author of an advanced textbook on monetary macroeconomics entitled Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy.[tpl]cite book|last=Woodford|first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Interest and prices: Foundations of a theory of monetary policy |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-01049-8 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Green |first=Edward |year=2005 |doi=10.1257/0022051053737799 |title=A review of Interest and Prices |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=43 |issue= |pages=121–134 [/tpl] The book has, in the words of the Deutsche Bank Prize Committee, “quickly become the standard reference for monetary theory and analysis among academic economists and their colleagues at central banks.”[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.ifk-cfs.de/index.php?id=939 |title=Michael Woodford: The Prize Winner 2007 |date=October 4, 2007 |work= [/tpl]
