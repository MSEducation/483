In Internet slang, a troll ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|oʊ|l[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|l[/tpl]) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011026130853/http://members.aol.com/intwg/trolls.htm|title=Internet Trolls|date=July 2001|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl]
by posting inflammatory,[tpl]cite web | title=Definition of troll | work=Collins English Dictionary | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/troll | accessdate=2012-09-17 [/tpl] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response
or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.
This sense of the word troll and its associated verb trolling are associated with Internet discourse, but have been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with online harassment. For example, mass media has used troll to describe "a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families."

==Usage==

Application of the term troll is subjective. Some readers may characterize a post as trolling, while others may regard the same post as a legitimate contribution to the discussion, even if controversial. Like any pejorative term, it can be used as an ad hominem attack, suggesting a negative motivation.
As noted in an OS News article titled "Why People Troll and How to Stop Them" (January 25, 2012), "The traditional definition of trolling includes intent. That is, trolls purposely disrupt forums. This definition is too narrow. Whether someone intends to disrupt a thread or not, the results are the same if they do."[tpl]cite news|journal=OS News|title=Why People Troll and How to Stop Them|author= Howard Fosdick|date=Wed 25th Jan 2012 06:58 UTC|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/25540[/tpl][tpl]cite news|journal=CollegeNET|title=Terminology: Trolling in CNet?!?|author= Tastam90, Message # 369489 |date= Jun 9, 2013  [/tpl] Others have addressed the same issue, e.g., Claire Hardaker, in her Ph.D. thesis "Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions",[tpl]cite doi| 10.1515/JPLR.2010.011[/tpl] and Dr. Phil.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Popular recognition of the existence (and prevalence) of non-deliberate, "accidental trolls", has been documented widely, in sources as diverse as the Urban Dictionary,[tpl]cite news|journal=Urban Dictionary|title=Accidental Troll|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Accidental%20Troll[/tpl] Nicole Sullivan's keynote speech at the 2012 Fluent Conference, titled "Don't Feed the Trolls"[tpl]cite news|title=DE-TROLLING THE WEB: DON'T POST IN ANGER|date=June 4, 2012 |url=http://christianheilmann.com/2012/06/04/de-trolling-the-web-dont-post-in-anger/|date=2012-06-04[/tpl] Gizmodo,[tpl]cite news|author=Mat Honan|date=Jan 6, 2012|title=Why We Troll|url=http://gizmodo.com/5873503/why-we-troll[/tpl] online opinions on the subject written by Silicon Valley executives[tpl]cite news|author==Mike Elgan|journal=Google+|date=Jan 6, 2012|title=What is a troll?|url=https://plus.google.com/+MikeElgan/posts/YqoAHnDT18J [/tpl] and comics.[tpl]cite news|journal=RageComics|title=Accidental troll mom rage|url=http://ragecomics.com/c/64kp/accidental-troll-mom-rage|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]
Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities. Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore it,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=It is commonly said to be the most effective way, but are there any studies, or only anecdotes?[/tpl] because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive posts[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]hence the often-seen warning: "Please do not feed the trolls".
A popular early article defining and explaining the issue of Internet Trolls included the suggestion, "The only way to deal with trolls is to limit your reaction to reminding others not to respond to trolls."
The "trollface" is an image occasionally used to indicate trolling in Internet culture.Trollface hack strikes PlayStation 3? PSU community member reports XMB weirdness."Pasta" y "MasterDog" ya son parte de la jerga universitaria."Forever Alone" y "Ay sí, ay sí", entre los más populares.

==Origin and etymology==

There are competing theories of where and when troll was first used in Internet slang, with numerous unattested accounts of BBS and UseNet origins in the early 80s or before.
The origin of the English noun troll in the standard sense of ugly dwarf or giant dates to 1610 and comes from the Old Norse word 'troll' meaning giant or demon.[tpl]OEtymD|troll||accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl]
The word evokes the trolls of Scandinavian folklore and children's tales, where they are at times beings bent on mischief and wickedness.[tpl]cite web|title=Trolls. Who are they?|url=http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs991a/troll.html|publisher=unknown|accessdate=July 3, 2013[/tpl]
In modern English usage, trolling may describe the fishing technique of slowly dragging a lure or baited hook from a moving boat[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/troll|title=troll|year=2010|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] whereas trawling describes the generally commercial act of dragging a fishing net.
Early non-Internet related slang use of trolling for actions deliberately performed to provoke a reaction can be found in the military—by 1972 the term trolling for MiGs was documented in use by US Navy pilots in Vietnam.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Life |date=February 4, 1972 |author=John Saar |title=Carrier War |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EkAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28[/tpl]
The contemporary slang use of the term is alleged to have appeared on the Internet in the late 1980s,
but the earliest known attestation is from the OED in 1992.
Another claim sets the origin in Usenet in the early 1990s as in the phrase "trolling for newbies", as used in alt.folklore.urban (AFU).
Commonly, what is meant is a relatively gentle inside joke by veteran users, presenting questions or topics that had been so overdone that only a new user would respond to them earnestly. For example, a veteran of the group might make a post on the common misconception that glass flows over time. Long-time readers would both recognize the poster's name and know that the topic had been discussed a lot, but new subscribers to the group would not realize, and would thus respond. These types of trolls served as a practice to identify group insiders. This definition of trolling, considerably narrower than the modern understanding of the term, was considered a positive contribution.
One of the most notorious AFU trollers, David Mikkelson, went on to create the urban folklore website Snopes.com.
By the late 1990s, alt.folklore.urban had such heavy traffic and participation that trolling of this sort was frowned upon. Others expanded the term to include the practice of playing a seriously misinformed or deluded user, even in newsgroups where one was not a regular; these were often attempts at humor rather than provocation. In such contexts, the noun troll usually referred to an act of trolling — or to the resulting discussion — rather than to the author.

===In other languages===

In Chinese, trolling is referred to as bái mù ([tpl]zh|c=白目|l=white eye[/tpl]), which can be straightforwardly explained as "eyes without pupils", in the sense that whilst the pupil of the eye is used for vision, the white section of the eye cannot see, and trolling involves blindly talking nonsense over the internet, having total disregard to sensitivities or being oblivious to the situation at hand, akin to having eyes without pupils. An alternative term is bái làn ([tpl]zh|c=白爛|l=white rot[/tpl]), which describes a post completely nonsensical and full of folly made to upset others, and derives from a Taiwanese slang term for the male genitalia, where genitalia that is pale white in colour represents that someone is young, and thus foolish. Both terms originate from Taiwan, and are also used in Hong Kong and mainland China. Another term, xiǎo bái ([tpl]zh|c=小白|l=little white[/tpl]) is a derogatory term that refers to both bái mù and bái làn that is used on anonymous posting internet forums. Another common term for a troll used in mainland China is pēn zi ([tpl]zh|c=噴子|l=sprayer, spurter[/tpl]).
In Japanese, [tpl]nihongo|tsuri|釣り[/tpl] means "fishing" and refers to intentionally misleading posts whose only purpose is to get the readers to react, i.e. get trolled. [tpl]nihongo|arashi|荒らし[/tpl] means "laying waste" and can also be used to refer to simple spamming.
In Icelandic, þurs (a thurs) or tröll (a troll) may refer to trolls, the verbs þursa (to troll) or þursast (to be trolling, to troll about) may be used.
In Korean, nak-si (낚시) means "fishing", and is used to refer to Internet trolling attempts, as well as purposefully misleading post titles. A person who recognizes the troll after having responded (or, in case of a post title nak-si, having read the actual post) would often refer to himself as a caught fish.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In Portuguese, more commonly in its Brazilian variant, troll (produced [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈtɾɔw|[/tpl] in most of Brazil as spelling pronunciation) is the usual term to denote internet trolls (examples of common derivate terms are trollismo or trollagem, "trolling", and the verb trollar, "to troll", which entered popular use), but an older expression, used by those which want to avoid anglicisms or slangs, is complexo do pombo enxadrista to denote trolling behavior, and pombos enxadristas (literally, "chessplayer pigeons") or simply pombos are the terms used to name the trolls. The terms are explained by an adage or popular saying: "Arguing with fulano (i.e., John Doe) is the same as playing chess with a pigeon: the pigeon defecates on the table, drop the pieces and simply fly, claiming victory."
In Thai, the term "krean" (เกรียน) has been adopted to address Internet trolls. The term literally refers to a closely cropped hairstyle worn by most school boys in Thailand, thus equating Internet trolls to school boys. The term "tob krean" (ตบเกรียน), or "slapping a cropped head", refers to the act of posting intellectual replies to refute and cause the messages of Internet trolls to be perceived as unintelligent.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
In Sinhala Language this is called ala kiríma (අල කිරීම), which means "Turning it into Potatoes (Sabotage)". Sometimes it is used as ala vagaa kiríma (අල වගා කිරීම) – "Planting Potatoes". People/Profiles who does trolling often are called "Potato Planters" – ala vagákaruvan (අල වගාකරුවන්). This seems to be originated from university slang ala veda (අල වැඩ) which means "Potato business" is used for breaking the laws/codes of the university.

==Trolling, identity, and anonymity==

Early incidents of trollingStevan Harnad (1987/2011) "Sky-Writing, Or, When Man First Met Troll" The Atlantic were considered to be the same as flaming, but this has changed with modern usage by the news media to refer to the creation of any content that targets another person. The Internet dictionary NetLingo suggests there are four grades of trolling: playtime trolling, tactical trolling, strategic trolling, and domination trolling.
The relationship between trolling and flaming was observed in open-access forums in California, on a series of modem-linked computers. CommuniTree was begun in 1978 but was closed in 1982 when accessed by high school teenagers, becoming a ground for trashing and abuse.[tpl]cite news |title=How the internet created an age of rage |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/24/internet-anonymity-trolling-tim-adams |publisher=The Guardian (The Observer)|date= 24 July 2011 |location=London |first=Tim |last=Adams[/tpl] Some psychologists have suggested that flaming would be caused by deindividuation or decreased self-evaluation: the anonymity of online postings would lead to disinhibition amongst individuals[tpl]cite journal|author=S. Kiesler, J. Siegel and T.W. McGuire|title=Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication|journal=American Psychologist|volume=39|pages=1123–1134|year=1984|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.10.1123|issue=10[/tpl] Others have suggested that although flaming and trolling is often unpleasant, it may be a form of normative behavior that expresses the social identity of a certain user group [tpl]cite journal|author=M. Lea, T. O'Shea, P. Fung and R. Spears|title='Flaming' in Computer-Mediated Communication: observation, explanations, implications|journal=Contexts of Computer-Mediated Communication|pages=89–112|year=1992[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Postmes, T., Spears, R., & Lea, M.|title=Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE-effects of computer-mediated communication|journal=Communication Research|pages=689–715|issue=25|year=1998[/tpl]
According to Tom Postmes, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the universities of Exeter, England, and Groningen, The Netherlands, and the author of Individuality and the Group, who has studied online behavior for 20 years, "Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure."
In academic literature, the practice of trolling was first documented by Judith Donath (1999). Donath's paper outlines the ambiguity of identity in a disembodied "virtual community" such as Usenet:

Donath provides a concise overview of identity deception games which trade on the confusion between physical and epistemic community:
[tpl]quote|Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players. The troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant, sharing the group's common interests and concerns; the newsgroups members, if they are cognizant of trolls and other identity deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from trolling postings, and upon judging a poster a troll, make the offending poster leave the group. Their success at the former depends on how well they[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and the troll[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]understand identity cues; their success at the latter depends on whether the troll's enjoyment is sufficiently diminished or outweighed by the costs imposed by the group.[/tpl]
Trolls can be costly in several ways. A troll can disrupt the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trolling[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]where the rate of deception is high[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]many honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings. This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one's online reputation.
Susan Herring and colleagues in "Searching for Safety Online: Managing 'Trolling' in a Feminist Forum" point out the difficulty inherent in monitoring trolling and maintaining freedom of speech in online communities: "harassment often arises in spaces known for their freedom, lack of censure, and experimental nature".
Free speech may lead to tolerance of trolling behavior, complicating the members' efforts to maintain an open, yet supportive discussion area, especially for sensitive topics such as race, gender, and sexuality.
In an effort to reduce uncivil behavior by increasing accountability, many web sites (e.g. Reuters, Facebook, and Gizmodo) now require commenters to register their names and e-mail addresses.J. Zhao, Where Anonymity Breeds Contempt, NY Times, 29 Nov 2010.

==Psychological characteristics of trolls==

Two studies published in 2013 and 2014 have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.

The 2013 study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 study suggested that the noxious personality characteristics known as the dark triad of personality should be investigated in the analysis of trolling. Their relevance is suggested by research linking these traits to bullying in both adolescents and adults. The 2014 study found that trolls operate as agents of chaos on the Internet, exploiting hot-button issues to make users appear overly emotional or foolish in some manner. If an unfortunate person falls into their trap, trolling intensiﬁes for further, merciless amusement. This is why novice Internet users are routinely admonished, "Do not feed the trolls!" The 2013 study found that trolls often have a high expectation of what it means 
to be successful, which is higher than they are able to attain, and this results in them resenting 
others who think they are successful but who fall below their standards. "Haters gonna hate" sums up this line of thinking.

==Concern troll==

A concern troll is a false flag pseudonym created by a user whose actual point of view is opposed to the one that the user claims to hold. The concern troll posts in Web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to share their goals, but with professed "concerns". The goal is to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt within the group.
An example of this occurred in 2006 when Tad Furtado, a staffer for then-Congressman Charles Bass (R-NH), was caught posing as a "concerned" supporter of Bass' opponent, Democrat Paul Hodes, on several liberal New Hampshire blogs, using the pseudonyms "IndieNH" or "IndyNH". "IndyNH" expressed concern that Democrats might just be wasting their time or money on Hodes, because Bass was unbeatable. Hodes eventually won the election.
Although the term "concern troll" originated in discussions of online behavior, it now sees increasing use to describe similar behaviors that take place offline. For example, James Wolcott of Vanity Fair accused a conservative New York Daily News columnist of "concern troll" behavior in his efforts to downplay the Mark Foley scandal. Wolcott links what he calls concern trolls to what Saul Alinsky calls "Do-Nothings", giving a long quote from Alinsky on the Do-Nothings' method and effects:

The Hill published an op-ed piece by Markos Moulitsas of the liberal blog Daily Kos titled "Dems: Ignore 'Concern Trolls'". The concern trolls in question were not Internet participants; they were Republicans offering public advice and warnings to the Democrats. The author defines "concern trolling" as "offering a poisoned apple in the form of advice to political opponents that, if taken, would harm the recipient".

==Troll sites==

While many webmasters and forum administrators consider trolls a scourge on their sites, some websites welcome them. For example, a New York Times article discussed troll activity at 4chan and at Encyclopedia Dramatica, which it described as "an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore".
This site and others are often used as a base to troll against sites that their members can not normally post on. These trolls feed off the reactions of their victims because "their agenda is to take delight in causing trouble".

==Media coverage and controversy==

Mainstream media outlets have focused their attention on the willingness of how some Internet users to go to extreme lengths to participate in organized psychological harassment.

===Australia===

In February 2010, the Australian government became involved after users defaced the Facebook tribute pages of murdered children Trinity Bates and Elliott Fletcher. Australian communications minister Stephen Conroy decried the attacks, committed mainly by 4chan users, as evidence of the need for greater Internet regulation, stating, "This argument that the Internet is some mystical creation that no laws should apply to, that is a recipe for anarchy and the wild west.""Internet without laws a 'recipe for anarchy', 1 April 2010. Retrieved 5 April 2010. Facebook responded by strongly urging administrators to be aware of ways to ban users and remove inappropriate content from Facebook pages."Facebook takes (small) step against tribute page trolls", TG Daily, 30 March 2010. Retrieved 5 April 2010. In 2012, the Daily Telegraph started a campaign to take action against "Twitter trolls", who abuse and threaten users. Several high-profile Australians including Charlotte Dawson, Robbie Farah, Laura Dundovic, and Ray Hadley have been victims of this phenomenon.[tpl]cite web|last=Jones |first=Gemma |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/time-is-up-for-twitter-trolls-and-bulllies/story-e6frfro0-1226472133504 |title=Time is up for Twitter trolls and bullies | Information, Gadgets, Mobile Phones News & Reviews |publisher=News.com.au |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2012-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/farah-subjected-to-vile-twitter-abuse/story-fndo48ca-1226468559816|title=Twitter trolls attack radio host Ray Hadley, NRL star Robbie Farah|newspaper=Herald Sun|accessdate=2012-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/twitter-moves-on-trolls/story-fndo317g-1226474468650|title=Twitter makes moves to prevent online trolls|newspaper=Herald Sun|accessdate=2012-09-15[/tpl]

On March 31, 2010, the Today Show ran a segment detailing the deaths of three separate adolescent girls and trolls' subsequent reactions to their deaths. Shortly after the suicide of high school student Alexis Pilkington, anonymous posters began performing organized psychological harassment across various message boards, referring to Pilkington as a "suicidal slut", and posting graphic images on her Facebook memorial page. The segment also included an exposé of a 2006 accident, in which an eighteen-year old fatally crashed her father's car into a highway pylon; trolls emailed her grieving family the leaked pictures of her mutilated corpse."Trolling: The Today Show Explores the Dark Side of the Internet", March 31, 2010.

==Examples==

As reported on April 8, 1999, investors became victims of trolling via an online financial discussion regarding PairGain, a telephone equipment company based in California. Trolls operating in the stock's Yahoo Finance chat room posted a fabricated Bloomberg News article stating that an Israeli telecom company could potentially acquire PairGain. As a result, PairGain's stock jumped by 31%. However, the stock promptly crashed after the reports were identified as false.[tpl]Cite news|title=Links, Frames, Meta-tags and Trolls|last=Bond|first=Robert|year=1999|work=International Review of Law, Computers & Technology 13|pages=317–323[/tpl]
So-called Gold Membership trolling originated in 2007 on 4chan boards, users posting fake images claiming to offer upgraded 4chan account privileges; without a "Gold" account, one could not view certain content. This turned out to be a hoax designed to fool board members, especially newcomers. It was copied and became an Internet meme. In some cases, this type of troll has been used as a scam, most notably on Facebook, where fake Facebook Gold Account upgrade ads have proliferated in order to link users to dubious websites and other content."All that glisters is not (Facebook) gold", CounterMeasures: Security, Privacy & Trust (A TrendMicro Blog).

The case of Zeran v. America Online, Inc. resulted primarily from trolling.
