==History==

The railway to Altona opened on 9 November 1888, but to a station called named Altona Beach, which was about a kilometre to the east of the current station.[tpl]Cite book|last=Harrigan|first=Leo J|title=Victorian Railways to ‘62|location=Melbourne|publisher=Victorian Railways Public Relations and Betterment Board|year=1962[/tpl] The line was privately owned from its inception, but the Victorian Railways (VR) took over train operations in 1917, opening a new Altona Beach station on the present site on 1 December 1917. For a period of time de-motored McKeen railmotors were used to as carriages on the passenger services.
By 1924 the private company which owned the Altona line owed the VR £7,289 through guarantees against losses on operating the services, so the VR took full control of the line on 1 October 1924. The station was renamed Altona in 1938. There was a loop siding beside the platform for a number of years, and the line once extended west to serve a brown coal mine a little to the north of where Westona station now stands. The Altona line was extended to Westona in January 1985, and to Laverton in April the same year.
