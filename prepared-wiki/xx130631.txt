[[Pennsylvania Route 47]]

Pennsylvania Route 47 was a state highway split into two segments in northwest Pennsylvania. The two segments were simultaneously assigned in 1927 and decommissioned in the same fashion in 1928; however, the two segments were never connected.
The two segments are now part of other Pennsylvania state highways.
From 1928 to 1930, a section of U.S. Route 106 in northeast Pennsylvania was also designated (but never signed) as PA 47. The section so designated is now Pennsylvania Route 106. (Pennsylvania Route Families 40-49 (PA 47) - Central PA/MD Roads - Timothy Reichard)
