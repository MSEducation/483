After four days, Scott began to pretend that he had changed his mind, feigning tears and remorse, in the hope that this would in due course give him a chance to escape. The final day of his imprisonment he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.
At the civil trial Ross and his co-defendants were found liable for conspiracy to deprive Scott of his civil rights and religious liberties. Scott was awarded nearly $5 million.[tpl]cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950930&slug=2144224 | work=The Seattle Times | first=Jennifer | last=Bjorhus | title=Man Wins $5 Million In Deprogramming Suit -- Mother Had Tried To Wrest Son Away From Bellevue Church | date=September 30, 1995[/tpl] The judge awarded $875,000 in compensatory damages, and punitive damages in the amount of $1,000,000 against CAN, $2,500,000 against Ross, and $250,000 against each of the other two individual defendants.

In 1995 Ross filed for personal bankruptcy because of the damages award against him in the Scott civil trial.[tpl]cite book | last = Shupe | first = Anson | authorlink = Anson Shupe | coauthors = Darnell, Susan E. | title = Agents of Discord | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 2006 | location = New Brunswick (U.S.A.), London (U.K.) | pages = 180–184 | isbn = 0-7658-0323-2 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | first = Laurie | last = Goodstein | title = New Twist In Anti-Cult Saga: Foe Is Now Ally – Bellevue Man Who Put Group Into Bankruptcy Fires Scientology Lawyer | url =http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2366495&date=19961223 | work = Washington Post | publisher = Seattle Times | date = December 23, 1996 | accessdate = October 21, 2008 [/tpl] Scott then settled with Ross, accepting $5,000 plus 200 hours of Ross's professional services "as an expert consultant and intervention specialist".[tpl]cite web | first = Tony | last = Ortega | title = What's $2.995 Million Between Former Enemies? | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-12-19/news/what-s-2-995-million-between-former-enemies/ | work = Phoenix New Times | date = December 19, 1996 | accessdate = October 21, 2008 [/tpl] Graham Berry, Scott's new attorney, said that Scott's decision to use Ross's services was not a vindication of Ross's deprogramming methods and refused to say what services Ross would provide.
As a result of the legal risks involved, Ross stopped advocating coercive deprogramming or involuntary interventions for adults, preferring instead voluntary exit counseling without the use of force or restraint. He states that despite refinement of processes over the years, exit counseling and deprogramming continue to depend on the same principles.

In December 2005, Landmark Education filed to dismiss its own lawsuit with prejudice, purportedly on the grounds of a material change in case law after the publication of an opinion in another case, Donato v. Moldow, regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1996.

==Groups to watch==

Organisations cited by Ross as "groups to watch" include the Kabbalah Centre, Chabad of Southern Nevada, the Greater Las Vegas International Church of Christ, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Unification Church, Falun Gong, among others. Included in his individual files at the 'Group Information Database' on Ross' website are names such as Deepak Chopra, Nation of Islam and Patty Hearst. Some have expressed displeasure about their inclusion in these lists.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2001/aug/24/arrival-of-cult-specialist-in-las-vegas-stirs-deba/|title=Arrival of cult specialist in Las Vegas stirs debate|publisher=Las Vegas Sun News|author=Stacy J.
