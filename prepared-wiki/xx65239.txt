The Hino da Independência (Portuguese: Independence Anthem) is a Brazilian official patriotic song, created in 1822, commemorating the country's declaration of independence from Portugal.
It was used as the Brazilian national anthem until the abdication, in 1831, of the  first Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro I, the composer of the anthem's melody. The lyrics were written by Evaristo da Veiga.
Dom Pedro I soon lost popularity and because of the anthem's close association with him in the minds of the people, on his abdication the anthem was replaced as National Anthem by another, also created in 1822, and which remains the new nation's national anthem to this day.
However, Pedro I's composition remained in use as a patriotic song, being played especially in the context of civil or military ceremonies celebrating the country's Independence, and it was declared the "Anthem of the Independence of Brazil", keeping, therefore, the status of one of Brazil's official patriotic songs.
