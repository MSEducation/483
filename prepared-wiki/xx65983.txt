The title of Earl of Athlone has been created three times. It was created first in the Peerage of Ireland in 1692 by King William III for the Dutch General Baron Godard van Reede, Lord of Ginkel, to honour him for his successful battles in Ireland. The title also had the subsidiary title of Baron Aghrim.  These titles became extinct in 1844 upon the death of the 9th Earl. The Earls did bear the Dutch nobility title Baron van Reede as well (hereditary in male line; still existing in the Netherlands).
The second creation was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Clarence and Avondale, and was conferred in 1890 upon HRH Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. When he died in 1892, the title became extinct. 
The third creation was in 1917, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for the former Prince Alexander of Teck, younger brother of Queen Mary, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Trematon.
