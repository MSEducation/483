[[Shock (mechanics)]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Packaging, Fracture mechanics, Acceleration

A mechanical or physical shock is a sudden acceleration or deceleration caused, for example, by impact, drop, kick, earthquake, or explosion.  Shock is a transient physical excitation.
Shock is term for extreme forces subject to matter, often quantified by acceleration per unit time. needed. A shock interaction can be characterised by the peak acceleration, the duration, and the shape of the shock pulse (half sine, triangular, trapezoidal, etc.).  The Shock response spectrum is a method for further evaluating a mechanical shock.  It is sometimes used as a defense standard for military equipment.
Shock is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.

==Effects of shock==

Mechanical shock has the potential for damaging an item (e.g., an entire light bulb) or an element of the item (e.g. a filament in an Incandescent light bulb):

==Considerations==

When laboratory testing, field experience, or engineering judgement indicates that an item could be damaged by mechanical shock, several courses of action might be considered:[tpl]cite journal |last=Burgess |first=G|authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000|title=Extensnion and Evaluation of fatigue Model for Product Shock Fragility Used in Package Design|journal=J.
