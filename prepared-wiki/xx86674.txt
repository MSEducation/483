[[Web Services for Remote Portlets]]

CATEGORIES: Web service specifications

Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) is an OASIS-approved network protocol standard designed for communications with remote portlets.

==Overview==

The WSRP specification defines a web service interface for interacting with presentation-oriented web services. Initial work was produced through the joint efforts of the Web Services for Interactive Applications (WSIA) and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committees. With the approval of WSRP v1 as an OASIS standard in September, 2003, these two technical committees merged and continued the work as the Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committee.
Scenarios that motivate WSRP functionality include:

==Implementation==

The WSRP specification does not make any statements as to implementation.  Java's portlet specification, JSR 168, and WSRP are not competing technologies.  JSR 168 may be used to define a portlet, and WSRP may be used to define a portlet's operations to remote containers.  JSR 168 portlets and WSRP may be used together to define a portlet and to provide remote operations.  Similarly, .NET portlets may be created for use with WSRP. Interoperability between JSR 168 and .NET WSRP implementations has been demonstrated[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl].
There are several WSRP implementations to assist developers:
The first release, WSRP v1, provided a limited interoperability platform.  Further versions of WSRP v1 were abandoned so that effort could be concentrated on WSRP v2. WSRP v2 augments the initial standard with cross-portlet coordination and access management features. This major update to the standard permits a more useful integration of multiple content sources, regardless of whether they are local or remote, into a new web application.  In addition, WSRP v2 supports Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX and REST, without requiring them.  WSRP v2 was approved by OASIS on April 1, 2008.
