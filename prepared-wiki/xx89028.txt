[[Listening prayer]]

CATEGORIES: Prayer

Listening prayer is a type of Christian  prayer.  As compared with the traditional Christian prayer, the listening prayer method demands "hearing and discerning God's voice through prayer and scripture; then obeying the Lord's direction in personal ministry."

Traditional Christian prayer requested people to thank  God, as well as tell God their own request.  When their prayers seemed unanswered, some would feel that God did not hear them or did not respond to them.  Listening prayer asks: "Was it that God did not respond to you, or was it that you did not hear from God"?  Listening prayer requires those praying to calm their minds down and read the Scripture.  During the reading, some sentences may pop into mind, as if in answer to their prayers.
