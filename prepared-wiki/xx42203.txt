==Kalakshetra style==

Having studied the Pandanallur style for three years, in 1936 Rukmini Devi Arundale started working on developing her own, Kalakshetra, style of Bharatanatyam. She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets.
The Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinestetics, and its avoidance of Recakas and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs.
According to Shri Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra’s beginnings,[tpl]cite news |title=Guru who inspired love (Sankara Menon’s centenary at Kalakshetra) |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/28/stories/2007092850930100.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date=September 28, 2007 [/tpl] Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by "removing objectionable elements" (mostly, the Sringara, certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the Pandanallur style, which was publicly criticized by Balasaraswati and other representatives of the traditional Isai Vellalar culture. Not all love was portrayed, at least outside parameters considered "chaste".
Balasaraswati said that "the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus". E.Krishna Iyer said about Rukmini Devi, “There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before”.
