==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album 4Â½ stars stating "This music exists at the border between post-bop and free jazz -- it's grounded in post-bop, but it knows what is happening across the border. Within a few years, he would cross that line, but Schizophrenia crackles with the excitement of Shorter and his colleagues trying to balance the two extremes".Erlewine, S. T.
