Henrys Lake is a small, shallow natural alpine lake, approximately [tpl]convert|8|sqmi|km2[/tpl] in area, at 4 miles (6.4 km) in length and 2 miles (3.2 km) in width. It is located at 6472 feet (1973 m) above sea level in the mountains of southeastern Idaho in the United States. It is on the southwest side of the Henrys Lake Mountains of northern Fremont County, approximately 2 miles  (3.2 km) south the continental divide along the Montana state line, just west of Targhee Pass.  The lake is located in Caribou-Targhee National Forest.
The lake provides the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River. The lake lies less than 10 miles (16 km) across the continental divide from the headwaters of the Missouri River in southwestern Montana.
It is estimated that there are 1.2 million catchable trout in Henrys Lake.  The Idaho State Record brook trout was caught there several years ago. On opening day 2013 several fish exceeding 13 pounds (Cutthroat Hybrids) and 9 pound brook trout were caught. There is a limit of two fish per day.  You keep the first big fish and the last fish you catch but you release 20 or more fish in between.  A young man (boy scout age) in 2011 caught 80+ fish with a little red bead on an egg hook from the County Boat Dock. Black leach and little white flies work as well.  Worms are the easiest.  Just put a worm on the bottom and sit back and read a book.
