Mesa Airlines operated America West Express from hubs at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona, McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California to regional destinations.  
America West Express fleet consisted of 61 turboprop and regional jet aircraft.

==History==

America West Express started as a regional carrier in association with America West Airlines with a hub at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The name "America West Express" was taken from the old America West Airlines cargo service which had begun in 1985.
Originally, America West operated the Dash-8 turboprop aircraft, but on November 30, 1992, America West signed a codeshare agreement with Mesa Airlines to operate America West Airlines' regional and commuter services. 
In the mid-1990s, with the opening of the America West Airlines hub at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio,  America West Airlines used Chautauqua Airlines to provide commuter service to feed the hub.  When the hub was shut down, the Chautauqua Airlines code share was discontinued, leaving Mesa as the sole operator of AW Express services.
In 2003, America West greatly increased the size of their express operation by starting new routes operated by regional jets from its hub at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.
In 2006 America West Express was branded as US Airways Express.

==Services==

America West Express operated all of its fleet in a single coach class configuration.  At one time, the CRJ-700s and CRJ-900s did offer dual class service. However, this was dropped when customers were not willing to pay extra for limited First class amenities on these short flights.  Increasing the number of coach seats resulted in increased revenue.

==Identifying codes==

Since these were code share flights, the America West Airlines codes were used for customer purposes.  HPX indicates America West Express flights.  However, the flights were actually operated under the Mesa Airlines codes.
