Young Nak (YN) Presbyterian Church was founded in Seoul on December 2, 1945 by 1992 Templeton Prize recipient, Kyung-Chik Han.  Inaugurated by twenty-seven refugees from Soviet occupied Korea, Young Nak steadily increased in membership as more refugees sought religious freedom below the 38th parallel.Just Three More Years to Live!

In 1998, under the auspices of Rev. Han, who at the time was a Pastor Emeritus, Young Nak gained an English language ministry, International Worship in English, which was founded by an American missionary to Korea, Bill Majors.  For his efforts, Majors was made an Honorary Citizen of Seoul in 2005.Seoul Metropolitan Government - "A Clean, Attractive & Global City, Seoul!"
