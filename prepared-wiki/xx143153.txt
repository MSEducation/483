He was the son of Thomas Raikes, a London banker and merchant, and Charlotte Finch, daughter of Henry  Finch, Earl of Winchelsea.
One of his three brothers was Thomas Raikes (the younger) (1777-1848), a London banker and merchant who later became a famous diarist and a dandy traveller on the  Continent (mostly in France). One of his five sisters, Georgina Raikes, married Lord William FitzRoy, Admiral (1782-1857) on 9 August 1816.
Henry Raikes was the father of Henry Cecil Raikes (1838 - 1891), a British Conservative politician and one of the earliest British politicians to have had their voice recorded.
