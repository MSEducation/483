[[NoteCards]]

CATEGORIES: Hypertext, HyperCard products

NoteCards was a hypertext personal knowledge basesystem developed at Xerox PARC by Randall Trigg, Frank Halasz and Thomas Moran in 1984. NoteCards developed after Trigg became the first to write a Ph.D. thesis on hypertext while at the University of Maryland College Park in 1983. NoteCards is one of the best known hypertext projects in the research world due to its design being well documented.
NoteCards is built on the model of there being four basic kinds of objects: notecards, links, browser card, and a filebox. Each window is an analog of a cue card; window sizes may vary, but contents cannot scroll. As such, the windowing model is not fully supported. Local and global maps are available through browsers. There are over 40 different nodes which support various media.

NoteCards was implemented in LISP on Xerox D-machine workstations, which used large, high-resolution displays. The NoteCards interface is event-driven. One interesting feature of NoteCards is that authors may use LISP commands to customize or create entirely new node types. The powerful programming language allows almost complete customization of the entire NoteCards work environment.
Notecards has been referred to as a "second generation" hypertext system.
