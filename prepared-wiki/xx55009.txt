[[One Chord to Another]]

CATEGORIES: 1996 albums, Sloan albums, Murderecords albums

One Chord to Another is the third album by Canadian rock band, Sloan.  After rumours that they had broken up following the problems they faced with Geffen Records when Twice Removed was released, Sloan began touring and writing again in 1995 and released One Chord to Another on Murderecords in 1996.  Like the previous album it was a catchy, Beatles-influenced pop record.  The band also experimented with instruments they had never used before, such as trumpets  and maracas.

==Track listing==

Japanese Bonus Tracks

B-sides
Note:  Prior to the release of One Chord to Another, Sloan released Same Old Flame / Stood up as a 7" single on murderecords.  These songs were re-recorded for the first pressing of One Chord to Another in Japan, released on EMI.   While these versions of Stood Up are a Chris Murphy original, the song by the same name on the Party Album is a cover of a Matthew Grimson song.

==American and Japanese releases==

One Chord To Another was not released until 1997 in the United States on the independent label, The Enclave.  It was originally released in an LP-style cardboard gatefold jacket rather than a traditional plastic jewel box, and included a 10-track bonus CD of material entitled Recorded Live At A Sloan Party!  This bonus CD consisted of cover versions and re-recordings of previous Sloan songs; it was recorded in the studio but was overdubbed with miscellaneous party-type sounds to give the impression of being recorded live at an intimate gathering of friends (somewhat akin to the Beach Boys' Party! album).  To this date the "Sloan Party" CD has not been released in the band's native Canada and has only been available as an American import.
(Notes: All of track 1 and the last 2:35 of track 10 consist of party sound effects only; track 8 is a different song from the 1995 7" single.)
One Chord To Another was Sloan's first album to be released in Japan.  They secured a distribution deal with EMI who released the album with new recordings of Stood Up and Same Old Flame.  When Navy Blues was released in Canada, however, Sloan's distribution deal with Universal Canada led to new Japanese distribution with Universal Japan.  Universal then released Sloan's first three albums in Japan.  The new Universal Japan version of One Chord to Another was a one-disc release featuring Live at a Sloan Party as bonus tracks, making the original EMI release with its two exclusive tracks a rarity in the Sloan catalogue.
