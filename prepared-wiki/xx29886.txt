A backsword is a type of European sword characterized by having a straight single-edged blade and a hilt with a single-handed grip.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_euroedge.html |publisher=MyArmoury.com |title=Forms of European Edged Weaponry[/tpl] It is so called because the triangular cross section gives a flat back edge opposite the cutting edge.[tpl]cite book |last=Loades |first=Mike |title=Swords and Swordsmen |year=2010 |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |isbn=978-1-84884-133-8[/tpl] Later examples often have a "false edge" on the back near the tip, which was in many cases sharpened to make an actual edge and facilitate thrusting attacks. From around the early 14th century the backsword became the first type of European sword to be fitted with a knuckle guard.
The term "backsword" can also refer to the singlestick, which is used to train for fighting with the backsword, or to the sport or art of fighting in this fashion.[tpl]cite book |title=Broadsword and Single-stick |first1=R.

Being easier and cheaper to make than double-edged swords, backswords became the favored sidearm of common infantry, including irregulars such as the Highland Scots, which in Scottish Gaelic were called the claidheamh cuil (back sword), after one of several terms for the distinct types of weapons they used. Backswords were often the secondary weapons of European cavalrymen beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
