==History==

The airport was constructed in 1939 near Crumlin, on a location that was then outside the city limits of London but has since been annexed into the city. It was originally an air base under the command of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, where pilots from the British Commonwealth and former colonies were trained; as a tribute to this period, a Canadair T-33 aircraft in former Royal Canadian Air Force livery is mounted in front of the main terminal building.
London International Airport has experienced tremendous growth as of late. With WestJet entering the market during the early 2000s, an increase in terminal size was needed. As a result, London International Airport's terminal was completely renovated and expanded to meet passenger needs finishing in 2003.
