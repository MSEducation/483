[[Dyakiidae]]

CATEGORIES: Dyakiidae

Dyakiidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Dyakioidea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).[tpl]Bouchet 2005[/tpl]
Dyakiidae is the only family in the superfamily Dyakioidea. This family has no subfamilies.
Some of the species in this family are sinistral (left-handed) in their shell coiling.

==Distribution==

The family Dyakiidae is endemic to Sundaland in Southeast Asia.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1111/j.1096-0031.1995.tb00095.x[/tpl].

==Anatomy==

In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes is between 26 and 30 (according to the values in this table).Barker G. M. (2001) Gastropods on Land: Phylogeny, Diversity and Adaptive Morphology. 1-146. In: Barker G. M. (ed.) (2001) The biology of terrestrial molluscs. CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, cited pages: 139-144. ISBN 0-85199-318-4.
The family also includes Quantula striata, the only known terrestrial gastropod to emit light.[tpl]Cite PMID|3213594[/tpl].
The Digestive system characteristics are as follows. The buccal mass is small. The jaw is smooth. The stomach is very simple with weak muscles (as is the case in the majority of land snails). (These anatomical characteristics also include the family Staffordiidae which was considered part of the Dyakiidae at the time the study was done).

==Genera==

The family Dyakiidae includes the following 11 genera, with a total of 82 species (71 species until 2007 + 11 new species in 2009[tpl]Cite doi|10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00526.x[/tpl].):
