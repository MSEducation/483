Kinematic320 is a record label that was formed in 2004 by drum & bass artists Static (Aaron Danks) and Rregula (Ross Deschamp). Based out of Perth, Western Australia, the label was one of the very first to exclusively release as MP3 as opposed to 12" vinyl, a trend which many labels are now following.
Kinematic320 specializes in the drum & bass subgenres of Neurofunk, Techstep and Trancestep.
