The economy of Ethiopia is largely based on agriculture, which accounts for 46.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 85% of total employment.
Ethiopia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is Africa’s second most populous country.[tpl]cite news | title = Private Sector Boosts Ethiopia's Growth | work = IFC | url = http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/regions/sub-saharan+africa/news/ethiopia_to_host_world_economic_forum| accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] Many properties owned by the government during the previous regime have now been  privatized and are in the process of privatization.[tpl]cite news | title = Ethiopia sells off seven state firms, to offer more | work = Reuters | date = 19 March 2012| url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/29/ethiopia-privatisation-idUSL6E8ET53G20120329| accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] However, certain sectors namely Telecommunications, Financial and Insurance services, Air and Land Transportation services, and retail are considered as strategic sectors and would remain under state control for the foreseeable future. Almost 50% of Ethiopia's population is under the age of 18, and even though education enrollment at primary and tertiary level has increased significantly, job creation has not caught up with the increased output from educational institutes. The country must create hundreds of thousands of jobs every year just to keep up with population growth.[tpl]cite news | title = A brittle Western ally in the Horn of Africa | work = The Economist | date = 11 November 2007 | url = http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10062658 | accessdate=23 November 2007[/tpl]
The Ethiopian constitution defines the right to own land as belonging only to "the state and the people", but citizens may only lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage, sell, or own it.UPenn: Ethiopian Constitution Various groups and political parties have sought for full privatization of land, while other opposition parties are against privatization and favor communal ownership.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The current government has embarked on a program of economic reform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of government regulation. While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have begun to attract much-needed foreign investment. Despite recent improvements, with an exploding population Ethiopia remains one of the poorest nations in the world.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Sectors==

===Agriculture===

The economy of Ethiopia is based on agriculture, which accounts for 46.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of exports, and 80% of total employment.
Ethiopia's agriculture is plagued by periodic drought, soil degradation caused by overgrazing, deforestation, high population density,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] high levels of taxation and poor infrastructure (making it difficult and expensive to get goods to market). Yet agriculture is the country's most promising resource. A potential exists for self-sufficiency in grains and for export development in livestock, grains, vegetables, and fruits. As many as 4.6 million people need food assistance annually.
Agriculture accounts for almost 41 percent of GDP, 80 percent of exports, and 80 percent of the labour force.  Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly of a subsistence nature, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, pulses (e.g., beans), oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables.  Exports are almost entirely agricultural commodities, with coffee as the largest foreign exchange earner, and its flower industry becoming a new source of revenue: for 2005/2006 (the latest year available) Ethiopia's coffee exports represented 0.9% of the world exports, and oilseeds and flowers each representing 0.5%."The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Selected Issues Series", International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 08/259, pp. 35f (Retrieved 4 February 2009) Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9304411 | work=The Economist | title=Get the gangsters out of the food chain | date=7 June 2007[/tpl]
In 2000, Ethiopia's livestock contributed to 19% of total GDP.[tpl]cite web|title=Livestock Sector Brief: Ethiopia|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/en/publications/sector_briefs/lsb_ETH.pdf|work=FAO Country Profiles|publisher=FAO|accessdate=7 November 2011|author=Food and Agriculture Organization|authorlink=Food and Agriculture Organization|page=1|date=May 2004[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], some countries that import most of their food, such as Saudi Arabia, had begun planning the development of large tracts of arable land in developing countries such as Ethiopia.[tpl]cite news |title=Arable Land, the new gold rush  |first=Javier |last=Blas |author2=Andrew England |url=http://en.afrik.com/article14301.html |newspaper=Financial Times|location=London |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |quote=Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of Ethiopia, is also enthusiastic. After welcoming a Saudi agriculture delegation a fortnight ago, he said: 'We told them Saudis that we would be very eager to provide hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land for investment.'  [/tpl]  This has raised fears of food being exported to more prosperous countries while the local population faces its own shortage.

===Forestry===

Forest products are used in construction and manufacturing, and as energy sources.

===Fishing===

Ethiopia's fisheries are entirely freshwater, as it has no marine coastline, and are a small part of the economy.

===Minerals and mining===

The mining sector is small in Ethiopia. The country has deposits of coal, opal, gemstones, kaolin, iron ore, soda ash, and tantalum, but only gold is mined in significant quantities. In 2001 gold production amounted to some 3.4 tons. Salt extraction from salt beds in the Afar Depression, as well as from salt springs in Dire and Afder districts in the south, is only of internal importance and only a negligible amount is exported.
On 30 August 2012 it was announced that British firm Nyota Minerals was about to become the first foreign company to receive a mining licence to extract gold from an estimated resource of 52 tonnes in western Ethiopia.Matthew Newsome, "Gold mining promises big boost for Ethiopia's development", The Guardian (30 August 2012)

===Energy===

Waterpower and forests are Ethiopia's main energy sources. The country derives about 90 percent of its electricity needs from hydropower, which means that electricity generation, as with agriculture, is dependent on abundant rainfall. Present installed capacity is rated at about 2000 megawatts, with planned expansion to 10,000 megawatts. In general, Ethiopians rely on forests for nearly all of their energy and construction needs; the result has been deforestation of much of the highlands during the last three decades.
Less than one-half of Ethiopia’s towns and cities are connected to the national grid. Petroleum requirements are met via imports of refined products, although some oil is being hauled overland from Sudan. Oil exploration in Ethiopia has been underway for decades, ever since Emperor Haile Selassie granted a 50-year concession to SOCONY-Vacuum in September 1945."Sinco Places a Bet", Time, 17 September 1945 (Retrieved 14 May 2009) Plans are afoot to exploit natural gas reserves in the southeastern lowlands, estimated at [tpl]convert|4|Tcuft[/tpl]. Exploration for gas and oil is underway in the Gambela Region bordering Sudan.

===Manufacturing===

This sector constitutes about 4 percent of the overall economy, although it has shown some growth and diversification in recent years. Much of it is concentrated in Addis Ababa. Food and beverages constitute some 40 percent of the sector, but textiles and leather are also important, the latter especially for the export market. A program to privatize state-owned enterprises has been underway since the late 1990s.Ethiopia country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (April 2005).

===Transport===

Prior to the outbreak of the 1998–2000 Eritrean–Ethiopian War, landlocked Ethiopia mainly relied on the seaports of Asseb and Massawa in Eritrea for international trade. [tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], Ethiopia uses the ports of Djibouti, connected to Addis Ababa by the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway, and to a lesser extent Port Sudan in Sudan.  In May 2005, the Ethiopian government began negotiations to use the port of Berbera in Somaliland. Of the 23,812 kilometres of Ethiopia's all-weather roads, 15% are asphalt. Mountainous terrain and the lack of good roads and sufficient vehicles make land transportation difficult. However, the government-owned airline, Ethiopian Airlines, is one of Africa's best airlines. It serves 41 domestic airfields and has 65 international destinations.

===Telecommunications===

Telecommunications are provided by a state-owned monopoly, Ethio Telecom, formerly the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation.

===Tourism===

Aside from wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and communications, the services sector consists almost entirely of tourism. Developed in the 1960s, tourism declined greatly during the later 1970s and the 1980s under the military government. Recovery began in the 1990s, but growth has been constrained by the lack of suitable hotels and other infrastructure, despite a boom in construction of small and medium-sized hotels and restaurants, and by the impact of drought, the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, and the specter of terrorism. In 2002 more than 156,000 tourists entered the country, many of them Ethiopians visiting from abroad, spending more than US$77 million.  In 2008, the number of tourists entering the country had increased to 330,000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Ethiopia | title=UNdata country profile: Ethiopia | accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl]

==External trade==

The major agricultural export crop is coffee, providing about 26.4% of Ethiopia's foreign exchange earnings. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy. More than 15 million people (25% of the population) derive their livelihood from the coffee sector."Ethiopian coffee: The best in the world?" African Business, 2001. (Retrieved 24 January 2007)
Other exports include live animals, leather and leather products, chemicals, gold, pulses, oilseeds, flowers, fruits and vegetables and khat (or qat), a leafy shrub which has psychotropic qualities when chewed.
Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).Pavanello, Sara 2010. Working across borders - Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands. London: Overseas Development Institute This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues. Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.
Dependent on a few vulnerable crops for its foreign exchange earnings and reliant on imported oil, Ethiopia lacks sufficient foreign exchange. The financially conservative government has taken measures to solve this problem, including stringent import controls and sharply reduced subsidies on retail gasoline prices. Nevertheless, the largely subsistence economy is incapable of supporting high military expenditures, drought relief, an ambitious development plan, and indispensable imports such as oil; it therefore depends on foreign assistance.
In December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 billion joint venture deal with the Malaysian oil company, Petronas, to develop a huge natural gas field in the Somali Region. By the year 2010, however, implementation failed to progress and Petronas sold its share to another oil company."Petronas sells Ethiopian assets to SouthWest" Upstream Online news, 6 October 2010.
