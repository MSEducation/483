Campania ([tpl]IPA-it|kamˈpaːnja[/tpl]) is a region in southern Italy. The region has a population of around 5.8 million people, making it the second-most-populous region of Italy; its total area of [tpl]convert|13590|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl] makes it the most densely populated region in the country.[tpl]cite news|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9019840|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Campania|date=7 October 2007[/tpl] Located on the Italian Peninsula, with the Mediterranean Sea to the west, it includes the small Phlegraean Islands and Capri for administration as part of the region.
Located on the Italian Peninsula, Campania was colonised by Ancient Greeks and was part of Magna Græcia. During the Roman era, the area maintained a Greco-Roman culture. The capital city of Campania is Naples. Campania is rich in culture, especially in regards to gastronomy, music, architecture, archeological and ancient sites such as Pompeii, Herculaneum, Paestum and Velia. The name of Campania itself is derived from Latin, as the Romans knew the region as Campania felix, which translates into English as "fertile countryside". The rich natural sights of Campania make it highly important in the tourism industry, especially along the Amalfi Coast, Mount Vesuvius and the island of Capri.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/campania/|publisher=LifeInItaly.com|title=Campania: Gateway to Southern Italy|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]

==History==

===Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars===

The original inhabitants of Campania were three defined groups of the Ancient peoples of Italy, who all spoke the Oscan language, which is part of the Italic family; their names were the Osci, the Aurunci and the Ausones.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.instoria.it/home/italia_antiqua_XV.htm|publisher=InStoria.it|title=Italia Antiqua - XV, Campania|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] During the 8th century BC, people from Euboea in Greece, known as Cumaeans, began to establish colonies in the area roughly around the modern day province of Naples.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050505081832/http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archivedate=2005-05-05|publisher=Interteam.it|title=Campania: History|date=7 October 2007[/tpl] Another Oscan tribe, the Samnites, moved down from central Italy into Campania. Since the Samnites were more warlike than the Campanians, they easily took over the cities of Capua and Cumae, in an area which was one of the most prosperous and fertile in the Italian Peninsula at the time. During the 340s BC, the Samnites were engaged in a war with the Roman Republic in a dispute known as the Samnite Wars, with the Romans securing rich pastures of northern Campania during the First Samnite War.
The major remaining independent Greek settlement was Neapolis, and when the town was eventually captured by the Samnites, the Neapolitans were left with no other option than to call on the Romans, with whom they established an alliance, setting off the Second Samnite War.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.unrv.com/empire/samnite-wars.php|publisher=UNRV.com|title=The Samnite Wars|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] The Roman consul Quintus Publilius Filo recaptured Neapolis by 326 BC and allowed it to remain a Greek city with some autonomy as a civitas foederata while strongly aligned with Rome.[tpl]cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.du|title=Roman Naples|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] The Second Samnite War ended with the Romans controlling southern Campania and additional regions further to the south.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~vigorimi/genealogy/first_millenium_BC.html|publisher=Michael Vigorita|title=Ancient Times - 1st millennium B.C.|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]

===Roman period===

Campania was a full-fledged part of the Roman Republic by the end of the 4th century BC, valued for its pastures and rich countryside. Its Greek language and customs made it a centre of Hellenistic civilization, creating the first traces of Greco-Roman culture. During the Pyrrhic War the battle took place in Campania at Maleventum in which the Romans, led by consul Curius Dentatus, were victorious. They renamed the city Beneventum (modern day Benevento), which grew in stature until it was second only to Capua in southern Italy.[tpl]cite book | last =Oakley | first = Stephen P| title =A Commentary on Livy, Books VI-X| publisher =Oxford University Press | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=JqsqlajAPCoC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=in+verrem+cicero+verres| isbn =0-19-927143-7 | accessdate =2009-07-22 | year =1971[/tpl] During the Second Punic War in 216 BC, Capua, in a bid for equality with Rome, allied with Carthage. The rebellious Capuans were isolated from the rest of Campania, which remained allies of Rome. Naples resisted Hannibal due to the imposing walls. Capua was eventually starved into submission in the Roman retaking of 211 BC, and the Romans were victorious.[tpl]cite news|url=http://roman-empire.info/roman-empire/13/|publisher=Roman-Empire.info|title=Second Punic War: Second Period, From The Revolt Of Capua To The Battle Of The Metaurus - b.C. 215-207|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]
The rest of Campania, with the exception of Naples, adopted the Latin language as official and was Romanised. As part of the Roman Empire, Campania, with Latium, formed the most important region of the Augustan divisions of Italia; Campania was one of the main areas for granary.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.emmeti.it/Cucina/Campania/Storia/Campania.ART.95.uk.html|publisher=Emmeti.it|title=Campania: A Little History|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] Roman Emperors chose Campania as a holiday destination, among them Claudius and Tiberius, the latter of whom is infamously linked to the island of Capri. It was also during this period that Christianity came to Campania. Two of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, are said to have preached in the city of Naples, and there were also several martyrs during this time.[tpl]ws|"Naples" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl] Unfortunately, the period of relative calm was violently interrupted by the epic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/P/pompeii/index.htm|publisher=Channel4.com|title=Secrets of the Dead: Pompeii and Herculaneum|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] With the Decline of the Roman Empire, its last emperor, Romulus Augustus, was put in a manor house prison near Castel dell'Ovo, Naples, in 476, ushering in the beginning of the Dark Ages and a period of uncertainty in regards to the future of the area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://naples.rome-in-italy.com/history_naples_1.html|publisher=Naples.Rome-in-Italy.com|title=Antic Naples|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]

===Feudalism in the Middle Ages===

The area had many duchies and principalities during the Middle Ages, in the hands of the Byzantine Empire and the Lombards. Under the Normans, the smaller independent states were brought together as part of the Kingdom of Sicily, before the mainland broke away to form the Kingdom of Naples. It was during this period that elements of Spanish, French and Aragonese culture were introduced to Campania.

===The Kingdom===

====Norman to Angevin====

After a period as a Norman kingdom, the Kingdom of Sicily passed to the Hohenstaufens, who were a powerful Germanic royal house of Swabian origins.[tpl]cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/swabian.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu|title=Swabian Naples|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] The University of Naples Federico II was founded by Frederick II in the city, the oldest state university in the world, making Naples the intellectual centre of the kingdom.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scholarshipnet.info/postgraduate/italy-phd-scholarships-in-various-fields-at-university-of-naples-federico-ii/|publisher=ScholarshipNet.info|title=Italy: PhD Scholarships in Various Fields at University of Naples-Federico II|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy, led in 1266 to Pope Innocent IV crowning Angevin Dynasty duke Charles I as the king.

In 1281, with the advent of the Sicilian Vespers, the kingdom split in half. The Angevin Kingdom of Naples included the southern part of the Italian peninsula, while the island of Sicily became the Aragonese Kingdom of Sicily. The wars continued until the peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, which saw Frederick III recognised as king of the Isle of Sicily, while Charles II was recognised as the king of Naples by Pope Boniface VIII.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dieli.net/SicilyPage/History/SicilianHist.html|publisher=Dieli.net|title=Sicilian History|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] Despite the split, Naples grew in importance, attracting Pisan and Genoese merchants,[tpl]cite book | last = Constable| first = Olivia Remie | title =Housing the Stranger in the Mediterranean World: Lodging, Trade, and Travel| publisher = Humana Press| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=y9H7mfxqs7UC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=%22genoese+merchants%22+naples| isbn = 1-58829-171-5 | accessdate = 2009-07-22 | date = 2002-08-01[/tpl] Tuscan bankers, and with them some of the most championed Renaissance artists of the time, such as Boccaccio, Petrarch and Giotto.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.naples-city.info/napoli/angioinoeng.htm|publisher=Naples-City.info|title=Angioino Castle, Naples|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] Alfonso I conquered Naples after his victory against the last Angevin king, René, and Naples was unified for a brief period with Sicily again.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/spain/aragonexp.html|publisher=Zum.de|title= Aragonese Overseas Expansion, 1282–1479|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]

Sicily and Naples were separated in 1458 but remained as dependencies of Aragon under Ferrante.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HGLTkBTylpyyN6nRHvHhh1ChNGN38XWmr4HZhn5HLhnkkhWHHhXn!602093125?docId=5000263626|publisher=Questia.com|title=Ferrante of Naples: the statecraft of a Renaissance prince|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] The new dynasty enhanced Naples' commerce by establishing relations with the Iberian peninsula.

Spain won Naples at the Battle of Garigliano and, as a result, Naples then became part of the Spanish Empire throughout the entire Habsburg Spain period. The Spanish sent viceroys to Naples to directly deal with local issues: the most important of which was Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, who was responsible for considerable social, economic and urban progress in the city; he also supported the Inquisition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/toledo.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu|title=Don Pedro de Toledo|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]

During the time of Ferdinand IV, the French Revolution made its way to Naples: Horatio Nelson, an ally of the Bourbons, even arrived in the city in 1798 to warn against it. However, Ferdinand was forced to retreat and fled to Palermo, where he was protected by a British fleet. Naples' lower classes (the lazzaroni) were pious and Royalist, favouring the Bourbons; in the mêlée that followed, they fought the Neapolitan pro-Republican aristocracy, causing a civil war. The Republicans conquered Castel Sant'Elmo and proclaimed a Parthenopaean Republic, secured by the French Army. A counter-revolutionary religious army of lazzaroni under Fabrizio Ruffo was raised; they had great success and the French surrendered the Neapolitan castles and were allowed to sail back to Toulon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Parthenopean_Republic.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu|title=The Parthenopean Republic|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl]
Ferdinand IV was restored as king; however, after only seven years Napoleon conquered the kingdom and instated Bonapartist kings including his brother Joseph Bonaparte. With the help of the Austrian Empire and allies, the Bonapartists were defeated in the Neapolitan War and Bourbon Ferdinand IV once again regained the throne and the kingdom.

===World War II, "Salerno Capital"===

In September 1943, Salerno was the scene of the Operation Avalanche and suffered a great deal of damage. From February 12 to July 17, 1944, it hosted the Government of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. In those months Salerno was the temporary "Capital of the Kingdom of Italy", and the King Victor Emmanuel III lived in a mansion in its outskirts. Salerno received the first "Tricolore" in an official ceremony on 7 January 2012 from the premier Mario Monti, to celebrate the glorious story of Italy and its old capitals.

==Geography==

Campania has an area of [tpl]convert|13590|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a coastline of [tpl]convert|350|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Campania is famous for its gulfs (Naples, Salerno and Policastro) as well as for three islands (Capri, Ischia and Procida).
Four other regions border Campania; Lazio to the northwest, Molise to the north, Apulia (Puglia) to the northeast and Basilicata to the east.
The mountainous interior is fragmented into several massifs, rarely reaching 2,000 metres (Miltetto of 2,050 m), whereas close to the coast there are volcanic massifs: Vesuvio (1,277 m) and Campi Flegrei.
The climate is typically Mediterranean along the coast, whereas in the inner zones it is more continental, with low temperatures in winter. 51% of the total area is hilly, 34% mountainous and the remaining 15% is made up of plains. There is a high 'seismic' risk in the area of the region.

==Economy==

The agro-food industry is one of the main pillars of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The value added of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. Animal breeding is widespread (it was done in 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products, such as mozzarella. Olive trees cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl]
The region has a dense network of road and motorways, a system of maritime connections and an airport (Naples Airport), which connect it rapidly to the rest of the Country. Campania has a series of historical problems and internal contrasts, although they are improving. The regional capital, Naples, one of the most populated and interesting cities in Italy, rich in history and natural beauty, both artistic and archaeological, still represents the centre of regional life. The port connects the region with the whole Mediterranean basin, and brings tourists to the archaeological sites, the cities of art (Naples and Caserta), to the beautiful coastal areas and to the islands. The services sector makes up for 78% of the region's gross domestic product.

==Demographics==

The region, with a population of over 5.8 million inhabitants, is divided into five provinces: Naples, Benevento, Avellino, Caserta and Salerno. Over half of the population is resident in the province of Naples, where there is a population density of 2,626 inhabitants per km2. Within the province, the highest density can be found along the coast, where it reaches 13,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city of Portici. The region, which was characterised until recently by an acute economic contrast between internal and coastal areas, has shown an improvement in the last decade thanks to the development of the provinces of Benevento and Avellino. At the same time, the provinces of Naples, Caserta and in part Salerno, have developed a variety of activities connected to advanced types of services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl]
Unlike central and northern Italy, in the last decade the region of Campania has not attracted large numbers of immigrants. The Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated in January 2007 that 98,052 foreign-born immigrants live in Campania, equal to 1.7% of the total regional population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.demo.istat.it/strasa2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] Part of the reason for this is in recent times, there have been more employment opportunities in northern regions than in the Southern Italian regions.

==Government and politics==

The Politics of Campania, takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.
The Regional Council of Campania (Consiglio Regionale della Campania) is composed of 60 members, of which 47 are elected in provincial constituencies with proportional representation, 12 from the so-called "regional list" of the elected President and the last one is for the candidate for President who comes second, who usually becomes the leader of the opposition in the Council. If a coalition wins more than 55% of the vote, only 6 candidates from the "regional list" will be elected and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 53.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&p_p_id=20&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_col_id=null&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3&_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&_20_folderId=69&_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf |title=Home - Consiglio Regionale della Lombardia |publisher=Consiglio.regione.lombardia.it |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Campania is divided into five provinces:

==Culture==

===Cuisine===

Campanian cuisine varies within the region. While Neapolitan dishes center on seafood, Casertan and Aversan ones rely more on fresh vegetables and cheeses. The cuisine from Sorrento combines the culinary traditions from both Naples and Salerno.
Pizza was conceived in Naples. Historical and original pizzas from Naples are pizza fritta (fried pizza); calzone (literally "trouser leg"), which is pizza fritta stuffed with ricotta cheese; pizza Marinara, with just olive oil, tomato sauce and garlic; and pizza Margherita, with olive oil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil leaves. Neapolitans were among the first Europeans to use tomatoes not only as ornamental plant, but also as food and garnish.
Spaghetti is also a well-known dish from southern Italy and Campania. 
Campania produces wines including Lacryma Christi, Fiano, Aglianico, Greco di Tufo, Pere 'e palomma, Ischitano, Taburno, Solopaca, and Taurasi. The cheeses of Campania consist of Mozzarella di Bufala (buffalo mozzarella) (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), fiordilatte ("flower of milk") a mozzarella made from cow's milk, ricotta from sheep or buffalo milk, provolone from cow milk, and caciotta made from goat milk. Buffalo are bred in Salerno and Caserta.
Several different cakes and pies are made in Campania. Pastiera pie is made during Easter. Casatiello and tortano are Easter bread-cakes made by adding lard or oil and various types of cheese to bread dough and garnishing it with slices of salami. Babà cake is a well known Neapolitan delicacy, best served with Rum or limoncello (a liqueur invented in the Sorrento peninsula). It is an old Austrian cake, which arrived in Campania during the Austrian domination of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and was modified there to became a "walking cake" for citizens always in a hurry for work and other pursuits. Sfogliatella is another cake from the Amalfi Coast, as is Zeppole, traditionally eaten on Saint Joseph's day. Struffoli, little balls fried dough dipped in honey, are enjoyed during the Christmas holidays.
Another Campanian dish is the so-called Russian salad (which is based on similar dishes from France), made of potatoes in mayonnaise garnished with shrimp and vegetables in vinegar. Russians call this same dish Olivier Salad, and Germans call it Italian salad. Another French-derived dish is "gattò" or "gâteau di patate" (oven-baked pie made of boiled potatoes). As with the Russian salad, Campania is home to other seafood-based dishes, such as "insalata di mare" (seafood salad), "zuppa di polpo" (octopus soup), and "zuppa di cozze" (mussel soup), are popular. Other regional seafood dishes include "frittelle di mare" (fritters with seaweed), made with edible poseidonia algae, "triglie al cartoccio" (red mullet in the bag), and "alici marinate" (fresh anchovies in olive oil). The island of Ischia is famous for its fish dishes, as well as for cooked rabbit. Campania is also home to the lemons of Sorrento. Rapini (or Broccoli rabe), known locally as friarielli, are often used in the regional cooking. Campania also produces many nuts, especially in the area of Avellino, Salerno and Benevento. Hazelnut production is especially relevant in the province of Avellino - in Spanish, in Portuguese and in Occitan the hazelnut is respectively called avellana, avelã and avelano,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] after the city of Avella. That is also the case of ancient Italian avellana, which is however not in use anymore.

===Ancient, medieval, and early arts===

The region of Campania is rich with a vast array of culture and history. Since the Greek colony of Elea, now Velia, Campania was home to philosophers of the Pre-Socratic philosophy school, such as Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, who came to prominence around 490-480 BC. The Latin poet Vergil (70 BC–19 BC) settled in Naples in his late life: parts of his epic poem Aeneid are located in Campania. The ancient scientist Pliny the Elder studied Mount Vesuvius, and died after being poisoned and killed by gas emitted from the volcano during the 79 AD eruption.
Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, died as a prisoner of the German general Odoacer at Naples around 500. In the Middle Ages, the artist Giotto made some frescoes in Castel Nuovo. These works of art were subsequently destroyed by an earthquake.
By the end of the Middle Ages, the medical school of Salerno, which combined ancient Roman and Greek medicine with Arab medicine, was known throughout Europe and its methods were adopted across the continent. Some have suggested that this may have been one of the first universities in Europe. Boccaccio, the Tuscan poet, visited Naples on various occasions, and in the Decameron described it as a dissolute city. He also wrote a love story involving a noble woman close to the King of Naples.
In 1570, the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, who wrote the romance novel Don Quixote, served as a Spanish soldier for a period in Naples. Poet Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento in 1575. Years earlier in 1558, the first modern description and studies of the "camera obscura" ("dark chamber"), were established in Italy by Giovanni Battista della Porta in his  Magiae Naturalis.
Philosopher Giordano Bruno was born in Nola. He was the first to theorize infinite suns and infinite worlds in the universe. He was burnt in Rome by the Spanish Inquisition in 1600. Later, in c. 1606, the Baroque painter Caravaggio established his studio in Naples. Italian Baroque architect Cosimo Fanzago from Bergamo also decided to move to Naples.
In the 18th century, Naples was the last city to be visited by philosophers who created the "Grand Tour" which was the big touring voyage to visit all the important cultural sites of the European continent. Italian architect Luigi Vanvitelli son of Dutch architect Kaspar van Wittel built the Kingdom Palace in Caserta in c. 1750.
