==History==

The first school in Karibib was opened in 1902 by a missionary. In 1907 Deutsche Schule Karibib (DSK, [tpl]lang-de|German School Karibib[/tpl], also: Privatschule Karibib) was opened in town, first as a government school of Imperial Germany, and after World War I as private school. When competition from other German schools eroded its pupil base, the school closed down in 1986. The campus is currently leased to the similarly named but unrelated Karibib Private School which sees itself as continuing the legacy of DSK.
