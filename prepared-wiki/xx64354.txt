The hobo spider (Tegenaria agrestis) is a member of the genus of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian funnel-web spider. It is one of a small number of spiders whose bites are generally considered to be medically significant.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations.

==Habitat and History==

===Europe===

The Hobo spider is a resident of fields, rarely entering human habitations due to the presence of major competitors, particularly the giant house spider (Tegenaria duellica) which is a common resident of houses and other man-made structures in Europe. As a result, human contacts with the hobo spider are uncommon in Europe. 
It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species.Checklist of Danish Spiders (Araneae). Version 26-10-2011 (list)
The species was first described in 1802 by naturalist C.A. Walkenaer,Faune Parisienne, vol. 2, p. 187 under the name Aranea agrestis, in reference to its western European habitat in fields, woods, and under rocks.

===North America===

Tegenaria agrestis is a non-native species in the United States, where it was introduced to the Pacific Northwest from Western Europe. It is believed to have first appeared in the port city of Seattle sometime before the 1930s.http://www.bulkmsm.com/research/spider/Australia/page7.htm#2 There is speculation that it arrived as eggs in commercial agricultural shipments from Europe, since isolated adults in shipments would have had difficulty in establishing a breeding population. It was first reported in the U.S. in 1936 by arachnologist Harriet Exline (as Tegenaria magnacava).Psyche, vol. 43(1), pp. 21–26), cited in http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/uma/ims/hobo.pdf There, without the widespread presence of any dominant competitors, it rapidly adapted to living in urban areas, where it became abundant and extended its range. By 1968 it had become established as far east as Spokane, Washington, and Moscow, Idaho, and as far south as Roseburg, Oregon.Darwin K. Vest. 1999. The Hobo Spider Website. hobospider.org They have recently been discovered as far north as Vancouver Island, Canada.How to Identify and Handle a Brown Recluse - Smarter Every Day 89 - YouTube Hobo spiders have also been found in other western states, such as Utah, where they are commonly found inside of homes.Hobo Spiders - Utah Plant Pest Diagnostic Lab - utahpests.usu.edu
(Two other closely related spiders live in Washington state, the giant house spider (Tegenaria duellica, or alternatively Tegenaria gigantea) and the barn funnel weaving spider or domestic house spider (Tegenaria domestica). All three of these spiders originated in Europe.)

==Identification==

Spiders, including the hobo spider, vary considerably in appearance, and identification can be difficult. Identification relies on an examination of the spider’s anatomy. Positive identification requires microscopic examination of the epigynum and palps and is best done by an arachnologist. However, the following characteristics can help in identification of hobo spiders in order to prevent misidentification and eradication of beneficial species with a similar general appearance:

==Toxicity and aggression==

The toxicity and aggression of the hobo spider are currently disputed by arachnologists. One common name, the aggressive house spider may arise from a misinterpretation of the Latin name agrestis, (lit. "of the fields") as "aggressive". If a hobo spider is tending an egg sac, it may become aggressive if it perceives the egg sac as being threatened.Rod Crawford (10 September, 2010).  Myths about "Dangerous" Spiders. Burke Museum of Natural History & Culture However, they generally do not bite unless forced to protect themselves.
In the United States, the hobo spider has been considered to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits.Vest, D. K. (1987). Envenomation by Tegenaria agrestis (Walckenaer) spiders in rabbits. Toxicon 25(2):221-4. This laboratory study has led to the proposal that in some parts of the U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite.Vest, D. K. (1987). Necrotic arachnidism in the northwest United States and its probable relationship to Tegenaria agrestis (Walckenaer) spiders. Toxicon 25(2):175-84. The CDC and other U.S. government agenciesHobo Spider have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Necrotic arachnidism- Pacific Northwest, 1988-1996. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1996;45:433-6. despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic.Vetter, R. S. and G. K. Isbister. (2004). Do hobo spider bites cause dermonecrotic injuries? Annals of Emergency Medicine 44:605-607.
In Canada, there are scientists who claim that no hobo spider bites lead to dermal necrosis.Bennett, R. G. and R. S. Vetter. (2004). An approach to spider bites: erroneous attribution of dermonecrotic lesions to brown recluse and hobo spider bites in Canada. Canadian Fam. Physician 50: 1098-1101. Hobo spiders are common in Europe, though bites are relatively uncommon, and there are no confirmed reports of them causing necrosis despite hundreds of years of coexistence there. The only documented case of a verified hobo spider bite leading to necrotic skin lesions involves a person who had a pre-existing medical condition (phlebitis) that can also cause the appearance of skin lesions.
Hobo spider bites are not known to be fatal to healthy humans. The necrosis in purported cases is similar to, but milder than, that caused by the brown recluse spider, and in severe cases can take months to heal. Other reported symptoms include intense headaches, vision abnormalities, and/or general feelings of malaise. These symptoms are not confirmed for the hobo spider bite specifically due to lack of positive identification of the spider by an expert, and the Oregon Poison Center (affiliated with the Oregon Health & Science University) is attempting to gather definitive evidence regarding the validity of these reports as of September 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/ohsuedu/newspub/releases/090507spider.cfm|title=OHSU Wants Your Spiders, Dead or Alive|date=2007-09-05|publisher=Oregon Health & Science University|accessdate=2007-11-02[/tpl]
