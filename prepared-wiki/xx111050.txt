The porous nature of biscuit earthenware means that it readily absorbs water, while vitreous ware and bone china are almost non-porous even without glazing.Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd & David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994. The temperature of biscuit firing is usually at least 1000°C, although higher temperatures are common.Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control. W.Ryan & C.Radford. Pergamon Press / Institute Of Ceramics, 1987. The firing of the ware that results in the biscuit article causes permanent chemical and physical changes to occur. These result in a much harder and more resilient article which can still be porous, and this can ease the application of glazes.
