[[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Human spaceflight, Manned spacecraft, Constellation program, Orion program

The Crew Exploration Vehicle (or CEV) was the conceptual component of the U.S. NASA Vision for Space Exploration that later became known as the Orion spacecraft. The Orion CEV was part of NASA's Constellation Program to send human explorers back to the Moon, and then onward to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.
Official planning for the vehicle began in 2004, with the final Request For Proposal issued on March 1, 2005, to begin a design competition for the vehicle. For the later design and construction phases, see  Orion (spacecraft). NASA has posted project status notes at the NASA.gov website, under the name "Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle" (see External links, below).

The concept for the vehicle was officially announced in a speech given by George W. Bush at NASA Headquarters on January 14, 2004.[ref]
