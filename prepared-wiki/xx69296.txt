CATEGORIES: Presidents of Afghanistan

Afghanistan has only been a republic between 1973 and 1992 and from 2001 onwards. Before 1973, it was a monarchy that was governed by a variety of kings, emirs or shahs. From 1992 to 2001, during the civil war, the country was recognized as the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

==Powers==

The constitution of Afghanistan grants the president wide powers over military and legislative affairs, with a relatively weak national bicameral national assembly, the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) and Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders).
These were a subject of considerable controversy when debated by the country's Constitutional Loya Jirga in December 2003.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] However, they were seen by the interim administration and its Western backers as being essential to securing the stability of Afghanistan.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
