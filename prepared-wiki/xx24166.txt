Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L)[tpl]cite web | author=IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title=Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | work=Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology etc | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate=2007-05-17[/tpl] is a branched-chain α-amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2CH(CH3)2. Leucine is classified as a hydrophobic amino acid due to its aliphatic isobutyl side chain. It is encoded by six codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG) and is a major component of the subunits in ferritin, astacin and other 'buffer' proteins. Leucine is an essential amino acid, meaning that the human body cannot synthesize it, and it  therefore must be ingested.

==Biosynthesis==

As an essential amino acid, leucine cannot be synthesised by animals. Consequently, it must be ingested, usually as a component of proteins. In plants and microorganisms, leucine is synthesised  from pyruvic acid by a series of enzymes:Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. ISBN 1-57259-153-6.
Synthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid Valine also includes the initial part of this pathway.

==Biology==

Leucine is utilized in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. In adipose and muscle tissue, leucine is used in the formation of sterols, and the combined usage of leucine in these two tissues is seven times greater than its use in the liver.[tpl]cite web | author=J.

Leucine is the only dietary amino acid that has the capacity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.[tpl]cite journal | author=Etzel MR | title=Manufacture and use of dairy protein fractions | journal=The Journal of Nutrition  | volume=134 | issue=4 | year=2004 | pages=996S–1002S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/4/996S.long | pmid=15051860 [/tpl] As a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats.[tpl]cite web | author=L. Combaret, et al. Human Nutrition Research Centre of Clermont-Ferrand | title=A leucine-supplemented diet restores the defective postprandial inhibition of proteasome-dependent proteolysis in aged rat skeletal muscle | work=Journal of Physiology Volume 569, issue 2, p. 489-499 | url=http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/569/2/489 | accessdate=2008-03-25[/tpl] However, results of comparative studies are conflicted. Long-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men.[tpl]cite journal | author=Am J Clin Nutr. | title=Long-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men | year=2009 issue=May 89(5) | pages=1468–75 | doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26668 | pmid=19321567 | volume=89 | issue=5 | journal=Am J Clin Nutr[/tpl] More studies are needed, preferably those which utilize an objective, random sample of society. Factors such as lifestyle choices, age, gender, diet, exercise, etc. must be factored into the analyses in order to isolate the effects of supplemental leucine as a standalone, or if taken with other BCAA's Branched Chain Amino Acids. Until then,  dietary supplemental leucine cannot be associated as the prime reason for muscular growth or optimal maintenance for the entire population.
While once seen as an important part of the three branch chained amino acids in sports supplements, leucine has since earned more attention on its own as a catalyst for muscle growth and muscular insurance.  Supplement companies once marketed the "ideal" 2:1:1 ratio of leucine, isoleucine and valine; but with furthered evidence that leucine is the most important amino acid for muscle building, it has become much more popular as the primary ingredient in dietary supplements with a 4:1:1 ratio.[tpl]cite web | title= Leucine Awesome, Scientists Say |  url=http://sportssupplementreviewer.com/2011/06/leucine-awesome-scientists-say/ | accessdate=2011-06-14  |website= Sports Supplement Reviewer[/tpl]
Leucine potently activates the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase that regulates cell growth. Infusion of leucine into the rat brain has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight via activation of the mTOR pathway.[tpl]cite journal | author=Cota D, Proulx K, Smith KA, Kozma SC, Thomas G, Woods SC, Seeley RJ | title=Hypothalamic mTOR signaling regulates food intake | journal=Science  | volume=312 | issue=5775 | year=2006 | pages=927–930   | id= | pmid=16690869 | doi=10.1126/science.1124147[/tpl]
Leucine toxicity, as seen in decompensated Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), causes delirium and neurologic compromise, and can be life-threatening. More studies need to be done on liver overactivity due to taking supplemental leucine.
Excess leucine may be a cause of pellagra, whose main symptoms are "the four D's": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia and death,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hegyi J, Schwartz R, Hegyi V |title=Pellagra: dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea |journal=Int J Dermatol |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2004 |pmid=14693013 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01959.x[/tpl] though the relationship is unclear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bapurao S, Krishnaswamy K |title=Vitamin B6 nutritional status of pellagrins and their leucine tolerance |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=819–24 |year=1978 |pmid=206127[/tpl]
In yeast genetics, mutants with a defective gene for leucine synthesis (leu2) are transformed with a plasmid that contains a working leucine synthesis gene (LEU2) and grown on minimal media. Leucine synthesis then becomes a useful selectable marker.

==Chemical properties==

Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) since it possesses an aliphatic side-chain that is non-linear.
Racemic leucine had been subjected to circularly polarized synchrotron radiation in order to better understand the origin of biomolecular asymmetry. An enantiomeric enhancement of 2.6% had been induced, indicating a possible photochemical origin of biomolecules' homochirality.Meierhenrich: Amino acids and the asymmetry of life, Springer-Verlag, 2008, ISBN 978-3-540-76885-2.

==Food additive==

As a food additive, L-Leucine has E number E641 and is classified as a flavor enhancer.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
