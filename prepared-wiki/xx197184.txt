Luisa Ottolini (born July 10, 1954 in  Tortona, province of Alessandria, Italy) is an Italian physicist.

==Biography==

In 1978, Luisa Ottolini graduated in Physics at the University of Pavia. From 1982 to 1986, she was the Head of the Structuristic Section at the Istituto Sperimentale dei Metalli Leggeri (I.S.M.L.) in Novara.CNR Comitato Pari Opportunitá - Biography, January 2013 In 1987, she activated the Strategic Project of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) An Ion Microprobe for Advanced Researches in the Earth Sciences with the installation at the “Centro di Studio per la Cristallografia Strutturale” in Pavia of the first, and so far, the only one National Laboratory of Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) in the Earth Sciences. Since that time she has been the Head of the SIMS Lab. Starting from 1989, she activated the National SIMS service for University and CNR Institutions affering the Earth Science Committee (05), following more than 90 research projects.CNR - Biography, January 2013 In 2002-2005 she coordinated a research Unit in Pavia, sponsored by the European Framework Project EUROMELTEUROMELT, January 2013 (European Community’s Human Potential Programme, contract HPRN-CT-2002-00211). Since December 19, 2005, she has been the Head of CNR-Institute of Geosciences and Geo-resources (IGG)-Section of Pavia.
She is coauthor of more than 140 international ISI publications, of which 5 on Nature;Nature. Transition of Mount Etna lavas from a mantle-plume to an island-arc magmatic source, January 2013Nature.

==Main scientific interests==

Her research activities are concerned  mainly the use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for the quantitative measurement of low-concentration constituents, of light (Lithium, Beryllium and Boron) and volatile elements (Hydrogen, Fluorine, Chlorine, Carbon) in geological samples,  with particular reference to the investigation of the physical/chemical processes underlying the production of secondary ions, aiming at overcoming the limitations of the technique (interferences and non-linear effects, “matrix effects”); the development, set up and optimization of SIMS procedures for trace elements,AN ION PROBE CONTRIBUTION TO RARE-EARTH ELEMENT INVESTIGATION OF GABBRO GOG-1 USING SECONDARY ION MASS-SPECTROMETRY light and volatile elements,Quantification of lithium, beryllium, and boron in silicates by secondary-ion mass spectrometry using conventional energy filteringDETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN IN SILICATES BY SECONDARY-ION MASS-SPECTROMETRY and ultra-trace elementsDirect assessment of mantle boron and lithium contents and distribution by SIMS analyses of peridotite minerals in the frame of petrologic, geochemical and crystal-chemical studies, with particular reference to the investigation of melt inclusions,A study of melt inclusions at Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy): insights on the primitive magmas and on the volcanic feeding systemThe relationship between potassic, calc-alkaline and Na-alkaline magmatism in South Italy volcanoes: A melt inclusion approach silicate minerals,An investigation of matrix effects in the analysis of fluorine in humite-group minerals by EMPA, SIMS, and SREFSIMS ionization of hydrogen in silicates: a case study of kornerupine artificial glasses,Preparation of reference glasses for in-situ analysis of lithium and boron chemically-complex silicateNew SIMS procedures for the characterization of a complex silicate matrix, Na-3(REE,Th,Ca,U)Si6O15 center dot 2.5H(2)O (sazhinite), and comparison with EMPA and SREF results and non-silicate matrixes,New data on the crystal-chemistry of fluoborite by means of SREF, SIMS, and EMP analysis experimental charges.Melting of amphibole-bearing wehrlites: An experimental study on the origin of ultra-calcic nepheline-normative meltsPiston-cylinder experiments on H2O undersaturated Fe-bearing systems: An experimental setup approaching f(o2) conditions of natural calc-alkaline magmas
