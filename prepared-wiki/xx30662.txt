</ref> After nearly 7 years and over $24 million in investor funding, the touchscreen kiosks/bartop model was closed amid complaints of unpaid prizes and lack of maintaining service agreements with locations to keep the kiosk/bartop units in working condition.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] The latest iteration (announced in 2005) is a new interactive entertainment restaurant called the uWink Media Bistro, whose concept builds off his Chuck E. Cheese venture and previous 1988–1989 venture Bots Inc., which developed similar systems of customer-side point-of-sale touch-screen terminals in addition to autonomous [[pizza delivery]] robots for [[Little Caesar's Pizza]].  The plan was for guests to order their food and drinks using screens at each table, on which they may also play games with each other and watch movie trailers and short videos. The multiplayer network type video games that allowed table to table interaction or even with table group play never materialized. Guest often spotted the OSX based machine being constantly re-booted in order to play much simpler casual video games. The first Bistro opened in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]] on October 16, 2006.  A second in [[Hollywood]] was established, and in 2008 the company opened a third Southern California restaurant and one in [[Mountain View, California]], in [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name=Holbrook>[tpl]cite web|title=Stett Holbrook, "The Poet of Play," ''Metro Silicon Valley'' Nov. 26, 2008|url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/11.26.08/cover-Bushnell-0848.html|accessdate = 2008-11-30[/tpl]</ref>  Both the Hollywood restaurant and Woodland Hills locations were located in obscure non-ground level locations.

==BrainRush==

Bushnell's most recent company is BrainRush, where he is Founder, CEO and Chairman, a company that uses video game technology in educational software. The company was venture capital funded in 2012. It is based on the idea that many curriculum lessons can be turned into mini-games. Developers can take any body of knowledge from English language arts to foreign language, geography, multiplication table or chemistry tables, to parts of the human body and gamify the experience. BrainRush calls their underlying technology "Adaptive Practice." They've also developed an open-authoring system allowing users to quickly create games in different topic areas.
Between 2010-2012 BrainRush ran a test in Spanish language vocabulary learning with over 2200 teachers and 80,000 students across the country and got an increase in learning speed of between 8–10 times traditional learning. BrainRush is rolling out the full platform in the Fall of 2013.
