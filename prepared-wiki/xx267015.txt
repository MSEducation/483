The Ambassador of the Kingdom of England to Portugal was the foremost diplomatic representative of the historic Kingdom of England in Portugal, before the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.
The position was not always a continuous or permanent one, and there was sometimes no diplomatic representation between the two countries.
For ambassadors of the Court of St James's to Portugal after 1707, see List of ambassadors of Great Britain to Portugal.
