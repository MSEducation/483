The Mental Health Foundation was founded in 1949. It is a British charitable organization that provides information, carries out research, and campaigns to improve services for people affected by mental health problems. It now incorporates the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities.

==History and origins==

In 1949 Derek Richter, a neurochemist with an interest in mental health, and Ian Henderson, a stockbroker, formed the Mental Health Research Fund (MHRF), with the aim of raising funds to award grants for research in mental health. In 1972 the Fund merged with another fundraising body, The Mental Health Trust, and in 1973 was renamed the Mental Health Foundation.http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/about-us/our-history/
