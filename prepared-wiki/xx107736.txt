Vuntut National Park is a national park located in northern Yukon, Canada. It was established in 1995. Due to land claims negotiations, this national park is still very undeveloped. It currently has no roads or developed trails.
Vuntut National Park is adjacent to another Canadian National Park, Ivvavik National Park.  Also, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lies just across the border in Alaska, USA.
