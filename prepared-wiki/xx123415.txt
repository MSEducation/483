There are three floors with eight units per floor. One unit is located in the basement as is communal storage and laundry facilities.

==Owner==

The building is owned by a non-profit corporation of which the residents of the building are member owners. The co-op is run cooperatively by the members via the seven-member Board of Directors that meets monthly to take care of the co-op's business.

==Membership==

Generally, membership is allowed to any one who wishes to purchase and live in a unit in the building. All potential members must go through a background check and an interview with the board, which has the right to deny membership for any legally allowed reason.
Although a cooperative situation, members generally do not split the duties of the co-op's business with the exception of board service. Live-in caretakers are responsible for all cleaning duties and basic maintenance as well as working with various city and state governments to ensure all annual inspections are completed on time.
