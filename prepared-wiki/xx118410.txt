AL-LAD, also known as 6-allyl-6-''nor''-LSD, is a novel psychedelic drug and an analogue of LSD. It is described by Alexander Shulgin in the book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). While AL-LAD has subtly different effects than LSD, and appears to be slightly shorter lasting, their potencies are similar;[tpl]cite journal |author=Hoffman AJ, Nichols DE |title=Synthesis and LSD-like discriminative stimulus properties in a series of N(6)-alkyl norlysergic acid N,N-diethylamide derivatives |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1252â€“5 |date=September 1985 |pmid=4032428 |doi= 10.1021/jm00147a022|url=[/tpl] an active dose of AL-LAD is reported to be between 80 and 160 micrograms[tpl]CiteTiHKAL|pages=392[/tpl] though there are many reports of higher dosages being taken.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/Thread-AL-LAD |title=AL-LAD Thread.
