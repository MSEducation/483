[[Cyrestinae]]

CATEGORIES: Nymphalidae, Cyrestinae

Cyrestinae is a small subfamily of nymphalid brush-footed butterflies. It is considered to include only three genera Marpesia, Chersonesia and Cyrestis distributed in the tropics.N. Wahlberg , J.

==Systematics==

The circumscription of the Cyrestinae has seen some changes in the recent years, when it was first suggested that the former tribes Cyrestini and Pseudergolini formed a monophyletic clade, and the name was given to the proposed new subfamily,Niklas Wahlberg , Elisabet Weingartner , and Sören Nylin 2003 Towards a better understanding of the higher systematics of Nymphalidae (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 28: 473–484. but the tribes were split again later—as two independent subfamilies—as their positions within the Nymphalidae were defined more clearly. It is now considered to be the sister group to the larger subfamily Nymphalinae, and only three genera are included:
Marpesia is Neotropical and Cyrestis and Chersonesia are mainly Oriental with few species in the Afrotropics.Wahlberg, Niklas and Andrew V. Z. Brower. 2012. Cyrestinae Guenée 1865.
