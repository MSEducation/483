[[Calorimetry]]

CATEGORIES: Calorimetry, Heat transfer

Calorimetry is the science or act of measuring changes in parameters of chemical reactions, physical changes and phase transitions, for the purpose of deriving the heat or heat transfer associated with those changes.   Calorimetry is performed with a calorimeter. The word calorimetry is derived from the Latin word calor, meaning heat and the Greek word μέτρον (metron), meaning measure.  Scottish physician and scientist Joseph Black, who was the first to recognize the distinction between heat and temperature, is said to be the founder of the science of calorimetry.[tpl]cite book|author= Laidler, Keith, J.|title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-19-855919-4[/tpl] 
Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce by measuring either their production of carbon dioxide and nitrogen waste (frequently ammonia in aquatic organisms, or urea in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of oxygen. 
Lavoisier noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption this way, using multiple regression. The Dynamic Energy Budget theory explains why this procedure is correct. Heat generated by living organisms may also be measured by direct calorimetry, in which the entire organism is placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement.
A widely used modern instrument is the differential scanning calorimeter, a device which allows thermal data to be obtained on small amounts of material. It involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and recording the heat flow either into or from the specimen.

==Classical calorimetric calculation of heat==

===Basic classical calculation with respect to volume===

Calorimetry requires that a reference material that changes temperature have known definite thermal constitutive properties. The classical rule, recognized by Clausius and by Kelvin, is that the pressure exerted by the calorimetric material is fully and rapidly determined solely by its temperature and volume; this rule is for changes that do not involve phase change, such as melting of ice. There are many materials that do not comply with this rule, and for them, the present formula of classical calorimetry does not provide an adequate account. Here the classical rule is assumed to hold for the calorimetric material being used, and the propositions are mathematically written:
where
The heat capacity at constant volume is the heat required for unit increment in temperature at constant volume. It can be said to be 'measured along an isochor', and again, the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. It always has a positive sign. This means that for an increase in the temperature of a body without change of its volume, heat must be supplied to it. This is consistent with common experience.

===Constant-volume calorimetry (Bomb Calorimetry)===

Constant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter. Heat is still measured by the above-stated principle of calorimetry.

===Classical heat calculation with respect to pressure===

From the above rule of calculation of heat with respect to volume, there follows one with respect to pressure.Crawford, F.H. (1963), Section 5.10, pp. 121–122.Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 23.

===Calorimetry through phase change===

An early calorimeter was that used by Laplace and Lavoisier, as shown in the figure above. It worked at constant temperature, and at atmospheric pressure. The latent heat involved was then not a latent heat with respect to volume or with respect to pressure, as in the above account for calorimetry without phase change. The latent heat involved in this calorimeter was with respect to phase change, naturally occurring at constant temperature. This kind of calorimeter worked by measurement of mass of water produced by the melting of ice, which is a phase change.

===Mathematical aspects of the above rules===

In terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be writtenTruesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977), page 20.

===Physical scope of the above rules of calorimetry===

The above rules refer only to suitable calorimetric materials. The terms 'rapidly' and 'very small' call for empirical physical checking of the domain of validity of the above rules.
The above rules for the calculation of heat belong to pure calorimetry. They make no reference to thermodynamics, and were mostly understood before the advent of thermodynamics. They are the basis of the 'thermo' contribution to thermodynamics. The 'dynamics' contribution is based on the idea of work, which is not used in the above rules of calculation.

==Experimentally conveniently measured coefficients==

Empirically, it is convenient to measure properties of calorimetric materials under experimentally controlled conditions.

===Pressure increase at constant volume===

For measurements at experimentally controlled volume, one can use the assumption, stated above, that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is can be expressed as a function of its volume and temperature.
For measurement at constant experimentally controlled volume, the isochoric coefficient of pressure rise with temperature, is defined by

===Expansion at constant pressure===

The quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled pressure, the isobaric volume expansion coefficient, is defined by

===Compressibility at constant temperature===

The quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled temperature, the isothermal compressibility, is defined by

==Connection between calorimetry and thermodynamics==

Thermodynamics developed gradually over the first half of the nineteenth century, building on the above theory of calorimetry which had been worked out before it, and on other discoveries. According to Gislason and Craig (2005): "Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..."Gislason, E.A., Craig, N.C. (2005). Cementing the foundations of thermodynamics:comparison of system-based and surroundings-based definitions of work and heat, J. Chem. Thermodynamics 37: 954-966. According to Kondepudi (2008): "Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories."Kondepudi, D. (2008), page 63.
Then it can be shown that one can write a thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

Then, according to Adkins (1975),Adkins, C.J. (1975), page 46. it can be shown that one can write a further thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

==Special interest of thermodynamics in calorimetry: the isothermal segments of a Carnot cycle==

Calorimetry has a special benefit for thermodynamics. It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a Carnot cycle.
A Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:
In isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by
and in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by
Because the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by
