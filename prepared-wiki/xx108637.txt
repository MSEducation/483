[[Toronto water taxi]]

CATEGORIES: Water transport in Toronto

Toronto water taxis operate in the Canadian city of Toronto as an alternate form of transportation to and from the Toronto Islands.

==Operations and Restrictions==

Unlike the city run ferry service, water taxis are privately run and cost more to cover the same distance. The taxis offer services to those who are stranded on the Islands when ferry service is disrupted or ended or to patrons who have missed boarding their cruise ships at various docks along the mainland. Inner taxis normally offer services within the inner harbour only.Nautical Adventures
