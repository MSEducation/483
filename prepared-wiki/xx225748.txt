The Martinique Macaw, Ara martinica, als known as Orange-bellied Macaw, is an hypothetical extinct species of parrot that may have been native to Martinique, a French island in the eastern Caribbean Sea.[tpl]cite web| publisher =The Extinction Website (2008) |url = http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/martiniquemacaw.htm |title = Species Info: Ara martinica |accessdate = 5 October 2008 [/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

The species was first scientifically described and named by Walter Rothschild in 1905 (and later in his 1907 book, Extinct Birds), in the absence of a specimen and based on a brief 17th-century report from the island by Pere Bouton. Bouton described the Martinique Macaw as follows:
Rothschild initially called these parrots Anodorhynchus martinicus and later Ara martinicus. There are no remains of the parrots that lived on the island, and so the existence of a unique island species may never be proven. They could have been a feral population of parrots originating from Blue-and-yellow Macaws that were taken to the island as pets by humans.[tpl]cite book |title = Extinct Birds |pages = 148â€“149 |first = Errol |last = Fuller | year = 1987| publisher = Penguin Books (England) |isbn = 0-670-81787-2[/tpl] No evidence other than Bouton's account is known, but a 1626 painting by Roelant Savery has been suggested to show this bird alongside a Dodo.
Rothschild also named Ara erythrura (Red-tailed Blue-and-yellow Macaw or Satin Macaw) in 1907, based on the following 1658 description by Charles de Rochefort:
This species was supposed to have been native to Jamaica or Martinique.[tpl]cite web| publisher =The Extinction Website (2008) |url = http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/redtailedmacaw.htm |title = Species Info: Ara erythrura |accessdate = 8 October 2008 [/tpl] However, James Greenway suggested Rochefort's description was dubious, as he had never visited Jamaica, and appeared to have based his account on Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre's.Greenway, J. C. 1958. Extinct and vanishing birds of the world. American Committee for International Wild Life Protection 13, New York.Williams, M. I. & D. V.

A. & F. E. Sergile, eds.) Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press. It is considered the same as the Martinique Macaw today, if either has ever existed.
