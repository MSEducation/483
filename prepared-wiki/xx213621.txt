In August, 2000, CNSI was founded on both campuses of UCSB and UCLA. Martha Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, was named the founder.

==Active leaders==

===UCLA===

The people that oversee CNSI at UCLA are broken down into 4 groups: Leaders (group of head directors), Governing Board, Executive Committee, and External Advisory Board.

====Leadership====

====Governing Board====

The Governing Board was created to advise the leaders in all scientific issues including operations and research guidance of CNSI. Also, the Governing Board helps in creating objectives for researchers to strive for in the future. Today, the Governing Board consists of 6 Deans from UCLA's schools of medicine, engineering and sciences."Governing Board". . 25 October 2008.

====Executive Committee====

The CNSI Executive Committee overlooks all business policy related matters. Also, the Executive Committee governs and manages any and all CNSI issues like the Governing Board. CNSI bylaws were created the Executive Committee on December 13, 2007."Executive Committee". . 25 October 2008.

====External Advisory Board====

The CNSI External Advisory Board has been established to provide advice and guidance to the Institute Director and Co-Director in their efforts to develop the CNSI as an international center for the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The board seeks to identify innovative collaborative partnerships with industry to enhance the CNSI's impact at state, national and international levels. The board assists in defining performance expectations for the Institute and oversees regular reviews prepared by the Director and Co-Director. The board meets annually."External Advisory Board". . 04 March 2010.

===UCSB===

The people in charge of UCSB CNSI fall into 2 categories: the administrative staff and the faculty.

====Administrative staff====

==Current research==

===UCLA===

Research at the California NanoSystems Institute has significant impact on important areas such as energy, the environment, health- medicine, and information technology.

====Energy====

Nanotechnology is being implemented to promote alternate forms of renewable energy. Research in this area has led to the development of materials that work more efficiently and are more cost effective. Nanotechnology is leading the way with developments in decreasing battery size and smaller energy sources to keep up with increasingly compacted technologies demanded by the electronics industry. Researchers have discovered not only how to capture natural energy, but also how to efficiently store and use energy at the nanoscale.

====Environment====

Nanotechnology research is producing solutions to many of the environmental problems faced today as well as anticipating problems before they arise. Current problems include greenhouse gas emissions being discharged into the atmosphere by the combustion of fossil fuels to generate power and how to effectively use natural resources in ways that will not harm the environment. Nanotechnologies are providing many benefits as well as preserving the environment and using natural materials that will minimize the human footprint. Efforts are also under way to develop new testing and risk assessment methods to deal with the proliferation of new materials being created and catch harmful substances before damage can be done.

====Health - Medicine====

Nanotechnology in the arena of health and science is rapidly advancing procedures, medicines and diagnostic tools, giving hope to many patients and answers for many doctors and researchers. Nanotechnology has been used to develop sensors that aid in early cancer detection, as well as a variety of drug delivering therapeutics to treat a wide variety of diseases including heart disease and diabetes. Efforts are also under way to use nanotechnology for the treatment and outbreak management of infectious diseases.

====Information Technology====

New and efficient electronic technologies are making their way from science fiction to reality. Smaller chip sizes for computers and the ability to store more information and tools in electronics increases the ability and minimizes materials for information technology devices such as computers. With research in nanotechnology, innovations and inventions will become not only faster and more energy efficient, but smaller in size making it possible for more to fit into the palm of a hand or in the depth of a pocket."CNSI, UCLA Research". . 04 March 2010.

===UCSB===

Current nanotechnology research being conducted on the UCSB campus is organized into three differing fields.

====Biology and biomedical====

The research fields of nanobiology(nanobiotechnology) and biomedicine show promise in the connection of nanoscale science to biological/nonbiological matter. New diagnostic methods as well as new ways to administer increasingly efficient disease specific treatments are also being researched and developed."Biological and Biomedical". . 13 October 2008.

====Energy efficiency====

Nanotechnology has promise to help fight global warming. Nanoscale research can promise more efficient, less wasteful technologies. Also, nanoscale allows to control, transform and store energy more efficiently."Energy Efficiency". . 13 October 2008.
