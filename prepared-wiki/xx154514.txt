Eckhard Krautzun  (born 13 January 1941 in Solingen) is a German football coach and former football player.

==Managerial career==

As a player, Krautzun turned out for Union Solingen, Rheydter SV, 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Young Fellows Zürich and TeBe Berlin. As well as a manager, Krautzun has acted as a technical director and scout. He has worked extensively in North America and Asia, where he worked as a scout in China and Korea from 2001–2003.
Krautzun was the first head coach of Canada not to hail from that country or the United Kingdom. After his resignation, Krautzun pointed to the lack of public support for amateur sports in Canada as a reason for the country's lack of success on the international stage.[tpl]cite web | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/clips/3099/ | title = How do Canadian athletes stack up? | date = 8 June 1975 | accessdate = 22 May 2011 | work = CBC Digital Archives[/tpl]Krautzen went on right after resigning to coach in the NASL with the Vancouver Whitecaps (and later with the Houston Hurricane and Ft. Lauderdale Strikers). He was not a popular coach with the Whitecaps due to the defensive style of play he employed. It was only later with the Strikers (with stars such as Gerd Muller, Teofilo Cubillas, Ray Hudson and Branko Segota) where he loosened up and got his teams attacking and the Strikers had two very successful seasons getting to the semi-finals twice.
The German steered Tunisia through World Cup 2002 qualifying but resigned ahead of the tournament, citing interference from the Tunisian FA with his coaching.
Krauztun was in charge of a training camp for promising Chinese youngsters in Bad Kissingen, Germany in 2006, helping prepare the younger generation of players for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/sep/06/theknowledge.sport | title = What's in a number? | publisher = The Guardian | date = 6 September 2005 | accessdate = 22 May 2011[/tpl] In 2007, he acted as an adviser to the Chinese women's team, stepping down in March of that year due to health issues.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2007-03/09/content_824248.htm | title = Krautzun steps down as adviser to Chinese women's soccer team | publisher = China Daily | date = 9 March 2007 | accessdate = 22 May 2011[/tpl]
