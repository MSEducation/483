A shared nothing architecture (SN) is a distributed computing architecture in which each node is independent and self-sufficient, and there is no single point of contention across the system. More specifically, none of the nodes share memory or disk storage.
People typically contrast SN with systems that keep a large amount of centrally-stored state information, whether in a database, an application server, or any other similar single point of contention. While SN is best known in the context of web development, the concept predates the web: Michael Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley used the term in a 1986 database paper.The Case for Shared Nothing Architecture by Michael Stonebraker. published in Database Engineering, Volume 9, Number 1 (1986).(PDF) In it he mentions existing commercial implementations of the architecture (although none are named explicitly).   Teradata,  which delivered its first system in 1983, was probably one of those commercial implementations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teradata.com/t/history/ |title=Teradata History |publisher=Teradata.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] Tandem Computers officially released NonStop SQL, a shared nothing database, in 1984.NonStop SQL, A Distributed, High-Performance, High-Availability Implementation of SQL, Tandem Technical Report TR-87.4, http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/tandem/TR-87.4.pdf
Shared nothing is popular for web development because of its scalability. As Google has demonstrated, a pure SN system can scale almost infinitely simply by adding nodes in the form of inexpensive computers, since there is no single bottleneck to slow the system down.[ref]
