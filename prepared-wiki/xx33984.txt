[[Cockshoot Broad]]

CATEGORIES: Norfolk Broads

Cockshoot Broad, one of the Norfolk Broads, lies on the River Bure within The Broads National Park in Norfolk, England. It is one of several Broads where boats are not allowed at any time of the year, although they can moor at its entrance. It is a nature reserve in the care of Norfolk Wildlife Trust. Before becoming a nature reserve it was one of the most dilapidated broads, clogged with large amounts of silt. The silt was dredged in the early 1980s and the Broad has been returned to the way it looked some 100 years ago.
Cockshoot Broad is renowned for its Waterlily beds and the Damselflies they attract.
A pedestrian route around the front of the broad allows views across and there is also a bird hide.
