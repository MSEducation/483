==Music career==

In 1977, Hunt graduated from Brazoswood High School in Clute, Texas.  He then attended  Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he graduated
in 1980.  Later, Hunt returned to Berklee, where he is an instructor in the piano department.
While recording and performing in the Boston area with his Berklee contemporaries  Randy Roos and Tiger Okoshi, Hunt also performed with Peter Calo's bands Bellvista, and Thin Ice.  During 1985, he toured with  fusion drummer Billy Cobham.
From late 1985 to 1987, he served as musical director for the Jazz Explosion.  Here, he led a trio which backed up one or more important artists on tours.  The trio consisted of Hunt, bassist Jimmy Earl, and Victor Jones on drums.  The artists included: Gato Barbieri, Angela Bofill, Tom Browne, Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Kenny G, Freddy Hubbard, Ramsey Lewis, Noel Pointer, Stanley Turrentine, and the late Phyllis Hyman. The Jazz Explosion performed in the Kennedy Center in Washington, the Circle Star Theater in San Francisco, the Beacon Theatre in New York, the Universal Theater in Los Angeles, and Hammersmith Odeon in London.
In 1987, Hunt left the Jazz Explosion to go, with Earl and drummer Gerry Brown, on a tour of Europe led by fusion bassist Stanley Clarke and guitarist Alan Holdsworth.  In 1988, he recorded on Clarke's  album If This Bass Could Only Talk, and in 1993, on East River Drive, where he is credited with helping to compose the song "I'm Home Africa".
From 1987 to 2003, Hunt performed, toured, and recorded as a member of Allan Holdsworth's band. Several of his compositions appear on Holdsworth's albums.  On Secrets (1989), Hunt is credited with composing "Maid Marion", and "Joshua".  On  Wardenclyffe Tower (1992), he did "Dodgy Boat".  On Hard Hat Area, he helped to write "Prelude" and "Postlude".  On the album Then!, which was  recorded live in Japan, he helped with "Zone I", "Zone II", and "Zone III".  Tracks from these albums are included in the compilation The Best of Allan Holdsworth: Against the Clock
In 1997, percussionist Gregg Bendian recorded on Hunt's album From Your Heart and Soul, which also featured a performance by Holdsworth.  This began a relationship in which Hunt recorded on four of Bendian's albums.  Two of these, Trio Pianissimo and Change, are studio albums with Bendian's Trio Pianissimo, and two are part of  Bendian's Mahavishnu Project, which is his tribute to John McLaughlin.
In Chelmsford, MA, Hunt runs a record company, Spice Rack Records, which is closely associated with The Kitchen Recording Studio.  These companies created both Hunt's first album, mentioned above, and in 2007, his second, Live at the PCA.  In other releases, Hunt serves not only as producer, arranger, or engineer, but also as a performer.  The label has recorded works by: guitarist David Hines (2 albums), his wife, pianist Pamela Hines (5 albums), and bassist Christian Fabian (2 albums).  Eight more single releases are by: Auditory Implant, Robert Badoglio, Peter Fedele, Isha, Lucas Pickford, Lewis Robinson, Ed Spargo, and Nicole Storm.
Hunt has recorded extensively as a guest artist.  An example is Peter Janson's album Beautiful Day, on which Hunt is credited with helping to compose the songs "December Morning Sun", "Dragonfly", and "Beautiful Day".
When he is not busy in The Kitchen, Hunt performs locally and on tour.  Occasionally, he also performs   in festivals and at conventions.
