Lasers is the third studio album by American rapper Lupe Fiasco, released on March 7, 2011 by Atlantic Records. Production for the album took place between 2008 and 2010. Lasers features production by The Audibles, The Neptunes, Needlz, Alex da Kid, Syience, and long-time collaborator Soundtrakk, among others. Trey Songz, John Legend, Skylar Grey, Sway, Matt Mahaffey, MDMA, Eric Turner and Sarah Green contribute vocals to the album.
Lasers was preceded by the lead single "The Show Goes On" and its follow-up "Words I Never Said" featuring Skylar Grey. The former became Fiasco's highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been certified double platinum in the US. The latter, however, only achieved moderate success on the Hot 100.
The album has received "mixed or average reviews" from most major music critics, having a score of 57 out of 100 at the review aggregator Metacritic. It fared better commercially however, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over 200,000 copies sold, making the album Fiasco's second top ten album as well as his highest entry on the chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/chart-moves-katy-perry-rihanna-set-records-1005079122.story |title=Chart Moves: Katy Perry, Rihanna Set Records; Lupe Fiasco, Christian Music on Billboard 200 |publisher=Billboard.biz |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19[/tpl]

==Background==

Lupe Fiasco was originally going to release the album as a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. He then postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively called The Great American Rap Album in June 2009.Sharks (February 2, 2009). Lupe Fiasco to Release 'The Great American Rap Album'. TheBoombox. Retrieved on 2011-03-16. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. "Lasers" is a backronym for "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/07/03/trailer-lupe-fiasco-lasers/ |title=Trailer: Lupe Fiasco – ‘Lasers’ |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02[/tpl] Referring to the title of the album, Fiasco has stated: "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just put it in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym sic to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.[tpl]cite web|author=Source: Penny Newton |url=http://www.mtv.com.au/news/657b9996-interview-lupe-fiasco/ |title=INTERVIEW: Lupe Fiasco | Lupe Fiasco | News | MTV Australia |publisher=Mtv.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-03-04[/tpl]
In 2010, to promote the message of the album, Fiasco released a viral video onto the internet titled "The L.A.S.E.R.S. Manifesto", which can be found on both YouTube and the official website. The manifesto reads:[tpl]YouTube|BZtAQQh-yYA|LUPE FIASCO - THE L.A.S.E.R.S.

We want an end to the glamorization of negativity in the media. We want an end to status symbols dictating our worth as individuals. We want a meaningful and universal education system.

We want to think our own thoughts. We will be responsible for our environment. We want clarity & truth from our elected officials or they should move aside. We want love not lies. We want an end to all wars foreign & domestic violence. We want an end to the processed culture of exploitation, over-consumption & waste. We want knowledge, understanding & peace. We will not lose because we are not losers, we are lasers! Lasers are revolutionary. Lasers are the future.[/tpl]
On January 4, 2011, Billboard revealed two guest appearances on Fiasco's album Lasers. The guests confirmed were Trey Songz and British rapper Sway. In the interview with Billboard, Fiasco expressed his thoughts on music piracy and fighting track leaks on various blogs. Speaking about the problems with his record label, Fiasco has stated: "I think I set the precedent for record labels — showed everyone that you can have rappers that don't fit the format and still have a presence ... You look at a person like me, or Kanye West, and it was sort of a shock to the system. I definitely think I was part of changing that, and an influence to a lot dudes that are coming out today."Frazier, Walter (December 30, 2010). Lupe Fiasco Drops Label Beef to Focus on 'Lasers'. Billboard. Retrieved on 2011-03-16.
In a 2011 interview with MTV UK, Fiasco said that the album "doesn’t have a storyline, whereas The Cool was a concept album and this is more just a collection of songs that share some of the same tones, which is basically just positivity and consciousness. Some of the records are controversial, but it’s less cohesive than The Cool."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/music/urban/259115-lupe-fiasco-the-interview |title=Lupe Fiasco: The Interview! | Mtv Uk |publisher=Mtv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] Talking about the album with Details, Fiasco has stated that he wanted to make "a popular record ... but by my definition of popular ... an uprising of the people".[tpl]cite web|last=Knafo |first=Saki |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201103/lupe-fiasco-hip-hop-mc-touch-the-sky |title=Lupe Fiasco Goes Mainstream—His Way: Music + Books |language=[tpl]en icon[/tpl] |publisher=Details |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl] He has also stated that the creation of the album was "a very painful, dark, fucked-up process."

Speaking about the album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: "Lasers is a great album. I'm actually happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for what it took to get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can."[tpl]cite news|last=Conner |first=Thomas |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2011/03/lupe_fiasco_does_what_hes_told.html |title=Lupe Fiasco: 'I am a hostage' - struggles through difficult creative process for new 'Lasers' album - Music: Via Chicago |publisher=Blogs.suntimes.com |date= 2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-03-03[/tpl] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it .... I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely."[tpl]cite news|author=Angus Batey |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/03/lupe-fiasco-lasers-atlantic |title=Lupe Fiasco: 'I have the right to speak out' | Angus Batey | Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2011-03-03|accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=London[/tpl]

==Release conflict and petition==

Lupe Fiasco had announced on Twitter that the album was complete and was waiting for Atlantic Records to release it. A fan awaiting the release of the album, put together an online petition with the help of Rhymestyle from the "LupEND Blog" fan site, demanding that Atlantic Records release Lasers, due to the fact that the album was announced for a 2010 release and at the time still did not have a release date.[tpl]cite web|last=Baron |first=Zach |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/09/introducing_fia.php |title=Introducing Fiasco Friday, A Quixotic Plan to Picket the Offices of Atlantic Records In the Name of Lupe Fiasco - New York Music - Sound of the City |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/03/hip-hops-reluctant-hero.html |title=Hip-Hop’s Reluctant Hero |publisher=LA Times Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl] The petition garnered considerable attention on hip hop blog sites and attained over 5,000 signatures on its first day.[tpl]cite web|last=Koroma |first=Salima |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11771/title.dx-news-bits-kid-cudi-lupe-fiasco |title=DX News Bits: Kid Cudi, Lupe Fiasco | Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHopDX |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2011-02-18[/tpl] In response to the petition, Lupe Fiasco released a song titled "B.M.F.

Speaking in a March 2011 interview with New York about the support that his fans have given him to release the album, Fiasco has said: "It was amazing, humbling, and inspiring, to the point where I went back in the studio and did more records … it made everything real, that your music is actually something that people want.
