When the church was demolished in 1868 the arcade which connected the chapel to the church was walled up and a new south porch added. The chapel contains a series of monuments, including those to the parliamentarian John Evelyn who died in 1684 and his family.P.J.D., The Borbach Chantry, West Dean, Salisbury & Winchester Journal, April sixth 1928, page 9 Other memorials are to the Pierrepont family who inherited the adjacent manor house from him, which has since been demolished.[tpl]cite web|title=Church Monument Handbook|url=http://www.minervaconservation.com/articles/monument_handbook.pdf|publisher=Minerva Conservation|accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl] The church was declared redundant in 1971.[tpl]cite web|title=Order for the Borbach Chantry to become redundant.|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/archives/getarchive.php?id=98493|publisher=Wiltshire County Council|accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl]
