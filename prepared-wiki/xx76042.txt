Pleshet is the Hebrew name for what might otherwise be called the "land of the Philistines" according to the Hebrew Bible (see Book of Genesis 21:32, Exodus 13:17, 1 Samuel 27:1, Joel 3:4).[tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=Vilnai, Ze'ev|authorlink=Zev Vilnay|title=Pleshet|encyclopedia=Ariel Encyclopedia|volume=Volume 7|page=6108|publisher=Am Oved|location=Tel Aviv, Israel|year=1979[/tpl] [tpl]he icon[/tpl]
The term refers to the coastal region that stretches roughly from Gaza in the South to Ashdod in the North. The five main cities of the Philistines during the time of the Kings of Israel were Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath.
It was the name given to an Israeli army operation north of Gaza launched in June 1948.
