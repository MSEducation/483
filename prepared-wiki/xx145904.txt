==Overview==

It will have 4600 triangular panels and be similar in design to the Arecibo Observatory, utilizing a natural hollow (karst) to provide support for the telescope dish. As the name suggests, it will have a diameter of 500m.
It will use an active surface that adjusts to create parabolas in different directions, with an effective dish size of 300 m. This means that it will not be confined to pointing directly upwards, but capable of covering the sky within 40 degrees from the zenith. Its working frequency will be 0.3-5.1 GHz, with a pointing precision of 4 arcseconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://159.226.88.6/bao/LT/|title =FAST home page|publisher= National Astronomical Observertories, Chinese Academy of Sciences|accessdate=December 28, 2008[/tpl]
The chief scientist of the project is Nan Rendong, a researcher with the Chinese National Astronomical Observatory, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

==History==

The telescope was first proposed in 1994. In October 2008, the project was approved by the National development and reform commission. On December 26, 2008, a foundation laying ceremony was held on the construction site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gzrb.gog.com.cn/system/2008/12/27/010441147.shtml|title =中国科学院·贵州省共建国家重大科技基础设施500米口径球面射电望远镜（ＦＡＳＴ）项目奠基|publisher= Guizhou Daily|date=2008-012-27|accessdate=December 28, 2008[/tpl] Construction started in March 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3794 |title= The Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) Project |author=Rendong Nan, Di Li, Chengjin Jin, Qiming Wang, Lichun Zhu, Wenbai Zhu, Haiyan Zhang, Youling Yue, Lei Qian |date=2011-05-20|accessdate= 2012-08-13|work=arxiv.org[/tpl]
