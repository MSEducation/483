Winnipeg [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=Winnipeg.ogg|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|ɪ|p|ɛ|ɡ[/tpl] is the capital and largest city of Manitoba, Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The Winnipeg area was a trading centre for Aboriginal peoples prior to the arrival of Europeans. The first fort was built there in 1738 by French traders. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. Winnipeg is the seventh-largest municipality in Canada, and is the primary municipality of the Winnipeg Capital Region.
The economy of Winnipeg is primarily based on the finance, manufacturing, food and beverage production, culture, retail and tourism sectors. Winnipeg is a transportation hub, served by Richardson International Airport.  The city has railway connections to the United States and Eastern and Western Canada. Winnipeg's professional sports teams are the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (football), the Winnipeg Jets (hockey), and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball). Its post-secondary institutions are Red River College, the University of Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg, Canadian Mennonite University, Booth University College,  and University of St. Boniface (formerly known as St. Boniface College). Some of the city's popular festivals include the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk Festival, the Winnipeg Jazz Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and Folklorama.

==History==

Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, a location currently known as "The Forks". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by Aboriginal peoples prior to European contact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theforks.com/history |title = History |publisher = The Forks |accessdate=4 November 2008[/tpl] The name Winnipeg is a transcription of the western Cree word wi-nipe-k meaning "muddy waters";[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645488/Winnipeg-River|title=Winnipeg River|year=2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=16 July 2009[/tpl] the area was populated for thousands of years by First Nations.

In 1869–70, Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the Métis rebellion. As a consequence of this rebellion, the Manitoba Act of 1870 paved the way for Manitoba's entry into the Canadian Confederation as Canada's fifth province.[tpl]cite book|last=Hayes|first=Derek|title=Historical Atlas of Canada|publisher=D&M Adult|year=2006|pages=213–214|isbn=1-55365-077-8[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Sprague, DN|title=Canada and the Métis, 1869–1885|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=1988|pages=33–67, 89–129|isbn=978-0-88920-964-0[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ross|first=David|title=Canadian campaigns 1860–70|date=1992|publisher=Osprey|isbn=9781855322264|pages=36–39|coauthors=Tyler, Grant[/tpl] On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://winnipeg.ca/Services/CityLife/HistoryOfWinnipeg/HistoricalProfile.stm |title = History Of Winnipeg/Historical Profile |publisher = City of Winnipeg |accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] Manitoba and Northwest Territories legislator James McKay named the city.[tpl]cite news|title=Who Named the North-Land?|work=Manitoba Free Press|date=19 August 1876|page=3[/tpl]

==Geography==

Winnipeg lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/geomorphology_e.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110604201210/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/geomorphology_e.php |archivedate=4 June 2011 |title=Geomorphology of the Red River|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada and is known as the "Gateway to the West". Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast, although most the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturenorth.com/summer/wildlife/wildF.html |title=Manitoba's Tall Grass Prairie Preserve|work=Nature North Zine |publisher=Nature North |accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake).[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210173421/http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-08.html |title= Lake Winnipeg |publisher= World Lake Database|accessdate=4 March 2014[/tpl] Winnipeg contains the "largest remaining mature urban elm forest in North America".[tpl]cite web|url=http://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/Forestry/PAMPHLETS/wpgtreefctspamph%20%282%29.pdf|title=Winnipeg Tree Facts|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=4 March 2014[/tpl] The city has a total area of [tpl]convert|464.08|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].
Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red River, the Assiniboine River, the La Salle River, and the Seine River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iclr.org/images/Charles_-_Full.pdf|author=Boulet, Charles|title=Basement Flood Risk Reduction: City of Winnipeg|publisher=Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction|accessdate=4 March 2014[/tpl] The city is subject to severe flooding. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood occurred in 1950, which caused millions of dollars in damages and thousands of evacuations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/historical_e.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100719121057/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/historical_e.php|archivedate=19 July 2010|title=Historical floods and flood disasters|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] This flood prompted Duff Roblin's government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city from flooding. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to cities without flood control structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/environment/extreme-weather/red-river-rising-manitoba-floods/topic---red-river-rising-manitoba-floods.html|accessdate=4 March 2014|publisher=CBC|title=Red River Rising: Manitoba floods[/tpl] The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in a seasonal explosion of insects, especially mosquitoes.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.fcpp.org/posts/floodway-part-of-war-on-mosquitoes|title=Floodway: part of war on mosquitoes?|date=25 September 2002|publisher=Frontier Centre for Public Policy[/tpl]
