==Biography==

===Early life===

Kropotkin was born in Moscow, into the second-highest level of the Russian aristocracy. His mother was the daughter of a Cossack general. His father, Alexei Petrovich Kropotkin, was a prince in Smolensk,[tpl]cite book|title=Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990|isbn=9780921689607|page=13|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KCpksaH3NrgC&pg=PA13 |author=Woodcock, George & Avakumović, Ivan[/tpl] of the Rurik dynasty which had ruled Russia before the rise of the Romanovs. Kropotkin's father owned large tracts of land and nearly 1,200 male serfs in three provinces.[tpl]cite book |author=Harman, Oren|title=The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2011|isbn=9780393339994|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cZJ2evtw7HAC&pg=PA20[/tpl]
"Under the influence of republican teachings," Kropotkin dropped his princely title at the age of twelve, and "even rebuked his friends, when they so referred to him."Roger N. Baldwin, "The Story of Kropotkin's Life," in Kropotkin's Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, ed. by Baldwin (Orig. 1927; Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 1970), p. 13.
In 1857, at age 14, Kropotkin enrolled in the Corps of Pages at St. Petersburg. Only 150 boys — mostly children of nobility belonging to the court — were educated in this privileged corps, which combined the character of a military school endowed with special rights and of a court institution attached to the Imperial Household. Kropotkin's memoirs detail the hazing and other abuse of pages for which the Corps had become notorious.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Smith, Elder & Co.|location=London|pages=63|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LtdMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR7&dq=peter+kropotkin+memoirs+revolutionist#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
In Moscow, Kropotkin had developed an interest in the condition of the peasantry, and this interest increased as he grew older. Although his work as a page for Tsar Alexander II made Kropotkin sceptical about the tsar's "liberal" reputation,[tpl]cite book |chapter=Kropotkin, Petr Alexseyevich|editor=Winkle, Justin|title=The Concise New Makers of Modern Culture|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2009|isbn=9780415477826|page=425|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z_mVLMM55gUC&pg=PA425[/tpl] Kropotkin was greatly pleased by the tsar's decision to emancipate the serfs in 1861.[tpl]cite book |author=Todes, Daniel Philip|title=Darwin Without Malthus: The Struggle for Existence in Russian Evolutionary Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195058307|page=124|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rjVskyJh6TgC&pg=PA124[/tpl] In St. Petersburg, he read widely on his own account, and gave special attention to the works of the French encyclopædists and to French history. The years 1857–1861 witnessed a growth in the intellectual forces of Russia, and Kropotkin came under the influence of the new liberal-revolutionary literature, which largely expressed his own aspirations.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=270[/tpl]
In 1862, Kropotkin was promoted from the Corps of Pages to the army. The members of the corps had the prescriptive right to choose the regiment to which they would be attached. For some time, he was aide de camp to the governor of Transbaikalia at Chita.  Later he was appointed attaché for Cossack affairs to the governor-general of East Siberia at Irkutsk.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=198[/tpl]

===Geographical expeditions in Siberia===

Administrative work was scarce, and in 1864 Kropotkin accepted charge of a geographical survey expedition, crossing North Manchuria from Transbaikalia to the Amur, and soon was attached to another expedition which proceeded up the Sungari River into the heart of Manchuria. The expeditions yielded valuable geographical results. The impossibility of obtaining any real administrative reforms in Siberia now induced Kropotkin to devote himself almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be highly successful.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=214[/tpl]
In 1866, Kropotkin began reading the works of the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and other political thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Alexander Herzen. These readings, along with his experiences amongst the peasantry in Siberia, led him to declare himself an anarchist by 1872.[tpl]cite book |author=Ward, Dana|chapter=Alchemy in Clarens: Kropotkin and Reclus, 1877–1881|editors=Jun, Nathan J. & Wahl, Shane|title=New Perspectives on Anarchism|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2010|isbn=9780739132418|page=211|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p5t0R0ckDMAC&pg=PA211[/tpl]
In 1867, Kropotkin resigned his commission in the army and returned to St. Petersburg, where he entered the university to study mathematics, becoming at the same time secretary to the geography section of the Russian Geographical Society.[tpl]cite book |author=Marshall, Peter|title=Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism|publisher=PM Press|year=2010|isbn=9781604860641|page=311|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QDWIOL_KtGYC&pg=PA311[/tpl] His departure from a family tradition of military service prompted his father to disinherit him, "leaving him a 'prince' with no visible means of support."[tpl]cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=The Anarchism of Peter Kropotkin |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=March 4, 2011|url=http://mises.org/daily/5071/The-Anarchism-of-Peter-Kropotkin[/tpl] In 1871, he explored the glacial deposits of Finland and Sweden for the Society. In 1873, he published an important contribution to science, a map and paper in which he showed that the existing maps entirely misrepresented the physical features of Asia; the main structural lines were in fact from southwest to northeast, not from north to south or from east to west as had been previously supposed. During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large. Accordingly, he refused the offer and returned to St. Petersburg, where he joined the revolutionary party.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=235–236[/tpl]

===Activism in Switzerland and France===

Kropotkin visited Switzerland in 1872 and became a member of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA) at Geneva. It was there that he found that he did not like IWA’s style of socialism. Instead, he studied the programme of the more radical Jura federation at Neuchâtel and spent time in the company of the leading members, and adopted the creed of anarchism.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=282–287[/tpl]
On returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced him to the Circle of Tchaikovsky, a socialist/populist group that had been created in 1872. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary propaganda amongst peasants and workers, and acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy. Throughout this period, Kropotkin maintained his position within the Geographical Society in order to provide cover for his activities.[tpl]cite book |author=Cahm, Caroline|title=Kropotkin: And the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872–1886|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780521891578|page=44|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zk7wTSWT3JUC&pg=PA44[/tpl]
In 1874 Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress for subversive political activity, as a result of his work with the Circle of Tchaikovsky. Because of his aristocratic background, he was granted special privileges while in prison, such as being allowed to continue his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the subject of the Ice Age, where he argued that it had taken place in not as distant a past as originally thought. In 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with the assistance of his friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming correctly that the police would not think to look for them there. After this, he boarded a boat, and headed to England.[tpl]cite book |author=Bell, Jeffrey A.|chapter=Kropotkin, Pyotr|editor=Bell, Jeffrey A.|title=Industrialization and Imperialism, 1800–1914: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780313314513|page=199|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XB6ckxWOq9kC&pg=PA199[/tpl] After a short stay there, he moved to Switzerland where he joined the Jura Federation. In 1877 he moved to Paris, where he helped start the socialist movement. In 1878 he returned to Switzerland where he edited the Jura Federation's revolutionary newspaper Le Révolté, and published various revolutionary pamphlets.[tpl]cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin & Company|location=Boston and New York|pages=417–423[/tpl]
In 1881, shortly after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, he was expelled from Switzerland. After a short stay at Thonon (Savoy), he went to London where he stayed nearly a year.[tpl]cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|publisher=Dover Publications|page=440|year=2010 (reproduction of 1899 edition)|isbn=978-0-486-47316-1[/tpl] He attended the Anarchist Congress that met in London from 14 July 1881.[ref]
</ref>
Other delegates included Marie Le Compte, Errico Malatesta, Saverio Merlino, Louise Michel, Peter Tchaikovsky and Émile Gautier. While respecting "complete autonomy of local groups" the congress defined propaganda actions that all could follow and agreed that propaganda by the deed was the path to social revolution. The Radical of 23 July 1881 reported that the congress met on July 18 at the Cleveland Hall, Fitzroy Square, with speeches by Marie Le Compte, "the transatlantic agitator", Louise Michel, and Kropotkin.[tpl]cite web |ref=harv |url=http://sarahjyoung.com/site/2011/01/09/russians-in-london-pyotr-kropotkin/ |last=Young |first=Sarah J.|date=9 January 2011|title=Russians in London: Pyotr Kropotkin|accessdate=2013-08-30[/tpl] Later Le Compte and Kropotkin gave talks to the Homerton Social Democratic Club and to the Stratford Radical and Dialectical Club.[tpl]cite web |ref=harv |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317725/1/281916.pdf |page=20 |last=Shpayer |first=Haia |title=British Anarchism 1881–1914: Reality and Appearance|date=June 1981|accessdate=2013-08-30[/tpl]
Kropotkin returned to Thonon in late 1882. Soon he was arrested by the French government, tried at Lyon, and sentenced by a police-court magistrate (under a special law passed on the fall of the Paris Commune) to five years' imprisonment, on the ground that he had belonged to the IWA (1883). The French Chamber repeatedly agitated on his behalf, and he was released in 1886. He settled near London, living at various times in Harrow – where his daughter, Alexandra, was born – Ealing and Bromley (6 Crescent Road 1886–1914).Bromley Council guide to blue plaques He also lived for a number of years in Brighton.Peter Marshall Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism, London: Fontana, 1993, p.315 While living in London, Kropotkin became friends with a number of prominent English-speaking socialists, including William Morris and George Bernard Shaw.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Return to Russia===

In 1917 after the February Revolution, Kropotkin returned to Russia again after years of exile. Upon his arrival, he was greeted by crowds of tens of thousands of people, cheering his return. He was offered the ministry of education in the provisional government, which he promptly refused, feeling that working with them would be a violation of his anarchist principles.[tpl]cite book |author=Burbank, Jane|title=Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism, 1917–1922|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=9780195045734|page=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nJHHAttsOL4C&pg=PA99[/tpl]
His enthusiasm for the changes happening in the Russian Empire turned to disappointment when the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution. "This buries the revolution," he said. He thought that the Bolsheviks had shown how the revolution was not to be made; by authoritarian rather than libertarian methods. He had spoken out against authoritarian socialism in his writings (for example The Conquest of Bread), making the prediction that any state founded on these principles would most likely see its own breakup and the restoration of capitalism.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Death===

Kropotkin died of pneumonia on 8 February 1921, in the city of Dmitrov, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. Thousands of people marched in his funeral procession, including, with Vladimir Lenin's approval,[tpl]cite book|last=Goldman|first=Emma|authorlink=Emma Goldman|title=Living My Life|year=1931|publisher=Dover Publications|pages=867–868|isbn=0-486-22543-7[/tpl] anarchists carrying banners with anti-Bolshevik slogans. It was to become the last public demonstration of anarchists, which saw engaged speeches by Emma Goldman and Aron Baron. In 1957 the Dvorets Sovetov station of the Moscow Metro was renamed Kropotkinskaya in his honor.

==Philosophy==

===Critique of capitalism===

Kropotkin pointed out what he considered to be the fallacies of the economic systems of feudalism and capitalism, and how he believed they create poverty and artificial scarcity while promoting privilege. He further proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, mutual support, and voluntary cooperation, asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Cooperation and competition===

In 1902, Kropotkin published the book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, which provided an alternative view on animal and human survival, beyond the claims of interpersonal competition and natural hierarchy proffered at the time by some "social Darwinists", such as Francis Galton. He argued "that it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human."Sale, Kirkpatrick (2010-07-01) Are Anarchists Revolting?, The American Conservative Kropotkin explored the widespread use of cooperation as a survival mechanism in human societies through their many stages, and animals. He used many real life examples in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups, without central control, authority, or compulsion. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce competition as the core of evolution, that provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic, and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] In the last chapter, he wrote:[tpl]cite book |author=Kropotkin, Peter|title=quotation from Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|year=1902|url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.|source=Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion.[/tpl]
Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but believed that they were not the driving force of history as capitalists and social Darwinists claimed.[tpl]cite book |author=Gallaher, Carolyn|chapter=Anti-statism|editors=Gallaher, Carolyn & Gilmartin, Mary|title=Key Concepts in Political Geography|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=|isbn=9780921689607|page=262|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wau7IT__O80C&pg=PA262 |date=2009-05-07[/tpl] He did believe that there were times that it was socially beneficial to seek out conflict, but only during attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or Church, which stifled human creativity and freedom and impeded humans' instinctual drive towards sociality and cooperation.[tpl]cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&pg=PA349[/tpl]
His observations of cooperative tendencies in indigenous peoples (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) allowed him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition, such as those of industrialized Europe, and that in many societies, cooperation was the norm among individuals and groups. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian  societies (where he claimed that leadership, central government and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by, for example, equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when he died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth (see Gift economy).Morris, David. Anarchism Is Not What You Think It Is – And There's a Whole Lot We Can Learn from It, AlterNet, February 13, 2012

===Mutual aid===

In The Conquest of Bread, Kropotkin proposed a system of economics based on mutual exchanges made in a system of voluntary cooperation. He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will stand as an obstacle for all taking what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolishment of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Kropotkin believed that Bakunin's collectivist economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,Kropotkin wrote: "After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap." (quoted in [tpl]cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&pg=PA211[/tpl]) and thought that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social labor, and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.[tpl]cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=The Russian Anarchists|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5pqSkSgKacAC&pg=PA28[/tpl] He further developed these ideas in Fields, Factories and Workshops.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
According to Kirkpatrick Sale:
His focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for self-sufficiency[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends he advocated irrigation and growing under glass to boost local food production ability.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
