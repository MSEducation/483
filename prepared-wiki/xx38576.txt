A Quick One is the second studio album by English rock band The Who, released in 1966. The album was also released under the title Happy Jack on Decca Records in the United States, where the song "Happy Jack" was a top 40 hit.
Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album #383 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, published in 2003.

==Composition and production==

The Who's second studio album departs from the R&B emphasis of the first. Part of the marketing push for the album was a requirement that each band member should write at least two of the songs on it, though Roger Daltrey only wrote one (See My Way), so this is The Who album least dominated by Pete Townshend's songwriting. It was recorded at IBC Studios, Pye Studios and Regent Sound, in London, England in 1966 with Kit Lambert as the record producer.
"Boris the Spider" was written after John Entwistle had been out drinking with Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. They were making up funny names for animals when Entwistle came up with the song. The chorus utilises vocals that influenced the vocal style of death metal singers.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
"Heat Wave", the only cover-version and the only reversion to the group's soul influences, a song by Tamla's Holland-Dozier-Holland team, was replaced by "Happy Jack" on the original US release but included on the 1974 double album repackaging of A Quick One and The Who Sell Out.
"A Quick One, While He's Away", the title track of the LP, is a nine-minute suite of song snippets telling a story of infidelity and reconciliation, a first foray into extended form that led to the so-called "rock operas" Tommy and Quadrophenia.
"Boris the Spider" quickly became Entwistle's most popular song, still performed decades later: in later years he often wore a spider necklace. "Happy Jack", though quirky, remains a favourite.
Keith Moon's "I Need You", was originally titled "I Need You (Like I Need a Hole in the Head)". Moon thought The Beatles spoke in a secret language behind his back, and this song was his way of getting back at them. Although Moon denied that a vocal part in the song was a John Lennon imitation, Entwistle said that, in fact, it was.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/AQuickOne.htm |title=The Hypertext Who – Liner Notes – A Quick One |publisher=Thewho.net |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606091547/http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/AQuickOne.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
"Cobwebs and Strange" was originally called "Showbiz Sonata", though Entwistle claimed that the melody came from the UK television series Man From Interpol.
The mod/pop number "So Sad About Us", according to Allmusic, is "one of the Who's most covered songs".[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t3563653|pure_url=yes[/tpl] The Merseys, Shaun Cassidy, Primal Scream, The Breeders and The Jam have recorded studio versions.
Each band member played a wind instrument on "Cobwebs and Strange": Townshend played the penny-whistle, Entwistle on the French horn and Daltrey on the trombone.

==Cover art==

The album was intended to be pop music, a sonic participant in the pop art movement. The cover was designed by the pop art exponent Alan Aldridge,Liner notes to the CD reissue with the front cover depicting the band playing their instruments. The back cover of the UK release is black, with the title and track listing across the top, and a colour head-shot photograph of each band member with the letters of "The W H O" superimposed individually over their faces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1336260|title=Images of A Quick One|publisher=Discogs.com[/tpl] The back cover of the US release is a black-and-white photo montage of the band members accompanied by a short personality sketch of each (infamous among Who fans for Keith Moon's humorous assertion that he was keen on "breeding chickens"). A track listing, a couple of paragraphs touting the band, an ad for their first album, and a technical blurb are also crowded onto the back cover of the US release.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=2688182 |title=Images of Happy Jack |publisher=Discogs.com[/tpl]
