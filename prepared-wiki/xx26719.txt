[[Placentalia]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals

Placentalia is a group of mammals. The majority of living mammals are placental: the other two living mammal groups are the Monotremata and the Marsupialia. The placentals are distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is nourished during gestation via a placenta while, in general, this is not the case with other mammals (Bandicoots are an exception). They reproduce sexually, and the young is carried in the mother until fully developed. Placental mammals are viviparous.

==Evolution==

The earliest known placental mammal species (including Protungulatum donnae, Purgatorius coracis, and Leptacodon proserpinae) are all dated to the early Paleogene period, about 65 million years ago. True placental mammals appeared shortly after the K-Pg extinction event and quickly diversified into ecological niches previously occupied by various groups of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles.[tpl]cite journal |last1=O'Leary |first1=Maureen A. |last2=Bloch |first2=Jonathan I. |last3=Flynn |first3=John J. |last4=Gaudin |first4=Timothy J. |last5=Giallombardo |first5=Andres |last6=Giannini |first6=Norberto P. |last7=Goldberg |first7=Suzann L. |last8=Kraatz |first8=Brian P. |last9=Luo |first9=Zhe-Xi |last10=Meng |first10=Jin |last11=Ni |first11=Michael J. |last12=Novacek |first12=Fernando A. |last13=Perini |first13=Zachary S. |last14=Randall |first14=Guillermo |last15=Rougier |first15=Eric J. |last16=Sargis |first16=Mary T. |last17=Silcox |first17=Nancy b. |last18=Simmons |first18=Micelle |last19=Spaulding |first19=Paul M. |last20=Velazco |first20=Marcelo |last21=Weksler |first21=John r. |last22=Wible |first22=Andrea L. |title=The Placental Mammal Ancestor and the Post–K-Pg Radiation of Placentals |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/662.abstract |date=8 February 2013 |journal=Science |volume=339 |pages=662–667 |doi=10.1126/science.1229237 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |pmid=23393258 |issue=6120 |last23=Cirranello |first23=A.

==Classification==

Placentals are divided into three major groups:[tpl]cite journal |author=Archibald JD, Averianov AO, Ekdale EG |title=Late Cretaceous relatives of rabbits, rodents, and other extant eutherian mammals |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=6859 |pages=62–5 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11689942 |doi=10.1038/35102048[/tpl][tpl]-[/tpl]
Molecular studies based on DNA analysis have revised the understanding of relationships among placental groups during the 21st century.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kriegs|first=Jan Ole|coauthors=Churakov, Gennady; Kiefmann, Martin; Jordan, Ursula; Brosius, Jürgen; Schmitz, Jürgen|title=Retroposed Elements as Archives for the Evolutionary History of Placental Mammals|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2006|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e91|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040091|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040091|pmid=16515367|pmc=1395351[/tpl] Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals: Afrotheria, Xenarthra, and Boreoeutheria, all of which diverged from common ancestors in the Cretaceous. The exact relationships between these three lineages is currently a subject of debate, and three different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal, or diverged first from other placentals. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra), and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria).[tpl]cite journal|last=Nishihara|first=H.|coauthors=Maruyama, S.; Okada, N.|title=Retroposon analysis and recent geological data suggest near-simultaneous divergence of the three superorders of mammals|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2009|volume=106|issue=13|pages=5235–5240|doi=10.1073/pnas.0809297106[/tpl] Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages- Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.
Estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago, depending on type of DNA (e.g. nuclear or mitochondrial)[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0334222100[/tpl] and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data.
