The Culture of Popular Laughter was a historical-anthropological theory devised by the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin, first published in the book Rabelais and His World, based on observations of popular culture in the Renaissance. Bakhtin analysed François Rabelais' book Gargantua and Pantagruel and its portrayals of "grotesque realism" (i.e. celebrations of primary needs) and carnival in which social norms were subverted.
The Culture of Popular Laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: the idea of "Grotesque body" and "Carnivalesque" debauchery. It is distinguished from each, however, by its applications outside literary theory.

==Carnivalesque==

The idea of "Carnivalesque" was also created by Bakhtin and forms part of his wider theory of Popular Laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the Feast of Fools, social norms were deliberately turned upside-down. The carnival then became a form of Safety-valve institution, which served a Structural-functionalist role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system.[tpl]cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=12[/tpl]  Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was "formalized" in the culture of the period as "popular laughter".

===Scope and influence===

The historian Gábor Klaniczay argued that the Culture of Popular Laughter stretched through all echelons of society and was certainly not restricted to the peasantry.[tpl]cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=17[/tpl] Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessement of the importance of popular culture in history.[tpl]cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=24[/tpl]

==Examples==

The Culture of Popular Laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his descendants.[tpl]cite book|last=Gibson|first=Walter S.|title=Pieter Bruegel and the Art of Laughter|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520245210|page=33|edition=1st[/tpl]  The example has also been applied to Japanese society.[tpl]cite book|last=de Wil|first=Theodore et al.|title=Sources of Japanese tradition from earliest times-1600|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231121393|page=471|edition=2nd|volume=1[/tpl]
