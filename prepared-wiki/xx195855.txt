[[Roma, Gotland]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Gotland County

Roma (also referred to as Romakloster) is a locality (Swedish tätort) situated in Gotland Municipality, Gotland County, Sweden with 913 inhabitants in 2010.
In 1995 the locality known as Roma was divided by Statistics Sweden into a part with the tentative name of "Roma kyrkby" or "Lövsta" (pop. 277) and the remaining part that retained the name "Roma" (pop. 913), but is using to as "Romakloster" as postal address.Tätorter 1995, p. 30 (population; see footnote for the tentative character of the names), 62 (list of new localities since 1990)
Some confusion is caused by the fact that Lövsta/Roma kyrkby has been referred to as "Roma" in the statistical figures since 2000.Cf. the population figures from 1995 for Roma kyrkby/Roma (277 people)  and Romakloster (902) given in Tätorter 1995, p. 30, and Tätorter 2000, p. 27.
