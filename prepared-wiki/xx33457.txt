[[Inosine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleosides, Purines, Antivirals

Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond.
Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs.
Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism.  Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including Wegener's granulomatosis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from IMD inhibition.

==Reactions==

Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with Adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U).
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine.
Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotides reactions required for muscle movements.

==Clinical significance==

It was tried in the 1970s in Eastern countries for improving athletic performance. Nevertheless, the clinical trials for this purpose showed no improvement.[tpl]cite journal |title=Inosine supplementation has no effect on aerobic or anaerobic cycling performance |journal=International journal of sport nutrition |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=333–44 |year=1999 |pmid=10660865 |doi= |author1=McNaughton L |author2=Dalton B |author3=Tarr J |author-separator=,[/tpl]
It has been shown that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury;[tpl]cite journal |title=Secondary degeneration reduced by inosine after spinal cord injury in rats |journal=Spinal Cord |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=421–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16317421 |doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3101878 |display-authors=3 |author1=Liu F |author2=You SW |author3=Yao LP |author-separator=, |last4=Liu |first4=HL |last5=Jiao |first5=XY |last6=Shi |first6=M |last7=Zhao |first7=QB |last8=Ju |first8=G[/tpl] because it improves axonal rewiring, and for administration after stroke, because observation has shown that axonal re-wiring is encouraged.[tpl]cite journal |title=Inosine induces axonal rewiring and improves behavioral outcome after stroke |journal=Proc.

After ingestion, inosine produces uric acid that is suggested to be a natural antioxidant and a peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS.)Uric Acid: Natural Scavenger Of Peroxynitrite Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration http://www.fedem.org/revista/n17/neuhausing.htm. In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS.[tpl]cite web|title=Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Using Over the Counter Inosine|url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00067327[/tpl] The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis with Inosine |journal=J Altern Complem Med |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=619–625 |year=2009 |doi=10.1089/acm.2008.0513 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2008.0513?2 |author1=Markowitz CE |author2=Spitsin S | author3=Zimmerman V |author4=Jacobs D |author5=Udupa JK |author6=Hooper DC| author7=Koprowski H | pmid=19425822 | pmc=3189001[/tpl] In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in 4 out of 16 patients. Thus, additional studies are necessary to prove the treatment's efficacy.
It is also in phase II trials for Parkinson's disease. Earlier trials had suggested those with the highest serum urate levels had lower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL).[tpl]cite web|title=Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease|url=https://foxtrialfinder.michaeljfox.org/trial/468/[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00833690|publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov[/tpl]

==Biotechnology==

When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it will indiscriminately pair with adenine, thymine, or cytosine.  This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency.

==Fitness==

Despite  lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements.

==Feeding Stimulant==

Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine-5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) Mackie, A.M. (1987). Identification of the gustatory feeding stimulants. In: Chemoreception in Fishes. (ed. T.J. Hara). Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam, pp. 275-291. and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata).Takeda, M. Takii, K. & Matsui, K. (1984). Identification of feeding stimulants for juvenile eel. Bull. Jap. Soc. Scient. Fish., 50: 645-651. The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively low.
