Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School is a coeducational Catholic high school in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1989 by the Halton Catholic District School Board and currently enrolls students from the ninth to twelfth grades. Notre Dame's emblem is a small dueling leprechaun and, accordingly, the school's slogan is "Fightin' Irish".
In its first year, Notre Dame began by only enrolling ninth and tenth grade classes.  Today it schools the Ontario standard of grades 9 through 12. With grade 13 recently being removed as a requirement for graduation in Ontario, many grade twelve graduates return for an optional extra year.

It receives most new students from local elementary schools including St. Gabriel, St. Timothy, St. Mark, and Canadian Martyrs.
Notre Dame, like all publicly funded Catholic schools in Ontario, also accepts non-Catholics into the school; however, they are expected to take part in the religious activities and mandatory religious classes.
The Catholic school's parishes are St. Paul the Apostle and St. Gabriel. It belongs to the Diocese of Hamilton, under Bishop Crosby.
