==Personal life==

Bushnell was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut.  She is the daughter of Calvin L. and Camille Bushnell. Her father was one of the inventors of the Air Cooled Hydrogen Fuel Cell that was used in the Apollo space missions in the 1960s.  Her Bushnell ancestors in the United States can be traced back to Francis Bushnell, one of the signers of the Guilford Covenant, who emigrated from Thatcham, Berkshire, England in 1639. 
While attending high school in Glastonbury, Candace was accompanied to her senior prom by Mike O'Meara, now a nationally syndicated radio host, who also dated Candace's sister, "Lolly". She attended Rice University and New York University. She moved to New York in the late '70's and often frequented Studio 54.  In 1995, she met publishing executive Ron Galotti, who became the inspiration for Sex and The City's Mr. Big.http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/n_10334/index4.html New York Magazine, May 2004

At age 19, Bushnell moved to New York City and sold a children’s story to Simon & Schuster, which was never published. She continued writing and worked as a freelance journalist for various publications, struggling to make ends meet for many years.Candace Bushnell on her new TV series Lipstick Jungle By Stephen Armstrong, The Sunday Times, August 10, 2008. Bushnell began writing for the New York Observer in 1993.  She created a humorous column for the paper, which appeared from 1994 through 1996.  Called "Sex and the City," the column was based on her own personal dating experiences and those of her friends.  In 1997, Bushnell's columns were published in an anthology, also called Sex and the City, and soon after became the basis for the popular HBO television series sharing the same name.  The series aired from 1998 through 2004, and starred Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw, a sex and lifestyles columnist partaking in and enjoying New York City nightlife, a character which Bushnell has stated was her alter ego.  The series is now in syndication and was adapted for and made into two motion pictures, released in 2008 and 2010.
