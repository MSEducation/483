State Highway 135 is a [tpl]convert|27.48|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] state highway connecting Crested Butte to Gunnison in the U.S. state of Colorado.  It is the primary connection between Crested Butte and the outside world and is in fact the only paved road leading to Crested Butte.

==Route description==

It begins at the intersection of U.S. Highway 50 and Main Street in Gunnison and follows Main Street North out of town. Between miles 10 and 11, it passes through the community of Almont.  It terminates at the intersection of Elk Avenue and 6th Street (the Four Way Stop) in Crested Butte.

==History==

The route was established in the 1920s, when it began at SH 92 in Hotchkiss and ended at Gunnison. The route was paved from its southern terminus to Paonia and from Almont to Gunnison by 1950. SH 135 was split in 1954 over Kebler Pass. The route was completely paved by 1958. A small section near Bardine was renumbered in 1970, leaving what is left today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/r120-139.html#135|title=Colorado Routes 120-139|author=Salek, Matthew E.|accessdate=2010-05-29[/tpl]
