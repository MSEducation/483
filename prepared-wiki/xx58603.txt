Mahadev Desai (January 1, 1892 – August 15, 1942) was an Indian independence activist and writer best remembered as Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary. He has variously been described as "Gandhi’s Boswell, a Plato to Gandhi’s Socrates, as well as an Ananda to Gandhi’s Buddha".[tpl]cite news|title=Price Of Freedom|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?238154|accessdate=30 November 2012|newspaper=Outlook|date=August 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=Mahadev ..|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/10/23/stories/2005102300210300.htm|accessdate=30 November 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=October 23, 2005[/tpl]

==Early life==

Mahadev Desai was born on New Year's Day in 1892 in the village of Saras in Surat District of Gujarat to Haribhai Desai a school teacher and his wife Jamnabehn. Jamnabehn died when Desai was only seven years of age. In 1905, aged 13, Mahadev was married to Durgabehn. He was educated at the Surat High School and the Elphinstone College, Mumbai. Graduated with a BA Degree, he went on to do an LLB.[tpl]cite book|last=Agrawal|first=LMG|title=Freedom Fighters of India - Volume 3|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=New Delhi|pages=134, 135|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vnJ0MwbAsEAC&pg=PA134&dq=mahadev+desai|isbn=9788182054714[/tpl]

==Gandhi's Associate==

Mahadev Desai first met Gandhi in 1915 when he went to meet him to seek his advice on how best to get John Morley's On Compromise, a book he had translated into Gujarati, published. Desai joined Gandhi's Ashram in 1917 and with Durgabehn accompanied him to Champaran that year. He maintained a diary from 13 November 1917 to 14 August 1942, the day before his death, chronicling his life with Gandhi. In 1919 when the colonial government arrested Gandhi in Punjab, he named Desai his heir. Desai was for the first time arrested and sentenced to a year in prison in 1921.[tpl]cite book|last=Agrawal|first=LMG|title=Freedom Fighters of India - Volume 3|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=New Delhi|pages=136, 139|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vnJ0MwbAsEAC&pg=PA134&dq=mahadev+desai|isbn=9788182054714[/tpl] He was Gandhi's personal secretary for 25 years, but as Verrier Elwin wrote of him, "he was much more than that. He was in fact Home and Foreign Secretary combined. He managed everything. He made all the arrangements. He was equally at home in the office, the guest-house and the kitchen. He looked after many guests and must have saved 10 years of Gandhi's life by diverting from him unwanted visitors". Rajmohan Gandhi writes of Mahadev Desai thus: "Waking up before Gandhi in pre-dawn darkness, and going to sleep long after his Master, Desai lived Gandhi's day thrice over — first in an attempt to anticipate it, next in spending it alongside Gandhi, and finally in recording it into his diary".

==Political Activism==

In 1920, Motilal Nehru requisitioned the services of Mahadev Desai from Gandhi to run his newspaper, the Independent, from Allahabad. Desai created a sensation by bringing out a hand-written cyclostyled newspaper after the Independent's printing press was confiscated by the British government. Desai was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment for his writings in 1921 - his first stint in prison.[tpl]cite web|title=Associates of Mahatma Gandhi - Mahadev Desai|url=http://www.mkgandhi.org/associates/Mahadev.htm|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl]  In prison, Desai saw that the jail authorities mistreated prisoners, frequently flogging them. His report describing the life inside an Indian jail, published in Young India and Navajivan, compelled the British authorities to bring about some drastic jail reform measures. Desai took over as editor of Navajivan in 1924 and from 1925 he began the translation into English of Gandhi's autobiography and its serial publication in the Young India. The following year he became chairman of the executive committee of the Satyagraha Ashram and won a prize from the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad for his article in Navajivan. He took part in the Bardoli Satyagraha along with Sardar Patel and wrote a history of the Satyagraha in Gujarati which he translated into English as The Story of Bardoli.[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Judith M|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gandhi|year=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=2011|pages=90|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KLM8kMZZu-IC&pg=PA89&dq=mahadev+desai#v=onepage&q=mahadev%20desai&f=false|isbn=9780521116701[/tpl] For his participation in the Salt Satyagraha, he was arrested and imprisoned but following the Gandhi- Irwin Pact, he was released from jail and accompanied Gandhi to the Second Round Table Conference along with Mirabehn, Devdas Gandhi and Pyarelal. He was the only person to accompany Gandhi when the latter met with King George V.
Following the collapse of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the deadlock at the Round Table Conference, Gandhi restarted the Civil Disobedience Movement. The colonial government, under the new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, was determined to crush the movement and ordered a clampdown on the Indian National Congress and its activists. In 1932, Desai was arrested again and sent to prison with Gandhi and Sardar Patel. Following his release in 1933, he was re-arrested and detained in the Belgaum Jail. It was during this time in prison that he wrote Gita According to Gandhi which was posthumously published in 1946. He also played a role in organising people’s movements in the princely states of Rajkot and Mysore in 1939 and was put in charge of selecting satyagrahis during the Individual Satyagraha of 1940.[tpl]cite web|title=Mahadev Desai - Timeline|url=http://mahadevdesai.org/eng/?page_id=209|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] Desai's final prison term followed the Quit India Declaration of August 8, 1942. He was arrested on the morning of August 9, 1942 and, till his death of a massive heart-attack six days later, was interned with Gandhi at the Aga Khan Palace. Desai was 51 at the time of his death.[tpl]cite web|title=Who is Mahadev Desai ?|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/201104225777/who-is-mahadev-desai.html|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl]

==Death and Legacy==

Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack on the morning of 15 August 1942 at the Aga Khan Palace where he was interned with Gandhi. When Desai stopped breathing, Gandhi called out to him in agitation: "Mahadev! Mahadev!" When he was later asked why he had done so, Gandhi answered: "I felt that if Mahadev opened his eyes and looked at me, I would tell him to get up. He had never disobeyed me in his life. I was confident that had he heard those words, he would have defied even death and got up".[tpl]cite book|last=Douglass|first=James W|title=Gandhi and the Unspeakable: His Final Experiment With Truth|year=2012|publisher=Orbis Books|location=New York|pages=46, 47|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0BKIZiq3uTgC&pg=PA46&dq=mahadev+desai#v=onepage&q=mahadev%20desai&f=false|isbn=9781570759635[/tpl] Gandhi himself washed Desai's body and he was cremated on the Palace's grounds, where his samadhi lies today.[tpl]cite book|last=Vyas|first=Bhaskar|title=Experiments with Truth and Non-Violence: The Dalai Lama in Exile from Tibet|year=2007|publisher=Concepts Publishing|location=New Delhi|pages=116|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MZcsi3K_37oC&pg=PA116&dq=mahadev+desai#v=onepage&q=mahadev%20desai&f=false|isbn=9788180693595[/tpl]
