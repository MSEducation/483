</ref> One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by [[accretion disc|accretion]] around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.
The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. The question arises: what is meant by deuterium burning? This question arises because large objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, on the amount of helium and deuterium present.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1008.5150 |author1=Spiegel |author2=Adam Burrows |author3=Milsom |title=The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2010[/tpl] The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is no special feature around 13 MJup in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit."[tpl]cite journal|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |last2=Dedieu |first2=C. |last3=Le Sidaner |first3=P. |last4=Savalle |first4=R. |last5=Zolotukhin |first5=I. |title=Defining and cataloging exoplanets: The exoplanet.eu database|year=2011|volume=532|issue=79|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |arxiv=1106.0586|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116713|pages=A79|bibcode=2011A&A...532A..79S[/tpl] The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity."[tpl]cite arXiv|eprint=1012.5676|last1=Wright |first11=J.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium burning, formation process or location, is whether the core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Ann.

====2006 definition====

The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the IAU's General Assembly. After much debate and one failed proposal, the assembly voted to pass a resolution that defined planets within the Solar System as:[tpl]cite web | author=Staff |year=2006 |url =http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/ |title =IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU resolution votes |publisher =IAU |accessdate = 2007-05-11[/tpl]
Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as dwarf planets, provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4795755.stm |title=Planets plan boosts tally 12 |publisher=BBC |date=2006-08-16 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Paul |last=Rincon[/tpl] After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/5282440.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Pluto loses status as a planet |date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl]
This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer Steven Soter:[tpl]cite journal | last = Soter |first = Steven |title = What is a Planet |journal = Astronomical Journal |volume = 132 |issue = 6 |pages = 2513–19 |year = 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 |bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S[/tpl]
Beyond the scientific community, Pluto has held a strong cultural significance for many in the general public considering its planetary status after its discovery in 1930. The discovery of Eris was widely reported in the media as the tenth planet and therefore the reclassification of all three objects as dwarf planets has attracted a lot of media and public attention as well.[tpl]cite news | first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |title=Scientist who found '10th planet' discusses downgrading of Pluto |publisher=Stanford news |date=2006-10-18 |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/october18/mbrown-101806.html |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl]

===Objects formerly considered planets===

The table below lists Solar System bodies once considered to be planets.
A few astronomers consider dwarf planets and some moons to be planets.

==Mythology and naming==

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians. In ancient Greece, the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called Helios and Selene; the farthest planet (Saturn) was called Phainon, the shiner; followed by Phaethon (Jupiter), "bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as Pyroeis, the "fiery"; the brightest (Venus) was known as Phosphoros, the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called Stilbon, the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the Olympians: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to Cronus, the Titan who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to Zeus, Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to Ares, son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by Aphrodite, the goddess of love; and Hermes, messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.
The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk.[tpl]cite web |first=Kelley L. |last=Ross |year=2005 |title=The Days of the Week |url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm |publisher=The Friesian School |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. However, unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.[tpl]cite book |title=Martian Metamorphoses: The Planet Mars in Ancient Myth and Tradition |first=Ev |last=Cochrane |year=1997 |publisher=Aeon Press |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jz3eqRGuM0wC&pg=PP9&dq=ares+nergal+planet+pestilence |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=0-9656229-0-8[/tpl]
Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were Indo-Europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given their gods. During the later period of the Roman Republic, Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.[tpl]cite book |title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World |first=Alan |last=Cameron |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517121-7[/tpl] When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: Mercurius (for Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite), Mars (Ares), Iuppiter (Zeus) and Saturnus (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with Neptūnus (Poseidon). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.
Some Romans, following a belief possibly originating in Mesopotamia but developed in Hellenistic Egypt, believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet).[tpl]cite book | first=Eviatar |last=Zerubavel |year=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-98165-7 |title= The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |page=14 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=aGahKeojIUoC&pg=PA14 |accessdate=2008-02-07[/tpl] Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was named by the god that started it, this is also the order of the days of the week in the Roman calendar after the Nundinal cycle was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages.[tpl]cite journal | first=Michael |last=Falk |title=Astronomical Names for the Days of the Week |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |year=1999 |volume=93 |pages=122–133 |bibcode=1999JRASC..93..122F |doi=10.1016/j.newast.2003.07.002 | last2=Koresko | first2=Christopher[/tpl] In English, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The other days were renamed after Tiw, (Tuesday) Wóden (Wednesday), Thunor (Thursday), and Fríge (Friday), the Anglo-Saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.
Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century,[tpl]cite web | last=Van Helden |first=Al |year=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html |title=Copernican System |publisher=The Galileo Project |accessdate=2008-01-28[/tpl] there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer generally considered planets.) The name originates from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon word erda, which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300.[tpl]cite web | publisher= Oxford English Dictionary |url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50071589?query_type=word&queryword=earth&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=7aas-q054tm-4631&hilite=50071589 | title = earth, n |accessdate = 2008-02-06 |year = 1989[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas |date = September 2001 |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earth |title = Earth |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] As with its equivalents in the other Germanic languages, it derives ultimately from the Proto-Germanic word ertho, "ground", as can be seen in the English earth, the German Erde, the Dutch aarde, and the Scandinavian jord. Many of the Romance languages retain the old Roman word terra (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea".[tpl]cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=September 2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain |title=Etymology of "terrain" |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2008-01-30[/tpl] However, the non-Romance languages use their own native words. The Greeks retain their original name, Γή (Ge).
Non-European cultures use other planetary-naming systems. India uses a system based on the Navagraha, which incorporates the seven traditional planets (Surya for the Sun, Chandra for the Moon, and Budha, Shukra, Mangala, [tpl]IAST|Bṛhaspati[/tpl] and Shani for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu. China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to Chinese cultural influence (such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam) use a naming system based on the five Chinese elements: water (Mercury), metal (Venus), fire (Mars), wood (Jupiter) and earth (Saturn).

==Formation==

It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust. A protostar forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk. Through accretion (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets.[tpl]cite journal | first=G. W. |last=Wetherill |title=Formation of the Terrestrial Planets |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=1980 |volume=18 | issue=1 |pages=77–113 |bibcode=1980ARA&A..18...77W |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.18.090180.000453[/tpl] After a planet reaches a diameter larger than the Moon, it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere, greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag.[tpl]cite journal | author=Inaba, S.; Ikoma, M. |title=Enhanced Collisional Growth of a Protoplanet that has an Atmosphere |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=2003 |volume=410 | issue=2 |pages=711–723 |bibcode=2003A&A...410..711I |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20031248[/tpl]
When the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star, the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects.[tpl]cite journal | last = Dutkevitch |first = Diane |year =1995 |url =http://www.astro.umass.edu/theses/dianne/thesis.html |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071125124958/http://www.astro.umass.edu/theses/dianne/thesis.html |archivedate=2007-11-25 |title =The Evolution of Dust in the Terrestrial Planet Region of Circumstellar Disks Around Young Stars |publisher =PhD thesis, University of Massachusetts Amherst |accessdate = 2008-08-23 |bibcode=1995PhDT..........D[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Matsuyama, I.; Johnstone, D.; Murray, N. |title=Halting Planet Migration by Photoevaporation from the Central Source |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year = 2005 |volume=585 |issue=2 |pages=L143–L146 |bibcode=2003astro.ph..2042M |doi = 10.1086/374406|arxiv = astro-ph/0302042 [/tpl] Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Kenyon |first1=Scott J. |author2=Bromley, Benjamin C. |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=131 | issue=3 |page=1837 | year=2006 |doi=10.1086/499807 |title= Terrestrial Planet Formation.

Personal web page | bibcode=2006AJ....131.1837K|arxiv = astro-ph/0503568 [/tpl] Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Meanwhile, protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.
The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as radioactive decay) will heat up the growing planet, causing it to at least partially melt. The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass, developing a denser core.[tpl]cite journal | journal=Icarus |year=1987 |volume=69 | issue=2 |page=239 |last1=Ida |first1=Shigeru |author2=Nakagawa, Yoshitsugu; Nakazawa, Kiyoshi |title= The Earth's core formation due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(87)90103-5 |bibcode=1987Icar...69..239I[/tpl] Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets.[tpl]cite journal | last=Kasting |first=James F. |title=Earth's early atmosphere |journal=Science |year=1993 |volume=259 |bibcode=1993Sci...259..920K |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |pmid=11536547 |issue=5097 | pages=920–6[/tpl] (Smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms.)
With the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than the Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now believed to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets.[tpl]cite press release |first1=David |last1=Aguilar |first2=Christine |last2=Pulliam |date=2004-01-06 |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/archive/pr0404.html |title=Lifeless Suns Dominated The Early Universe |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=2011-10-23[/tpl] Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely possess a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.

==Solar System==

According to the IAU, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In increasing distance from the Sun, the planets are:
Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.
The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:

===Planetary attributes===

==Exoplanets==

An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. Around 1800 such planets have been discoveredConfirmed Planets - NASA Exoplanet Archive[tpl]cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's Kepler Mission Announces a Planet Bonanza, 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/ |date=February 26, 2014 |work=NASA |accessdate=February 26, 2014 [/tpl]The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog - Planetary Habitability Laboratory @ UPR Arecibo

In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/355145a0[/tpl] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.
The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi. From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected, however the catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets Neptune sized and smaller down to sub-Mercury sized.
There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System: super-earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1311.0329 |last1=Lopez |first1=E.

Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury. Neptune is 30AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.
The next few space telescopes to study exoplanets are expected to be Gaia launched in December 2013, CHEOPS in 2017, TESS in 2017, and the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018.

==Planetary-mass objects==

A planetary-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is a celestial object with a mass that falls within the range of the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star.G. Basri & E.M. Brown, 2006. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 34: 193–216 By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).

===Rogue planets===

===Sub-brown dwarfs===

Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as Cha 110913-773444, or orbiting a larger object such as 2MASS J04414489+2301513.
For a brief time in 2006, astronomers believed they had found a binary system of such objects, Oph 162225-240515, which the discoverers described as "planemos", or "planetary-mass objects". However, recent analysis of the objects has determined that their masses are probably each greater than 13 Jupiter-masses, making the pair brown dwarfs.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Wide Brown Dwarf Binary Oph 1622–2405 and Discovery of A Wide, Low Mass Binary in Ophiuchus (Oph 1623–2402): A New Class of Young Evaporating Wide Binaries? |journal= Astrophysical Journal |author=Close, Laird M. et al. |volume=660 | issue=2 |page=1492 |doi=10.1086/513417 |year=2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608574 |bibcode=2007ApJ...660.1492C | last2=Zuckerman | first2=B. | last3=Song | first3=Inseok | last4=Barman | first4=Travis | last5=Marois | first5=Christian | last6=Rice | first6=Emily L. | last7=Siegler | first7=Nick | last8=MacIntosh | first8=Bruce | last9=Becklin | first9=E.

===Former stars===

In close binary star systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. See accretion-powered pulsars. The shrinking star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438.[tpl]cite journal |arxiv=1108.5201 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1717B |doi=10.1126/science.1208890 |title=Transformation of a Star into a Planet in a Millisecond Pulsar Binary |year=2011 |last1=Bailes |first1=M. |last2=Bates |first2=S.

===Satellite planets and belt planets===

Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===Captured planets===

Free-floating planets in stellar clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.On the origin of planets at very wide orbits from the re-capture of free floating planets, Hagai B. Perets, M. B. N. Kouwenhoven, 2012

==Attributes==

Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whilst others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.

===Dynamic characteristics===

====Orbit====

According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential "rogue planets" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation.[tpl]cite arXiv | author = D. R.

[/tpl] The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year.[tpl]cite book | first=Charles Augustus |last=Young |year=1902 |title=Manual of Astronomy: A Text Book |publisher=Ginn & company |pages=324–7[/tpl] A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, as it is less affected by the star's gravity. Because no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.[tpl]cite book | author=Dvorak, R.; Kurths, J.; Freistetter, F. |year=2005 |title=Chaos And Stability in Planetary Systems |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-28208-4[/tpl]
Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:

====Axial tilt====

Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore possesses seasons; changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.[tpl]cite web | last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to possess negligible to no axial tilt, as a result of their proximity to their stars.[tpl]cite journal |title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters |author=Winn, Joshua N.; Holman, Matthew J. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 | doi=10.1086/432834 | volume=628 |issue=2 |pages=L159 |bibcode=2005ApJ...628L.159W|arxiv = astro-ph/0506468 |last2=Holman [/tpl]

====Rotation====

The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's rotation period is known as a stellar day. Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole, the exceptions being Venus[tpl]cite journal |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements |author=Goldstein, R. M.; Carpenter, R. L. |year=1963 |journal =Science |volume=139 |doi=10.1126/science.139.3558.910 |pmid=17743054 |issue=3558 |bibcode=1963Sci...139..910G |pages=910–1[/tpl] and Uranus,[tpl]cite journal |contribution=Rotational properties of Uranus and Neptune |first1=M. J. S. |last1=Belton |author2=Terrile R. J. |title=Uranus and Neptune |year=1984 |journal=In its Uranus and Neptune pp. 327–347 (SEE N85-11927 02-91) |bibcode=1984urnp.nasa..327B |volume=2330 |page=327 |editor=Bergstralh, J. T.[/tpl] which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.[tpl]cite book |title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond |pages=195–206 |year=2006 |first=Michael P. |last=Borgia |publisher=Springer New York[/tpl] However, regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit.
The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation. A net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the gas giants can also contribute to the angular momentum. Finally, during the last stages of planet building, a stochastic process of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet.[tpl]cite journal | title=Planet formation |last=Lissauer | series=31 |first=Jack J. |journal=Annual review of astronomy and astrophysics |volume=(A94-12726 02–90) | issue=1 |pages=129–174 |year=1993 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.31.090193.001021 |bibcode=1993ARA&A..31..129L[/tpl] There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 days to rotate, and the gas giants only a few hours.[tpl]cite web |title=Planet tables |url=http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm |first=Nick |last=Strobel |publisher=astronomynotes.com |accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known; however their proximity to their stars means that hot Jupiters are tidally locked (their orbits are in sync with their rotations). This means they only ever show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.[tpl]cite journal |title=Magnetically-Driven Planetary Radio Emissions and Application to Extrasolar Planets | last1=Zarka |first1=Philippe |author2=Treumann, Rudolf A.; Ryabov, Boris P.; Ryabov, Vladimir B. |year=2001 |journal=Astrophysics & Space Science |volume=277 |issue=1/2 |page=293 |doi = 10.1023/A:1012221527425|bibcode = 2001Ap&SS.277..293Z [/tpl]

====Orbital clearing====

The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.[tpl]cite arXiv |title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings |date=2007-07-12 |author=Faber, Peter; Quillen, Alice C. |eprint=0706.1684 |class=astro-ph[/tpl]

===Physical characteristics===

====Mass====

A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.[tpl]cite web |title=The Dwarf Planets |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/ |authorlink=Michael E. Brown |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |work=California Institute of Technology |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl]
Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance, beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses,How One Astronomer Became the Unofficial Exoplanet Record-Keeper, www.scientificamerican.com and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.[tpl]cite arXiv |eprint=1012.5676 |author1=Jason T Wright |author2=Onsi Fakhouri |author3=Marcy |author4=Eunkyu Han |author5=Ying Feng |author6=John Asher Johnson |author7=Howard |author8=Fischer |author9=Valenti |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2010|last10=Anderson |first10=Jay |last11=Piskunov |first11=Nikolai [/tpl]
The smallest known planet is PSR B1257+12A, one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury. The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is Kepler-37b, with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the Moon.

====Internal differentiation====

Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts,[tpl]cite web |title=Planetary Interiors |work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] but in the gas giants the mantle simply dissolves into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets possess cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn are believed to possess cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen.[tpl]cite book | first=Linda T. |last=Elkins-Tanton |year=2006 |title=Jupiter and Saturn |publisher=Chelsea House |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5196-8[/tpl] Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, possess rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0032-0633(95)00061-5[/tpl] The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.

====Atmosphere====

All of the Solar System planets except MercuryHunten D. M., Shemansky D. E., Morgan T. H. (1988), The Mercury atmosphere, In: Mercury (A89-43751 19–91). University of Arizona Press, pp. 562–612 have substantial atmospheres as their large masses mean gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface. The larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium close by, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space.[tpl]cite doi |10.1086/426329 [/tpl] The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.[tpl]cite book | last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael A. |author2=Gregory, Stephan A. |title=Introductory Astronomy & Astrophysics |edition=4th |year=1998 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=0-03-006228-4 |page=67[/tpl]
Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), an Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Knutson |first1=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David; Allen, Lori E.; Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b |journal=Nature |year=2007 |volume=447 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |laysummary=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2007/pr200713.html |laysource=Center for Astrophysics press release |laydate=2007-05-09 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K | pages=183–6|arxiv = 0705.0993[/tpl]
Hot Jupiters, due to their extreme proximities to their host stars, have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.[tpl]cite press release |first1=Donna |last1=Weaver |first2=Ray |last2=Villard |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/full/ |title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2011-10-23[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=Nature |last1=Ballester |first1=Gilda E. |author2=Sing, David K.; Herbert, Floyd |title=The signature of hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b |volume=445 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05525 |pmid=17268463 |issue=7127 |bibcode=2007Natur.445..511B | pages=511–4[/tpl] These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds,[tpl]cite journal | last1=Harrington |first1=Jason |author2=Hansen, Brad M.; Luszcz, Statia H.; Seager, Sara |title=The phase-dependent infrared brightness of the extrasolar planet Andromeda b |journal=Science |volume=314 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1133904 |laysummary=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/spitzer-20061012.html |laysource=NASA press release |laydate=2006-10-12 |pmid=17038587 |issue=5799 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..623H | pages=623–6|arxiv = astro-ph/0610491 [/tpl] although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.

====Magnetosphere====

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.
Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre of the planet.[tpl]cite book | last1=Kivelson |first1=Margaret Galland |author2=Bagenal, Fran |chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |year=2007 |publisher=Academic Press |editor= Lucyann Mcfadden, Paul Weissman, Torrence Johnson |isbn=978-0-12-088589-3 |page=519[/tpl]
In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high 7,760 °C temperature by an additional 400 °C.[tpl]cite web | title=Magnetic planet |first=Amanda | last=Gefter | work=Astronomy |date=2004-01-17 |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&id=2090 |accessdate=2008-01-29[/tpl]

===Secondary characteristics===

Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except Mercury and Venus have natural satellites, often called "moons". Earth has one, Mars has two, and the gas giants have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems. Many gas giant moons have similar features to the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially Europa).[tpl]cite journal | last1=Grasset |first1=O. |author2=Sotin C.; Deschamps F. |title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan |year = 2000 |journal = Planetary and Space Science |volume = 48 | issue= 7–8 | pages = 617–636 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8 | bibcode=2000P&SS...48..617G[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal = Icarus |volume= 146 |issue = 2 |pages = 444–452 |year= 2000 |doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 |title = Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan |author = Fortes, A.

The four gas giants are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.[tpl]cite journal | author=Molnar, L. A.; Dunn, D. E. |title=On the Formation of Planetary Rings |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |year=1996 |volume=28 |pages=77–115 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.1815M | last2=Dunn[/tpl][tpl]cite book | first=Encrenaz |last=Thérèse |year=2004 |title=The Solar System |edition=Third |pages=388–390 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-00241-3[/tpl]
No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. However the sub-brown dwarf Cha 110913-773444, which has been described as a rogue planet, is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc.
