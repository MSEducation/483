Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien wanted in 1993 to put Peterson forward to the Governor General of Canada for appointment to the  post of Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, but Peterson felt that his health could not stand up to the many ceremonial duties that this position would require. "He was the most famous Canadian in the world," said Chrétien. Chrétien also said that Nelson Mandela glowed when meeting Peterson. "It was very emotional. They were both moved to meet each other. These were two men with humble beginnings who rose to very illustrious levels."[tpl]cite news | title=Chrétien recalls Mandela, Peterson meeting | url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071224/peterson_mandela_071224/20071224 | publisher=CTV.ca  | date=24 December 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-11[/tpl]; http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jysfV8l_cM9t30j6K61HrnzB_i2w[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl]
A major memorial concert, held on January 12, 2008, filled the 2500-seat Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto. People had queued for more than three hours to get in. Governor General Michaëlle Jean reported at the concert that "thousands" more could not get in. Among the performers were Grégory Charles, Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Phil Nimmons and singers Audrey Morris and Nancy Wilson.

A movement was begun on Facebook to rename the Lionel-Groulx Metro station, a transfer station between Montreal's Green Line and Orange Line, in honour of Oscar Peterson. The Montreal Transit Corporation, however, has refused to end its moratorium on renaming Metro stations. The city's policy on landmark tributes is to wait at least a year after a public figure's death.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idINN0619825120080306?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0| title=No Montreal Metro tribute for jazz great Peterson| first=Natalie |last=Armstrong | date=2008-03-06| publisher=Reuteurs[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=0cdc74a2-7c10-4ff7-9be1-875f94d266db| title=Put his name on the map, not a métro station| date=2008-03-06| publisher=Montreal Gazette[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080306.wpeterson06/BNStory/Entertainment/home| title=Peterson tribute proposal hits sour note| first=Ingrid |last=Peritz | date=2008-03-06| publisher=The Globe and Mail| location=Toronto[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/arts/music/07arts-OSCARPETERSO_BRF.html?ref=arts| title=Oscar Peterson Proposal in Montreal Causes Flap| first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder | date=2008-03-07| publisher=New York Times[/tpl]
