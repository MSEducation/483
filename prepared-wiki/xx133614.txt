CATEGORIES: Vacuum cleaner manufacturers

Dirt Devil is a brand name of household vacuum cleaners and floor care. There are two main units: Power for large houses, and RV unit for smaller houses or apartments, as well as a variety of other floor care products including handheld vacuum cleaners and carpet shampooing machines.

==Company history==

The company was founded 1905 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. In 1955 they built the first household vacuum with a patented Cyclone system. Since then over 25 million have been sold.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]  Originally the company was called "Royal Manufacturing" and made vacuum cleaners with metal cases. In the 1980s they began selling the mass-market "Dirt Devil" line with plastic cases; originally the packaging said "Royal Dirt Devil" but over the years the name "Royal" appeared in smaller and smaller type until it vanished entirely from the package.  Today the brand is "Dirt Devil", but they also continue to manufacture the "Royal" line, though it is much more expensive and of a higher quality than Dirt Devil, and the corporate legal name is the rather anonymous "TTI Floor Care North America". TTI stands for Techtronic Industries, a Hong Kong-based firm and the makers of Hoover, Vax, and other vacuum cleaners.

==Products and marketing==

===Classic Red Hand Vac===

In 1984, Royal introduced the Dirt Devil Hand Vac. The hand vac has a rotating brush for cleanup on stairs and furniture, plus a hose for hard to reach spots. The hand vac became the largest selling handheld vacuum in the United States selling more than 25 million which made Dirt Devil open its door to newer product innovations.
In 1996, the Ultra Hand Vac was introduced with more suction and a built-in stretch hose and crevice tool. The Ultra Hand Vac is still available at some retailers and department stores.
In 2005, Dirt Devil gave the hand vac a makeover calling it the Dirt Devil Classic Hand Vac.
The Classic has twice the power of the classic red hand vac with a HEPA Filter and a bagless dirt cup. The Classic is available at various retailers.

In 1996, the Broom Vac debuted and became the most selling stick vacuum in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The Broom Vac is a rechargeable stick vacuum used for mostly bare floors; the user sweeps with it and vacuums the pile; it does not require bags.
In 2005, Dirt Devil came out with a completely different Broom Vac, with 9 color options, longer battery life, and more suction. They are available at various retailers and department stores.
