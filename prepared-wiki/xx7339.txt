From 1849–52, the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts, establishing several missions in Europe, Latin America, and the South Pacific.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=91[/tpl]. Converts were expected to "gather" to Zion, and during Young's presidency (1847–77) over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America. Many of the converts came from England and Scandinavia, and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=91–92[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|url=http://welshmormonhistory.org/ |title=Welsh Mormon History[/tpl] During the 1840s and 1850s many thousands of Welsh Mormon converts immigrated to America, and today, it is estimated that around 20 percent of the population of Utah is of Welsh descent.  Many of these immigrants crossed the Great Plains in wagons drawn by oxen, while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts. During the 1860s, newcomers began using the new railroad that was under construction.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=95–96[/tpl].
In 1852, church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage, a form of polygamy.[ref][tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=88[/tpl] (Plural marriage originated in a revelation that Joseph Smith apparently received in 1831 and wrote down in 1843.

According to the federal censuses, the highest percentage of the population in polygamous families was in 1860 (43.6 percent) and it declined to 25 percent in 1880 and to 7 percent in 1890). Besides the doctrinal reasons for plural marriage, the practice made some economic sense, as many of the plural wives were single women who arrived in Utah without brothers or fathers to offer them societal support.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=88[/tpl] ("The close study of the marriages in one nineteenth-century Utah community revealed that a disproportionate number of plural wives were women who arrived in Utah without fathers or brothers to care for them...Since better-off men more frequently married plurally, the practice distributed wealth to the poor and disconnected").
By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young.See Tullidge, Edward, History of Salt Lake City, pp. 132-35 (Original from the University of Michigan, 1886). In 1857, U.S. President James Buchanan sent an army to Utah, which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them. Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois, the Mormons prepared to defend themselves, determined to torch their own homes in the case that they were invaded.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=101–02[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=95[/tpl]. The relatively peaceful Utah War ensued from 1857 to 1858, in which the most notable instance of violence was the Mountain Meadows massacre, when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=96–97[/tpl] (calling the Mountain Meadows massacre the greatest tragedy in Mormon history). In 1858, Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non-Mormon, Alfred Cumming.To combat the notion that rank-and-file Mormons were unhappy under Young's leadership, Cumming noted that he had offered to help any leave the territory who desired. Of the 50,000 inhabitants of the state of Utah, the underwhelming response—56 men, 33 women, and 71 children, most of whom stated they left for economic reasons—impressed Cumming, as did the fact that Mormon leaders contributed supplies to the emigrants. Cumming to of State Lewis Cass, written by Thomas Kane, May 2, 1858, BYU Special Collections. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.[ref]

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other LDS Church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=97[/tpl]. In 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. United States that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy, and many Mormon polygamists went into hiding; later, Congress began seizing church assets. In September 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice of polygamy.[tpl]lds|Official Declaration|od|1[/tpl] Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a "Second Manifesto" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today seeks actively to distance itself from "fundamentalist" groups that continue the practice.The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word Mormon in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy [tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide — LDS Newsroom |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]; The church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25396937/ns/us_news-faith/t/mormons-seek-distance-polygamist-sects |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher=msnbc.com[/tpl].

===Modern times===

During the early 20th century, Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream. In 1929, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=103[/tpl]. Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle-class.[tpl]Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=22[/tpl]. "With the consistent encouragement of church leaders, Mormons became models of patriotic, law-abiding citizenship, sometimes seeming to "out-American" all other Americans. Their participation in the full spectrum of national, social, political, economic, and cultural life has been thorough and sincere".
In the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the Great Depression, as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=105[/tpl]. As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=106[/tpl].  In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as Boy Scouting, a Young Women organization, church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and religious education programs for youth and college students.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=53[/tpl]. During the Great Depression, the church started a welfare program to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=40–41[/tpl].
During the latter half of the 19th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a "peculiar people".The term peculiar people is consciously borrowed from 1 Peter 2:9, and can be interpreted as "special" or "different", though Mormons have certainly been viewed as "peculiar" in the modern sense as well. [tpl]Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=60[/tpl].
Though the 1960s and 1970s brought positive changes such as Women's Liberation and the Civil Rights Movement, Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the sexual revolution, the widespread use of recreational drugs, moral relativism, and other forces they saw as damaging to the family."Developments mitigating traditional racial, ethnic, and gender inequality and bigotry were regarded in hindsight by most Americans (and most Mormons) as desirable  .... On the other hand, Mormons (and many others) have watched with increasing alarm the spread throughout society of 'liberating' innovations such as the normalization of non marital sexual behavior, the rise in abortion, illegitimacy, divorce, and child neglect or abuse, recreational drugs, crime, etc." [tpl]Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=124[/tpl].
Partly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s."The church appears to have arrested, if not reversed, the erosion of distinctive Mormon ways that might have been anticipated in the 60s." [tpl]Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=140[/tpl]. "However, in partial contradiction to their public image, Mormons stand mostly on the liberal side of the continuum on certain other social and political issues, notably on civil rights, and even on women's rights, except where these seem to conflict with child-rearing roles." [tpl]Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=156[/tpl].
Although black people have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith's time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church had a policy against ordaining men of black African descent to the priesthood.[tpl]Cite book |title=All Abraham's Children: Changing Mormon Conceptions of Race and Lineage |first=Armand L. |last=Mauss |pages=213–215 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-252-02803-1 |ref=harv [/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=111–12[/tpl] ("The origins of this policy are not altogether clear. "Passages in Joseph Smith's translations indicate that a lineage associated with Ham and the Egyptian pharaohs was forbidden the priesthood. Connecting the ancient pharaohs with modern Africans and African Americans required a speculative leap, but by the time of Brigham Young, the leap was made.") The church had previously been criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, but the change came in 1978 and was prompted primarily by problems facing mixed-race converts in Brazil.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=111–12[/tpl]. In general, Mormons greeted the change with joy and relief. Since 1978, black membership has grown, and in 1997 there were approximately 500,000 black members of the church (about 5 percent of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean.[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_218.html#1062 |title=1999–2000 Church Almanac |author= |year=1998 |work=Adherents.com quoting Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City |page=119 |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |ref=harv [/tpl] "A rough estimate would place the number of Church members with African roots at year-end 1997 at half a million, with about 100,000 each in Africa and the Caribbean, and another 300,000 in Brazil."

The church enforces general doctrinal uniformity, and congregations on all continents teach the same doctrines, and international Mormons tend to absorb a good deal of Mormon culture, possibly because of the church's top-down hierarchy and a missionary presence.

==Culture and practices==

Isolation in Utah had allowed Mormons to create a culture of their own.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=47[/tpl]. As the faith spread around the world, many of its more distinctive practices followed. Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes, repent of their sins, and adopt sometimes foreign standards of conduct. Practices common to Mormons include studying the scriptures, praying daily, fasting on a regular basis, attending Sunday worship services, participating in church programs and activities on weekdays, and refraining from work on Sundays when possible. The most important part of the church services is considered to be the Lord's Supper (commonly called sacrament), in which church members renew covenants made at baptism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/sacrament |publisher=lds.org |title=Sacrament[/tpl] Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by Jesus Christ, including personal honesty, integrity, obedience to law, chastity outside of opposite-sex marriage and fidelity within marriage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/for-the-strength-of-youth-fulfilling-our-duty-to-god |title=For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God |publisher=LDS Church[/tpl]

Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers.
Mormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history.Early Mormons had practiced the law of consecration in Missouri for two years, in an attempt to eliminate poverty. Families would return their surplus "income" to the bishop, who would then redistribute it among the saints. Though initial efforts at "consecration" failed, consecration has become a more general attitude that underlies Mormon charitable works. [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=36–39[/tpl]. LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church. The church is divided by locality into congregations called "wards", with several wards making up a "stake".[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=53[/tpl] (The name "stake" comes from a passage in Isaiah that compares Zion to a tent that will enlarge as new stakes are planted); See [tpl]nowrap|Isaiah 33:20[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|Isaiah 54:2[/tpl]. The vast majority of church leadership positions are lay positions, and church members may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=35, 52[/tpl] Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as tithing, and are often involved in humanitarian efforts. Many LDS young men choose to serve a two-year proselytizing mission, during which they dedicate all of their time to the church, without pay.A full-time mission is looked upon as important character training for a young man.

Mormons have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage.

One denomination dominates the non-Mormon section of the movement: Community of Christ, which has about 250,000 members.) Also note the use of the lower case d and hyphen in "Latter-day Saints", as opposed to the larger "Latter Day Saint movement." The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of LDS Church leaders. There are, however, several smaller groups that differ from "mainstream" Mormonism in various ways.
 LDS Church members who  do not  actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called "less-active" (akin to the qualifying expressions non-observant or non-practicing used in relation to members of other religious groups).[tpl]cite news |last= Stack |first= Peggy Fletcher |authorlink= Peggy Fletcher Stack |date= 23 September 2011 |title= Active, inactive – do Mormon labels work or wound? |url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/52631643-80/mormon-church-lds-says.html.csp |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate= 2013-09-20[/tpl]. The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services.Member activity rates are estimated from missionary reports, seminary and institute enrollment, and ratio of members per congregation – [tpl]cite web |url=http://ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com/2011/07/countries-of-world-by-estimated-member.html |title=Countries of the World by Estimated Member Activity Rate |author= |date=July 11, 2011 |work=LDS Church Growth |publisher= |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]; See also: [tpl]cite web |url=http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/latter-day-saint-social-life-social-research-lds-church-and-its-members/8-consequential-dim |title=The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity |author=Stan L.

Activity rates tend to vary with age, and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25.

===Fundamentalist Mormons===

Members of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as fundamentalist Mormons; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of plural marriage. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects, (0.1–0.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy.Martha Sonntag Bradley, "Polygamy-Practicing Mormons" in J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann (eds.) (2002). Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia 3:1023–24; Dateline NBC, 2001–01–02; Ken Driggs, "Twentieth-Century Polygamy and Fundamentalist Mormons in Southern Utah", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Winter 1991, pp. 46–47; Irwin Altman, "Polygamous Family Life: The Case of Contemporary Mormon Fundamentalists", Utah Law Review (1996) p. 369; Stephen Eliot Smith, "'The Mormon Question' Revisited: Anti-Polygamy Laws and the Free Exercise Clause", LL.M. thesis, Harvard Law School, 2005. There are a number of fundamentalist sects, the largest two being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian communalism known as the law of consecration or the United Order. The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups, excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it,The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word Mormon in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy [tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide |author= |date= |work= |publisher=LDS Newsroom |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]; The church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered – [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25396937/ns/us_news-faith/t/mormons-seek-distance-polygamist-sects/ |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher= msnbc.com [/tpl] and today a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church.[tpl]Cite journal| journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V31N02_19.pdf |author=Quinn, Michael D. |issue=2 |date=Summer 1998 |title=Plural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism |page=7 |volume=31| ref=harv[/tpl]

===Liberal Mormons===

Liberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture. They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but do not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true. For liberal Mormons, revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.liberalmormon.net/501whl.shtml |title=LiberalMormon.net |accessdate=October 27, 2011 [/tpl]. Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://latterdaymainstreet.com/2010/09/21/bringing-back-liberal-mormonism/  |title=Bringing back Liberal Mormonism |author=Chris H |date=September 21, 2010 |publisher=Main Street Plaza |accessdate=October 27, 2011 [/tpl]. In a separate context, members of minuscule "progressive" breakaway groups have also adopted the label Liberal Mormon.

===Cultural Mormons===

Cultural Mormons are individuals who do not believe some (or many) of the doctrines of LDS Church, but who self-identify as Mormon. Usually this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith, or as having converted and spent a large portion of one's life as an active member of the LDS Church.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.newordermormon.org/essays/faithful-unbelievers.php |contribution= The Paradox of the Faithful Unbeliever |first= Peggy |last= Rogers |date= Undated |title= New Order Mormon Essays |work= New Order Mormon, NewOrderMormon.org |publisher= Publisher is anonymous |accessdate= 2013-09-20[/tpl]. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church, and in some cases may not even be officially members of the church.

==Beliefs==

Mormons have a scriptural canon consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price.  Mormons however have a relatively open definition of scripture. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a prophet, while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Scriptures#Scriptures:_Authority_of_Scripture |title=Authority of Scripture |author= |date= |work=Encyclopedia of Mormonism |publisher= |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]. Thus, the Bible, written by prophets, is the word of God, so far as it is translated correctly. The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets, and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against, and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=25–26[/tpl].
Mormons believe in "a friendly universe", governed by a God whose work and glory it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=79[/tpl]. Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God, the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Plan of Salvation|work=True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference|year=2004|publisher=LDS Church |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/plan-of-salvation|page=115|ref=harv[/tpl] and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a "fulness of joy". The most important part of the plan involved Jesus, the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God, to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=75[/tpl]. To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through  ordinances such as  baptism and the laying on of hands.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=78[/tpl]; In Mormonism, an ordinance is a formal act, in which people enter into  covenants with God. For example, covenants associated with baptism and the Eucharist involve taking the name of the Son upon themselves, always remembering him, and keeping his commandments; [tpl]Cite journal|title=Atonement of Jesus Christ|work=True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference|year=2004|publisher=LDS Church |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/atonement-of-jesus-christ|page=14|ref=harv[/tpl];  [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=60–61[/tpl] Because Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform vicarious ordinances such as baptism for the dead on behalf of deceased persons. Mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the spirit world.
According to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, known as the Great Apostasy, began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ.[tpl]Cite book |author= Missionary Department of the LDS Church |authorlink= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |title= Preach My Gospel |publisher= LDS Church, Inc |year= 2004 |page= 35 |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ |isbn= 0-402-36617-4 |ref= harv   [/tpl] It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies,[tpl]Cite book |last= Talmage |first= James E. |authorlink= James E.

Mormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, John the Baptist, Moses, and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the "only true and living church" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Mormonism in America|url= http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=January 2012[/tpl] (Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view); [tpl]citation |author=Robinson, Stephen E. |date=May 1998 |url=http://www.lds.org/new-era/1998/05/are-mormons-christians |title=Are Mormons Christians? |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |work=New Era[/tpl]. while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Romney's Mormon Faith Likely a Factor in Primaries, Not in a General Election|publisher=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Romneys-Mormon-Faith-Likely-a-Factor-in-Primaries-Not-in-a-General-Election.aspx[/tpl] (About a third of Americans and half of evangelical Protestants view Mormonism as a non-Christian religion).

Though the LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president–prophet dictating revelations for the whole church, there is a bottom-up aspect as well. Ordinary Mormons have access to the same inspiration that is thought to guide their prophets, and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=54[/tpl]. Mormons see Joseph Smith's first vision as proof that the heavens are open, and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on "asking God" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers, but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=15, 35–35[/tpl] (Outside observers sometimes react to Mormonism as "nice people, wacky beliefs." Mormons insist that the "wacky" beliefs pull them together as a people and give them the strength and the know-how to succeed in the modern world).
