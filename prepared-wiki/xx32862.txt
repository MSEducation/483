Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (18 July 1853 – 4 February 1928) was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. He also derived the transformation equations subsequently used by Albert Einstein to describe space and time.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Hendrik Lorentz was born in Arnhem, Gelderland (The Netherlands), the son of Gerrit Frederik Lorentz (1822–1893), a well-off nurseryman, and Geertruida van Ginkel (1826–1861). In 1862, after his mother's death, his father married Luberta Hupkes. Despite being raised as a Protestant, he was a freethinker in religious matters.[tpl]cite web|title=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hendrik_Antoon_Lorentz.aspx|publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Russell McCormmach|quote=Although he grew up in Protestant circles, he was a freethinker in religious matters; he regularly attended the local French church to improve his French.[/tpl] From 1866 to 1869 he attended the "Hogere Burger School" in Arnhem, a new type of public high school recently established by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke. His results in school were exemplary; not only did he excel in the exact sciences, but also in English, French, and German. In 1870 he passed the exams in classical languages which were then required for admission to University.
Lorentz studied physics and mathematics at the Leiden University, where he was strongly influenced by the teaching of astronomy professor Frederik Kaiser; it was his influence that led him to become a physicist. After earning a bachelor's degree, he returned to Arnhem in 1871 to teach night school classes in mathematics, but he continued his studies in Leiden in addition to his teaching position.  In 1875 Lorentz earned a doctoral degree under Pieter Rijke on a thesis entitled "[tpl]lang|nl|Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht[/tpl]" (On the theory of reflection and refraction of light), in which he refined the electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell.

===Career===

====Professor in Leiden====

In 1877, only 24 years of age, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. The position had initially been offered to Johan van der Waals, but he opted for a position at the Universiteit van Amsterdam at the last moment. On January 25, 1878, he delivered his inaugural lecture on "[tpl]lang|nl|De moleculaire theoriën in de natuurkunde[/tpl]" (The molecular theories in physics).
During the first twenty years in Leiden, Lorentz was primarily interested in the theory of electromagnetism to explain the relationship of electricity, magnetism, and light. After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from hydrodynamics to general relativity. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.
Lorentz theorized that the atoms might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz, Pieter Zeeman, discovered the Zeeman effect in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the Lorentz-Lorenz formula, the Lorentz force, the Lorentzian distribution, and the Lorentz transformation.

====Electrodynamics and relativity====

In 1892 and 1895 Lorentz worked on describing electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move relative to the luminiferous aether.[ref]

|volume=5
|pages=252–278}}. See also the English translation.[/ref] (see Einstein synchronisation and Relativity of simultaneity). In 1892, with the attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz also proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (see length contraction; George FitzGerald had already arrived at this conclusion in 1889).
In 1899 and again in 1904, Lorentz added time dilation to his transformations and published what Poincaré in 1905 named Lorentz transformations.
It was apparently unknown to Lorentz that Joseph Larmor had used identical transformations to describe orbiting electrons in 1897. Larmor's and Lorentz's equations look somewhat unfamiliar, but they are algebraically equivalent to those presented by Poincaré and Einstein in 1905. Lorentz's 1904 paper includes the covariant formulation of electrodynamics, in which electrodynamic phenomena in different reference frames are described by identical equations with well defined transformation properties.  The paper clearly recognizes the significance of this formulation, namely that the outcomes of electrodynamic experiments do not depend on the relative motion of the reference frame. The 1904 paper includes a
detailed discussion of the increase of the inertial mass of rapidly moving objects.

====Lorentz and special relativity====

In 1905, Einstein would use many of the concepts, mathematical tools and results discussed to write his paper entitled "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies",[ref]
. See also: English translation.[/ref] known today as the theory of special relativity. Because Lorentz laid the fundamentals for the work by Einstein, this theory was originally called the Lorentz-Einstein theory.[tpl]Cite book|author=Miller, Arthur I.|year=1981|title=Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity.

In 1906, Lorentz's electron theory received a full-fledged treatment in his lectures at Columbia University, published under the title The Theory of Electrons.
The increase of mass was the first prediction of Lorentz and Einstein to be tested, but some experiments by Kaufmann appeared to show a slightly different mass increase; this led Lorentz to the famous remark that he was "at the end of his Latin."[tpl]Wayback |date=20050221211608 |url=www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/chp/text/lorentz1.html |title=Lorentz à Poincaré[/tpl]  The confirmation of his prediction had to wait until 1908 and later (see Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments).
Lorentz published a series of papers dealing with what he called "Einstein's principle of relativity".

1914.
In his 1906 lectures published with additions in 1909 in the book "The theory of electrons" (updated in 1915), he spoke affirmatively of Einstein's theory:
Though Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the "true time":
Lorentz also gave credit to Poincaré's contributions to relativity.[ref]

====Lorentz and general relativity====

Lorentz was one of few scientists who supported Einstein's search for general relativity from the beginning – he wrote several research papers and discussed with Einstein personally and by letter.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kox, A.J.|year=1993|title= Einstein, Lorentz, Leiden and general relativity|journal=Class.

and to reformulate it in a coordinate-free way (1916).[tpl]Cite book|author=Janssen, M.|year=1992|chapter=H. A. Lorentz's Attempt to Give a Coordinate-free Formulation of the General.

====Assessments====

Einstein wrote of Lorentz:

Poincaré (1902) said of Lorentz's theory of electrodynamics:
Paul Langevin (1911) said of Lorentz:[ref]
 (translated by J. B. Sykes, 1973).[/ref]
Lorentz and Emil Wiechert had an interesting correspondence on the topics of electromagnetism and the theory of relativity, and Lorentz explained his ideas in letters to Wiechert. The correspondence between Lorentz and Wiechert has been published by Wilfried Schröder.(Arch. ex. hist. Sci, 1984).
Lorentz was chairman of the first Solvay Conference held in Brussels in the autumn of 1911. Shortly after the conference, Poincaré wrote an essay on quantum physics which gives an indication of Lorentz's status at the time:

====Change of priorities====

In 1910 Lorentz decided to reorganize his life.  His teaching and management duties at Leiden University were taking up too much of his time leaving him little time for research. In 1912, he resigned from his chair of theoretical physics to become curator of the "Physics Cabinet" at Teylers Museum in Haarlem. He remained connected to Leiden University  as an external professor, and his "Monday morning lectures" on new developments in theoretical physics soon became legendary.
Lorentz initially asked Einstein to succeed him as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. However, he could not accept because he had just accepted a position at ETH Zurich. Einstein had no regrets in this matter, since the prospect of having to fill Lorentz's shoes made him shiver. Instead Lorentz appointed Paul Ehrenfest as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the Lorentz Institute.

====Civil work====

After World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the "Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.
Lorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the Waddenzee. Hydraulic engineering was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem. Lorentz proposed to start from the basic hydrodynamic equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a "human computer", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the Waddenzee. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932 and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |accessdate=2012-02-01[/tpl]
One of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.

===Death===

In January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4. The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from Owen Willans Richardson's description of his funeral:
Unique 1928 film footage of the funeral procession with a lead carriage followed by ten mourners, followed by a carriage with the coffin, followed in turn by at least four more carriages, passing by a crowd at the Grote Markt, Haarlem from the Zijlstraat to the Smedesstraat, and then back again through the Grote Houtstraat towards the Barteljorisstraat, on the way to the "Algemene Begraafplaats" at the Kleverlaan (northern Haarlem cemetery) has been digitized on Youtube.[tpl]YouTube|H2VtrJD0xJk|Funeral procession[/tpl] Hendrik Lorentz Einstein gave a eulogy at a memorial service at Leiden University.

==Legacy==

Lorentz is considered one of the prime representatives of the "Second Dutch Golden Age", a period of several decades surrounding 1900 in which in the natural sciences in the Netherlands flourished.
Richardson describes Lorentz as:
M. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:
In addition to the Nobel prize, Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1905. The Society awarded him their Rumford Medal in 1908 and their Copley Medal in 1918.
