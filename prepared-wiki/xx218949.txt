Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway 3759 is a standard gauge 4-8-4 (four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels), Northern type, steam railway locomotive built by Baldwin in 1928. It is on display in Locomotive Park, located between Andy Devine Avenue and Beale Street in Kingman, Arizona. The park was established in August 1957 with AT&SF 3759 donated to the City of Kingman in recognition of Kingman's history with the railroad.
3759 was delivered in 1928 as a 3751 class 4-8-4 passenger locomotive.  Originally a coal burning locomotive with 73-inch drivers, the fleet was converted to oil in 1936 and rebuilt between 1938 and 1941 with 80-inch drivers. Its regular passenger run was from Los Angeles to Kansas City, with Kingman as a water stop on the way back to Los Angeles. Retired in 1953, the engine had traveled over 2,585,000 miles.
In February 1955, 3759 was brought out of retirement at the request of the Railway Club of Southern California for a special excursion run, dubbed "Farewell to Steam."  It ran on February 6, a round trip between Los Angeles Union Station and Barstow, California with stops in Pasadena and San Bernardino and was the last Santa Fe revenue steam train to leave Los Angeles and to traverse Cajon Pass.  After this trip, 3759 went back into storage, until Santa Fe donated the locomotive to the city of Kingman in 1957.
The locomotive was added to the National Register of Historic Places as AT&SF Locomotive in 1986, reference number 86001113. In 1987 caboose 999520 was retired and donated to Kingman to be added behind 3759.
