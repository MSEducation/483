[[Wickham]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hampshire

Wickham, formerly spelled Wykeham, is a small historic village and civil parish in Hampshire, southern England, located about three miles north of Fareham. It is within the City of Winchester local government district, although it is considerably closer to Fareham than to Winchester. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 4,816.
The centre of Wickham is focused on its wide and well-proportioned square, which is lined with historic buildings and is designated a conservation area.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]
It was the fording place of the River Meon on the Roman road between Noviomagus Regnorum (Chichester) and Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and the inferred divergent point of the route to Clausentum (Bitterne). The Roman road from Wickham to Chichester is still followed today by local roads, passing behind Portsdown Hill to the north of Portsmouth Harbour and then onwards via Havant. In contrast, the route to Winchester is mostly likely lost through neglect in the Dark Ages, before present field patterns emerged.
There have been a reasonable number of sites identified nearby associated with Romano-British industry. These have mainly been pottery kilns focused around the limit of navigation of the River Hamble, near Botley. It is also here that a ford on the Clausentum road has been identified.
Wickham has occasionally been hypothesised as an alternative to Nursling (on the River Test) or Neatham (near Alton) for the Roman station Onna listed in the Antonine Itinerary. However, no definite location for Onna has been determined.
It was the birthplace of William of Wykeham, founder of Winchester College and New College, Oxford.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/bios/wmofwkhm/early.html |title=Biography of William of Wykeham (1324-1404), Bishop of Winchester |publisher=Britannia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl]
The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Wickham.
The village was an intermediate station on the Meon Valley Railway, a late Victorian route, until the line closed in 1955. At one time this railway was conceived as a direct route from London to the Isle of Wight. The closed line is now established as a cycle path and bridleway along the valley of the River Meon.
The village has a community centre[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wickhamcentre.org.uk/ |title=Wickham Centre Home Page |publisher=Wickhamcentre.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl] which is home to many activities, including the Home-Start Meon Valley Charity,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homestart-meonvalley.org.uk |title=Home-Start Meon Valley |publisher=Home-Start Meon Valley |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl] a badminton club,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wickhambadminton.hampshire.org.uk |title=Wickham Badminton Group |publisher=Wickhambadminton.hampshire.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl] an Elim Pentecostal Church church[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meonvalleychurch.co.uk |title=You're invited, just come along! |publisher=Meon Valley Church |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl] and a monthly antiques fair.
