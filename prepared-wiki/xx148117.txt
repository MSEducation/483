[[Meko 360]]

The MEKO 360 is a class of five destroyers built in Germany for the Argentine and Nigerian Navies.  The 360 was the first ship of the MEKO family of vessels built by Blohm und Voss.

==Variants==

A single vessel of the MEKO 360H1 variant was produced for the Nigerian Navy. Called the Aradu, it is one of the largest vessels of that navy.
Four vessels of a second variant, the MEKO 360H2, were constructed for Argentina. They were locally named the Almirante Brown class, and currently serve as the main strength in their Navy.
Although considered by its builders to be a frigate, the Almirante Brown vessels have been classed in Argentina (and in Jane's Fighting Ships) as destroyers.
