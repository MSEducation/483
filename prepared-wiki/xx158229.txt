CATEGORIES: Provinces of the Sasanian Empire

Maishan (Middle Persian: 𐭬𐭩𐭱𐭠𐭭) was a satrapy (province) of the Sassanid Empire. It consisted of the Parthian vassal kingdoms of Mesene and Characene and reached north along the Shatt al-Arab river and then the lower Tigris to Madhar and possibly further. Its inhabitants included Babylonians, Arabs, Iranians, and even some Indians and Malays (the Malays may have been slaves brought from the Indian sub-continent). The province was very fertile, the best place for barley according to Strabo, and contained many date palms. It was also an important trading province along the Persian Gulf.The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3(2): The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods, ed.
