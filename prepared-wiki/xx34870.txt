Culgoa is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 662 km northwest of Sydney.
The Culgoa National Park, with its impressive river red gums and  expansive floodplains, is the landscape that people have come to be representative of the Australian outback. The iconic coolabah tree, a native species, covers large sections of the park. In fact, no other national park in New South Wales has an area larger than the Culgoa's coolabah woodlands.[tpl]cite web|title=Culgoa National Park|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0099|publisher=The Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH), NSW|accessdate=5 February 2013[/tpl]
