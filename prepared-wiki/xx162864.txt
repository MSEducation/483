==Music video==

Shot in various landscapes, it starts off with the band performing on a boat on a river; the band members being filmed from different angles whilst performing. Following a time lapse sequence (implying passage of time), Felix Riebl  (the lead singer) jumps off the boat into a vast sandy desert. Initially, from a long camera shot, the large boat in the background for several seconds is seen, followed by the band members relaxing in a canoe lying on sand, with Harry James Angus playing trumpet whilst Riebl walks by. The next sequence shows Riebl commence singing as he continues to walk, passing by the other band members as they relax on a couch with bassist Ryan Monro resting on the sand next to the couch. In the last scene of the song we see all of the band members performing once again, this time on the sand. In the last seconds of the song, the camera pans out and displays a barren planet Earth (devoid of water), with the (former) coastline of Australia clearly visible.
