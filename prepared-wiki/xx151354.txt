Formula One (F1) is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/the-fia/about-fia/Pages/AboutFIA.aspx |title=About FIA |publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) |accessdate=31 October 2008 [/tpl] The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.
Safety standards have improved since the first World Championship Grand Prix at Silverstone in [tpl]F1|1950[/tpl], where there was no medical back-up or safety measures in case of an accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7423.html |title=The fifties and sixties |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] In the 1960s helmets and overalls became mandatory and the FIA assumed responsibility for safety at the circuits. Further steps were taken to improve the safety of the Formula One car in the 1970s: the cockpit opening was enlarged allowing the driver quicker escape in the event of an accident and outside mirrors became mandatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7425.html |title=The seventies |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] In the 1980s the carbon fibre monocoque replaced aluminium, increasing protection upon impact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7426.html |title=The eighties |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] Following the death of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in [tpl]F1|1994[/tpl], a number of measures were introduced in an attempt to slow the cars down, including a wooden undertray. In [tpl]F1|1998[/tpl] grooved tyres replaced racing slick tyres to reduce cornering speed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7427.html |title=The nineties |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] Safety measures continued to be introduced into the 21st century, with a number of circuits changing their configuration to improve driver safety.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7428.html |title=The 21st century |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl]
This list includes drivers who have died during a FIA World Championship race weekend, and those who have died while driving a Formula One car  outside of the World Championship. Track marshals and other race attendees who have died as a result of these accidents are not included in the list. Fifty drivers have died driving a Formula One car, with Cameron Earl being the first in [tpl]F1|1952[/tpl]. Thirty-two of the drivers died during a World Championship Grand Prix race weekend, seven as the result of injuries suffered in a test session and eleven during a non-championship Formula One event. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has seen the most fatalities; seven drivers have died there during the course of the Indianapolis 500. Fifteen drivers died in the 1950s; fourteen in the 1960s; twelve in the 1970s; four in the 1980s and two in the 1990s. Following Senna's death in 1994, no driver had died from injuries sustained in a World Championship-related accident until María de Villota died in 2013 from complications of injuries she sustained in a testing accident the previous year.[tpl]ref label|1994|A|a[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/3831.html |title=A Brief History of Formula One |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=19 August 2012 |first=Martin |last=Williamson [/tpl] Only two Formula One Champions have died while racing or practicing in Formula One, Jochen Rindt in [tpl]F1|1970[/tpl], and Ayrton Senna. Rindt is the only driver to win the championship posthumously.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/17319968 |title=Formula 1's Greatest Drivers.
