==Origins==

The earliest surviving version of the song is in a broadside printed in England between 1672 and 1685, under the name Diddle Diddle, Or The Kind Country Lovers. The broadside indicates it is to be sung to the tune "Lavenders Green", implying that a tune by that name was already in existence. The lyrics printed in the broadside are fairly bawdy, celebrating sex and drinking. According to the Traditional Ballad Index, "The singer tells his lady that she must love him because he loves her. He tells of a vale where young man and maid have lain together, and suggests that they might do the same, and that she might love him (and also his dog)." Here is the first of ten verses:
 Lavender's green, diddle, diddle,
 You must love me, diddle, diddle,
I heard one say, diddle, diddle,
That you and I, diddle, diddle,
It emerged as a children's song in Songs for the Nursery in 1805 in the form:
Similar versions appeared in collections of rhymes throughout the nineteenth century.
