It is relatively safe and well tolerated by most patients at doses of up to 600 mg/day for months. 
After promising results in three small trial Tranilast was studied in a major clinical trial (the PRESTO trial) for prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization, but was not found effective for that application.http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/10/1243 "Results of Prevention of REStenosis with Tranilast and its Outcomes (PRESTO) Trial" 2002
It has also been investigated for use as an antiproliferative drug on drug-eluting stents.
A phase II trial is recruiting rheumatoid arthritis patients.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00882024
