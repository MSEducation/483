Amjad Farooqi (1972—September 26, 2004) (Urdu: امجد فاروقی), known by the alias Amjad Hussain (Urdu: امجد حسین), was an Islamic militant.
He was born in Punjab, Pakistan, and participated in the fighting against India in Kashmir. 
Farooqi allegedly was involved in the murder of Daniel Pearl, as well as conspiring with Abu Faraj al-Libbi to kill General Pervez Musharraf during the assassination attempts in Rawalpindi on December 14 and December 25, 2003. Farooqi might have been an associate of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Pakistani forces launched a massive manhunt in May 2004, which ended with Farooqi's death in a two-hour gun battle at a house in southern Sindh province. 
Farooqi was a member of the Pakistani-based jihadi group Jaish-e-Mohammed (now banned), which was founded by Masood Azhar after he was released by India because of a deal with hijackers who hijacked an Indian plane in December 1999.
