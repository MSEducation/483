CATEGORIES: 1977 Atlantic hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season had the fewest tropical storms since the 1965 season. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical depression of the season developed on June 13, 12 days after the start of the season, in the western Caribbean Sea. After a succession of three other tropical depressions, the first tropical storm of the season, Hurricane Anita, finally became a named storm on August 29 – the latest date since the satellite era began in the 1960s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/weather/51858507.html|title=Real Hurricane Season About to Start|author=John Kocet|date=July 28, 2009|agency=AccuWeather|newspaper=Star Tribune|accessdate=September 19, 2013[/tpl] Anita struck Mexico as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. At least 25,000 people were left homeless and 11 fatalities were reported.
In addition to Anita, another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe. The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana, resulting in $10 million (1977 USD) in damage.[tpl]#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1977 USD, unless otherwise noted|group="nb"[/tpl]  After moving inland, it spawned 14 tornadoes throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In addition to Anita and Babe, five other tropical cyclones – hurricanes Clara, Dorothy, and Evelyn, as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine – left only minor impacts on land. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11 fatalities and at least $13 million in damage, excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine, which led to 53 deaths and $203 million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States, New Jersey, and New York.
