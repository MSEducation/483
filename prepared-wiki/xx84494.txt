==Plot==

Wondering what has happened to herself, now feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley Valentine finds herself regularly talking to the wall while preparing her husband's chips and egg. When her best friend wins a trip-for-two to Greece, she packs her bags, leaves a note on the Cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. What she finds is romance and a new awareness of who she is and what her existence can be with just a little effort on her part.

==Productions==

Commissioned by the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the play premiered in 1986, with Noreen Kershaw directed by Glen Walford. Two years later it opened in London's West End at the Vaudeville Theatre, with Pauline Collins directed by Simon Callow. After eight previews, the Broadway production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 324 performances. Ellen Burstyn replaced Collins later in the run. Loretta Swit starred in a US national tour in 1995.
From 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Meera Syal takes the lead role of Shirley in the production's first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory production will be at the Trafalgar Studios from 20 July - 30 October 2010. Meera Syal will reprise her role as Shirley. Like the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, the production will run in Repertory alongside Educating Rita starring Laura Dos Santon as Rita and Tim Pigott-Smith as Frank.
