H & Claire were a pop duo, consisting of former Steps members Claire Richards and Ian "H" Watkins. Following the release of the group's debut album, they were set to go back into the studio to record new material after Richards's wedding although that never materialized and the group later disbanded. In May 2011, the duo reunited with their original group Steps.

==Career==

Following the split of Steps on 26 December 2001, H & Claire formed the duo. The pair released their debut single "DJ" on WEA Records on 6 May 2002. The single debuted and peaked on the UK Singles Chart at #3, spending a week in the Top 10. 
Their second single, "Half A Heart" followed on 12 August 2002, peaking at #8. Their third and final single release was a double A-side of an original song entitled "All Out of Love" and a cover of the Disney song "Beauty and the Beast". The single was released in November 2002 and peaked at #10, spending 3 weeks on the UK Top 40. Their debut album, Another You Another Me, followed. However, it peaked at #58 in the UK Albums Chart, and WEA Records soon dropped the pair. 
When Richards took a break from singing, to plan her wedding, the duo never recorded together again, and dissolved in 2003.
