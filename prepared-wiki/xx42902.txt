The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is the First Minister for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, which was at certain points in its history a colony, dominion, and province. The province had a system of responsible government from 1855 to 1934, and again since 1949. Newfoundland became a British crown colony in 1855, in 1907 it became a dominion, and in 1949, it became a province and joined Canadian Confederation. Since then, the province has been a part of the Canadian federation and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters. The province was named Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=21 May 2013|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2230-e.html|date=2 May 2005|title=Newfoundland |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608210845/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2230-e.html  |archivedate = 8 June 2008[/tpl]
The province has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the Premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 12, 2008|url=http://www.assembly.nl.ca/pubinfo/history.htm|title=History of the House of Assembly |publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly [/tpl]
