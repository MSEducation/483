Ernest "Ernie" Banks (born January 31, 1931), nicknamed "Mr. Cub" and "Mr. Sunshine", is a retired American professional baseball player. He was a Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop and first baseman for 19 seasons,  1953 through 1971. He spent his entire MLB career with the Chicago Cubs. He was a National League (NL) All-Star for 11 seasons, playing in 14 All-Star Games.Sportsdata.Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game. "there were two games a year from 1959 to 1962"... "all players who were named to the AL or NL roster were credited with one appearance per season." Retrieved July 17, 2013.
Banks was born and raised in Dallas. He entered Negro league baseball in 1950, playing for the Kansas City Monarchs. He served in the military for two years and returned to the Monarchs before beginning his major league career in September 1953. He made his first MLB All-Star Game appearance in 1955. Banks had his best seasons in 1958 and 1959, when he received back-to-back National League Most Valuable Player awards. In 1958, he hit .313 and led the NL with 47 home runs (HR) and 129 runs batted in (RBI). In 1959,  he hit .304 with 45 HRs and led the NL with 143 RBIs.
During the 1961 season, Banks was transferred to left field followed by a final position change to first base. Cubs manager Leo Durocher became frustrated with Banks in the mid-1960s, saying that the slugger's performance was faltering, but he felt that he was unable to remove Banks from the lineup due to the star's popularity among Cubs fans. Banks was a player-coach from 1967 through 1971. In 1970, he hit his 500th career home run. In 1972, he joined the Cubs coaching staff after his retirement as a player.
Banks was active in the Chicago community during and after his tenure with the Cubs. He founded a charitable organization, became the first black Ford Motor Company dealer in the United States, and made an unsuccessful bid for a local political office. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. In 1999, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2013, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to sports. Banks lives in the Los Angeles area.

==Early life==

Banks was born in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931. He had eleven siblings, ten of them younger. His father who had worked in construction and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black semi-pro teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at the local five and dime store. He bribed Banks with nickels and dimes to play catch.[tpl]cite news|last=Down|first=Fred|title=Ernie Banks Enshrined in Hall of Fame|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSsmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Vv4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=748,562846&dq=ernie+banks+softball&hl=en|accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=The Afro-American|date=August 13, 1977[/tpl] Ernie's mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into a career as a minister.[tpl]cite news|title=Essie Banks, Mother Of Baseball Legend Ernie Banks, Dies At 97|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/12/essie-banks-mother-of-bas_n_174298.html|accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 12, 2009[/tpl]

In 1951, Banks was drafted into the US Army and served in Germany during the Korean War. He suffered a knee injury in basic training, but recovered after a few weeks of rest and therapy.Banks and Enright, p. 55.

In fact, when he was sold to the Chicago Cubs, Banks was reluctant to leave his Monarchs teammates.

==MLB career==

===Early career===

Banks signed with the Cubs on September 14, 1953. He made his major league debut at Wrigley Field on September 17 at age 22, and played in ten games. He became one of a handful of former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. He also was the first Cubs black player. In regard to Banks' view of race in baseball, authors Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that Banks "just was not the crusading type. He was so grateful to be playing baseball for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it. Banks was not about changing anyone's mind about the color of his skin; he was about baseball, pure and simple."[tpl]cite book|last=Moffi|first=Larry and Jonathan Kronstadt|title=Crossing the Line: Black Major Leaguers, 1947-1959|year=2006|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803283164|page=85|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jRHgMttlKDIC&pg=PA85&dq=ernie+banks&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sx8LUsXZKOjq2AX2x4GoCA&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=ernie%20banks&f=false[/tpl]
He received a visit from Jackie Robinson during that first game he played that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn."[tpl]cite news|last=Haugh|first=David|title=Presidential honor has Mr. Cub singing a happy tune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-13/sports/ct-spt-0813-haugh-column-20130813_1_ernie-banks-presidential-honor-cubs|accessdate=September 6, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 13, 2013[/tpl] "For years, I didn't talk and learned a lot about people." Over time when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that get caught once they open their mouths. "I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better", Banks said. (Chicago Tribune article, 2013)
In 1954, Banks' double play partner during his official rookie season was Gene Baker, the second Cubs black player. Banks and Baker roomed together on road trips and became the first all-black double-play combination in major league history.[tpl]cite web|last=Muskat|first=Carrie|title=Banks grew from early Baker influence|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120412&content_id=28506800&vkey=news_chc&c_id=chc|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=January 3, 2014[/tpl]  When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as "Bingo to Bango to Bilko".[tpl]cite web|last=Muskat|first=Carrie|title=Santo Tops Cubs Voices on Frick Ballot|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20061030&content_id=1727994&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc&affiliateId=CommentWidget|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second in Rookie of the Year voting. Banks became a participant in a trend toward much lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate's bat and liked how easy it was to generate bat speed.
In [tpl]By|1955[/tpl], Banks hit 44 home runs, had 117 RBIs, and batted .295. He played in his first of 14 All-Star Games that season.

Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated Press, reported on the eve of the 1960 World Series, that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton Willey, and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan, and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange for Banks from the Cubs.Braves reported making big pitch for Ernie Banks

===Move to first base===

In 1961, Banks began having problems with his knee while playing shortstop when moving to his left or right side. It was the same knee he had injured while in the army. After playing in 717 consecutive games, he pulled himself from the Cubs lineup for at least four games, ending his pursuit of the NL consecutive games played streak (895 games) set by Stan Musial.[tpl]cite news|title=Ernie Banks Favors Knee Over Record|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wLcxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YmwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6795,5682461&dq=ernie+banks+knee&hl=en|accessdate=August 14, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=June 24, 1961[/tpl] In May, the Cubs announced that Jerry Kindall would replace Banks at shortstop and that Banks would move to left field.Banks and Enright, p. 96. Banks later said, "Only a duck out of water could have shared my loneliness in left field."Banks and Enright, p. 129. Banks credited center fielder Richie Ashburn with helping him learn how to play left field; in 23 games he committed only one error. In June, he was moved to first base, learning that position from former first baseman and Cubs coach Charley Grimm.Banks and Enright, pp. 129-130.
The Cubs began playing under the College of Coaches in 1961, a system in which decisions were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager.Rogers, p. 43. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop, but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely.Rogers, p. 211. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious.[tpl]cite news|title=Ernie Banks Couldn't Avoid Ball That Caused Concussion|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19620527&id=V3ZPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GgUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4019,5115229|accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=May 27, 1962[/tpl] He sustained a concussion on Friday, was in the hospital for two nights, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.[tpl]cite news|last=Rogers|first=Phil|title=Ernie Banks: Mr. Cub turns 80|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-30/sports/ct-spt-0131-rogers-ernie-banks-cubs-c20110130_1_cubs-greatest-second-baseman-kansas-city-monarchs|accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 30, 2011[/tpl]

Despite Banks' struggles that season, the Cubs managed to have their first winning record since the 1940s. Banks, following his doctor's orders, skipped his usual off season participation in handball and basketball and began the 1964 season weighing seven pounds more than the previous year.

Leo Durocher was hired to be the Cubs manager in 1966. The Cubs hoped that Durocher could inspire renewed interest in the Chicago fan base.[tpl]cite web|title=Cubs Timeline|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/history/timeline08.jsp|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl] Banks hit only 15 home runs and the Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59-103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career.[tpl]cite web|last=Marlett|first=Jeffrey|title=Leo Durocher|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/35d925c7|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl] From the time that Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, the manager recalled that "he was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, there was not a thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. But I had to play him. Had to play the man or there would have been a revolution in the street."[tpl]cite book|last=Durocher|first=Leo and Ed Linn|title=Nice Guys Finish Last|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226173895|pages=365–366|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dzF30wd8kA0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=ernie+banks+durocher&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2mQbUoiIE4ij2QXhlICQBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=ernie%20banks&f=false[/tpl] Banks, on the other hand, said of Durocher, "I wish there had been someone around like him early in my career...

In Mr. Cub, a memoir published around the time that Banks retired, the slugger said that too much had been made of the racial implications in his relationship with Durocher and he summarized his thoughts on race relations:
[tpl]quotation | My philosophy about race relations is that I'm the man and I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black you will never be treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will... If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine.
