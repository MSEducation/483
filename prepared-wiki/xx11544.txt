Venice is a residential, commercial, and recreational beachfront neighborhood in the Westside district of the city of Los Angeles, California.
Venice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it was annexed by Los Angeles. Today, Venice is known for its canals, beaches and circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only promenade that features performers, fortune-tellers, artists, and vendors.

==History==

Venice, originally called "Venice of America," was founded by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney in 1905 as a beach resort town, [tpl]convert|14|mi|km[/tpl] west of Los Angeles. He and his partner Francis Ryan had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of Santa Monica in 1891. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to Santa Monica. After Ryan died, Kinney and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in 1904, Kinney, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like its namesake in Italy.[tpl]cite book|author1=Elayne Alexander|author2=Bryan L. Mercer|title=Venice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sSPkrmbplagC&|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 February 2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-6966-6[/tpl][tpl]rp|8[/tpl]
When Venice of America opened on July 4, 1905, Kinney had dug several miles of canals to drain the marshes for his residential area, built a [tpl]convert|1200|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl]-long pleasure pier with an auditorium, ship restaurant, and dance hall, constructed a hot salt-water plunge, and built a block-long arcaded business street with Venetian architecture. Tourists, mostly arriving on the "Red Cars" of the Pacific Electric Railway from Los Angeles and Santa Monica, then rode Venice's miniature railroad and gondolas to tour the town. But the biggest attraction was Venice's mile-long gently sloping beach. Cottages and housekeeping tents were available for rent.
The community seceded from Santa Monica in 1911.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] The population (3,119 residents in 1910) soon exceeded 10,000; the town drew 50,000 to 150,000 tourists on weekends.
Attractions on the Kinney Pier became more amusement-oriented by 1910, when a Venice Scenic Railway, Aquarium, Virginia Reel, Whip, Racing Derby, and other rides and game booths were added. Since the business district was allotted only three one-block-long streets, and the City Hall was more than a mile away, other competing business districts developed. Unfortunately, this created a fractious political climate. Kinney, however, governed with an iron hand and kept things in check. When he died in November 1920, Venice became harder to govern. With the amusement pier burning six weeks later in December 1920, and Prohibition (which had begun the previous January), the town's tax revenue was severely affected.
The Kinney family rebuilt their amusement pier quickly to compete with Ocean Park's Pickering Pleasure Pier and the new Sunset Pier. When it opened it had two roller coasters, a new Racing Derby, a Noah's Ark, a Mill Chutes, and many other rides. By 1925 with the addition of a third coaster, a tall Dragon Slide, Fun House, and Flying Circus aerial ride, it was the finest amusement pier on the West Coast. Several hundred thousand tourists visited on weekends. In 1923 Charles Lick built the Lick Pier at Navy Street in Venice, adjacent to the Ocean Park Pier at Pier Avenue in Ocean Park. Another pier was planned for Venice in 1925 at Leona Street (now Washington Street).
For the amusement of the public, Kinney hired aviators to do aerial stunts over the beach. One of them, movie aviator and Venice airport owner B. H. DeLay, implemented the first lighted airport in the United States on DeLay Field (previously known as Ince Field). He also initiated the first aerial police in the nation, after a marine rescue attempt was thwarted. DeLay also performed many of the world's first aerial stunts for motion pictures in Venice.
By 1925, Venice's politics had become unmanageable. Its roads, water and sewage systems badly needed repair and expansion to keep up with its growing population. When it was proposed that Venice be annexed to Los Angeles, the board of trustees voted to hold an election.  Annexation was approved in the election in November, 1925, and Venice was formally annexed to Los Angeles in 1926.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl]
Los Angeles had annexed the Disneyland of its day and proceeded to remake Venice in its own image. It was felt that the town needed more streets – not canals – and most of them were paved in 1929 after a three-year court battle led by canal residents. They wanted to close Venice's three amusement piers but had to wait until the first of the tidelands leases expired in 1946.
In 1929, oil was discovered south of Washington Street on the Venice Peninsula. Within two years, 450 oil wells covered the area, and drilling waste clogged the remaining waterways. It was a short-lived boom that provided needed income to the community, which suffered during the Great Depression. The wells produced oil into the 1970s.
Los Angeles had neglected Venice so long that, by the 1950s, it had become the "Slum by the Sea." With the exception of new police and fire stations in 1930, the city spent little on improvements after annexation. The city did not pave Trolleyway (Pacific Avenue) until 1954 when county and state funds became available. Low rents for run-down bungalows attracted predominantly European immigrants (including a substantial number of Holocaust survivors) and young counterculture artists, poets, and writers. The Beat Generation hung out at the Gas House on Ocean Front Walk and at Venice West Cafe on Dudley. Police raids were frequent during that era.

===Gang activity in Venice===

The Venice Shoreline Crips and the Latino Venice 13 (V-13) are the two main gangs active in Venice. V13 dates back to the 1950s, while the Shoreline Crips were founded in the early 1970s, making them one of the first Crip sets in Los Angeles.
In the early 1990s V-13 and the Shoreline Crips were involved in a bloody, brutal war over crack cocaine sales territories.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Los Angeles Coast as a Public Place|journal=Geographical Review|volume=95|number=4|date=October 2005|pages=578–593|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30034261[/tpl]
While violence has decreased, they continue to remain active in Venice. By 2002, numbers of gang members in Venice were reduced due to gentrification and increased police presence. According to a Los Angeles City Beat article, by 2003, many Los Angeles Westside gang members resettled in the city of Inglewood. Author John Brodie challenges the idea of gentrification causing change and commented "... the gunplay of the Shoreline Crips and the V-13 is as much a part of life in Venice as pit bulls playing with blond Labs at the local dog park."Venice in Magazines etc. Virtualvenice.info.

==Population==

The 2000 U.S. census counted 37,705 residents in the 3.17-square-mile Venice neighborhood—an average of 11,891 people per square mile, about the norm for Los Angeles; in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 40,885. The median age for residents was 35, considered the average for Los Angeles; the percentages of residents aged 19 through 49 were among the county's highest.
The neighborhood was moderately diverse ethnically, but had a high percentage of white people. The breakdown was whites, 64.2%; Latinos, 21.7%; blacks, 5.4%; Asians, 4.1%, and others, 4.6%.  Mexico (38.4%) and the United Kingdom (8.5%) were the most common places of birth for the 22.3% of the residents who were born abroad—considered a low figure for Los Angeles.
The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $67,647, a high figure for Los Angeles. The percentage of households earning $125,000 was considered high for the city. The average household size of 1.9 people was low for both the city and the county. Renters occupied 68.8% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 31.2%. Property values have been increasing lately due to the presence of technology companies such as Google Inc., which in 2011 began leasing 100,000 square feet of space in Venice.Donna Kardos Yesalavich (April 1, 2014), Cut!

==Geography==

===Description===

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Venice is adjoined on the northwest  by Santa Monica,  on the northeast by Mar Vista, on the southeast by Culver City, Del Rey and Marina Del Rey, on the south by Ballona Creek and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/region/westside/ "Westside," Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times
Venice is bounded on the northwest by the Santa Monica city line. The northern apex of the Venice neighborhood is at Walgrove Avenue and Rose Avenue abutting the Santa Monica Airport. On the east the boundary runs north-south on Walgrove Avenue to the neighborhood's eastern apex at Zanja Street, thus including the Penmar Golf Course but excluding Venice High School. The boundary runs on Lincoln Boulevard to Admiralty Way, excluding all of Marina del Rey, south to Ballona Creek."Venice," Mapping L.A., Los Angeles TimesThe Thomas Guide: Los Angeles County, 2004, pages 671, 672 and 702

===Attractions and neighborhoods===

====Venice Canal Historic District====

====Abbot Kinney Boulevard====

Abbott Kinney Boulevard is a principal attraction, with stores, restaurants, bars and art galleries lining the street. The street was described as "a derelict strip of rundown beach cottages and empty brick industrial buildings called West Washington Boulevard,"Janelle Brown (November 20, 2005), Venice, Calif., Is Turning Into Sunrise Boulevard New York Times and in the late 1980s community groups and property owners pushed for renaming a portion of the street to honor Abbot Kinney.Nancy Hill-Holtzman (August 10, 1989), Plan for Kinney Boulevard in Venice Runs Into Pothole Los Angeles Times.Nancy Hill-Holtzman (February 25, 1990), Part of Washington Blvd. to Be Renamed Los Angeles Times. The renaming was widely considered as a marketing strategy to commercialize the area and bring new high-end businesses to the area.Departures: Venice - Chapter 5: Abbot Kinney Boulevard KCET.

====Venice Farmers Market====

Founded in 1987, the Farmers Market operates every Friday from 7 to 11 a.m. on Venice Boulevard at Venice Way.

====72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill====

72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill was one of several historical footnotes associated with Market Street in Venice, one of the first streets designated for commerce when the city was founded in 1905. During the depression era, Upton Sinclair had an office there when he was running for governor, and the same historic building where the restaurant was located was also the site of the first Ace/Venice Gallery in the early 1970s[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/2003-10-16/news/the-ace-is-wild/3/ | title=The Ace is Wild: The Doug Chrismas story | publisher=LA Weekly | date=October 9, 2003 | accessdate=January 26, 2012 | author=McKenna, Kristine[/tpl] and, before that, the studio of American installation artist Robert Irwin.

====Post office====

The former Venice Post Office, a red-tile-roofed 1939 Works Progress Administration building designed by Louis A. SimonVenice Post Office Los Angeles Conservancy Retrieved 24 April 2014 on Windward Circle, has been another fixture in Venice.

====Residences and streets====

Many of Venice's houses have their principal entries from pedestrian-only streets and have house numbers on these footpaths. (Automobile access is by alleys in the rear.) The inland walk streets are made up primarily of around 620 single-family homes.Leah Ziskin (August 12, 2007), It's purely pedestrian Los Angeles Times. Like much of the rest of Los Angeles, however, Venice is known for traffic congestion. It lies [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] away from the nearest freeway, and its unusually dense network of narrow streets was not planned for modern traffic. Mindful of the tourist nature of much of the district's vehicle traffic, its residents have successfully fought numerous attempts to extend the Marina Freeway (SR 90) into southern Venice.

====Venice Beach====

Venice Beach, which receives millions of visitors a year, has been labeled as "a cultural hub known for its eccentricities" as well as a "global tourist destination."Ari Bloomekatz and Abby Sewell, "Car Plows Through Crowd on Venice Boardwalk, Killing One," Los Angeles Times, August 3, 2013David Zahniser and Matt Stevens, "L.A. City Council Calls for Boardwalk Barriers in Venice," Los Angeles Times, August 6, 2013 It includes the promenade that runs parallel to the beach ("Ocean Front Walk" or just "the boardwalk"), Muscle Beach, the handball courts, the paddle tennis courts, Skate Dancing plaza, the numerous beach volleyball courts, the bike trail and the businesses on Ocean Front Walk.
The basketball courts in Venice are renowned across the country for their high level of streetball; numerous professional basketball players developed their games or have been recruited on these courts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.courtsoftheworld.com/courts/184:United-States/12:Los-Angeles-CA/1:Venice-Beach |title=Court profile of Venice Beach basketball court |publisher=courtsoftheworld.com[/tpl]

The suspect, 38-year-old Nathan Campbell, was arrested two hours later after turning himself in at a police station. He was charged with murder, 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 17 counts of hit-and-run.[tpl]cite news|title=Driver charged with murder in L.A. boardwalk rampage|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/06/venice-beach-boardwalk-driver-pedestrians-murder/2625805/|accessdate=August 10, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 6, 2013|author=[/tpl]

====Fishing pier====

Along the southern portion of the beach, at the end of Washington Boulevard, is the 'Venice Fishing Pier'. A [tpl]convert|1310|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] concrete structure, it first opened in 1964, was closed in 1983 due to El Niño storm damage, and re-opened in the mid-1990s. On December 21, 2005, the pier again suffered damage when waves from a large northern swell caused part of it to fall into the ocean.
The pier remained closed until May 25, 2006, when it was re-opened after an engineering study concluded that it was structurally sound.

====Breakwater====

The Venice Breakwater is an acclaimed local surf spot in Venice. It is located north of the Venice Pier and lifeguard headquarters and south of the Santa Monica Pier. This spot is sheltered on the north by an artificial barrier, the breakwater, consisting of an extending sand bar, piping, and large rocks at its end.
In late 2010, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors conducted a $1.6 million replacement of 30,000 cubic yards of sand at Venice Beach eroded by rainstorms in recent years. Although Venice Beach is located in the city of Los Angeles, the county is responsible for maintaining the beach under an agreement reached between the two governments in 1975.Rong-Gong Lin II (October 12, 2010), $1.6-million county project approved to replace sand on Venice Beach Los Angeles Times.

====Oakwood====

The Oakwood portion of Venice, also known as "Ghost Town" and the "Oakwood Pentagon," lies inland from the tourist areas and is one of the few historically African American areas in West Los Angeles; Latinos now constitute the overwhelming majority of the residents. During the age of restrictive covenants that enforced racial segregation, Oakwood was set aside as a settlement area for Black-Americans, who came by the hundreds to Venice to work in the oil fields during the 1930s and 1940s. After the construction of the San Diego Freeway, which passed through predominantly Mexican American and immigrant communities, those groups moved further west and into Oakwood where black residents were already established. White-Americans moved into Oakwood during the 1980s and 1990's and Latinos moved out.[tpl]cite news | author = Stevens, Matt | title = Venice's new bloom | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2012-12-11 | pages = A1, A15 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-rose-avenue-20121211,0,94377,full.story | accessdate = 2012-12-12 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6CqGhnyVE | archivedate = 2012-12-12[/tpl]
By the end of the 20th century, gentrification had altered Oakwood. Although still a primarily Latino and African-American neighborhood, the neighborhood is in flux. According to Los Angeles City Beat,http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=362&IssueNum=22 "In Venice, the transformation is... obvious. Homes are fetching sometimes more than $1 million, and homies are being displaced every day." In 2012, an article in the Los Angeles Times predicted that the wine shops, cafes, restaurants and other businesses opening on Rose Avenue — adjacent to Oakwood — would soon lead to the other streets of Venice being transformed into upmarket areas.  Xinachtli, a Latino student group from Venice High School and subset of MEChA, refers to Oakwood as one of last beachside communities of color in California. Chicanos, Hispanics, and Latinos of any race or ethnicity make up over 50% of Venice High School's student body.http://www.sioc.ucla.edu/main.asp?nav=projects&nav=XINACHTLI

====East Venice====

East Venice is a racially and ethnically mixed residential neighborhood of Venice that is separated from Oakwood and Milwood (the area south of Oakwood) by Lincoln Boulevard, extending east to the border with the Mar Vista neighborhood, near Venice High School and Santa Monica Municipal Airport. Aside from the commercial strip on Lincoln (including the Venice Boys and Girls Club and the Venice United Methodist Church), the area almost entirely consists of small homes and apartments as well as Penmar Park and (bordering Santa Monica) Penmar Golf Course. The existing population (primarily composed of Caucasians, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians, with small numbers of other groups) is being supplemented by new arrivals who have moved in with gentrification.
A housing project, Lincoln Place Apartment Homes, built by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles is currently undergoing a $140 million renovation to add 99 new market-rate apartment homes and to update the remaining 696 existing homes. A new pool, two-story fitness center, resident park and sustainable landscaping are being added.http://www.multifamilybiz.com/News/4412/Aimco_Officials_Break_Ground_on_the_140_Million_Re... multifamilybiz.com Aimco, which acquired the property in 2003, had previously been in a legal battle to determine whether or not Lincoln Place could be demolished and rebuilt. In 2010, Aimco settled with tenants and agreed to reopen the project and return scores of evicted residents to their homes and add hundreds of units to the Venice area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/26/local/la-me-0526-lincoln-place-20100526|title=Los Angeles, developer reach deal to preserve Venice's landmark Lincoln Place apartments|author=Martha Groves|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 14, 2014[/tpl]

==Creative works==

Venice has always been known as a hangout for the creative and the artistic. In the 1950s and 1960's, Venice became a center for the Beat generation. There was an explosion of poetry and art. Major participants included Stuart Perkoff, John Thomas, Frank T. Rios, Tony Scibella, Lawrence Lipton, John Haag, Saul White, Robert Farrington, Philomene Long, and Tom Sewell.[tpl]cite book | title = Venice West: The Beat Generation in Southern California | author = Maynard, John Arthur | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8135-1965-9 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aGOVgiSR7oEC[/tpl]

Chainsaw jugglers,acrobats and comics like Michael Colyar could be seen on a daily basis. Many performers like the Jim Rose Circus got their start on the boardwalk.

===Music===

Venice was where legendary rock band The Doors were formed in 1965 by UCLA alums and Venice bohemians Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison. The Doors would go on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are considered one of the greatest rock groups of all time, with Morrison being considered one of the greatest rock frontmen. Venice would also be the birthplace of another legendary rock band in the 1980's in Jane's Addiction. Perry Farrell, frontman and founder of the Lollapalooza, was a longtime Venice resident until 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://welovenice.com/2011/04/07/venice-native-perry-farrel-janes-addiction-are-back-free-download-off-their-new-album-due-out-in-august/|title= Venice native, Perry Farrel & Jane’s Addiction are back [tpl]![/tpl] FREE Download off their new album due out in August|publisher=WE LOVENICE|accessdate=March 12, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/26/home/la-hm-hotprop-farrell-20100526|title= Alt-rocker Perry Farrell breaks his Venice addiction|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 26, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2014[/tpl]
