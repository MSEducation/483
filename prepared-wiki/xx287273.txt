The San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike is native to San Clemente Island, a small island off the coast of California, United States.  The island is owned by the United States Navy, which uses the island for target practice.  The shrike nests in the center of the Navy's bombing range, nicknamed the "boom box."[tpl]cite news|title=Home on the bombing range: Rare birds and flora stage comeback on island where U.S. Navy does constant explosives drills|author=Jule Watson|date=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.theprovince.com/technology/environment/Home+bombing+range+Rare+birds+flora+stage+comeback/8774100/story.html|agency=AP|work=The Province|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] According to Navy biologist Melissa Booker "the shrike seems to be unaffected by the loud noises bombs."[tpl]cite news|title=Rare songbird fights back from brink of extinction and found to be thriving in habitat used by Navy for bomb practice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2389751/Endangered-bird-San-Clemente-Island-loggerhead-shrike-thriving-US-Navy-firing-range.html|work=Daily Mail|author=Stuart Woledge|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl]

==Environmental status==

Since the 1880s, the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike's habitat has been threatened by domestic animals, primarily goats, imported to San Clemente Island. By the early 1900s, the bird's population had declined to about 20, but stabilized. The Navy began removing introduced species in 1973.[tpl]cite web|title=San Clemente loggerhead shrike|publisher=Center for Biological Diversity|url=https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/esa_works/profile_pages/SanClementeLoggerheadShrike.html|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]  In 1977, the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike was listed as endangered by the United States government, with an estimated population of 50.  Between 1982 and 1999, the bird's population was measured between 14 and 33 birds, bottoming out in January 1998.  The removal of introduced species was completed in 1993.
In 1996, the Institute for Wildlife Studies conducted video research on the shrike for the Navy.  In 1997, they were asked to come up with a strategy to raise the bird's numbers.[tpl]cite web|title=San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike|publisher=Institute for Wildlife Studies|url=http://www.iws.org/species_loggerhead_shrike.html|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]  A $3 million per year breeding program was launched in 1999 and new policies were instituted to help the shrike.  For example, snipers must aim around bird nests when practicing. Thanks to the program, the bird's population reached 135 (captive and wild) specimens by 2004.  In 2013, an estimated 70 breeding pairs were alive in the wild.
