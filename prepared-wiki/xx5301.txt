The Jewish Defense League (JDL) is a Jewish far-right religious-political militant organization whose stated goal is to "protect Jews from antisemitism by whatever means necessary".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp|title=Anti-Defamation League on JDL|publisher=Adl.org|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl] While the group asserts that it "unequivocally condemns terrorism" and states that it has a "strict no-tolerance policy against terrorism and other felonious acts",[tpl]cite web|url=http://jdl.org/index.php/ideology-advocacy/anti-terrorism-racism/|title=Anti-Terrorism & Anti-Racism | Jewish Defense League|publisher=Jdl.org|date=2009-07-30|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl][tpl]dl|date=May 2013[/tpl] it was classified as "a right-wing terrorist group" by the FBI in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror/terrorism-2000-2001/?searchterm=JDL|title=FBI — Terrorism 2000/2001|publisher=Fbi.gov|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]SPLCenter.org: Anti-Arab Terrorism According to the FBI, the JDL has been involved in plotting and executing acts of terrorism within the United States.
Founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City in 1968, JDL's self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of antisemitism.JDL group profile from National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] Its criticism of the Soviet Union garnered support for the group, transforming it from a "vigilante club" into an organization with stated membership numbering over 15,000 at one point.[tpl]cite book|title=Understanding Terrorism in America: From the Klan to Al Qaeda|first=Christopher|last=Hewitt|pages=35f|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-27765-5[/tpl] The group took to bombing Arab and Soviet properties in the United States,Hewitt, p. 65 and targeting various alleged "enemies of the Jewish people", ranging from Arab-American political activists to neo-Nazis, for assassination.Nasseph McCarus, Ernest.

The Achille Lauro Hijacking. 2004, pp. 176–7 and the group's founder, Meir Kahane, "preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism, violence and political extremism," attitudes that were replicated by Irv Rubin, the successor to Kahane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/extremism_72/4016_72.asp|title=ADL Commends FBI for Thwarting Alleged Bombing Plot By Jewish Extremists|publisher=Adl.org|date=December 12, 2001|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl] In 2002, the Southern Poverty Law Center added the Jewish Defense League to its list of watched hate groups for the JDL's "long history of bombing, assaulting and threatening its perceived enemies" such as "the Soviet Union, neo-Nazi activists, Palestinian leaders, prominent black Americans and even Jewish moderates" as well as other Jewish radicals, and stated that the JDL "claims to have 13,000 members, but apparently has a few dozen at best."
In 1994, the JDL's sister movements Kach and Kahane Chai were both outlawed in Israel as terrorist organizations posing a threat to state security.

===Schism===

After Rubin's death in prison in November 2002, Bill Maniaci was appointed interim chairman by Shelley Rubin. Two years later, the Jewish Defense League became mired in a state of upheaval over legal control of the organization. In October 2004, Maniaci rejected Shelley Rubin's call for him to resign; as a result, Maniaci was stripped of his title and membership. At that point, the JDL split into two separate factions, each vying for legal control of the associated "intellectual property." The two operated as separate organizations with the same name while a lengthy legal battle ensued.The Jewish Defense League has split into feuding factions from CultNews.com (written by Rick Ross) In April 2005, the original domain name of the organization, jdl.org, was suspended by Network Solutions due to allegation of infringement; the organization went back online soon thereafter at domain name jewishdefenseleague.org. In April 2006, news of a settlement was announced in which signatories agreed to not object to "Shelley Rubin's titles of permanent chairman and CEO of JDL."jewishdefenseleague.org[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] The agreement also confirmed that "the name 'Jewish Defense League,' the acronym 'JDL,' and the 'Fist and Star' logo are the exclusive intellectual property of JDL." (Opponents of both groups claim that these are Kahanist symbols and not the exclusive property of JDL. At this time, however, the logo is no longer in general use by the Kahanist groups.) The agreement also states: "Domain names registered on behalf of JDL, including but not limited to jdl.org and jewishdefenseleague.org, are owned and operated by JDL." Meanwhile, the opposing group formed B'nai Elim,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bnaielim.org/ |title=Bnai Elim official website |publisher=Bnaielim.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] which is the latest of many JDL splinter groups to have formed over the years (previous splinter groups included the Jewish Direct Action and the United Jewish Underground that have been active during the 1980s).

===Principles===

The JDL upholds five fundamental principles, which as of July 2007 were listed on its website as:
The JDL encourages, per its principle of the "Love of Jewry", that "...In the end...the Jew can look to no one but another Jew for help and that the true solution to the Jewish problem is the liquidation of the Exile and the return of all Jews to Eretz Yisroel – the land of Israel."The Five Principles of the Jewish Defense League[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] The JDL elaborates on this fundamental principle by insisting upon an "immediate need to place Judaism over any other 'ism' and ideology and...use of the yardstick: 'Is it good for Jews?'" The JDL argues that, outside of Jews, there are historically no people corresponding to the Palestinian ethnicity. Writing on its official website, the JDL claims: "The first mention of a "Palestinian people" dates from the aftermath of the 1967 war, when the local Arabic-speaking communities ... were retrospectively endowed with a contrived "nationhood" ... taken from Jewish history ..." and that "Clearly, since Roman times "Palestinian" had meant Jews until the Arab's recent adoption of this identity in order to claim it as their land."Israel Today & Always: Palestine or Eretz Yisrael - To Whom Does It Belong?[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] On this basis, the JDL argues that "Zionism be under no obligation to accommodate a separate "Palestinian" claim, there being no historical evidence or witness for any such Arab category," and considers Palestinian claims to be "Arab usurpation" of proper Jewish title.

==Terrorism and other illegal activities==

===In the U.S.===

In 2004 congressional testimony, John S. Pistole, Executive Assistant Director for Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described the JDL as "a known violent extremist Jewish organization."Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] FBI statistics show that, from 1980 through 1985, there were 18 officially classified terrorist attacks in the U.S. committed by Jews; 15 of those by members of the JDL. According to the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0799/9907081.html|title=Middle East History: Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America|publisher=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
 In a 1986 study of domestic terrorism, the Department of Energy concluded: "For more than a decade, the Jewish Defense League (JDL) has been one of the most active terrorist groups in the United States. ... Since 1968, JDL operations have killed 7 persons and wounded at least 22. Thirty-nine percent of the targets were connected with the Soviet Union; 9 percent were Palestinian; 8 percent were Lebanese; 6 percent, Egyptian; 4 percent, French, Iranian, and Iraqi; 1 percent, Polish and German; and 23 percent were not connected with any states. Sixty-two percent of all JDL actions are directed against property; 30 percent against businesses; 4 percent against academics and academic institutions; and 2 percent against religious targets." (Department of Energy, Terrorism in the United States and the Potential Threat to Nuclear Facilities, R-3351-DOE, January 1986, pp. 11–16) 
In its report, Terrorism 2000/2001, the FBI referred to the JDL as a "violent extremist Jewish organization" and stated that the FBI was responsible for thwarting at least one of its terrorist acts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror |title=Terrorism 2000/2001 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] The National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism states that, during the JDL's first two decades of activity, it was an "active terrorist organization." The JDL was specifically referenced by the FBI's Executive Assistant Director Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, John S. Pistole, in his formal report before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States.
Initially, the League was connected to a series of violent attacks against the Soviet Union's interests in the United States, protesting that country's repression of Soviet Jews, who were often jailed and refused exit visas.[tpl]cite book|title=The Achille Lauro Hijacking: Lessons in the Politics and Prejudice of Terrorism|first=Michael K.|last=Bohn|page=67|year=2004|publisher=Brassey's Inc.|isbn=1-57488-779-3[/tpl] The JDL decided that violence was necessary to draw attention to their plight, reasoning that Moscow would respond to the strain on Soviet–United States relations by allowing more emigration to Israel. In 1970, according to Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, agents of the Soviet KGB forged and sent threatening letters to Arab missions claiming to be from the JDL to discredit it. They also were ordered to bomb a target in the "Negro section of New York" and blame it on the JDL.Christopher Andrew, Vasili Mitrokhin, The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, Basic Books, 2005, 237–238 ISBN 0-465-00311-7 One bomb attack, on January 8, 1971, outside of the Soviet cultural center in Washington, D.C., was followed by a phone call, including the JDL slogan "Never again"; a JDL spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the bombing, but refused to condemn it. In 1972, two JDL members were arrested and convicted of bomb possession and burglary in an attempt to blow up the Long Island residence of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. In 1972, a smoke bomb was planted in the Manhattan office of music impresario Sol Hurok, who organized Soviet performers' U.S. tours. Iris Kones, a Jewish secretary from Long Island, died of smoke inhalation, and Hurok and 12 others were injured and hospitalized.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/131489/when-violence-overcame-a-freedom-struggle/ |title='When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone' by Gal Beckerman Tells of Meir Kahane’s Tumultuous Reign Over the Soviet Jewry Movement – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] Jerome Zeller of the JDL was indicted for the bombing and in 1992 Kahane admitted his part in the attack. JDL activities were condemned by Moscow refuseniks who felt that the group's actions were making it less likely that the Soviet Union would relax restrictions on Jewish emigration. On April 6, 1976, six prominent refuseniks – including Alexander Lerner, Anatoly Shcharansky, and Iosif Begun – condemned the JDL's anti-Soviet activities as terrorist acts, stating that their "actions constitute a danger for Soviet Jews ... as they might be used by the Soviet authorities as a pretext for new repressions and for instigating anti-Semitic hostilities." During the 1980s, past-JDL member Victor Vancier (who later founded the Jewish Task Force), and two other former JDL members were arrested in connection with six incidents: a 1984 firebombing of an automobile at a Soviet diplomatic residence, the 1985 and 1986 pipe bombings of rival JDL members' cars, the 1986 firebombing at a hall where the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra was performing, and two 1986 detonations of tear gas grenades to protest performances by Soviet dance troupes. In a 1984 interview, the JDL leader Meir Kahane admitted that the JDL "bombed the Russian mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here Washington in 1971, the Soviet trade offices."Harvey W. Kushner, Encyclopedia of Terrorism, SAGE, 2003, 192–193.

The attacks, which caused minor diplomatic crisis in relations between the U.S. and the USSR, prompted the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to infiltrate the group and one udercover officer discovered a chain of weapon caches across Brooklyn, containing "enough shotguns and rifles to arm a small militia." In 1975, JDL leader Meir Kahane was accused of conspiracy to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. A hearing was held to revoke Kahane's probation for a 1971 incendiary device-making incident. He was found guilty of violating probation and served a one year prison sentence. On December 31, 1975, 15 members of the League seized the office of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in protest for Pope Paul VI's policy of support of Palestinian rights. The incident was over after one hour, as the activists left the place after being ordered to do so by the local police, and no arrests were made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=165744&dt=2082&dl=1345|title=Report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan about the incident|date=|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl] On October 26, 1981, after two firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at Rockefeller Center, JDL Chairman Meir Kahane said at a press conference: "I'm not going to say that the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I'm not going to say I mourn for it either." The next day, after an anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, "we support the act." JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites. On March 16, 1978, Irv Rubin, chairman of the JDL, said about the planned American Nazi Party march in Skokie, Illinois: "We are offering $500, that I have in my hand, to any member of the community ... who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi party." Rubin was charged with solicitation of murder but was acquitted in 1981."JDL's new leader was born in Montreal" Montreal Gazette, August 20, 1985, D10.
On October 11, 1985, Alex Odeh, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), was killed in a mail bombing at his office in Santa Ana, California. Shortly before his killing, Odeh had appeared on the television show Nightline, where he engaged in a tense dialogue with a representative from the Jewish Defense League.Juergensmeyer, Mark. Terror in the mind of God. 2003, page 56 Irv Rubin immediately made several controversial public statements in reaction to the incident: "I have no tears for Mr. Odeh. He got exactly what he deserved. ... My tears were used up crying for Leon Klinghoffer." The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both condemned the murder. Four weeks after Odeh's death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. Rubin denied JDL involvement: "What the FBI is doing is simple. ... Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase Never Again ... and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That's tragic." In 1987, Floyd Clarke, then assistant director of the FBI, wrote in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in the West Bank urban settlement of Kiryat Arba. In 1988, the FBI arrested Rochelle Manning as a suspect in the bombing, and also charged her husband, Robert Steven Manning, whom they considered a prime suspect in the attack; both were members of the JDL. Rochelle's jury deadlocked, and after the mistrial, she left for Israel to join her husband. Robert Manning was extradited from Israel to the U.S. in 1993. He was subsequently found guilty of involvement in the killing of the secretary of computer firm ProWest, Patricia Wilkerson, in another, unrelated mail bomb blast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1186/jdl-member-gets-life-term-in-bombing/ |title=JDL member gets life term in bombing | j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=1995-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-15/local/me-46008_1_bombing-death|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Ex-JDL Activist Found Guilty in Bombing Death|first=Eric|last=Malnic|date=October 15, 1993|accessdate=May 2, 2010[/tpl] In addition, he and other JDL members were also suspected in a string of other violent attacks through 1985, including the bombing of Boston ADC office that seriously injured two police officers, the bomb killing of suspected Nazi war criminal Tscherim Soobzokov in Paterson, New Jersey, and a bombing in Long Island that maimed a passerby. William Ross, another JDL member, was also found guilty for his participation in the bombing that killed Wilkerson. Rochelle Manning was re-indicted for her alleged involvement, and was detained in Israel, pending extradition, when she died of a heart attack in 1994.
When Ruthless Records recording artist and former N.W.A member Dr. Dre sought to work instead with Death Row Records, Ruthless Records executives, Mike Klein and Jerry Heller were fearful of possible physical intimidation from Death Row Entertainment executives including chief executive officer Suge Knight and requested security assistance from the violent JDL.JDL: The FBI Screws Up Again[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] The FBI launched a money laundering investigation, on the presumption that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records and several rap artists, including Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Tupac%20Shakur%20/Tupac%20Shakur%20Part%201%20of%201/view|title=Unsealed FBI Report on Tupac Shakur|publisher=Vault.fbi.gov|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09[/tpl] Heller has speculated that the FBI did not investigate these threats because of the song "Fuck Tha Police".

On February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli member of the JDL, opened fire on Muslims kneeling in prayer at the revered Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 worshippers and injuring 125 before he run out of ammunition and was himself killed. The attack set off riots and protests throughout the West Bank and 19 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli Defense Forces within 48 hours of the massacre. On its website, the JDL described the massacre as a "preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews" and noted that they "do not consider his assault to qualify under the label of terrorism". Furthermore, they noted that "we teach that violence is never a good solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism's protracted struggle against Arab terrorism. And we are not ashamed to say that Goldstein was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jdl.org/index.php/about-jdl/faqs/|title=FAQs | Jewish Defense League|publisher=Jdl.org|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jdl.org/index.php/about-jdl/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=JDL|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]BBC NEWS "Goldstein had been a member of the Jewish Defense League." In a similar attack nearly twelve years earlier, on April 11, 1982, an American-born JDL member and immigrant to Israel, Allan H. Goodman, opened fire with his military-issue rifle at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian Arab and injuring four others. The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.Israel releases Baltimorean who killed at mosque Goodman received life term in attack at Jerusalem shrine
