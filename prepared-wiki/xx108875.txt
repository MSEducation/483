The area was peopled primarily by settlers of Eastern European origin. The town was home to Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and his first wife Edna Brower. Diefenbaker opened his first law office in Wakaw from 1919 to 1925.
Wakaw was founded on December 26, 1911 after 21 residents petitioned the Department of Municipal Affairs, asking for the incorporation of the Village of Wakaw. It was located on Section 30, Township 42, Range 26, West of the 2nd Meridian. When the railroad was built the town was moved to its present location. On August 1, 1953 Wakaw was incorporated as a town. 
The community will recognize its 100th anniversary by holding Centennial Celebrations on July 21 to 31, 2011.Wakaw Recorder
