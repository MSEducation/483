[[First playable demo]]

CATEGORIES: Video game development, Video game design

A first playable demo is the first version of a video game that is playable outside of the video game development environment.  In the game design process, it is a significant milestone.  It is the first point at which a game has demonstrable gameplay.  Often at this phase, the demo will be shown to others outside the department that developed it.  It serves as a proof of concept or pilot.[tpl]cite book|title=Distributed Game Development: Harnessing Global Talent to Create Winning Games|last=Fields|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Fields|year=2010|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-81271-9|page=20|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=fXh6wyFiy90C&pg=PA20&dq=%22First+playable+demo%22&hl=en&ei=KFSPTMHwIMb_lgelseUr&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22First%20playable%20demo%22&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Serious games: games that educate, train and inform |first=David R. |last=Michael |first2=Sande |last2=Chen |year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|isbn=1-59200-622-1|page=267|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=49kTAQAAIAAJ&q=%22First+playable+demo%22&dq=%22First+playable+demo%22&hl=en&ei=KFSPTMHwIMb_lgelseUr&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The art of producing games |first=David |last=McCarthy |first2=Ste |last2=Curran |first3=Simon |last3=Byron |year=2005|publisher=Thomson|location=University of Michigan|isbn=1-59200-611-6|page=51|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=CKZQAAAAMAAJ&q=%22First+playable+demo%22&dq=%22First+playable+demo%22&hl=en&ei=KFSPTMHwIMb_lgelseUr&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw[/tpl]
For video games, this is a difficult step to reach.  Often the graphics will only be partially implemented, and major bugs may still be evident.
For a card game, the first playable demo is effectively its own game.  For a board game, the first playable demo may include many hastily scribbled together chits, pieces of paper, and some ad-hoc pieces.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
