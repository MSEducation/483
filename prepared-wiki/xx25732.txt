The Alexandria Aces were a United League Baseball team based in Alexandria, Louisiana, in the United States. The Aces were league champions of the professional Continental Baseball League, in 2009, but when the CBL moved its market to West Texas, the Aces found a better fit in the Texas Collegiate League. The decision to join the new league was announced on February 12, 2010. They returned to United League Baseball for 2013.
From the 1994 season to the present, the Aces have played their home games at historic Bringhurst Field, which was built in 1933 for the original Alexandria Aces.
Slightly past the halfway mark of the 2013 season, the United League cancelled the remaining games for the Aces. According to league CEO John O'Bryant, the league could not justify spending at least $100,000 for the remainder of the season to bring teams to Alexandria when average attendance had been fewer than two hundred per game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130722/SPORTS/307200026/Tompkins-Pro-baseball-s-demise-triggers-Aces-nostalgia|title=Bob Tompkins, "Tompkins: Pro baseball's demise triggers Aces nostalgia"|publisher=Alexandria Daily Town Talk|accessdate=July 22, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

That team started in 1934 as a member of the old Evangeline League and ceased operations with the league in 1942 due to World War II. The Aces (and the league) were revived after the war but once again ceased operations in 1957.
Baseball returned to Alexandria again in 1972, with the Aces as the San Diego Padres' AA farm club, and while it only lasted four years, many major league notables passed through Alexandria - in particular All-Star pitcher Randy Jones and longtime Cleveland Indians first baseman John Grubb. The late Duke Snider also managed the team during this period.
The new Aces were a charter member of the independent Texas-Louisiana League in 1994, and the Aces won back-to-back titles in [tpl]by|1997[/tpl] and [tpl]by|1998[/tpl] before the league changed its name to the Central Baseball League. In the first season of the new United League in 2006, the Aces won the inaugural ULB championship before pulling off another repeat as they would win the title once again in 2007. In 2009 the Aces joined the Continental Baseball League when the ULB went bankrupt. The Aces are the 2009 CBL Champions, beating the Big Bend Cowboys 2-0. In 2010, the Aces ended their contract with the CBL, citing travel costs among other reasons before joining the college wooden bat league they currently play in now, the Texas Collegiate League.
On March 12, 2011 the front office announced that there would be a change to the team's logo for the first time since the team returned in 1994.
