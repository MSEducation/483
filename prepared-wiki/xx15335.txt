Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger disorder (AD) or simply Asperger's, is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical (peculiar, odd) use of language are frequently reported.
The syndrome is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who, in 1944, studied and described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication skills, demonstrated limited empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981[tpl]cite journal |author=Klin A, Pauls D, Schultz R, Volkmar F |title=Three diagnostic approaches to Asperger syndrome: Implications for research |journal=J of Autism and Dev Dis |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=221–34 |year=2005 |pmid=15909408 |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2001-y[/tpl] and went through a period of popularization,[tpl]cite book |title= Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism? |editors= Schopler E, Mesibov GB, Kunce LJ |publisher= Plenum press |location= New York |year=1998 |chapter= The history of Asperger syndrome |author= Wing L |pages=11–25 |isbn= 0-306-45746-6 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=jz_xbeWgG9AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Asperger+syndrome+or+high-functioning+autism#v=onepage&q=Asperger%20syndrome%20or%20high-functioning%20autism%3F&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Asperger's Syndrome: A Comparison of Clinical Diagnoses and Those Made According to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV |journal=J of Autism and Dev Disord. |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=235–240 |year=2005 |pmid= 15909409 |author=Woodbury-Smith M, Klin A, Volkmar F |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2002-x [/tpl] becoming standardized as a diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions remain about aspects of the disorder. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA); partly because of this, its prevalence is not firmly established. The diagnosis of Asperger's was eliminated in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and replaced by a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on a severity scale.
The exact cause is unknown. Although research suggests the likelihood of a genetic basis, there is no known genetic cause[tpl]cite book |chapter=Etiology and prevalence |year=2006 |publisher= Elsevier Science |title= Early intervention for autism spectrum disorders: a critical analysis |page= 33 |isbn= 0-08-044675-2 |location= Amsterdam |url= http://books.google.com/?id=XonQy12xCgEC&pg=PP2&dq=Early+intervention+for+autism+spectrum+disorders:+a+critical+analysis#v=onepage&q=Early%20intervention%20for%20autism%20spectrum%20disorders%3A%20a%20critical%20analysis&f=false |author= Matson JL, Minshawi NF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Klauck SM |title= Genetics of autism spectrum disorder |journal= European Journal of Human Genetics |year=2006 |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=714–720 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201610 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v14/n6/pdf/5201610a.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] and brain imaging techniques have not identified a clear common pathology. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Intervention is aimed at improving symptoms and function. The mainstay of management is behavioral therapy, focusing on specific deficits to address poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Most children improve as they mature to adulthood, but social and communication difficulties may persist. Some researchers and people with Asperger's have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that it is a difference, rather than a disability that must be treated or cured.

==Classification==

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger syndrome (AS) as one of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.[tpl]cite book |chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |accessdate=25 June 2007 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition= 10th (ICD-10) |author= World Health Organization |chapter= F84.

==Characteristics==

As a pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.[tpl]cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= 4th, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=28 June 2007 |publisher= |location= [/tpl] Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue= suppl 1 |pages=S3–S11 |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author= Klin A |doi=10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en[/tpl]

===Social interaction===

A lack of demonstrated empathy has a significant impact on aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome. Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional reciprocity (social "games" give-and-take mechanic), and impaired nonverbal behaviors in areas such as eye contact, facial expression, posture, and gesture.[tpl]cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi= 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010[/tpl]
People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others compared to those with other, more debilitating, forms of autism; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction. This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd". This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.  However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display selective mutism, speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.[tpl]cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview |work=Medscape eMedicine |title=Asperger's Syndrome |author=Brasic JR |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010[/tpl]
The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.
The hypothesis that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated, but is not supported by data.[tpl]cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome |author= Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H |pmid=17805955 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=748–58[/tpl] More evidence suggests children with AS are victims rather than victimizers.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |year=2003 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |title=Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism |author= Tsatsanis KD |pmid=12512398 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000561/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1[/tpl] A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with AS had coexisting psychiatric disorders such as schizoaffective disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author= Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M |title=Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1848–52 |year=2008 |pmid=18449633 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8[/tpl]

===Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior===

People with Asperger syndrome often display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in stereotyped and repetitive ways, or preoccupy themselves with parts of objects.
Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.
Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=145–58 |title= Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |author= South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 |pmid=15909401[/tpl] They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements. These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.[tpl]cite journal |author= Rapin I |title= Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal= Adv Neurol |volume=85 |pages=89–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449[/tpl]
According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.

===Speech and language===

Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful only to the speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm.  Echolalia has also been observed in individuals with AS.[tpl]cite journal |author=Frith U |title=Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal=J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford) |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |date=January 1996 |pmid=22302727 |doi=10.1177/026988119601000108[/tpl]
Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to monitor whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.
Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding figurative language and tend to use language literally. Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of humor, they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others. Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.[tpl]cite journal |author= Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |title= Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=521–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15628606 |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8[/tpl]

===Motor and sensory perception===

Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.[tpl]cite journal |author= Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT, et al |title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493 |pmid=10638459[/tpl] These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.
Individuals with AS often have excellent auditory and visual perception.[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=672–86 |title= Emanuel Miller lecture: confusions and controversies about Asperger syndrome |author= Frith U |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00262.x |pmid=15056300[/tpl] Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of small changes in patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features.[tpl]cite book |chapter= Psychological factors in autism |author= Prior M, Ozonoff S |pages=69–128 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-54957-4[/tpl] Conversely, compared to individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli;[tpl]cite book |author= Bogdashina O |title= Sensory Perceptional Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Different Sensory Experiences, Different Perceptual Worlds |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |year=2003 |isbn=1-84310-166-1[/tpl] these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.[tpl]cite journal |author= Rogers SJ, Ozonoff S |title= Annotation: what do we know about sensory dysfunction in autism? A critical review of the empirical evidence |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1255–68 |year=2005 |pmid=16313426 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01431.x[/tpl]
Hans Asperger's initial accounts and other diagnostic schemes[tpl]cite journal |author= Ehlers S, Gillberg C |title= The epidemiology of Asperger's syndrome. A total population study |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiat |year=1993 |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1327–50 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1993.tb02094.x |pmid=8294522[/tpl] include descriptions of physical clumsiness. Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring motor dexterity, such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration. They may show problems with proprioception (sensation of body position) on measures of developmental coordination disorder (motor planning disorder), balance, tandem gait, and finger-thumb apposition. There is no evidence that these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.
Children with AS are more likely to have sleep problems, including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings.[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=260–8 |title= A survey of sleep problems in autism, Asperger's disorder and typically developing children |author= Polimeni MA, Richdale AL, Francis AJ |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00642.x |pmid=15816813[/tpl] AS is also associated with high levels of alexithymia, which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions.[ref]Alexithymia and AS:

==Causes==

Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).[tpl]cite web |author= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |date=31 July 2007 |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm |accessdate=24 August 2007 |title= Asperger syndrome fact sheet| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070821112426/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm?| archivedate= 21 August 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] NIH Publication No. 05-5624. Most research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.
A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245[/tpl] Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.[tpl]cite journal |author= Rutter M |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x |authorlink= Michael Rutter[/tpl]

==Mechanism==

==Diagnosis==

Standard diagnostic criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard, the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis in 2013, and folded it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders.  Other sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed by Szatmari et al.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Can J Psychiatry |year=1989 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=554–60 |title= Asperger's syndrome: a review of clinical features |author= Szatmari P, Bremner R, Nagy J |pmid=2766209[/tpl] and by Gillberg and Gillberg.[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=1989 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=631–8 |title= Asperger syndrome—some epidemiological considerations: a research note |author= Gillberg IC, Gillberg C |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1989.tb00275.x |pmid=2670981[/tpl]
Diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of four and eleven. A comprehensive assessment involves a multidisciplinary team that observes across multiple settings, and includes neurological and genetic assessment as well as tests for cognition, psychomotor function, verbal and nonverbal strengths and weaknesses, style of learning, and skills for independent living. The "gold standard" in diagnosing ASDs combines clinical judgment with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)—a semistructured parent interview—and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)—a conversation and play-based interview with the child.[tpl]cite journal |author=Woodbury-Smith MR, Volkmar FR |title=Asperger syndrome |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18563474 |doi=10.1007/s00787-008-0701-0[/tpl] Delayed or mistaken diagnosis can be traumatic for individuals and families; for example, misdiagnosis can lead to medications that worsen behavior.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leskovec TJ, Rowles BM, Findling RL |title=Pharmacological treatment options for autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=97–112 |year=2008 |pmid=18415882 |doi=10.1080/10673220802075852[/tpl] Many children with AS are initially misdiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

==Screening==

Parents of children with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age. Developmental screening during a routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. The diagnosis of AS is complicated by the use of several different screening instruments, including the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (previously called the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test),The CAST has been renamed from the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test to the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test, reflecting the removal of Asperger's Syndrome from the DSM-5 Gilliam Asperger's Disorder Scale (GADS), Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI),[tpl]cite journal|journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |title= Diagnostic assessment of Asperger's disorder: a review of five third-party rating scales |author= Campbell JM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1028-4|pmid=15796119[/tpl] and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; with versions for children,[tpl]cite journal|author=Auyeung B, Baron-Cohen S, Wheelwright S, Allison C |title= The Autism Spectrum Quotient: Children's Version (AQ-Child) |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1230–40 |year=2008 |pmid=18064550|doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0504-z |url=http://autismresearchcenter.com/docs/papers/2008_Auyeung_etal_ChildAQ.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2 January 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205170722/http://autismresearchcenter.com/docs/papers/2008_Auyeung_etal_ChildAQ.pdf|archivedate= 5 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] adolescents[tpl]cite journal |author= Baron-Cohen S, Hoekstra RA, Knickmeyer R, Wheelwright S |title= The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ)—adolescent version |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=343–50 |year=2006 |pmid=16552625 |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0073-6|url=http://autismresearchcenter.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Hoekstra_etal_AQ-adol.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2 January 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205170712/http://autismresearchcenter.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Hoekstra_etal_AQ-adol.pdf|archivedate= 5 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and adults[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=331–5 |title= Screening adults for Asperger Syndrome using the AQ: a preliminary study of its diagnostic validity in clinical practice |author= Woodbury-Smith MR, Robinson J, Wheelwright S, Baron-Cohen S |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3300-7 |pmid=16119474|url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2005_Woodbury-Smith_etal_ScreeningAdultsForAS.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2 January 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081217140624/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2005_Woodbury-Smith_etal_ScreeningAdultsForAS.pdf|archivedate= 17 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]). None have been shown to reliably differentiate between AS and other ASDs.

==Management==

Asperger syndrome treatment attempts to manage distressing symptoms and to teach age-appropriate social, communication and vocational skills that are not naturally acquired during development, with intervention tailored to the needs of the individual based on multidisciplinary assessment.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Compr Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=184–91 |title= Asperger's disorder: a review of its diagnosis and treatment |author= Khouzam HR, El-Gabalawi F, Pirwani N, Priest F |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2004.02.004 |pmid=15124148[/tpl] Although progress has been made, data supporting the efficacy of particular interventions are limited.[tpl]cite journal |author= Attwood T |title= Frameworks for behavioral interventions |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=65–86 |year=2003 |pmid=12512399 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000548/fulltext |doi= 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00054-8[/tpl]

===Therapies===

The ideal treatment for AS coordinates therapies that address core symptoms of the disorder, including poor communication skills and obsessive or repetitive routines. While most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better, there is no single best treatment package. AS treatment resembles that of other high-functioning ASDs, except that it takes into account the linguistic capabilities, verbal strengths, and nonverbal vulnerabilities of individuals with AS. A typical program generally includes:
Of the many studies on behavior-based early intervention programs, most are case reports of up to five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored.[tpl]cite journal |author= Matson JL |title= Determining treatment outcome in early intervention programs for autism spectrum disorders: a critical analysis of measurement issues in learning based interventions |journal= Res Dev Disabil |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=207–18 |year=2007 |pmid=16682171 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2005.07.006[/tpl] Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established.[tpl]cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Social skills interventions for children with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism: a review and recommendations |author= Rao PA, Beidel DC, Murray MJ |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0402-4 |pmid=17641962 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=353–61[/tpl] A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children.[tpl]cite journal |author= Sofronoff K, Leslie A, Brown W |title= Parent management training and Asperger syndrome: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a parent based intervention |journal=Autism |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=301–17 |year=2004 |pmid=15358872 |doi=10.1177/1362361304045215[/tpl] Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.

===Medications===

No medications directly treat the core symptoms of AS.[tpl]cite journal |author= Towbin KE |title= Strategies for pharmacologic treatment of high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45 |year=2003 |pmid=12512397 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000494/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00049-4[/tpl] Although research into the efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, it is essential to diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.
Care must be taken with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to evaluate in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications,[tpl]cite journal |author= Newcomer JW |title= Antipsychotic medications: metabolic and cardiovascular risk |journal= J Clin Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue= suppl 4 |pages=8–13 |year=2007 |pmid=17539694 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Chavez B, Chavez-Brown M, Sopko MA, Rey JA |title= Atypical antipsychotics in children with pervasive developmental disorders |journal= Pediatr Drugs |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=249–66 |year=2007 |pmid=17705564 |doi= 10.2165/00148581-200709040-00006[/tpl] along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels.[tpl]cite journal |author= Staller J |title= The effect of long-term antipsychotic treatment on prolactin |journal= J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=317–26 |year=2006 |pmid=16768639 |doi=10.1089/cap.2006.16.317[/tpl] Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes.

==Prognosis==

There is some evidence that children with AS may see a lessening of symptoms; up to 20% of children may no longer meet the diagnostic criteria as adults, although social and communication difficulties may persist. As of 2006, no studies addressing the long-term outcome of individuals with Asperger syndrome are available and there are no systematic long-term follow-up studies of children with AS. Individuals with AS appear to have normal life expectancy, but have an increased prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder that may significantly affect prognosis. Although social impairment is lifelong, the outcome is generally more positive than with individuals with lower functioning autism spectrum disorders; for example, ASD symptoms are more likely to diminish with time in children with AS or HFA.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2005 |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=117–22 |title= Modeling clinical outcome of children with autistic spectrum disorders |author= Coplan J, Jawad AF |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1118 |pmid=15995041 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/116/1/117 |laysummary=http://stokes.chop.edu/publications/press/?ID=181 |laysource=press release |laydate=5 July 2005[/tpl] Although most students with AS/HFA have average mathematical ability and test slightly worse in mathematics than in general intelligence, some are gifted in mathematics[tpl]cite journal |journal=Autism |year=2007 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=547–56 |title= Mathematical ability of students with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |author= Chiang HM, Lin YH |doi=10.1177/1362361307083259 |pmid=17947290 |url=http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/6/547 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 March 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090407051134/http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/6/547| archivedate= 7 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=SAGE Journals[/tpl] and AS has not prevented some adults from major accomplishments such as Vernon L.

Although many attend regular education classes, some children with AS may utilize special education services because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, although some do marry and work independently. The "different-ness" adolescents experience can be traumatic.[tpl]cite journal |author= Moran M |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/19/21 |title= Asperger's may be answer to diagnostic mysteries |journal= Psychiatr News |year=2006 |volume=41 |issue=19 |page=21 [/tpl] Anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as inattention, withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical experience suggests the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but this has not been confirmed by systematic empirical studies.[tpl]cite book |title= Asperger's Disorder |editor= Rausch JL, Johnson ME, Casanova MF (eds.) |publisher= Informa Healthcare |year=2008 |chapter= Asperger syndrome—mortality and morbidity |author= Gillberg C |pages=63–80 |isbn=0-8493-8360-9[/tpl]
Education of families is critical in developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis at a younger age that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.

==Epidemiology==

Prevalence estimates vary enormously. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism prevalence rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1;[tpl]cite journal |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |year=2003 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |title= Epidemiologic data on Asperger disorder |author= Fombonne E, Tidmarsh L |pmid=12512396 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000500/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00050-0[/tpl] combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000.[tpl]cite book |chapter= Epidemiological surveys of pervasive developmental disorders |author= Fombonne E |pages=33–68 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-54957-4[/tpl] Part of the variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria.
Anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder are the most common conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%.  Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author= Cederlund M, Gillberg C |title= One hundred males with Asperger syndrome: a clinical study of background and associated factors |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=652–60 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2004.tb00977.x |pmid=15473168[/tpl] AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author= Gillberg C, Billstedt E |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: coexistence with other clinical disorders |journal= Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=102 |issue=5 |pages=321–30 |year=2000 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0447.2000.102005321.x |pmid=11098802[/tpl] However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.

==History==

Named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger (1906–1980), Asperger syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of autism.[tpl]cite journal |author= Baron-Cohen S, Klin A |title= What's so special about Asperger Syndrome? |journal= Brain Cogn|volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16563588 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.02.002|url=http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S05/S05_360/pdf/klin.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]
As a child, Asperger appears to have exhibited some features of the very condition named after him, such as remoteness and talent in language.[tpl]cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |title=Did Hans Asperger (1906–1980) have Asperger Syndrome? |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0382-4 |pmid=17917805 |volume=37 |pages=2020–1 |issue=10 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Osborne L|title=American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome |publisher=Copernicus |year=2002 |isbn=0-387-95307-8 |page=19[/tpl] In 1944, Asperger described four children in his practice[tpl]cite journal |author= Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH |title= Asperger syndrome revisited |journal= Rev Neurol Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16596080[/tpl] who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially. The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by social isolation. Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a diagnosis were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hippler K, Klicpera C |title=A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=358 |issue=1430 |pages=291–301 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12639327 |pmc=1693115 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1197 [/tpl]
Unlike today's AS, autistic psychopathy could be found in people of all levels of intelligence, including those with intellectual disability.[tpl]cite book |author= Wing L |chapter= The relationship between Asperger's syndrome and Kanner's autism |editor= Frith U |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome |year=1991 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-38608-X |pages=93–121[/tpl] In the context of the Nazi eugenics policy of sterilizing and killing social deviants and the mentally handicapped, Asperger passionately defended the value of autistic individuals, writing "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers." Asperger also called his young patients "little professors",[tpl]cite book |author= Asperger H; tr. and annot. Frith U |origyear=1944 |chapter= 'Autistic psychopathy' in childhood |editor= Frith U |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome |year=1991 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-38608-X |pages=37–92[/tpl] and believed some would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life. His paper was published during wartime and in German, so it was not widely read elsewhere.
Lorna Wing popularized the term Asperger syndrome in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 publication[tpl]cite journal|author= Wing L |title= Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account |journal= Psychol Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=115–29 |year=1981|doi=10.1017/S0033291700053332 |pmid=7208735 |url=http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm |accessdate=15 August 2007| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070817231015/http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm| archivedate= 17 August 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year.[tpl]cite journal |author= Mattila ML, Kielinen M, Jussila K, et al |title= An epidemiological and diagnostic study of Asperger syndrome according to four sets of diagnostic criteria |journal= J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=636–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17450055|doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e318033ff42 [/tpl] AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
Hundreds of books, articles and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup. Whether it should be seen as distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.  In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.

==Society and culture==

People identifying with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999).[tpl]cite book |author= Willey LH |title= Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |pages=71, 104 |year=1999 |isbn=1-85302-749-9[/tpl] The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and is often used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS to communicate and celebrate diversity with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal. A subculture of aspies has formed. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Disabil Soc |year=2007 |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=761–76 |title= 'Surplus suffering': differences between organizational understandings of Asperger's syndrome and those people who claim the 'disorder' |author= Clarke J, van Amerom G |doi=10.1080/09687590701659618[/tpl]
Autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex syndromes rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an "ideal" brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is pathological; they promote tolerance for what they call neurodiversity.[tpl]cite book |author= Williams CC |chapter= In search of an Asperger |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=242–52 |quote= The life prospects of people with AS would change if we shifted from viewing AS as a set of dysfunctions, to viewing it as a set of differences that have merit.[/tpl] These views are the basis for the autistic rights and autistic pride movements.[tpl]cite book |author= Dakin CJ |chapter= Life on the outside: A personal perspective of Asperger syndrome |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=352–61[/tpl] There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.[tpl]cite journal |author= Clarke J, van Amerom G |title= Asperger's syndrome: differences between parents' understanding and those diagnosed |journal= Soc Work Health Care |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=85–106 |year=2008 |pmid=18551831 |doi=10.1300/J010v46n03_05[/tpl]
Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder or a disability, and that it should be removed from the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, much as homosexuality was removed.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Disabil Soc |year=2009 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=343–55 |title=Reframing Asperger syndrome: lessons from other challenges to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and ICIDH approaches |author=Allred S |doi=10.1080/09687590902789511 [/tpl] In a 2002 paper, Simon Baron-Cohen wrote of those with AS, "In the social world, there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloging, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure." Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Focus Autism Other Dev Disabl |year=2002 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=186–91 |title= Is Asperger syndrome necessarily viewed as a disability? |author= Baron-Cohen S |doi=10.1177/10883576020170030801[/tpl] A preliminary, freely readable draft, with slightly different wording in the quoted text, is in: [tpl]cite web |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2002_BC_ASDisability.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2 December 2008 |year=2002 |author= Baron-Cohen S |title= Is Asperger's syndrome necessarily a disability? |publisher= Autism Research Centre |location= Cambridge| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081217140628/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2002_BC_ASDisability.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Baron-Cohen argues that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent human evolution and have made remarkable contributions to human history.[tpl]cite book |title= Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology |chapter= The evolution of brain mechanisms for social behavior |author= Baron-Cohen S |pages=415–32 |editor= Crawford C, Krebs D (eds.) |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum |year=2008 |isbn=0-8058-5957-8[/tpl]
