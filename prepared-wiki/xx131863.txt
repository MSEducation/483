[[Acid mantle]]

CATEGORIES: Skin anatomy

The acid mantle is a very fine, slightly acidic film on the surface of the skin acting as a barrier to bacteria, viruses and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin.[tpl]cite book|author1=Monika-Hildegard Schmid-Wendtner|author2=Korting Schmid-Wendtner|title=Ph and Skin Care|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AWEDzXOAivgC&pg=PA31|accessdate=19 June 2012|year=2007|publisher=ABW Wissenschaftsverlag|isbn=978-3-936072-64-8|pages=31–[/tpl]  It is secreted by sebaceous glands. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, so it is acidic.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zlotogorski A |title=Distribution of skin surface pH on the forehead and cheek of adults |journal=Arch. Dermatol.
