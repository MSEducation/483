[[Chugach Mountains]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Alaska

The Chugach Mountains of southern Alaska are the northernmost of the several mountain ranges that make up the Pacific Coast Ranges of the western edge of North America. The range is about [tpl]convert|250|mi|km|0[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|60|mi|km|0[/tpl] wide, and extends from the Knik and Turnagain Arms of the Cook Inlet on the west to Bering Glacier, Tana Glacier, and the Tana River on the east. It is bounded on the north by the Matanuska, Copper, and Chitina rivers. The highest point of the Chugach Mountains is Mount Marcus Baker, at [tpl]convert|12884|ft|m|0[/tpl], but with an average elevation of [tpl]convert|4006|ft|m|0[/tpl], most of its summits are not especially high.[tpl]cite gnis|id=1412401|name=Chugach Mountains|accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl] Even so its position along the Gulf of Alaska ensures more snowfall in the Chugach than anywhere else in the world; an annual average of over 1500 cm (600 in).Steep, Freeskiing Documentary, 2007
The mountains are protected in the Chugach State Park and the Chugach National Forest. Near to Anchorage, they are a popular destination for outdoor activities. Weather permitting, the World Extreme Skiing Championship is held annually in the Chugach Mountains near Valdez.
The Richardson Highway, Seward Highway, Portage Glacier Highway, and the Glenn Highway run through the Chugach Mountains. The Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel of the Portage Glacier Highway provides railroad and automobile access underneath Maynard Mountain between Portage Lake and the city of Whittier on Prince William Sound.

==History==

The name "Chugach" comes from Chugach Sugpiaq, the name of the local indigenous people recorded by Russian explorers and written by them "Chugatz" and "Tchougatskoi". in 1898 United States Army Captain William R. Abercrombie spelled the name "Chugatch" and applied it to the mountains.
