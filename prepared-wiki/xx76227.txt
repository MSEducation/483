Right-handedness is the most common form of handedness in the world. Nearly 90 percent of people are right-handed compared to other form of handedness, such as left-handedness or ambidexterity. In many cultures, the right side, and thus the right hand, were viewed favorably. Because of this, many left-handers were forced to become right-handers. Even today, this discrimination persists in a more subtle form, langauge.
