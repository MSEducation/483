[[Carrier Strike Group Fourteen]]

CATEGORIES: Carrier Strike Groups, Military units and formations established in 2004, Military units and formations disestablished in the 2010s, Military in Florida

Carrier Strike Group Fourteen (CSG-14 or CARSTRKGRU 14) was a U.S. Navy carrier strike group. Carrier Strike Group Fourteen was for some time the only U.S. carrier strike group that does not have an assigned aircraft carrier or carrier air wing.[tpl]cite web | title= Ships | url= http://www.ccsg14.surfor.navy.mil/Site%20pages/Ships.aspx | work= Home page | publisher= COMCARSTRKGRU Fourteen | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] As of December 2010, it directs the cruisers [tpl]USS|Gettysburg|CG-64[/tpl] and [tpl]USS|Philippine Sea|CG-58[/tpl]. Carrier Strike Group Fourteen is currently based at Naval Station Mayport. Without a carrier flagship, it does not conduct the typical deployments of other carrier strike groups; instead, its two cruisers making independent voyages.
The group is not listed in the Administrative Organisation of the Operating Forces of the United States Navy: Fleet Chain of Command, March 2012, and thus appears to have been disestablished.

==Overview==

Commander Carrier Strike Group Fourteen exercises oversight of unit-level training, integrated training, and readiness for assigned ships and units, as well as maintains administrative functions and material readiness tracking for ships and squadrons assigned to the strike group.
The group reports to the Commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command as one of its six carrier strike groups currently assigned to that command.  The group's pre-deployment training and certification would theoretically come under the control of Fleet Forces Command following the disestablisment of the U.S. Second Fleet on 30 September 2011.[tpl]cite web | title= U.S. 2nd Fleet to Disestablish Sept. 30 | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=63005 | work= NNS110929-22 | publisher= U.S. 2nd Fleet Public Affairs | date= September 29, 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW/AW) Rafael Martie, USN | title= US 2nd Fleet Disestablishes, Merges with Fleet Forces Command | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=63027 | work= NNS110930-10 | publisher= U.S. 2nd Fleet Public Affairs | date= September 30, 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl] However, without a carrier assigned, the group does not conduct pre-deployment group workups. 
Administratively, Gettysburg and Philippine Sea are under the authority of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic.[tpl]cite web | title= Command Listing | url= http://www.surflant.navy.mil/site%20pages/Cmdlisting.aspx | work= COMNAVSURFLANT | publisher= U.S. Navy | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl]

==Historical background==

Effective 30 June 1973, Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla Twelve was re-designated as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Twelve (CCDG-12). In 1986, while commanding  Cruiser-Destroyer Group Twelve, Rear Admiral Henry H. Mauz, Jr., commanded the [tpl]USS|America|CV-66|2[/tpl] carrier battle group and Task Group 60.3, part of Task Force 60, U.S. Sixth Fleet during an operation codenamed 'Attain Document', which led to the Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986).  The operation was intended to assert the freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Sidra as well as to challenge the territorial claims of Libya to the area.  Subsequently, the America carrier battle group and the rest of Task Force 60 carried out Operation El Dorado Canyon, a series of punitive strikes against Libya in retaliation for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing.[tpl]cite book |title= Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events: Vol. II, 1946-2006 |last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 2008 |publisher= Potomac Books, Inc. |location= Dulles, Virginia |isbn= 978-157488-665-8 |pages= 369–374 |url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=69770 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= El Dorado Canyon: Reagan's Undeclared War With Qaddafi |last= Stanik |first= Joseph T. |year= 2003 |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= Annapolis, Maryland |isbn= 978-155750-983-3 |pages= 120, 123–140, 170, 175, 202–205|url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/history/el-dorado-canyon [/tpl] 
Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 previously served as Immediate Superior-in-Command for [tpl]USS|Enterprise|CVN-65[/tpl], Carrier Air Wing Eight, Destroyer Squadron 18, [tpl]USS|Gettysburg|CG-64[/tpl], and USS Philippine Sea (CG-58). CCDG-12 reported to Commander, Second Fleet as one of six carrier battle group Commanders in the Atlantic Fleet. CCDG-12's 2003 deployment included the destroyers [tpl]USS|Cole|DDG-67|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Thorn|DD-988|6[/tpl], and [tpl]USS|Gonzalez|DDG-66|6[/tpl].
On September 1, 2004, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 12 transferred command of the USS Enterprise (CVN 65) and its Carrier Strike Group to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8.[tpl]cite web | author= Journalist 3rd Class Daniel Vaughan, U.S.N | title= Cruiser Destroyer Group 8 Takes Charge of Enterprise CSG | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15054 | work= NNS040907-04 | publisher= USS Enterprise Public Affairs | date= September 7, 2004 | accessdate=2009-04-20[/tpl] This apparently left Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 without an assigned aircraft carrier.
On 1 October 2004, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 was redesignated Carrier Strike Group 14.
As of 2010, Carrier Strike Group 14 may have been deactivated. The Navy's Strike Group 14 webpage is no longer active, and the admiral listed in command is no longer mentioned in the official US Navy biography website of currently active flag officers, suggesting this officer may have since retired.
It was announced on October 22, 2009 that the last listed commander of the group, Rear Admiral Bernard J McCullough,[tpl]Cite web| title= Commander, Carrier Strike Group 14 | url= http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ccsg14/Pages/bio1.aspx | work= Leadership: Commander | publisher= Carrier Strike Group Fourteen | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-28[/tpl] was to be
