==Top grossing films (U.S.)Box Office Digest, March 1939, p.18==

At the time, box office numbers were reported as a percentage of business for each theater in comparison to 'normal' business. For example, Alexander's Ragtime Band performed at 227% and The Adventures of Robin Hood at 170%.  This is why exact dollar grosses for films are unreliable at best.
