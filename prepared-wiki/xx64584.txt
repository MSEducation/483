==Early life==

Princess Alexandra was born on 25 December 1936 at 3 Belgrave Square, London.[tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=37[/tpl] Her father was The Prince George, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George V and Queen Mary. Her mother was Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Alexandra, her maternal grandmother, Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, and both of her maternal aunts, Countess Karl Theodor of Törring-Jettenbach and Princess Paul of Yugoslavia. She received the name Christabel because she was born on Christmas Day like her aunt by marriage Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.
As a male-line granddaughter of the British monarch, she was styled as a British princess with the prefix Her Royal Highness. At the time of her birth, she was sixth in the line of succession to the British throne.
The Princess was baptised in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace, on 9 February 1937, and her godparents were: King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (her paternal uncle and aunt); the Queen of Norway (her great-aunt); Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark (her maternal grandmother); Princess Olga of Yugoslavia (her maternal aunt); the Princess Beatrice (her paternal great-great-aunt); the Earl of Athlone (her paternal great-uncle); and count Karl Theodor of Toerring-Jettenbach (her maternal uncle by marriage). Of her godparents, only the King and Queen and Lord Athlone were present.[tpl]cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings |publisher=Uniserve|accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]
Princess Alexandra spent most of her childhood at her family's country house, Coppins, in Buckinghamshire. She lived with her grandmother Queen Mary, the widow of George V, during World War II at Badminton.[tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=37[/tpl] Her father was killed in an aeroplane crash near Caithness, Scotland on 25 August 1942 while serving in the Royal Air Force. Princess Alexandra has the distinction of being the first British princess to have attended an ordinary boarding school, Heathfield School near Ascot.[tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=37[/tpl] She then studied in Paris.[tpl]cite news|title=Mayfair glamour girl not Margaret, but Alex|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_ZZRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AmwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3979,5364379&dq=princess+alexandra&hl=en|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|date=19 January 1956|agency=AP|location=London[/tpl] She was also trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital.
She served as bridesmaid at the wedding of her cousins, the then-Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh, on 20 November 1947.

She was also a bridesmaid at the 1962 wedding of Prince Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark. The Spanish Queen and Princess Alexandra are second cousins.

==Marriage and personal life==

On 24 April 1963, she married the Hon Angus James Bruce Ogilvy (1928–2004), the second son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, at Westminster Abbey.[tpl]cite news|last=Mishael|first=Herbert|title=Princess Alexandra to wed Ancestral foe|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OFBVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YpUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6980,3292048&dq=princess+alexandra&hl=en|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=24 April 1963|location=London[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=38[/tpl] The wedding ceremony was attended by the Royal Family[tpl]cite web|title=Royal Spring Wedding|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/royal-spring-wedding-technicolor|work=British Pathe News[/tpl] and was broadcast worldwide on television, watched by an estimated 200 million people.[tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=38[/tpl]
Ogilvy declined the Queen's offer of an earldom upon marriage.[tpl]sfn|Panton|2011|p=38[/tpl] This meant that any children they might have would carry no titles at all.
Angus Ogilvy received a knighthood in 1988, and was appointed to the Privy Council in 1997. Princess Alexandra and Sir Angus had two children, James and Marina, and four grandchildren, none of whom carry out royal duties:
She resides in a royal residence, Thatched House Lodge, Richmond Park, South-West London.

==Controversy==

Described as "one of the most popular members of the royal family",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor_25.htm |title=Princess Alexandra of Kent [/tpl] Princess Alexandra and her family have come under media scrutiny at various times in her life. Her husband was a director at a mining company, Lonrho, when it was involved in a scandal over the breaking of trade sanctions against Rhodesia. The Prime Minister at the time, Edward Heath, criticised the company, and Ogilvy subsequently resigned his directorships from that company.
