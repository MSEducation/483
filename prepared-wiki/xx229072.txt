Glacier 3000 (officially Gstaad 3000 AG) is a company that operates several cable cars and ski lifts in the region of the Diablerets in western Switzerland. It was created in 1997 by the merging of two former companies (Reusch - Cabane des Diablerets SA, Téléphériques Pillon – Glacier des Diablerets SA). The company is now based in Gstaad.
The main cable car was opened in 1964 and rebuilt in 1999. It connects the Col du Pillon (1,546) from the Scex Rouge (2,950 m). The company also operates ski lifts on the Tsanfleuron Glacier.History glacier3000.ch. Retrieved 2010-03-17
