==History==

Queen Anne's County has two hundred sixty-five miles of waterfront area, much of that being the shores of Kent Island, which stands out from the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. From the waters of this county, watermen have brought oysters, crabs, and terrapin.  Migrating waterfowl overwinter here, and hunting for geese and ducks has been an important part of the county's history.  The first settlement in Maryland was on Kent Island in August 21, 1631, and included twenty-five settlers in a manor house, a fort, and other buildings.  The settlement was referred to as Winston's Island.  The first houses were built similar to log cabins.  Although the county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places,[tpl]NRISref|2008a[/tpl] the original settlement no longer exists.  One of the oldest towns still existing is Stevensville, earlier known as Broad Creek.
In 1650, Kent Island had the first recorded fox hunt in America.  Queen Anne's County was organized under a sheriff in 1706, bounded by Talbot, Kent, and Dorchester Counties.  In 1713, Queen Anne's County became an English postal district where the sheriff was the postmaster and would travel to Annapolis by boat to obtain mail.  In 1773 a part of Queen Anne's County, together with a portion of Dorchester County, was taken to form Caroline County.  The county now is enclosed by Talbot, Caroline, and Kent County as well as the Chesapeake Bay.
By the time of Independence, the county had several churches, a government, school, and a postal system.
In 1876, Queen Anne's County had the first printed independent paper called the Maryland Citizen, and a bank, located in Centreville; the Centreville National Bank exists to this day. When the Railroad Company was finished in 1868 it operated from Baltimore around the top of the Chesapeake Bay down to Queenstown, and connected with other railroads that continued east into[tpl]cite book|last=Clark|first=Charles B.|title=The Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia|year=1950|publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|pages=1053–1070[/tpl] Delaware as far as Rehoboth, and southward to the Eastern Shore of Virginia.
