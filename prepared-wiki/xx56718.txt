Nueva Ecija ([tpl]pronunciation|Nueva ecija.ogg[/tpl]) (PSGC: 034900000; ISO: PH-NUE) is a landlocked province of the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is Palayan City. Nueva Ecija borders, from the south clockwise, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya, and Aurora.

==History==

The sprawling and varied geological features of the land now known as Nueva Ecija, includes plains, mountains and rivers, all the requisites for the birthing and sustenance of life itself. The land's very first settlers came upon three mountain ranges to the East, North and West and vast southern plains. All these were sustained by a great flowing river, one whose earliest name was spoken in a now lost tongue, and which was called the Rio Grande de Pampanga by the Spaniards later on. The Great Pampanga River nourished wild, fruit-bearing trees, served as home to an abundance of fish and made possible lush, teeming woodlands that sheltered animals.[tpl]cite web|title=Pampanga River Basin|url=http://rbco.denr.gov.ph/index.php/river-basin-home-8|publisher=rbco.denr.gov.ph[/tpl] All these combined must have been paradise in whatever language for the land's earliest settlers, who were able to not only survive but thrive in the surrounding abundance, all within easy reach.
These first settlers included tribes of Ilongots or Italons, Abaca and Buquids. Settlements were built along the banks following the river's undulations. The Ilongots, meaning people of the forest, were the fierce headhunters and animist tribes who occupied Carranglan and the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre and Caraballo.[tpl]cite book|last=Barrows|first=Dr. David P.|title=The Ilongot or Ibilao of Luzon|year=1910|publisher=Popular Science Monthly|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TSMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA521&dq=first+inhabitants+of+nueva+ecija#v=onepage&q=first%20inhabitants%20of%20nueva%20ecija&f=false[/tpl] The head hunting communities were nestled along the riverbanks of Rio Grande's tributaries in the north. Abaca and Italon were subgroups of Ilongots meaning river settlers. Ilongots survived mainly by fishing and hunting. Food production was a secondary occupation. The agriculture-based community of Caraclans and Buquids[tpl]cite book|last=Mozo|first=Antonio|title=En Que Se Da Cuenta|year=1763|publisher=googlebooks.com|pages=247|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dqaXOebmKBMC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Caraclans+and+Buquids#v=onepage&q=Caraclans%20and%20Buquids&f=false[/tpl]  were settled in Bongabon and Pantabangan along the riverbanks of Rio Grande's tributaries in the northeast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3458000800.html|title=The Ilongot|publisher=Daniel Strouthes[/tpl]
When the waves of Malay migrations took place between 300-200 B.C., intrepid travelers and traders set up settlements along Luzon's western coast. These early settlements formed the nucleus of the Pampango Empire that was consolidated by Balagtas. The flatlands of the southern portion of Upper Pampanga was a hospitable place for these new Malay settlers. The indigenous tribes were forced to take to the hills in the face of the Malays' superior technology.[tpl]cite web|title=Pre Colonial Period|url=http://www.oocities.org/collegepark/pool/1644/precolonial.html|publisher=oocities.org[/tpl]
Barter trade flourished among communities that settled along the great river. The constant riverside trading resulted in both a commercial and cultural exchange between the settlements in vast plains upstream of the Rio Grande de Pampanga. Settlements in Carranglan, Pantabangan, Bongabon and Puncan prospered and grew into more stable communities.
When the Pampango Empire fell into the hands of Spanish forces under the command of Martin de Goiti in 1572, the conquistadores began their long upward trek towards Cagayan Valley and Mountain Province. Their forces passed through the settlement areas of the Upper Pampanga River.
Because of growing territorial domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established. Then Governor-General[tpl]cite journal|title=The Governor-General of the Philippines Under Spain and the United States|publisher=The American Historical Review|jstor=1835051[/tpl] Fausto Cruzat y GÃ³ngora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1701) had most likely spent much of his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Ecija, Andalusia in Spain. Ecija, Andalusia was also known as eel sarten or the frying pan because of its intensely hot summers. Thus the Governor-General hit upon the notion to name the outpost Nueva (meaning new Ecija).Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Rio Grande de Pampanga and the latter, by the river Genil.

===Seeds of Faith and Civilization===

Consistent with the history of civilization in the rest of Philippine archipelago, Nueva Ecija was born from the fires of Catholic faith that spurred missionaries to convert the pagan communities despite many dangers and difficulties.
Augustinian missionaries executed early evangelical missions in Nueva Ecija. Its first founded mission was established in Gapan in 1595. Considered to be a big pueblo, Gapan embraced an area as far as North of Cabanatuan. The succeeding missions progressed slowly due to inaccessible terrain and limited manpower; hence, the Augustinians abandoned their missionary work in 1636, maintaining only the mission in Bongabon.[tpl]cite web|title=The Augustinian Friars (Order of Saint Augustine)|url=http://sanagustinchurch.org/about.php|publisher=sanagustinchurch.org[/tpl]
At the turn of the 18th century, the missionaries resumed their evangelical work and redirected their efforts to the northeast, towards rough, mountainous terrain inhabited by Ilongots. The Augustinians hurdled the difficulties brought about by ferocious headhunting tribes in completing their missions in the North. They successfully laid down the foundation of Christian way of life among ferocious and war like villagers in the province.
In September 1, 1759, King Carlos III of Spain issued a Royal Decree that ended the founding missions of Augustinians and transferred all Augustinian responsibilities in the settlements of Nueva Ecija to Franciscan friars. This was a milestone in the development of the missions in the province. Through tribute collections and polo y servicio or rendering of force labor, the Franciscans constructed churches, convents, parochial schools and tribunals. They also constructed roads and bridges to connect other settlements. In 1781, a simple irrigation system was constructed in Pantabangan. This new farming technology contributed to the promotion of agriculture in the province.

===New province===

To make possible the establishment of settlements, military force became necessary to protect the friars and whatever basic settlement structures were beginning to emerge. Thus military outposts were of utmost importance, especially with the friars trying to convert fierce head-hunting tribes with spears and bladed weapons. It was around this time, during the term of Governor General Fausto Cruzat y Gongora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1701), that he established the military outpost he named Nueva Ecija. At this time, however, Nueva Ecija was still part of upper Pampanga.
It was only later in 1848 that Nueva Ecija was established as a separate province independent from Pampanga. This was accompanied by changes in its territorial composition over the next 10 years. The progressive towns of Gapan, San Isidro, Cabiao and Aliaga were all annexed to Nueva Ecija, resulting in an economic as well as population boom for all the inhabitants. While Nueva Ecija only had a population of 9,165 in 1845,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fnetravel.com/travel_info/english/philippines-info/cabanatuan.html|title=About Cabanatuan City|publisher=fnetravel.com[/tpl] the annexation of new territories three years later pegged the population at 69,135.
Other changes in territorial composition happened in the following years until, in 1901, Nueva Ecija's northern municipalities of Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan were annexed to Pangasinan. Nueva Ecija's shifting political boundaries in fact, necessitated transferring its provincial capital four times. Still, these changes proved ultimately beneficial to Nueva Ecija, as they resulted in a territory with rich land resources nourished by an excellent river system composed of the Rio Grande de Pampanga, Talavera and Penaranda rivers. This would help lay the foundation for Nueva Ecija's abundant agricultural economy starting with the American Occupation in the early 20th century.

===Cry of Nueva Ecija===

The "Cry of Nueva Ecija" is the 1896 revolutionary battle led by General Mariano Llanera, manned and assisted by General Manuel Tinio of Gapan City, Nueva Ecija and Colonel Alipio Tecson of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija who later on became Brigadaire General. The battle was fought in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. Alipio Tecson would eventually become Governadorcillo of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija.[tpl]cite web|title=HISTORY OF "UNANG SIGAW NG NUEVE ECIJA"|url=http://www.mysmartschools.ph/web/gintoanginaani/history%20of%20unang%20sigaw%20ng%20nueva%20ecija.htm|publisher=Ginto ang Inaani[/tpl]

===Tobacco monopoly===

Maintaining the Philippines as a colony became a challenge for the Spanish Empire. Expenses incurred in running the colony were usually paid for by a yearly subsidy (called real situado) sent from the Philippines' sister colony in Mexico. This financial support from the Spanish royal court was often insufficient, especially with expenditures in the Philippine colony growing each year.
This prompted the royal fiscal assigned in Manila to devise a plan to allow the colony itself to raise revenues on its own and thus be able to supplement the Spanish subsidy. This royal fiscal was Francisco Leandro de Vianna, who first proposed creating a tobacco monopoly. De Vianna reasoned, tobacco was a product widely consumed throughout the islands, with a market of roughly one million. He projected earnings of as much as P400,000 from the venture. The first time the proposal was made, however, both King Carlos III of Spain and colonial officials didn't give the idea much importance.
All that would change during the term of Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas. Basco had plans to develop and promote Philippine agriculture, and de Vianna's proposal seemed attractive to him. After studying the proposal, Basco sent his plan to establish a large-scale tobacco production in the colony under complete ownership and management by the colonial government of Spain. What probably perked up the ears of the Spanish king about Basco's plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown. The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780 setting in motion Basco's plan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rereadinglives.blogspot.com/2010/04/tobacco-monopoly-in-philippines-1776-to.html|title=Tobacco Monopoly in Philippines|publisher=The Reading Life|author=Edilberto C de Jesus[/tpl]
Almost two years to the date of that royal decree, Basco ordered local officials and military commanders to prevent unnecessary losses of tobacco revenues. By March 2, 1782 tobacco production was established in Luzon, with La Union, Ilocos, Abra, Cagayan Valley and Nueva Ecija (still part of Pampanga at the time) as the centers for planting, growing, harvesting and processing tobacco.
This made a drastic and extreme change in the lives of all Novo Ecijanos. Where farmland used to bear rice, tobacco was now the only crop allowed to grow. These included the towns of Gapan, San Isidro, Jaen, Cabiao, Cabanatuan, Talavera, Santor and Bongabon. Each farming family was given a quota of tobacco plant to grow.
By 1850 the tobacco monopoly was producing immense financial gain for the colonial government. Some reports at the time pegged the earnings by as much as $500,000. One account in 1866 reported a much higher amount, as earnings rose to $38,418,939 that year.
Novo Ecijanos suffered a lot from the system. Nueva Ecija was more often able to meet production quotas compared to the other districts. Despite this, tobacco policy imposed a lower price on tobacco from areas closer to Manila. That meant that first-class tobacco leaf grown and harvested from Nueva Ecija was priced lower by one dollar, compared to those from Ilocos, La Union and Cagayan Valley.
The tobacco monopoly did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, unlike the Ilocanos who staged an uprising over injustices in the system. Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests in order to get some profit. But getting caught entailed harsher fines and penalties. Even sympathetic local officials had no choice but to enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.
The flourishing tobacco industry coupled with the rich agricultural lands in central and northeastern Nueva Ecija also attracted migrants from neighboring Pampanga, Ilocos and Tagalog areas. This made Nueva Ecija a melting pot of cultures and influences, the results of which are still evident in present-day Novo Ecijano culture.
As the tobacco monopoly fuelled further unrest, Spain finally abolished the monopoly on December 3, 1882. It was only then that they could all once again grow rice for food.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=HistoryoftheProvince&Page=1&pid=717|title=History of the Province|publisher=visitmyphilippines.com[/tpl]

===Freedom fighters===

One distinct feature of the 1896 revolution against Spain in Nueva Ecija was that it was led by the elite, ruling class instead of the masses. Leaders of the revolt in Nueva Ecija were municipal officials and prominent citizens, who refused to collaborate with the Spanish authorities when armed struggle broke out. Despite being in the ruling class and enjoying positions in the colonial government, these prominent Novo Ecijanos proved their patriotism and love for fellow Filipinos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.authorama.com/true-version-of-the-philippine-revolution-2.html|title=True Version of the Philippine Revolution|publisher=authorama.com[/tpl]
In fact, one of the founding members of the reform movement La Liga Filipina[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laligapilipinas.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=110:the-constitution-of-the-la-liga-filipina&catid=74:organizational-materials&Itemid=83|title=The Constitution of the Old La Liga Filipina(1892)|work=History of the Filipino People|author=Agoncillo & Guerrero|edition=5th|year=1977|pages=164â168[/tpl] was lawyer and Novo Ecijano Mamerto Natividad. By the time the Katipunan, the revolutionary movement against Spain, was formed, Novo Ecijanos were actively yet secretly joining it. Even local officials in Nueva Ecija secretly allied with the illustrados and farmers in forming the underground revolutionary society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/la-solidaridad.htm|title=La Solidaridad and La Liga Filipina|publisher=philippine-history.org[/tpl]
Once the Spanish authorities learned of the Katipunan's existence, those perceived as sympathizers of the movement, and even those who were falsely accused of being members of it, were arrested. Mamerto Natividad was among those arrested for sedition, tortured and killed by guardia civil. He was one of the first Novo Ecijano martyrs[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofgapan.gov.ph/aboutgapan.htm|title=About Gapan|publisher=cityofgapan.gov[/tpl] for freedom. His death however, would result in bigger problems for the Spanish authorities.
Mamerto Natividad's two sons, Mamerto Jr. and Benito Natividad, later joined the Katipunan. The Spaniards burned their house and sugar mills in Jaen. Mamerto Jr. was later jailed for shooting a Spanish judge who had slapped his younger brother. As the Revolution gained ground, Mamerto Jr. was released and he was able to join the revolutionary army of General Emilio Aguinaldo in Cavite. By August 30, 1896 a state of war was declared by the Spanish colonial government in several Luzon provinces including Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite and Manila.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aboutphilippines-phonedata.blogspot.com/2010/11/philippine-revolution-of-1896-1898.html|title=Philippine Revolution of 1896|publisher=About Philippines[/tpl]
Novo Ecijanos immediately proved themselves worthy of the fight for freedom. On September 2, 1896, Novo Ecijanos led by Capt. Mariano Llanera and Capt. Pantaleon Valmonte of Gapan attacked San Isidro, the provincial capital. Their 3,000-strong army attacked San Isidro in distinct Novo Ecijano fashion: accompanied by music played by the Banda de Cabiao or Cabiao band. It seems that in love or war, music is integral to Novo Ecijanos.
thumb|left|Wounded American on stretcher in the Philippines, 1899Novo Ecijanos like Llanera, Valmonte, Mamerto Natividad, Jr. and Manuel Tinio conducted themselves heroically during the revolution. They were allied with Aguinaldo's Magdalo[tpl]cite web|url=http://masternoel.tripod.com/compdev/page41.htm|title=Magdiwang and Magdalo|publisher=tripod.com[/tpl] group. Aguinaldo was in fact so impressed, he appointed Natividad and Llanera to the two highest-ranking posts in the revolutionary army. Natividad became General Mamerto Natividad, commanding general of the revolutionary army, while General Llanera was vice-commander with the rank of Lieutenant-General. General Natividad proved himself worthy of the position by scoring victories against the Spanish in Tayug, Pangasinan and San Rafael, Bulacan.
On November 11, 1897, Natividad's life would end after he was killed in action in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. His death precipitated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/biak-na-bato.htm|title=Pact of Biak na Bato|publisher=philippine-history.org[/tpl] a peace treaty that sought to end hostilities between Spanish authorities and the Filipino rebels. The treaty provided for a payment of P800,000 to the rebels who would then be exiled to Hong Kong. Five Novo Ecijanos would accompany Aguinaldo's exile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html|title=Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy|publisher=Library of Congress[/tpl] They were General Mariano Llanera, Benito Natividad, General Manuel Tinio,[tpl]cite web|url=http://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/ilocosandcagayan1899.htm|title=PhilippineâAmerican War, 1899-1902|publisher=philippineamericanwar.webs.com|author=Arnaldo Dumindin[/tpl] and Joaquin Natividad.
Later on, Novo Ecijanos would continue to participate in the drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom. They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and the United States, after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom. Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the PhilippineâAmerican War (after it became evident the United States wanted to make the Philippines their own colony).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/intro.html|title=The World of 1898:The Spanish-American War|publisher=Hispanic Division Library of Congress[/tpl]
Then when the Japanese tried to make the Philippines their own colony[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/japanese-occupation.htm|title=Japanese Occupation|publisher=philippine-history.org[/tpl] at the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific, Novo Ecijanos would also make history by participating in guerilla activities. The exploits of the Novo Ecijano guerillas have in fact been made into literature, through the World War II novel Ghost SoldiersÂ by Hampton Sides[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/ghostsoldiers/|title=Ghost Soldiers|publisher=Hampton Sides[/tpl] and in Hollywood cinema, in the war film The Great Raid[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.awesomestories.com/flicks/great-raid|title=Great Raid|publisher=Carole D.

===American period===

History records how the PhilippineâAmerican War began after American troops killed a Filipino soldier who was crossing the San Juan bridge on February 4, 1899.[tpl]cite web|url=http://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/filamwarbreaksout.htm|title=Fil-Am War Breaks Out|publisher=philippineamericanwar.webs.com|author=Arnaldo Dumindin[/tpl] One could also say however that hostilities and mistrust really began as early as August 13 the previous year. On that day, the Spanish colonial government in Intramuros surrendered to American forces instead of the Filipino soldiers that surrounded the Walled City. Thus began the United States own effort to have her own colonies, with the Philippines served, as it were, on a silver platter by the dying Spanish Empire thanks to the Treaty of Paris.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ksa/apsis/aufi/forbes/forbes55.htm|title=The Philippines under Spanish and American Rules|publisher=Forbes-Lindsay, C. H[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://law.upd.edu.ph/plj/images/files/PLJ%20volume%2060/PLJ%20Volume%2060%20supplemental%20issue%20-012-%20Treaty%20between%20spain%20and%20the%20United%20States.pdf|title=The Treaty of Paris|publisher=law.upd.edu.ph[/tpl]
When the war between Filipinos and Americans finally began, the fate of the infant Republic of the Philippines again lay in the hands of General Aguinaldo and his most trusted men who included Novo Ecijanos like General Llanera and General Tinio. And, as guerilla warfare became an effective tactic for the Filipinos, Novo Ecijanos were among the most feared guerillas around. Both the Novo Ecijanos and Americans were willing to resort to brutal tactics, torture and even atrocious killings in the course of the war.
By the time the war ended on April 1, 1901 with Aguinaldo's surrender to the Americans,[tpl]cite web|url=http://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/thelastholdouts.htm|title=The Last Holdouts|publisher=Arnaldo Dumindin[/tpl] Novo Ecijano guerillas who had fought so fiercely and bravely against two sets of foreign invaders reluctantly gave up. Still that was not the end of the association between them and the Americans. The end of the PhilippineâAmerican War also signaled a new beginning for Nueva Ecija and its people.

====The railway====

Before the American occupation, Nueva Ecija was alread a hub of trade and commerce. Since Nueva Ecija in the 19th century had neither excellent roads nor the ideal land transport system, trading activities were done mainly through the waterways.
While we moderns consider rivers as obstacles that need to be crossed, people in the 19th century valued rivers not just as sources of food and water but as passages for trading barges and boats. Thus, Nueva Ecijas early trading settlements sprouted along riverbanks.
Commercial, interprovincial trade was carried out using the Rio Grande de Pampanga as main waterway, with trade outposts in San Isidro and Talipapa. Traders from Bulacan, Tondo and Manila regularly came to Nueva Ecija to carry back rice, palay, tobacco, sugar, corn and livestock.
The Americans, however, wanted to shift from water-borne trade to a land-based trade system. Their idea for establishing this depended on something they were masters at: building railways. The American colonial government thought a railway could help boost Nueva Ecija's economic growth, in the same way that the US railway system helped unite and develop the economy of the North American continent.
What made the railway project attractive was that it was less expensive than building roads. At first run by a private company, the US colonial government[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonial_Period_(Philippines)|title=American Colonial Period (Philippines)|publisher=Wikipedia[/tpl] took over the ownership and management of the railway system by 1917.
The Americans were soon proven right: trade conducted through the railways boosted Nueva Ecija's income by 25% while transport costs went down by 25% to as much as 75%. With the train able to transport more goods and more people at a cheaper rate, the railway helped spark a rice boom in Gapan, San Isidro, Cabanatuan, Santa Rosa and Penaranda. Farmers could devote more land to growing rice and even secondary crops like onions and watermelons.
More rice mills, farmers and farmer settlers came to Nueva Ecija. By 1936, there were 42 rice mills in Nueva Ecija, owned mostly by Chinese.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/wickberg_3.pdf|title=Early Chinese Economic Influence in the Philippines, 1850-1898|author=Edgar Wickberg|publisher=upf.edu[/tpl]
The agriculture-based economic boom brought about by the train's huge load capacity and greater speed (compared to boats) encouraged waves of migrations to Nueva Ecija from places like Ilocos, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Bulacan.
The railway brought other changes to Nueva Ecija. While trade was still being done by waterways, settlements by necessity had to be established close to the rivers, where people's basic necessities came from. When the trains became the main mode of transporting goods and people, and with the influx of migrants, it became not only possible but crucial to build more communities further inland. This meant roads and irrigation systems were needed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tradechakra.com/economy/philippines/railways-in-philippines-259.php|title=Railways in The Philippines|publisher=Trade Chakra[/tpl]

====Roads and irrigation====

As communities expanded inward, first along the rivers and then along the railways, the need for roads and irrigation systems leading to communities in the plains became more urgent. These made it possible for the more remote townsâthose farther away from both rivers and railroadsâto grow crops and participate in trade, ending what was until then a very slow pace of economic development. By 1912 Governor Benito Natividad had appropriated funds to fast-track the building of roads and bridges linking these remote towns and municipalities to then provincial capital Cabanatuan.
The American government also constructed three major irrigation facilities: 1) The Talavera Irrigation System in 1924; 2) Penaranda River Irrigation System in 1930 and 3) Pampanga River Irrigation System in 1939.
By the time these irrigation systems went in full swing, combined with the railway system and the many rice mills, Nueva Ecija had been established as the "Rice Granary of the Philippines." From 1930 to 1939, rice production in Nueva Ecija was averaging more than 9 million cavans of rice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/452d8/786/|title=The Rice Granary of the Philippines|publisher=kylian74[/tpl]

====Homesteading and US-style tenancy====

Unlike the American pioneers of the Old West, Filipinos were not so willing to occupy remote, unsettled and undeveloped areas. So when the American colonial government introduced homesteading, there were few takers among Filipinos. Essentially, homesteading happens when someone lays claim on, harnesses the resources and develops a parcel of land, even if it's still wilderness and far from population centers, for economic use. Homesteading could be done through a legal process of acquiring a land title, or even without a title at all. In the latter case however, the lack of a title makes the informal homesteader vulnerable to any legal action attempting to take the land away from him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dar10.org.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=35|title=Agrarian Reform History|publisher=Department of Agrarian Reform[/tpl]
When the Philippine Bill of 1902 was passed by the US Congress, the US colonial government was formally established in the Philippine islands. This meant the colonial government now had the authority to dispose of public lands on it own, without having to seek the approval of the President of the United States. Based on an earlier survey of public lands by the Philippine Commission, the new American colonial government offered public lands to settlers through homesteading, sale, purchase or lease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/philippinebillof1902.htm|title=THE PHILIPPINE BILL OF JULY 1, 1902|publisher=chanrobles.com[/tpl]
Under the American regime's homesteading system, an individual could get up to 16 hectares of land, while a corporation could get as much as 1,024 hectares. This did not result in a wide settlement of lands throughout the country, however. Nueva Ecija was one exception, as more an more settlers opted to homestead its lands. A 1928 Statistical Bulletin records nearly 70,000 hectares were given to more than five thousand homestead applicants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/|title=The United States and Its Territories (1870-1925:The Age of Imperialism)|publisher=quod.lib.umich.edu[/tpl]
Among the immigrant-settlers of Nueva Ecija, the Ilocanos were mainly responsible for opening up through their homesteads, the once sparsely populated, remote areas of the province. Much like the early American pioneers, the Ilocanos tamed the land and turned what was once hostile wilderness into habitable and productive land.
However, the homesteading effort under the American regime resulted in a drop in tenancy in 1918, it ultimately failed in succeeding decades. This was due to two major factors. First, the new farmer-settlers did not have enough capital to sustain farming costs. Without any financial assistance available from the government that granted them the land, farmer-settlers accumulated huge debts at very high interest rates from usurious moneylenders. Most of these homesteaders were later forced to sell their land and become tenant farmers instead.

====Civil government in the American period====

The civil governments established in various provinces in the Philippines under the American Occupation were supposed to teach Filipinos the basic principles of democracy, following US military rule. In general, each provincial government presided over local governments in each town or municipality. In turn, each municipality would have a president, vice-president and municipal councillors. These were elected by a select group of qualified electors for two-year terms.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2006/08/18/the.government.during.the.american.regime.html|title=The Government During the American Regime|work=The News Today|date=August 18, 2006|author=Henry F. Funtecha[/tpl]
The second Philippine Commission went to what was then Nueva's provincial capital, San Isidro, on June 8, 1901 to begin proceedings for establishing the local and provincial governments. 16 out of Nueva Ecija's 19 towns were represented in the meeting. Elections of various representatives from the different towns were carried out successfully.
However, there was still the thorny problem of deciding whether or not to move the provincial capital. The dilemma was caused by events related to the PhilippineâAmerican War. First, Nueva Ecija had been a hotbed of resistance against the American Occupation, and was therefore in a state of siege. Four of its towns, Balungao, Rosales, San Quentin and Umingan, which were further away from the capital and already considered pacified by US forces, had been annexed to the province of Pangasinan.
The newly elected Nueva Ecija representatives were of the view that since a civil government under the Americans was already being established, it was time to return the four towns to Nueva Ecija. This would benefit the province as the four town were rich in natural resources. The fact that the towns were quite far from the capital, one of the representatives suggested, was no obstacle: the provincial capital could simply be moved to Cabanatuan. Other representatives objected to this proposal, pointing out that Cabanatuan had no infrastructures wherein to house the provincial government.
The matter was not resolved until two years later, when the US governor-general signed Act No. 1748,[tpl]cite web|url=http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/act1748.html|title=Act No. 1748|publisher=philippinelaw.info[/tpl] ordering the transfer of the capital to Cabanatuan by 1912.
The civil provincial government of Nueva Ecija was formally established by the Taft Commission[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/taft-commission.htm|title=The Taft Commission|publisher=philippine-history.org[/tpl] on June 11, 1901. The very first governor under this new system was Epifanio de los Santos. Interestingly, the main artery connecting most of Metro Manila has been named after Governor de los Santos, which is Epifanio de los Santos Avenue or simply, EDSA.

====Education during the American period====

It was the Americans who succeeded in making education widely available to Filipinos. While the Spanish government did, rather belatedly in their rule (in the middle of the 19th century), decide to establish public schools, it was the Americans who were able to improve it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etravelpilipinas.com/about_philippines/American_government_gave_importance_to_Education.htm|title=American Government Gave Importance to Education|publisher=etravelpilipinas.com[/tpl]
A report of the United States' Philippine Commission in 1900 showed, only 10 out of 23 municipalities in Nueva Ecija had a public school established during the Spanish times and according to the Philippine Commission figures by 1902, 37 public primary schools were established, and 63 Novo Ecijano teachers supported by 16 American "Thomasites", part of the larger group of some 500 pioneer American teachers who arrived aboard the [tpl]USS|Thomas[/tpl] in September 1901, to help establish an American public school system in the Philippines.
The Education Act No. 74 approved by the Philippine Commission in 1901[tpl]cite web|url=http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/act74-education-act-of-1901.html|title=Education Act of 1901|publisher=philippinelaw[/tpl] proved to be the catalyst that made Novo Ecijanos rally behind the local and American teachers to make sure as many children as possible benefitted from the public school system.
People contributed in the form of cash, construction materials or labor, and even vacant lots for the building of schools. Community support for the building of schools was such that by 1906, there were already 99 schools in Nueva Ecija. The Novo Ecijanos' high regard for the value of an education is a trait that persists until today.
The public schools system was still hampered by a lot of problems, however. Relying only on local support, Nueva Ecija (and other places in the Philippines as well) could simply not meet the increasing needs of a growing number of schools, teachers and students. Given the high premium placed by Novo Ecijanos on education, a legislator from Nueva Ecija took the crucial step to compel the American colonial government to allot funding for public education via a legislative act.
Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of Nueva Ecija filed an education bill before the 1907 Philippine Assembly, which would later be approved and known as the Gabaldon Education Act. The bill required government to earmark P1,000,000 for public schools throughout the Philippine islands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Philippine_Legislature|title=First Philippine Legislature (Act No. 1801) (Gabaldon Act)|publisher=Wikipedia[/tpl]
Nueva Ecija benefitted tremendously from the new education law. By 1908 Nueva Ecija had 144 primary schools, 11 non-sectarian private schools, 18 sectarian private schools, nine intermediate schools, one vocational school and one agricultural school, the Central Luzon Agricultural School, which is currently now operating as Central Luzon State University.

===World War II===

During World War II the Imperial Japanese Army entered the province and Nueva Ecija was taken in 1942. On March 29, 1942, under the leadership of Luis Taruc the Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon-People's Army Against the Japanese) was organized in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San Julian in the town of Cabiao.  It was perceived to be the military arm of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (Communist Party of the Philippines), that brought about the beginning of the early organized resistance of the Filipino people.[tpl]cite book|last=Kerkvliet|first=Benedict J.|title=The Huk Rebellion: A Study of Peasant Revolt in the Philippines|year=1977|publisher=google books|url=http://books.google.com/?id=h5Xq7nQE_ZoC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Talavera+1945#v=onepage&q=Talavera%201945&f=false|isbn=9780742518681[/tpl]

Aurora) from 1942 to 1945 and aided the local recognized guerrillas and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas against the Japanese Imperial forces since the Japanese Counter-Insurgencies (1942-1944) and the Allied Liberation (1944-1945).
In January to August 1945, combined American and Filipino soldiers liberated Nueva Ecija with the recognized guerrillas continuing to harass the Japanese at every opportunity. When Filipino soldiers of the 2nd, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-invading launches to entering liberated the province of Nueva Ecija and helping recognized guerrilla resistance fighter units, the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas and the American troops against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Invasion of Nueva Ecija. On January 30, 1945 American Army Rangers, Alamo scouts and Filipino guerrillas conducted a raid to liberate Allied civilians and prisoners of war in Cabanatuan, this was successful with over 516 rescued.[tpl]cite web|title=1945 Great Raid on Cabanatuan Prison|url=http://olive-drab.com/od_history_ww2_stories_1945cabanatuan.php|publisher=Olive-Drab[/tpl]  By January 31, 1945, the liberated civilians and POWs reached Talavera, the rescue is commemorated in Talavera.

==Festivals==

At the crack of dawn, scores of mud-covered, barely dressed devotees make their appearance, asking for alms and candles form the wide awake town folks.

Hundreds of years ago, here in Central Luzon, landlords in the haciendas made the farmers build the "damara", just before planting time of palay. A "damara" is a makeshift shelter made from kawayan (bamboo) and nipa, built at the center of ricefields as a protection from the sun's heat or from rain. Over the years, it has been tradition that after all the harvests were safely brought home, the "damaras" are demolished ("ginigiba"). People then start celebrating together for the bountiful harvest.
In 2008, with rice as its primary produce, San Jose City conducted its First Rice Festival, adopting the centuriesâold festive tradition. However, unlike in older days, wherein people celebrate separately in their barangays, San Jose City now celebrates as one big family. The after-harvest celebration has become a multi-sectoral effort, collectively prepared, funded out of contributions (from the public and private sector), and participated in by all sections of the city.
