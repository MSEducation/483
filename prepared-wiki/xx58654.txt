[[Temporal Cold War]]

CATEGORIES: Star Trek wars and battles, Time travel in fiction, Alternate Nazi Germany films

The Temporal Cold War is a fictional conflict waged throughout history in the Star Trek universe, predominantly during the 22nd century AD. First established in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Enterprise and recurring until the series' fourth season premiere, it is a struggle between those who would alter history to suit their own ends and those who would preserve the integrity of the original timeline.  One reason for using this plot device was in order to explain any differences in continuity between the events and details portrayed in Enterprise and the corresponding events and details shown in earlier Star Trek series and stories.  It also derived some dramatic resonance from the historical Cold War between the US and the USSR which influenced the original Star Trek series.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MzXpbyPRVYoC&pg=PA126|pages=126â€“127|year=2006|title=Beyond representation|isbn=978-0-7190-7458-5|author=Geraldine Mary Harris[/tpl]

===Throughout history===

The Temporal Accords were a historic agreement to preserve the integrity of the timeline.  Its principles were rejected by Vosk, who initiated an outright war using stealth time travel.  Unlike Earth's historical Cold War, the Temporal Cold War involves countless unknown factions, each with its own agenda. Humanity in the 31st Century is attempting to ascertain the identity of their adversaries and to thwart their efforts.
Although the scope of the war was unprecedented, most of its casualties were unaware that they were involved in an organized conflict, hence the term "Cold War". Timelines were changed frequently, with history being rewritten or significant events being erased. Eventually the struggle broke out into full-scale war.
One front of the war was fought in the 22nd century, the main focus point at where the Federation was founded. One faction, the Sphere Builders, who knew that they would be defeated by the Federation during the 26th century, convinced the Xindi to destroy Earth: no Earth, no Federation, no one to stop them.  The Earth starship Enterprise managed to stop them and send them back into their trans-dimensional realm.
However, this was not the end, for the dangerous time faction, the Na'kuhl, led by Vosk, ended up in 1944. They made an alliance with the Germans to exchange technology for supplies for a "temporal conduit". In an alternate timeline, they went back to their time period and made several alterations to history, causing a "chicken or the egg" paradox. Luckily, Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the Enterprise were sent back in time by Daniels to before the Na'kuhl entered the conduit in New York City, and, with the help of Silik (the leader of the Suliban Cabal), destroyed the conduit. In the subsequent explosion, Vosk was killed. As a result, the Cold War "never heated up", and the present timeline was restored.

====Apocryphal events from DTI: Watching the Clock====

Cristopher L. Bennett's novel Star Trek: Department of Temporal Investigations: Watching the Clock establishes that a lot of other time travel related events occurring in the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th century during the events of several Star Trek episodes and films are in fact more or less related to the Temporal Cold War. For example the temporal vortex device the Borg use in First Contact is given to them by the Sphere Builders in an attempt to prevent the Federation from ever existing.

==Controversy==

According to Manny Coto, a new executive producer during the fourth season, his fellow producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga never fully planned out the Temporal Cold War storyline.http://www.greatlink.org/showtglinterview136.htm According to Braga himself, they did not even firmly decide on the identity or back story of the 28th century leader of the Cabal.http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/6193.html At the end of the second season of Enterprise, poor ratings and reviews led to a new attempt to revamp the show by creating the Xindi race.
By the end of the third season, Coto felt the need for change, one of these being the removal of the TCW arc. According to him, "I felt that everything that had been said about the Temporal Cold War had already been said. I felt a heavy reliance on time travel at the beginning of Enterprise."http://www.galileo7.de/board/lofiversion/index.php/t1111.html Nevertheless, he says "I was secretly hoping for a season five to address the time travel."
