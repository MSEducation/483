The Geological Society of America (or GSA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of the geosciences.  The society was founded in New York in 1888 by Alexander Winchell, John J. Stevenson, Charles H. Hitchcock, John R. Procter and Edward OrtonEditor (26 August 1938) "The Semi-Centennial Meeting of the Geological Society of America" Science (New Series) 88(2278):  p. 183 and has been headquartered at 3300 Penrose Place, Boulder, Colorado, USA, since 1972.  The stated mission of GSA is "to advance geoscience research and discovery, service to society, stewardship of Earth, and the geosciences profession". Its main activities are sponsoring scientific meetings and publishing scientific literature, particularly the journals Society of America Bulletin (commonly called "GSA Bulletin") and Geology. A more recent publication endeavor is the online-only journal Geosphere. In February 2009, GSA began publishing Lithosphere. GSA's monthly news and science magazine, GSA Today'', is open access online.
The society has six regional sections in North America, an international section, and seventeen specialty divisions.
GSA began with 100 members under its first president, James Hall.  Over the next 43 years it grew slowly but steadily to 600 members until 1931, when a $4 million endowment from 1930 president R.A.F. Penrose, Jr. jumpstarted the GSA's growth. As of April 2013, GSA has more than 25,000 members in over 100 countries.

Annual meetings consist of oral and poster presentations about geology, along with field trips, short courses, and other activities. Another big part of the annual meeting is the Exhibit Hall, which includes the Graduate School Information Forum and booths for companies, suppliers, other geoscience organizations, and purveyors of goods and services.

==Position Statements==

As the need arises, GSA issues Position Statements "in support of and consistent with the GSA's Vision and Mission to develop consensus on significant professional, technical, and societal issues of relevance to the geosciences community. Position Statements, developed and adopted through a well-defined process, provide the basis for statements made on behalf of the GSA before government bodies and agencies and communicated to the media and the general public."GSA Position Statements
For example, in 2006, the GSA adopted the Position Statement Global Climate Change:
