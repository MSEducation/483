NOMOS Glashütte is a German watchmaking company based in Glashütte, Saxony, which specializes in manual-winding and automatic mechanical watches. Since 2005, NOMOS has been designing and producing its watch movements in-house. NOMOS Glashütte homepage - The Movements
The company was founded in January 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by Roland Schwertner. The designs for the first collection were drawn up by Susanne Günther, drawing influence from Bauhaus purist style. These watches have since gone on to become design classics and win multiple awards.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - Prizes and Awards In its early years, the company focused on manufacturing mechanical watches with hand-wound movements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/salon-qp/9615029/nomos-glashutte-watches-tangente.html |title=SalonQP spotlight shines on NOMOS Glashütte watches |publisher=Telegraph |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl] The basis for the movement was, until 2005, the Swiss-made ETA SA / Peseux 7001. 
Since April 2005, NOMOS Glashütte has only used in-house built movements. Starting with α (Alpha), a manual winding caliber, the range has since expanded to include a range of other manual winding movements with additional functions: β (Beta), with a date indicator; γ (Gamma), with a power reserve indicator; and δ (Delta), with both a date and power reserve indicator. 
The first NOMOS watch with automatic winding, Tangomat, was first introduced in summer 2006. It is powered by the ε (Epsilon) caliber, while the automatic ζ (Zeta) caliber - which includes a date indicator - can be found in the Tangente Datum models. Over 2008 and 2009, the company grew considerably, expanding its R&D department and number of employees.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - Curriculum Vitae Since 2010, NOMOS Glashütte has also expanded its range of watches to include several new models and sizes; notably three world timers - powered by the new ξ (Xi) caliber - and the eighth watch model, Ahoi, in 2013.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - News from Glashütte
