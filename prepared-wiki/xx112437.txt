==Bus connections==

Green Street was not built as a bus transfer station, and lacks an off-street busway. Since the  48 Jamaica Plain Loop, Monument - Jackson Square Station via Green Street & Stony Brook Stations route was discontinued on July 1, 2012, Green Street and nearby Stony Brook have no direct bus connections.  Forest Hills, the next stop to the south, is a major bus transfer station.
The 42 Forest Hills Station - Dudley or Ruggles Station via Washington Street route runs three blocks to the east on Washington Street.
