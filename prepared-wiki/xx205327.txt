The Scenics are a band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, active from 1976 to 1982, and from 2008 to the present. Their style incorporates punk rock, post-punk, and art punk. The Scenics appeared both in the 1979 Colin Brunton documentary film The Last Pogo and on the accompanying soundtrack album And Now Live from Toronto The Last Pogo with two tracks.
In 1980 the band released a full-length album, Underneath the Door on the Bomb Records label. Finally, in 1981, they released a single "Karen" b/w "See Me Smile" on their own Scenic Route Records label.[tpl]cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/S/Scenics.html | title = The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia | accessdate = 2011-02-09 | last = Vernon | first = Jaimie | date = 2004-12-07 | work = Jam!

First formed in 1976 by Andy Meyers (guitar/vocals/bass) and Ken Badger (guitar/vocals/bass), the Scenics were one of the most intrepidly inspired bands of the Toronto new wave/punk scene. [/tpl] The group reformed in early 2008 and has even played a few gigs to support the release including an appearance at the June 2008 NXNE Festival in Toronto, Canada.
In October 2009, the band released another compilation from their recording vaults, "Sunshine World (Studio Recordings 1977-78)". To promote the release, that same month, the band performed a series of live dates in Ontario and Quebec.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/74267/new-scenics-albums-coming | title = The Scenics Return, New Album Coming | accessdate = 2011-02-09 | last = Harper | first = Kate | date = 2009-09-09 | work = CHARTattack | publisher = CHART Communications | quote = The Scenics, the Toronto band who were part of the 1978 Last Pogo punk concert at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern, will release a collection of unearthed studio recordings, Sunshine World, on Oct. 13[/tpl]
