Michael Davis Pratt (born March 10, 1957) known professionally as Jim White, is a Southern American singer-songwriter and guitarist. White's music can be loosely described as alternative country, but veers off in different, sometimes experimental directions with occasional nods[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
to Tom Waits and the literary narratives of Flannery O'Connor, Cormac McCarthy, and Harry Crews.

==Early life==

White was born in California but moved to Pensacola, Florida at the age of 5 .He was influenced in his childhood by gospel music.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p128338|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Biography |accessdate=2008-06-01 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=Allmusic [/tpl] According to various sources, he has been a comedian, a fashion model, a boxer, a preacher, a professional surfer, and a New York cab driver.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/jim-white.shtml |title=Jim White Interview |accessdate=2008-06-01 |last=White |first=Jim |coauthors=BBC Four |date=2004-06-22 |work=BBC Four Documentaries |publisher=BBC [/tpl] Before embarking on a music career, White attended film school at New York University. Soon after finishing his lengthy thesis at the university, White entered a self-described "deep hole of sickness and depression and poverty."[tpl]cite journal |last=White |first =Jim |coauthors=Henderson, Steve |title=Jim White – The Triste Interview |journal=Triste Magazine |issue=4 |url=http://www.triste.co.uk/white.htm |accessdate=2008-06-01 [/tpl] However, during a party organized by film school friends, White began to perform, and began writing material for an album soon afterward.

==Musical career and performances==

White's live shows, particularly when touring solo, can be characterized as off-beat, blending his playlist with open discussion with the audience, anecdotal storytelling derived from his own life experiences, all of which is typically humorous and insightful,with a deep sense of his feeling for the broken beauty of humanity. He has stated during shows that ultimately he wishes to return to the academic field, particularly as a professor, rather than continue as a professional, touring musician. Much of this is due to his family life, which he has stated takes priority in his life and is the reason he does not like touring very much. His sister, Katherine Pratt, teaches at Loyola Law School.
White's band has no fixed lineup, but regularly includes musicians such as Dan Nettles (Electric Guitar); Peter Alvanos, Robby Handley, Steve Bishop Maples (Bass); Rob McMaken (Dulcimer, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin), Marlon Patton (Drums) and Mark Tulk (Keys).
White's albums often feature collaborations. On Wrong-Eyed Jesus, folk singer Victoria Williams sings on the track "Angel-Land"; British electronica trio Morcheeba produced and played on three tracks on No Such Place. Aimee Mann, Barenaked Ladies, and jazz guitarist Bill Frisell appear on Drill a Hole in That Substrate and Tell Me What You See, which was produced by Joe Henry, Tucker Martine, and Jim White himself. In an interview with David Byrne, White describes the making of the album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.luakabop.com/jim_white/cmp/talk.html |title=David Byrne & Jim White Talk and Talk and Talk |accessdate=2008-06-01 |last=White |first=Jim |coauthors=Byrne, David |date=2000-12-21 |work=luakabop.com |publisher=Luaka Bop [/tpl] In 2006, Jim White collaborated with Johnny Dowd and Willie B and formed a group called Hellwood; in 2006, the band toured throughout Europe to promote the album Chainsaw of Life. More recently, Jim White served as producer and songwriter on a collaboration alongside Tucker Martine and blues singer Linda Delgado, on a project entitled Mama Lucky. Mama Lucky's first release 'Permanent Stranger' was released February 2009.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/mamalucky |title=Mama Lucky[/tpl]

Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus is a 2004 BBC documentary, directed by Andrew Douglas, in which Jim White describes his idea of the rural South. The film features performances by like-minded musicians such as The Handsome Family, David Eugene Edwards of 16 Horsepower and Johnny Dowd.
