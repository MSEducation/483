[[Coat of arms of Belize]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Belize, National coats of arms

The Coat of Arms of Belize was adopted upon independence, and the current coat of arms is only slightly different from that used when Belize was a British colony.Arms of BELIZE - Heraldry of the World. Retrieved 10 March 2012.
The circular border of the coat is formed by fifty leaves. Within the circle is a mahogany tree, in front of which is a shield tierced per pall inverted.  Within the shield are the tools of a woodcutter in the upper sections and a ship in the lower one.  These are symbolic of the importance of mahogany in the 18th and 19th century Belizean economy.[tpl]cite web|title=The National Symbols|url=http://www.belize.gov.bz/index.php/component/content/article/26-about-belize/115-the-national-symbols|publisher=Government of Belize|accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl] 
The shield is supported by two men of different shades of brown.  The one on the left is holding an axe, while the one on the right is holding an oar.  Again the importance of the mahogany and its importance to boat building are represented.  At the bottom is the national motto: SUB UMBRA FLOREO (Under The Shade I Flourish).
The flag of Belize features the coat of arms in its center.
