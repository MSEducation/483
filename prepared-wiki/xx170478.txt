Parachromis friedrichsthalii, the Yellowjacket cichlid, is a species of cichlid native to Central America where it is found along the Atlantic Slope in Mexico, Belize, Honduras and Guatemala.  This species grows to a length of [tpl]convert|28|cm|in[/tpl] SL.  This species is popular with anglers as a gamefish and can also be found in the aquarium trade.[tpl]FishBase species |genus= Parachromis|species= friedrichsthalii| month = April | year = 2013[/tpl]
P. friedrichsthalii has an unusual hunting mechanism. The species has been observed to lie immobile near the bottom, feining death.  When smaller fish approach and attempt to pick at the dead fish, P. friedrichsthalii ambush the smaller fish. Similar behaviour has also been observed in some species of Lake Malawi cichlids, particularly from the genus Nimbochromis.[tpl]cite journal | first = M | last = Tobler | year = 2005 | title = Feigning death in the Central American cichlid Parachromis friedrichsthalii | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 66 | issue = March | pages = 877–81 | doi = 10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00648.x | accessdate = [/tpl]

==Description==

Physically similar to other members of the genus, especially P. managuensis and P. motaguensis, P. freidrichsthalii holds the broken band which runs horizontally through the flaml of the fish. The most distinct characteristic which enables the correct identification of this fish, is the golden-yellow colouration which is more prominent in this fish than the others.
However, P. loiselli also possesses such gold and yellow colouration. A distinct characteristic which enables these two fish to be easily separated is the distinctly un-broken dark band seen on P. friedrichsthalii. The dark spots which is found on P. loiselli ıs often so closely grouped that it appears to be a single solid band. P. loiselli can also be identified by its main colouration. Unlike all other members ın the genus, P. loiselli's main color is a solid yellow colouration. 

==Aquarium Care==

===Breeding===

Breeding can be achieved with very little effort and no specific requirements are needed for breeding purposes. As long as water conditions are maintained at a desirable high quality, a breeding pair of such fish will readily spawn. To enhance the likelihood of acquiring a breeding pair, purchase several healthy and active juveniles at a young age (between 6 -10) and grow these specimens until sexual maturity. Generally, you should be left with a breeding pair or two. These fish will noticeably become more aggressive and territorial, Remove all other fish at this point and keep the newly formed breeding pair separate. When a breeding pair had been successfully established, the male will begin to court the female by displaying his erect finnage to the female as he tries to impress her in an attempt for her to accept his mating invitation. The pair will begin to clean a flat surface if the female is responsive of the male's previous courting behavior. The female will then lay approximately 500 - 1000 orange coloured eggs which will then be fertilized by the male. The eggs will be ferociously guarded by both parents and a high degree of parental care is show to the eggs and fry. When the eggs 'hatch' after approximately 2 –3 days, the offspring (known as wrigglers at this stage in development) are defenseless and are unable to swim. They are often transported to pre dug pits by both parents, and are guarded. The fry will begin to swim in approximately 3–4 days and should be fed with baby brine shrimp or alike. If you choose to remove the fry from the parents, feed them baby brine shrimp until the stage where they are large enough to consume blood worm, daphnia and other live foods. However, removing the fry can interrupt the breeding cycle and cause the male to want to spawn again with the female before she is ready, and the male may injure or kill the female while attempting to force her to spawn. Since P. friedrichsthallii is not yet widely established in the aquarium hobby, it can be important not to mix fish from different localities when breeding. For example, there is a race endemic to Cenote Escondido near Tulum, Mexico that should not be breed with fish from other areas. Consequences from inbreeding fish are not as severe as those that occur when other animals are inbreed and are usually not noticeable until after many generations of inbreeding.

===Aquarium===

The aquarium should be large (400l +) for a breeding pair of yellow jacket cichlids. As with all members of its genus, these fish are large and heavily built cichlids who are aggressive and highly territorial. Decor should be kept to a minimum in such an aquarium and a sand or fine gravel should be used as the main substrate. Many pieces of flat slate or rock should also be included for the female to lay her eggs upon.

===Diet===

The Parachromis are not fussy eaters and will readily accept most food substances offered. Diet should be varied however. Offer a variety of insect, including blood worm, earthworm, mysis, crickets (for larger specimens). Chopped meat can also be offered along with beef heart (offer vary sparingly due to its high fat content) along with prawn and fish (live/frozen). Frozen fish is a much preferred method of feeding fish as many "feeder fish" carry the risk of the introducing disease into your aquarium, possibly harming your fish.

===Sexing===

Females are smaller than the male, and the red pigment seems more prominent in the gill plates. The red colouration is significantly prominent in the female in breeding colours. The male's dorsal and ventral fins are also much more extended and elongated than the female's.
