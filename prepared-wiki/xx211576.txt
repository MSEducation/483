[[Ultralimit]]

CATEGORIES: Geometric group theory, Metric geometry

In mathematics, an ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces Xn a limiting metric space. The notion of an ultralimit captures the limiting behavior of finite configurations in the spaces Xn and uses an ultrafilter to avoid the process of repeatedly passing to subsequences to ensure convergence. An ultralimit is a generalization of the notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces.

Actually, by construction, the limit space is always complete, even when (Xn,dn)
is a repeating sequence of a space (X,d) which is not complete.Bridson, Haefliger "Metric Spaces of Non-positive curvature" Lemma 5.53

==Asymptotic cones==

The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in geometric group theory since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their topological types and bi-Lipschitz types) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular.John Roe.
