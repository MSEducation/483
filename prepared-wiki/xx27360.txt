Incheon (Korean: 인천, 仁川 [tpl]IPA-ko|intɕʰʌn[/tpl]) literally 'wise river', formerly romanized as Inchon, and officially known as Incheon Metropolitan City, is a city located in northwestern South Korea, not too far from the Capital city of Seoul. The city was home to just 4,700 people when Jemulpo port was built in 1883. Today 2.9 million people live in the city, making it Korea’s third most populous city after Seoul and Busan Metropolitan City. While people have inhabited the area since the New Stone Age, the city’s growth was assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital at Seoul. It is part of the Seoul National Capital Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province; as such, Incheon is the world's fourth-largest suburb by population (after New Taipei, Yokohama, and Ekurhuleni).  A suburb here is defined as: not a central city from a business or infrastructure sense
Incheon has since led the economic development of Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as Korea’s first free economic zone. Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.
As an international city, Incheon has held numerous large scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair & Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 will also be held in Incheon from September 19, 2014. Incheon has established itself as a major transportation hub in northeast Asia with the world renowned Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port. The city is also home to the Green Climate Fund, an international organization addressing environmental issues.

==History==

The first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 CE. during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo by the name of "Michuhol," which is supposed to be located on today's Munhak Hill (문학산). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called Gyeongwon (경원) or Inju (인주). The current name was established in 1413. Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, 도호부). Old Incheon consisted of today's southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu-gu, and Namdong-gu) and northern part of Siheung City. The city centre was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office (도호부청사) and the local academy (hyanggyo, 향교) were located. The "original" two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from Munhak Baseball Stadium.
However, the name Jemulpo was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883.Incheon Metropolitan CityEwing, Stefan. "By Train from Seoul to Incheon -- and Jemulpo, too." Korea Web, 25 January 2006. After the opening of the Incheon port, the city centre moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered "Deep Incheon"(원인천). It was renamed as "Jinsen" during Japanese rule in Korean peninsula.
Incheon was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired. In 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former centre of Gwangyo) with Bupyeong County, forming Bucheon County. Through 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon City, by which some part of "old" Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.
On September 15, 1950, during the Korean War, Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon, when United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory.Bill Sloan, The Darkest Summer: Pusan and Inchon 1950: The Battles That Saved South Korea---and the Marines---From Extinction(2009) The [tpl]USS|Inchon|MCS-12|6[/tpl] was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.
Incheon was originally part of Gyeonggi Province, but was granted Directly Governed (now Metropolitan) City status on July 1, 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighbouring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo CountyPrior to 1973, the township belonged to Bucheon or old Bupyeong. were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo Country was annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.
Incheon was known as Inchon prior to South Korea's adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.
