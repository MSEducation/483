[[Cork on Sunday]]

CATEGORIES: Media in County Cork, Newspapers published in the Republic of Ireland

Cork on Sunday was a Cork Sunday newspaper serving Cork City and County which was published in 1996 and 1997. It was launched in August 1996 by Joseph O'Connor, formerly the boss of Cork super pirate ERI and operated from the former radio studios of both ERI and 96FM.
The newspaper was moderately successful with audited circulation of 4,500 copies per week during this period. This initial success prompted a fundraising effort to relaunch the newspaper in 1998 but new Cork On Sunday was cancelled in late 1998 due to technical difficulties and the withdrawal of a key investor.
The company which was established to launch the new Cork On Sunday later launched The East Cork Express which operated as a newspaper for the East Cork area from 2002 until 2005.
