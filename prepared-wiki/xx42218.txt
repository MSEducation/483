==Early life==

Geldof was born and brought up in Dún Laoghaire, Ireland, a son of Robert and Evelyn Geldof.[tpl]cite book | last=Geldof| first=Bob| title=Is That It?| publisher=Penguin| location=London| date=March 1987| edition=First Edition| pages=360 pages| isbn=978-1-55584-115-7[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article417890.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1| title=Ireland: The rat pack who looked after number one| last=Heaney| first=Mick| date=6 March 2005| work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=30 June 2009| location=London, UK[/tpl]  His paternal grandfather was a Belgian[tpl]cite news | title=Bob Geldof to receive BGU honorary doctorate| author=Nadav Shemer| url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/Bob-Geldof-to-receive-BGU-honorary-doctorate| newspaper=The Jerusalem Post| date=22 March 2011| deadurl=no| accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl] immigrant, Zenon Geldof, a hotel chef,[tpl]cite web | url=http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=tfschafart |title=Zenon Geldof : Belgian Master Chef |publisher=Arrow.die.ie |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl] and his paternal grandmother, Amelia Falk, was an English Jew from London.[tpl]cite news | title=Bob Geldof swaps punk for heavy medal show| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article3257025.ece| work=The Sunday Times| author=Maurice Chittenden| date=27 January 2008| accessdate=29 January 2008| location=London, UK[/tpl]  At the age of 41, Evelyn Geldof complained of a headache and died shortly thereafter of a cerebral haemorrhage. 
Bob Geldof attended Blackrock College, where he was bullied for being a poor rugby player and for his middle name, Zenon.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=16101| title=The World of Rugby League|publisher=rleague.com| accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl] After work as a slaughterman, a road navvy and pea canner in Wisbech, he was hired as a music journalist in Vancouver, British Columbia for Georgia Straight.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Musical career==

===The Boomtown Rats===

Returning to Ireland in 1975, he became lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, a rock group closely linked with the punk movement.
In 1978, the Boomtown Rats had their first No. 1 single in the UK with "Rat Trap", the first New Wave chart-topper in Britain. In 1979, they gained international attention with their second UK No. 1, "I Don't Like Mondays".[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2941142.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Geldof: From singer to saint | date=27 May 2003 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] This was both successful and controversial. Geldof had written it in the aftermath of Brenda Ann Spencer's attempted massacre at an elementary school in San Diego, California in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/justice-story-don-mondays-article-1.1504277 |title=Justice Story: 16-year-old girl shoots up school, tells reporter 'I Don't Like Mondays' |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]
In 1980, the Boomtown Rats released the album Mondo Bongo. Its single "Up All Night" was a hit in the U.S. and its video was played frequently on MTV.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/boomtownrats.htm |title=Boomtown Rats|author = Arthur Levy |publisher= Punk 77 |accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl]
Geldof became known as a colourful interview subject.  The Boomtown Rats' first appearance on Ireland's The Late Late Show saw Geldof as deliberately brusque to host Gay Byrne and during his interview he attacked Irish politicians and the Catholic Church, which he blamed for many of the country's problems.  He responded to nuns in the audience who tried to shout him down by saying they had "an easy life with no material worries in return for which they gave themselves body and soul to the church".  He also criticised Blackrock College.  The interview caused uproar, making it impossible for the Boomtown Rats to play in Ireland again.Bob Geldof – "Is That It?" (1985) # ISBN 0-330-44292-9 # ISBN 978-0-330-44292-3

===After the Boomtown Rats===

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986, to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, Is That It?, which was a UK best-seller.
His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics) and "The Great Song of Indifference". He also occasionally performed with other artists, such as David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Thin Lizzy. A performance of "Comfortably Numb" with David Gilmour is documented in the 2002 DVD David Gilmour in Concert. In 1992, he performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with the surviving members of Queen at the old Wembley Stadium, singing a song he had co-written with Mercury, called "Too Late God".
Geldof has also worked as a DJ for XFM radio.  In 1998, he erroneously announced Ian Dury's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/500829/geldof-falsely-reports-dury-death.jhtml |title=Geldof Falsely Reports Dury Death |publisher=  MTV |date=27 August 1998[/tpl] The event caused music paper NME (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of The Clash) to call Geldof "the world's worst DJ".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/330571.stm |title=Geldof's choice a hit  |publisher=  BBC News |date=28 April 1999[/tpl]
Along with U2's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for debt relief for developing countries. His commitments in this field, including the organisation of the Live 8 concerts, kept Geldof from producing any more musical output since 2001's Sex, Age & Death album.
In 2002, he was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a poll conducted among the general public,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm| title=100 great British heroes| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC| date=21 August 2002| accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl] despite the fact that he is Irish.
After Live 8, Geldof returned to his career as a musician by releasing a box set containing all of his solo albums entitled Great Songs of Indifference – The Anthology 1986–2001 in late 2005.  Following that release, Geldof toured, albeit with mixed success.
In July 2006, Geldof arrived at Milan's Arena Civica, a venue capable of holding 12,000 people, to play a scheduled concert to find that the organisers had not put the tickets on general sale and that only 45 people had shown up.[tpl]cite news | author=Barbara McMahon in Rome | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1827401,00.html |title=Guardian: Geldof cancels Italian tour after only 45 fans turn up for Milan gig |work=The Guardian |date= 24 July 2006|accessdate=10 August 2010 | location=London[/tpl]  Geldof refused to go on stage once he found out how small the attendance was. To offer some compensation for fans, Geldof stopped to sign autographs to those who had shown up.  He then played a well-attended free "Storytellers" concert for MTV Italy in Naples in October 2006.

==Charity work==

Geldof's first major charity involvement took place in September 1981, when he performed as a solo artist for Amnesty International's benefit show The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, at the invitation of Amnesty show producer Martin Lewis; he performed a solo version of "I Don't Like Mondays". Other rock artists had 'planted a seed' and appeared to have affected Geldof in a similar manner.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/1020/1160606784745.html |title=Fri, Oct 20, 2006 – REVOLVER |work=The Irish Times |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]

===Band Aid===

In 1984, Geldof responded to a BBC news report from Michael Buerk about the famine in Ethiopia by mobilising the pop world to do something about the images he had seen.[tpl]cite web|author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj2jf0US8zI |title=BBC on Ethiopian famine 1984 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]  With Midge Ure of Ultravox he wrote "Do They Know It's Christmas?" in order to raise funds. The song was recorded by various artists under the name of Band Aid.
In its first week of release the single became the UK's fastest seller of all time, entering the chart at number one and going on to sell over three million copies, making it the biggest-selling single in UK history up to that point, a title it held for almost 13 years. The single was also a major US hit, peaking at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. "Do They Know It's Christmas?" returned to the UK chart a year later, reaching number three, and eventually it raised over £8 million.
Following this massive success preparations were started for the biggest rock concerts the world had ever seen, the following summer.

===Live Aid===

As Geldof began to learn more about the situation, he discovered that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks. For every pound donated in aid, ten times as much would have to leave the country in loan repayments. It became obvious that one song was not enough.
On 13 July 1985, Geldof and Ure organised Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear its schedules for 16 hours of rock music, the event was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio.
It was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with Phil Collins flying on Concorde so that he could play at both Wembley and Philadelphia on the same day.
During the broadcast of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming his fist on the table and ordering them not to go out to the pub but to stay in and watch the show.
Nearly seven hours into the concert in London, Geldof gave an infamous interview in which he used the word fuck.  The BBC presenter David Hepworth, conducting the interview, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted: "Fuck the address, let's get the phone numbers!"  It has passed into folklore[tpl]cite web | title=1985 Live Aid – BBC web-site |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1985/music1.shtml |deadurl=no |accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl]  that he yelled at the audience, "Give us your fucking money!" although Geldof has stated that this phrase was never uttered.Geldof, Bob. Live Aid DVD.  Due to his Irish accent, the profanity was stated to be misheard as "fock" and "focking" respectively.  After the outburst, giving increased to £300 per second.
The harrowing video of dying, skeletal children that had been made by photo-journalists setting their films to the tune of "Drive" by the Cars, contributed to the concert's success.
In total, Live Aid raised over £150 million for famine relief.  Geldof was subsequently knighted, at age 34, for his efforts.  His autobiography, written soon after with Paul Vallely, was entitled Is That It?.Is that it? Bob Geldof with Paul Vallely, Macmillan, 1986  This book achieved further fame for being featured on the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination syllabus in a following year.
Much of the money raised by Live Aid went to NGOs in Ethiopia, some of which were under the influence or control of the Derg military junta. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and Oxfam money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.David Rieff  "Cruel to be kind?", The Guardian, 24 June 2005  However in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[tpl]cite web | last=Midgley |first=Neil |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8035539/BBC-apologises-to-Bob-Geldof-for-Band-Aid-slur.html |title=BBC apologises to Bob Geldof for Band Aid slur |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]

===Commission for Africa===

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid.  He rang the British Prime Minister Tony Blair from Addis Ababa.  According to the Live 8 programme notes by Geldof's biographer and friend, Paul Vallely, the Prime Minister responded: "Calm down Bob. ... And come and see me as soon as you get back.Live 8 programme notes by Paul Vallely "
The result was the Commission for Africa.  Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa's problems.  They came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve its governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support that change in new ways.  That meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules.  The Commission drew up a detailed plan of how that could be done.  It reported in March 2005.  To force the issue Geldof decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the G8.  He called it Live 8.  The Commission's recommendations later became the blueprint for the G8 Gleneagles African debt and aid package.

===Africa Progress Panel===

Geldof is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies.  In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[tpl]cite web | url=http://africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2012/ |title=Africa Progress Report 2012 |publisher=Africa Progress Panel |date= |accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl]  The 2013 report will outline issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

===DATA and the ONE Campaign===

Bob Geldof worked closely with DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt-relief, third world trade and AIDS relief in Africa.  It merged with the ONE Campaign in 2008, where Geldof also is very active.  In June 2009, on behalf of the ONE Campaign, he co-edited a special edition of the Italian newspaper La Stampa with a view on 35th G8 summit.[tpl]cite web | title=Direttore per un giorno |language=Italian |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/esteri/200907articoli/45157girata.asp |date=4 July 2009 |work=La Stampa |location=Italy |accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]

===Live 8 concerts===

On 31 March 2005, Geldof and Ure announced the Live 8 project, to raise awareness of issues that burden Africa, including  government debt, trade barriers, hunger, and AIDS issues.  Geldof organised six concerts on 2 July 2005 in large cities throughout the industrialised world.  They featured musicians from different genres and locations around the world.  The cities where Live 8 concerts were played were in industrialised countries, and drew huge crowds.  The locations were London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Philadelphia, Barrie, Chiba, Johannesburg, Moscow, Cornwall and Edinburgh.
The concerts were free, and were scheduled just days before world leaders gathered in Gleneagles, for the G8 economic summit, on 6 July.  Ure organised the 'final push' Live 8 concert at Edinburgh. 'The boys and girls with guitars will finally get to turn the world on its axis,' Geldof said in a statement.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.live8live.com/media/index.shtml |title=LIVE 8 – Media Centre |publisher=Live8live.com |date=29 July 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]  Pink Floyd's performance in London was its first since 1981 to include original bassist, Roger Waters, and the last to include keyboardist Rick Wright before his death in 2008.

==Criticism of his charity work==

Although part of the campaign "Make Poverty History" (MPH), Live 8 was accused by John Hilary, then a senior executive of the campaign, of hijacking MPH by planning its concerts on the same day as the march in Edinburgh, which was said to be the biggest social justice march in Scottish history.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/05/geldof-arrogance-poverty-agenda-starsuckers | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The arrogance of Saint Bob | first=John | last=Hilary | date=5 April 2010 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]
Geldof was also criticised for the lack of African acts performing at Live 8.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jun/15/live8 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Pressure forces Live 8 to add African concert | first=Sarah | last=Left | date=15 June 2005 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  Geldof responded that only the biggest-selling artists would attract the huge audience required to capture the attention of the world in the run-up to the G8 meeting.
In the lead-up to the G8 summit, Geldof, who had been a member of Tony Blair's Commission for Africa on which the Gleneagles recommendations were largely based,[tpl]cite news | first=Bob| last=Geldof| url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/mar/02/bob-geldof-africa-tony-blair| title=Bob Geldof: Gleneagles G8 summit was a triumph for Africa – and Tony Blair| date=2 March 2013| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=7 April 2014[/tpl] labelled Kumi Naidoo criticism of the summit "a disgrace".[tpl]Cite news | first=John| last=Hilary| url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/05/geldof-arrogance-poverty-agenda-starsuckers| title=The arrogance of Saint Bob| date=5 April 2010| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=7 April 2014[/tpl]  Some leading African campaigners have asked Geldof to stand down from the global anti-poverty movement, and the New Internationalist (between January and February 2006) said 'It would be long overdue if he did.'[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newint.org/columns/worldbeaters/2006/01/01/bob-geldof/ |title=Does Africa any longer need Bob Geldof as its champion? After Live 8 many people are saying no. |date=1 January 2006|work= New Internationalist |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]
There were also accusations that Live 8 gave unqualified support to the personal and political agendas of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, particularly in the lead up to an election.  Though many felt that it was the British politicians who had accepted Geldof's agenda, rather than the other way round, this led to accusations that Geldof had compromised his cause.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5220235-103677,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bards of the powerful | first=George | last=Monbiot | date=21 June 2005 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  
The promises made for Africa at the Gleneagles summit, were widely praised: "the greatest summit for Africa ever" (Kofi Annan), "an important, if incomplete, boost to the development prospects of the poorest countries" economist (Jeffrey Sachs) or "a major breakthrough on debt" (Kevin Wakins, former head of research at Oxfam).  But many aid agencies pronounced their disappointment with the outcome, feeling that the strict conditions imposed on African countries for accepting debt relief left them little better off than before. The New Internationalist stated, since becoming prominent in the salvation of Africa, "Geldof has re-released the entire back catalogue of the Boomtown Rats."
Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher became one of the more vocal skeptics about the impact of Live 8, citing his belief that rock stars have less influence over world leaders than popular culture may believe.  His explanation was:
 "Correct me if I'm wrong, but are they hoping that one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick 15-minute break at Gleneagles and sees Annie Lennox singing "Sweet Dreams" and thinks, 'Fuck me, she might have a point there, you know?'  And Keane doing "Somewhere Only We Know" and some Japanese businessman going, 'Aw, look at him. ... we should really fucking drop that debt, you know.'  It's not going to happen, is it?"[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jun/19/arts.live8 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Gallagher casts doubt on the value of Live8 | first=David | last=Smith | date=19 June 2005 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  

==Controversies==

At one point during his charity work, Geldof swore on CD:UK, thinking he could get away with it, when he said "Fuck the tape" whilst concluding his chat with Cat Deeley.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjZrUHGEHcA |title=Bob Geldof on CD:UK |deadurl=no |accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl]  At the NME awards in 2006, when accepting an award, Geldof referred to the host Russell Brand as a "cunt".  Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on 'I Don't Like Mondays' for 30 years".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jun/18/broadcasting.arts | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=This charming man | first=Barbara | last=Ellen | date=18 June 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]  Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl]  Winston Peters, the Minister of Foreign Affairs responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0607/S00212.htm |title=Geldof deserves support but has his facts wrong | Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]
During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis.  It was later revealed that he was paid A$100,000 for his speech, which included a luxury hotel room and first-class airfares.[tpl]cite news | title=Sir Bob Geldof wants $100,000 for anti-poverty speech | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sir-bob-geldof-wants-100000-for-anti-povery-speech/story-e6freuy9-1111118041648| accessdate=19 July 2010| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 November 2008[/tpl]

==Businessman==

By 1992 Bob Geldof had established himself as a businessman through co-ownership of the TV production company Planet 24, which featured early morning television with The Big Breakfast.

==Personal life==

Geldof's longtime girlfriend and eventual wife was Paula Yates.  Yates was a rock journalist, and later presenter of the music show The Tube which ran from 1982 to 1987.  She is known for her in-bed interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, from 1992.  Geldof met Yates when she became an obsessed fan of the Boomtown Rats during the band's early days.  They got together as a couple in 1976 when Yates flew to Paris to surprise him when the band was playing there.
Before they married, the couple had a daughter, Fifi Trixibelle Geldof, born 31 March 1983 (and while Geldof was still conducting an affair with the young Claire King). She was named Fifi after Bob's aunt Fifi, and Trixibelle because Yates wanted a belle in the family.  After 10 years together, Geldof and Yates married in June 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon (of Duran Duran) acting as Geldof's best man.  The couple later had two more daughters, Peaches Honeyblossom Geldof[tpl]cite web | url=http://twitter.com/peaches_g/status/10584937407 |title=Twitter / Peaches Geldof: Just to clarify once and f |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl] (known as Peaches Geldof) on 13 March 1989,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946809/bio|title=Peaches Geldof| publisher=IMDb.com| accessdate= 2014-04-10[/tpl] and Little Pixie Geldof (known as Pixie Geldof) on 17 September 1990.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2368067| title=Pixie Geldof| publisher=IMDb.com| accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]  Pixie is said to be named after a celebrity daughter character from the cartoon Celeb in the satirical magazine Private Eye, itself a lampoon of the names the Geldofs gave to their other children. Geldof has stated that his children find his music 'crap' and him an 'embarrassment'.[tpl]cite web | author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2jg5CwqN-s |title=Sir Bob Geldof interview – Parkinson – BBC |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=10 August 2010[/tpl]
In February 1995, Yates left Geldof for Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, whom she had first met back in 1985 when she interviewed him on The Tube.  Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996, and Yates moved in with Hutchence.  Hutchence was found hanged in a hotel room on 22 November 1997.  Geldof soon after went to court and obtained full custody of his own three daughters and has since become an outspoken advocate of fathers' rights.  After Paula Yates's death from a drug and alcohol overdose in 2000, Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Lily Hutchence, believing it best that she be raised with her three half-sisters.  In 2007, Geldof formally adopted her.
Regarding his Jewish ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester Jewish Telegraph, Geldof said “I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won.”[tpl]cite web | last=Shemer |first=Nadav |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=213237 |title=Bob Geldof to receive B...
