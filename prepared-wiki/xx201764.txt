It will not curdle when cooked or added to hot dishes. Its cooking properties are different from crème fraîche and the lighter sour creams sold in the U.S., which contain 12 to 16 percent butterfat.
Smântână is widely used in Romanian cuisine: in appetizers, main courses, soups and desserts. It is often added to ciorbă and other soups, and is used as a condiment for dumplings like mămăligă and sarmale.
