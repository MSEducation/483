[[.NET Bio]]

CATEGORIES: Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics software, .NET Software

.NET Bio is an open source bioinformatics framework that focuses primarily on genomics.  It may be used to create programs for processing biological data such as DNA and RNA sequences using Microsoft's .NET Framework.  It is similar in design and focus to other bioinformatics toolkits such as BioJava, BioPerl, and BioPython.

==History==

.NET Bio was originally built and released by Microsoft Research under the name Microsoft Biology Foundation (MBF) and was part of the Microsoft Biology Initiative in the eScience division. It was later repackaged and released by the Outercurve Foundation as a fully public and open source project under the Apache license.[tpl]cite web|title=MBF Becomes .NET Bio|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msr_er/archive/2011/10/18/microsoft-biology-foundation-evolves-into-new-toolkit-net-bio.aspx[/tpl]

==Capabilities==

The library consists of a set of object-oriented classes written in C# to perform common bioinformatic tasks such as:
Even though the library itself is written in C#, it may be used from any .NET compatible language and has samples of various usages including from IronPython scripting.
