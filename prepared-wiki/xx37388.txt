[[Timeline of Chinese history]]

CATEGORIES: China-related lists, History of China, History of the Republic of China, Chinese history timelines

The following is a timeline of the history of China. Between the changing of the dynasties, most dates overlap as ruling periods do not transfer immediately. Even in the simplest case the last year of one dynasty is the first year of the next dynasty, which amounts to counting that year twice, in terms of the arithmetic process used in the Gregorian calendar. The overlap could grow to many years in the case of dynasties in which the actual founder's father was posthumously declared as the official founder and the official founding date altered accordingly, despite the concurrent existence of the previous dynasty; for example, Wen of Zhou and Cao Cao. Dates prior to 841 BC (beginning of the Gonghe regency) are provisional and subject to dispute.
