===Critical reception===

The series pilot "And Jill Came Tumbling After" received mixed reviews with The Boston Herald claiming the show was "wicked fun" and praised the show's cast.[tpl]cite web|last=Perigard|first=Mark A.|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/reviews/view/20100617scoundrels_steals_spotlight_while_gates_totally_bites/ |title='Scoundrels' steals spotlight while 'Gates' totally bites |work=Boston Herald|date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] A reviewer from The Boston Globe was quoted to say "Not a single one of the characters were funny enough, or touching enough, to make me want to see more of them. If the Wests were thrown in jail, I’d be tempted to throw away the key."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/06/18/scoundrels_and_the_gates_try_their_best_to_warp_suburbia/ |title='Scoundrels' and 'The Gates' try their best to warp suburbia|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|work=Boston Globe|date=June 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] On the review collaboration site Metacritic, Scoundrels currently holds 56% (mixed or average) based on 18 critic reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/scoundrels |title=Scoundrels reviews at |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] The show's second episode Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary got overall a better response than the pilot with it earning positive reviews. TV Fanatic gave the episode 3/5 saying "the episode was an improvement on the pilot, with the characters developing and the show overall finding its tone and footing a bit." and "there were decent dramatic moments and good laughs in “Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary."http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/06/scoundrels-review-mary-mary-quite-contrary/
