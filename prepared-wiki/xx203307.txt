Battlemind is both the mental orientation developed during a combat zone deployment and a program developed at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) intended to reduce its impact on personal post-deployment issues.

==Mental orientation==

In the definition provided by the U.S. Army Medical Command

The significance of Battlemind in the Medical Command's context is that "Battlemind skills helped you survive in combat, but may cause you problems if not adapted when you get home."

==Program==

The first Battlemind product was a mental health post-deployment briefing. It quickly became a training system supporting soldiers and families across the seven phases of the deployment cycle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567 |title='Battlemind' Prepares Soldiers for Combat, Returning Home |author=Huseman, Susan |date=Jan 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=defenselink.mil| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080520122624/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567| archivedate= 20 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Battlemind system now includes separate pre-deployment training modules for soldiers, unit leaders, health care providers and spouses. Psychological debriefings are given in theater and upon redeployment. There is also a post-deployment module for spouses and several post-deployment modules for soldiers.

==Controversy==

Some veteran groups have expressed concern or curiosity about the effectiveness of the Battlemind program in addressing posttraumatic stress disorder.[tpl]cite web |title=A LOOK AT DoD's "BATTLEMIND" PROGRAM |url=http://www.vawatchdog.org/08/nf08/nfJAN08/nf010408-1.htm |author=Scott, Larry |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=VA Watchdog[/tpl]
