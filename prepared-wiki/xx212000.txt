==Notable projects==

Paul Lester Wiener collaborated with Le Corbusier. Wiener and Sert originated a master plan for the city of Bogota and several other city units in Colombia which were based on the principles of planning for expected population and organizing the growth of the city in and efficient manner, as well as reorganizing existing features to provide planned living and recreational space for residents with an eye to preventing the undesirable effects of random growth such as slum housing and inequitable distribution of land, etc.
In 1958, Wiener accepted his most significant commission in the United States: to plan a neighborhood development in the Washington Square area of New York City, providing several thousand housing units within a six block area. Combining his concepts of clean basic lines a functional form with bold color, he designed a series of high rise apartments which incorporated outdoor patio style living with the convenience of a central urban location and exciting visual environment.
