Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. is an American chain of combined restaurant and gift stores with a Southern country theme. The company was founded by Dan Evins in 1969; its first store was in Lebanon, Tennessee, which remains the company headquarters. The chain's  stores were at first positioned near highway exits in the Southeastern and Midwestern US, but it expanded across the country during the 1990s and 2000s. [tpl]As of|2012|09|18|df=US[/tpl],[tpl]cite web |url=http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/company-report?symbol=CBRL|title=Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc Company Profile |work=money.msn |date= |publisher=MSN |accessdate=December 31, 2012[/tpl] the chain operates 620 stores in 42 states.
Cracker Barrel's menu is based on traditional Southern cuisine, with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned general store. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a stone fireplace, and artifacts from the local area. Cracker Barrel is known for its partnerships with country music performers, and has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of Hurricane Katrina and injured war veterans.
During the 1990s, the company was the subject of controversy for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African American and female employees. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation found Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the Department of Justice, Cracker Barrel has implemented non-discrimination policies, and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.

==History==

===First location and early company history===

Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales representative for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales.[tpl]cite news |title=Along the interstate with Cracker Barrel |first=Liz |last=Rhein |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4S5W-1K80-TX4X-W1B5&csi=140610&oc=00240&perma=true |magazine=Restaurant Business |date=June 10, 1987 |issue=V86 |issn=0097-8043 |page=112 |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen to give it a Southern country theme,[tpl]cite news |title=Dan W.

The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee.[tpl]cite news |title=Nostalgia sells |first=Toddi |last=Gutner |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SJB-2X10-0019-F10P&csi=7986&oc=00240&perma=true |magazine=Forbes |date=April 27, 1992 |page=102 |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] It opened in September 1969,[tpl]cite news |title=Summer Tourists Improve Picture for Cracker Barrel |first=Susan |last=Adler Thorp |newspaper=Memphis Business Journal |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SND-S900-007B-43X7&csi=3559&oc=00240&perma=true |date=April 28, 1986 |page=10 |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and turnip greens.
Evins incorporated Cracker Barrel in February 1970, and soon opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages in the mid to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated more than half a million shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20 percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.

===New markets and refocus===

The company grew consistently through the 1980s and 1990s, attaining a $1 billion market value by 1992.[tpl]cite news |title=A barrel full of questions |first=Steve |last=Brooks |url=http://business.highbeam.com/137339/article-1G1-18064994/barrel-full-questions |magazine=Restaurant Business |date=March 1, 1996 |page=48 |accessdate=January 21, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Off the interstate and to the 'burbs |first=Gwen |last=Moritz |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3S7T-9FT0-008G-31MY&csi=3559&oc=00240&perma=true |magazine=Nashville Business Journal |date=April 25, 1994 |issue=V10 |page=33 |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] As of 1993, the chain's revenue was nearly twice that of any other family restaurant.
In 1994, the chain tested a carry-out-only store, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Corner Market, in suburban residential neighborhoods. In addition, it expanded into new markets through the establishment of more traditional Cracker Barrel locations, the majority of them outside the South, and  tested alterations to its menus to adapt to new regions.[tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel Customizes Menus, Changes Reflect Regional Tastes |first=J.

By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, and aimed to increase the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997, and refocused on its restaurant and gift-store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country-store setting, with good service and country music.[tpl]cite news |title=President: Cracker Barrel is Rolling Along |first=Susan G. |last=Strother |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-01/business/9802020469_1_cracker-barrel-barrel-old-country-restaurant |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel (Florida) |date=February 1, 1998 |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |page=H1[/tpl] The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama.[tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel opens new restaurants away from interstates |first=Ted |last=Jackovics |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-133622309/cracker-barrel-opens-new.html |newspaper=Tampa Tribune |date=June 26, 2005 |accessdate=January 21, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.[tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel celebrates 30th with book drive, sweepstakes |first=Stacey |last=Hartmann |newspaper=The Tennessean |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4969-FMN0-01D1-81V2&csi=255267&oc=00240&perma=true |date=May 21, 1999 |page=6E |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl]

===Recent operations===

The number of combined restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel increased between 1997 and 2000, to more than 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an order-placement system.[tpl]cite news |title=Fixing the Fixin's  |first=David  |last=Farkas |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62345581.html |newspaper=Chain Leader |date=May 1, 2000 |issn=1528-4999 |page=96 |accessdate=January 21, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl] From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers. It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway billboard advertisements to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo.[tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel overhauls billboards |first=Rose |last=French |url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Cracker-Barrel-overhauls-billboards-1855880.php |newspaper=The Houston Chronicle |date=November 23, 2006 |page=5 |accessdate=February 3, 2012[/tpl] By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states.[tpl]cite press release |title=Cracker Barrel Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter Conference Call on the Internet |url=http://investor.crackerbarrel.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=602026 |publisher=Cracker Barrel Old Country Store |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=Cracker Barrel Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Results And Provides Guidance for Fiscal 2012 |url=http://investor.crackerbarrel.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=604826 |publisher=Cracker Barrel Old Country Store |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 21, 2012[/tpl] It was announced on January 17, 2012, that company founder Dan Evins had died of bladder cancer.[tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel founder Dan Evins dies at 76 |author=Bobby Allyn |url=http://www.ongo.com/v/2861958/-1/E8D308997C2CB244/cracker-barrel-founder-dan-evins-dies-at-76 |newspaper=The Tennessean |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Policy toward sexual orientation===

In early 1991, an intra-company memo called for employees to be dismissed if they did not display "normal heterosexual values". According to news reports, at least 11 employees were fired under the policy on a store-by-store basis from locations in Georgia and other states. After demonstrations by gay rights groups, the company ended its policy in March 1991 and stated it would not discriminate based on sexual orientation.[tpl]cite news |title=Perseverance gains Cracker Barrel gift |first=Deb |last=Price |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=47HJ-6MY0-01CY-M44S&csi=255260&oc=00240&perma=true |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=December 23, 2002 |page=11A  |accessdate=January 25, 2012|subscription=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Cracker Barrel comes under fire for ousting gays |first= Jack |last=Hayes |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n9_v25/ai_10400309/ |newspaper=Nation's Restaurant News |date=March 4, 1991 |issue=V25 |issn=0028-0518 |page=1 |accessdate=February 3, 2012[/tpl] The company's founder, Dan Evins, subsequently described the policy as a mistake.

On December 20, 2013, Cracker Barrel announced it would no longer sell certain Duck Dynasty products which it was "concerned might offend some of its guests" after Phil Robertson, a star on the reality TV show, remarked in a GQ interview

Robertson also made "comments likening homosexuality to terrorism and bestiality" in the interview, and expressed views about race which attracted criticism.

In 2004, an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department found evidence that Cracker Barrel had been segregating customer seating by race; seating or serving white customers before seating or serving black customers; providing inferior service to black customers, and allowing white servers to refuse to wait on black customers. The Justice Department determined that the firm had violated Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The company was required to sign a five-year agreement to introduce "effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures". The terms included new equal opportunity training; the creation of a new system to log, investigate and resolve complaints of discrimination; and  the publicizing of its non-discrimination policies. They were required to hire an outside auditor to ensure compliance with the terms of the settlement.[tpl]cite news |title=Justice Department Settles Race Discrimination Lawsuit Against Cracker Barrel Restaurant Chain |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_crt_288.htm |newspaper=United States Department of Justice |date=May 3, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2012[/tpl]
