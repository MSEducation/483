[[Suph]]

CATEGORIES: Torah places

Suph is a place name that appears in Deuteronomy 1:1 (R.V. marg. "some ancient versions have the Red Sea," as in the A.V.). Some scholars identify it with Suphah (Numbers 21:14) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es-Sufah = Maaleh-acrabbim (Joshua 15:3), and yet others with Zuph (1 Samuel 9:5). It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e., the "Red Sea."
