CATEGORIES: Japanese emperors, 1285 births, 1308 deaths

Emperor Go-Nijō (後二条天皇 Go-Nijō-tennō) (March 9, 1285 – September 10, 1308) was the 94th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.  He reigned from March 3, 1301 until September 10, 1308.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, pp. 275–278; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki. p. 239.
This 14th-century sovereign was named after the 12th-century Emperor Nijō, and go- (後), translates literally as "later;" and thus, he is sometimes called the "Later Emperor Nijō". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the "second one;" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Nijō, the second," or as "Nijo II."

==Genealogy==

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was [tpl]nihongo| Kuniharu-shinnō |邦治親王[/tpl].Titsingh, p. 275; Varley, p. 239.
Go-Nijō was the eldest son of the 91st Emperor Emperor Go-Uda.  He belonged to the Daikakuji-tō branch of the Imperial Family.

==Events of Go-Nijō's life==

Kuniharu-shinnō was made an imperial prince by Imperial proclamation in 1286.
In 1296, he became crown prince (heir) to the Jimyōin-tō Emperor Go-Fushimi, his second cousin.
Go-Nijō's father, the Emperor Go-Uda reigned as cloistered emperor during his reign.
The succession dispute between the Daikakuji and Jimyōin branches of the Imperial Family continued during his reign.  His grandfather, the retired Emperor Emperor Kameyama was said to have acted through the Bakufu to ensure Go-Nijō's enthronement.
On September 10, 1308, Go-Nijō died of illness.
Go-Nijō is buried at Kitashirakawa no misasagi (北白河陵) in Sakyō-ku, Kyoto.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 422.

===Kugyō===

[tpl]nihongo|Kugyō|公卿[/tpl] is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Nijō's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:
