James Marion Asbell (born June 22, 1914 in Dallas, Texas) nicknamed "Big Train", was an outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Nicknamed "Big Train," his career was a brief one, consisting of a single season, the Cubs' World Series year of 1938.
After a college career that included stints at both Tulane and Rice, Asbell signed with the New York Giants. After some time in the minors, the Cubs took Asbell in the 1937 Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut with the Cubs on May 8, 1938. With the Cubs, Asbell appeared in just 17 games, playing only ten in the field. He committed no errors as a defender, but his offense was subpar, as he batted just .182 (6 for 33) with 2 doubles, 3 RBI, and no stolen bases. He played his last game as a Cub, and as a major leaguer, on October 2, 1938. He made no appearances with the club in the World Series.
Asbell died on July 6, 1967 in San Mateo, California.
