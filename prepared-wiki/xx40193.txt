</ref> A similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian [[clade]]s are compared (using rates averaged over [[macroevolution]]ary time scales). Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of ''body mass''<sup>0.259</sup> vs. time (in Ma) occurred in [[perissodactyl]]s (a slope of 2.1), followed by [[rodent]]s (1.2) and proboscids (1.1),<ref name = "Evans"/> all of which are hindgut fermenters. The rate of increase for [[artiodactyl]]s (0.74) was about a third that of perissodactyls. The rate for [[carnivora]]ns (0.65) was slightly lower yet, while [[primate]]s, perhaps constrained by their [[arboreal]] habits, had the lowest rate (0.39) among the mammalian groups studied.<ref name = "Evans"/>
Terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups (the mesonychid Andrewsarchus, the creodonts Megistotherium and Sarkastodon, and the carnivorans Amphicyon and Arctodus) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 kg (the carnivoran Arctotherium apparently actually got somewhat larger). The largest known metatherian carnivore, Proborhyaena gigantea, apparently reached 600 kg, also close to this limit. A similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals, the energetic cost of obtaining prey, and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake.[ref]
