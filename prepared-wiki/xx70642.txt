The Floating Admiral is a collaborative detective novel written by fourteen members of the Detection Club in 1931.  The twelve chapters of the story were each written by a different author, in the following sequence: Canon Victor Whitechurch, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole, Henry Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode, Milward Kennedy,  Dorothy L. Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Edgar Jepson, Clemence Dane and Anthony Berkeley. G. K. Chesterton contributed a Prologue, which was written after the novel had been completed.Charles Osborne, The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie, London, 1982. 
In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book.
As Sayers explained in the introduction to the book, "Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view—that is, he must not introduce new complications merely 'to make it more difficult' ... Each writer was bound to deal faithfully with all the difficulties left for his consideration by his predecessors."

==Literary significance and criticism==

"These members of the (London) Detection Club collaborate with skill in a piece of detection rather more tight-knit than one had a right to expect.  There is enough to amuse and to stimulate detection; and the Introduction by Dorothy Sayers and supplements by critics and solvers give an insight into the writers' thoughts and modes of work."Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig.  A Catalogue of Crime.  New York: Harper & Row.  1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989.  ISBN 0-06-015796-8
