==History==

The Old Bilibid Prison, then known as Carcel y Presidio Correccional (Spanish, "Correctional Jail and Military Prison") occupied a rectangular piece of land which was part of the Mayhalique Estate in the heart of Manila. The old prison was established by the Spanish colonial government on 25 June 1865 via royal decree. It is divided into two sections: the Carcel, which could accommodate 600 inmates; and the Presidio, which could hold  527 prisoners.
Due to increasing crime, the Philippine Government enacted Commonwealth Act No. 67 and a new prison was built in Muntinlupa on 551 hectares of land at an area considered at that time to be "remote". Construction began in 1936 with a budget of one million pesos. In 1940, the prisoners, equipment and facilities were transferred to the new prison. The remnants of the old facility was used by the City of Manila as its detention center then known as Manila City Jail. In 1941, the new facility was officially named "The New Bilibid Prison".

==Recreation and facilities==

The prisoners pass the time in the basketball court in the penitentiary's gymnasium and are also engaged in the production of handicrafts. Various religious denominations are active in the prison, with masses said daily in the prison's Catholic chapel. These religious groups, such as the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Amazing Grace Christian ministries, Philippine Jesuit Prison Service and Caritas Manila, also extend medical services to prisoners.
Educational facilities inside the compound provide elementary education, high school education, vocational training and adult literacy programs. It also provides a Bachelor's Degree in Commerce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/philippines_pdf/topic4.pdf|title=Community Involvement in the Rehabilitation and Treatment of Offenders|last=Liwag|first=Ramon J.|publisher=United Nations Asia and Far East Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. mabaho ang mga guard dito(UNAFEI)|accessdate=2008-05-25[/tpl] The New Bilibid Prison also houses a talipapa (market) where the prisoners can buy commodities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/oct/01/yehey/top_stories/20071001top6.html|title=New Bilibid to be like alien planet to Erap|last=Hicap|first=Jonathan M.|date=2007-10-01|publisher=The Manila Times|accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211152310/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/oct/01/yehey/top_stories/20071001top6.html  |archivedate = 2007-12-11[/tpl]
