[[Eurogas]]

CATEGORIES: Natural gas

Eurogas is the association representing the European gas wholesale, retail and distribution sector.
Founded in 1990, its members are some 50 companies and associations from 27 countries.
Eurogas represents the sector towards the EU institutions and, as such, participates in the Madrid Gas Regulatory Forum, the Gas Coordination Group, the Citizens Energy Forum and other stakeholder groups.
Its members work together, analysing the impact of EU political and legislative initiatives on their business and communicating their findings and suggestions to the EU stakeholders.
The association also provides statistics and forecasts on gas consumption, as well as information on energy taxation in Europe. For this, it can draw on national data supplied by its member companies and associations.

==History==

Eurogas was founded in 1990 to strengthen the representation of interests of the gas industry. It quickly replaced the informal grouping COMETEC-Gas (Committee for Economic Studies of the Gas Industry), a Brussels-based union representing the European gas industry.

==Missions==

Eurogas oversees the operation of the gas market and is devoted to strengthen the role of natural gas in the energy mix, by establishing an ongoing dialogue with European industry players, global producers of natural gas and relevant institutions such as the European Commission. 
Upon his arrival as President of Eurogas, Jean-François Cirelli has positioned natural gas as the energy solution of the future: "Gas is the only fossil fuel that is compatible with the development of 'green' energies. … Gas will be the fuel of choice for some decades."Jean-François Cirelli : Let the market choose what is best, europolitics.info
