Graz ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|æ|t|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|ɑː|t|s|[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈɡʁaːt͡s[/tpl]; Slovene: Gradec, [tpl]lang-hu|Grác[/tpl]) is the second-largest city in Austria after Vienna and the capital of the federal state of Styria (Steiermark). On 9. January 2014 it had a population of 303.731 (of which 271.998 had principal residence status).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.graz.at/Statistik/Bev%C3%B6lkerung/aktuelles_quartal.pdf|title=Anwesende Bevölkerung nach Wohnsitz und Gechlecht pro Bezirk - Stand 1.

Graz has a long tradition as a student city: its six universities have more than 44,000 students. Its "Old Town" is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Politically and culturally, Graz was for centuries more important for Slovenes than Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and still remains influential.[tpl]cite news |url=http://isn.zrc-sazu.si/files/file/Traditiones/Traditiones_35_2_Krek_separati/TR352%20099-103%20Granda.pdf |title=Gradec in Slovenci |language=Slovene, with a short abstract in English |first=Stane |last=Granda |year=2006 |publisher=University of Graz |journal=Traditiones |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=99–103 |accessdate=17 December 2010 (via Google Documents; http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:KsSTt5sfY7UJ:isn.zrc-sazu.si/files/file/Traditiones/Traditiones_35_2_Krek_separati/TR352%2520099-103%2520Granda.pdf+granda+gradec+slovenci&hl=sl&gl=si&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiyiNKQdxVieE89s2c8irLJ_Y7pplCPGUZxciVC_ERHycwKkALq3zwFtoF_N3_9QCodJRCu9jYcEgBEKh5IvguAAAPkSCfW4p15qd_3FXs-cnfgEHFe8WgxsOsI-7vm3fWIyP8a&sig=AHIEtbRJwxKwdl8G-BlsHzCdCpoCV95qxw)[/tpl]
In 1999, Graz was added to the UNESCO list of World Cultural Heritage Sites, and the site was extended in 2010 by Schloss Eggenberg. Graz was sole Cultural Capital of Europe for 2003 and got the title of a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.

==Etymology==

The name of the city, Graz (see the Slavic settlement Grad), and some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl], which in time became a heavily defended fortification. In literary Slovene, gradec literally means "small castle", which is etymologically a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *gradьcъ, itself by means of liquid metathesis descending from Common Slavic *gardьcъ, by Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku (cf. Ancient Greek toponym [tpl]lang|grc|Γαρδίκι[/tpl])  originally denoting "small town, settlement". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' was first used in 1128.

==Geography==

Graz is situated on the Mur River in the southeast of Austria. It is about [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Vienna. The nearest larger urban center is Maribor in Slovenia which is about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] away. Graz is the capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested area.

The city of Graz is divided into 17 districts:

==History==

The oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, there is no historical continuity of a settlement before the Middle Ages.
During the 12th century dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs, and in 1281 gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.
In the 14th century Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schloßberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).
In the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings built in this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.
The astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period. There, he worked as a math teacher, but found time to study astronomy. He left Graz to go to Prague when Lutherans were banned from the city.
Karl-Franzens Universität, also called the University of Graz, is the city's oldest university, founded in 1585 by Archduke Charles II. For most of its existence it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor Franz I, thus gaining the name 'Karl-Franzens Universität,' meaning 'Charles-Francis University.' Over 30,000 students currently study at this university.
Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in Graz in 1875. Nobel Laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andric, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature Laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Johannes Kepler was a professor of mathematics at the University of Graz. Erwin Schrödinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.
Adolf Hitler was given a warm welcome when he visited in 1938, the year Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. The thriving Jewish community was destroyed by the Nazis, and their grand synagogue was burnt. A small group of Graz Jews returned despite everything after the war. In 2000, on the anniversary of the Reichskristallnacht, Graz city council presented the Jewish community with a new synagogue as a gesture of reconciliation. Hitler promised the people of Graz 1,000 years of prosperity and an end to mass unemployment: only seven years later the Graz resistance surrendered the city to Soviet troops, sparing Graz any further destruction. By then about 16% of buildings had been destroyed by Allied bombing - luckily the Old Town was not seriously hit.
Graz lies in Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry are taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was often assaulted (unsuccessfully), e.g. by the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and by the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg, the Schloßberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of Baroque weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.
From the earlier part of the 15th century Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809 the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schloßberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Armée occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Schönbrunn of the same year. The belltower and the civic clock tower, often used as the symbol of Graz, were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.
Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz, in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).

==Population development==

The more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2006 there were 37,624 people with secondary residence status in Graz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/606066/EN/|title=Graz in Numbers|last=Tautscher|first=Sonja|date=7 January 2010|publisher=Stadt Graz - Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit|accessdate=7 May 2010|location=Graz[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/blickgem/blick1/g60101.pdf|title=Ein Blick auf die Gemeinde Graz |publisher=Statistik Austria|language=German|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]
The population (with principal residence status) in the agglomeration was about 320,000 at the end of 2006.

==Climate==

Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south. However, this milder, less windy climate is detrimental to the air quality in Graz as it makes the city prone to smog in winter. The exhaust fumes of the around 120,000 cars driven into Graz every weekday by people living in the surrounding areas, together with the car journeys made by the inhabitants of Graz itself, are the most significant source of air pollution.

==Slovenes and Graz==

The name of Graz is undoubtedly of Slovene origin and the city was Slovene for a short period.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2014[/tpl] Politically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-H9LFKLTH/? |title=Primeri nekaj sklanjatev in spregatev v Megiserjevem Dictionarium quatuor linguarum 1592 |trans_title=The Concise Grammar of Four Languages in Megiser’s 1592 Dictionary |language=Slovene, with an English abstract |journal=Jezikoslovni zapiski |volume=13 |issue=1/2 |year=2007 |publisher=Inštitut za slovenski jezik Frana Ramovša, ZRC SAZU |id=[tpl]COBISS|ID=26967085[/tpl] |pages=23–32 |issn=0354-0448[/tpl]
Styrian Slovenes did not consider Graz a German city, but their own, a place to study while living at their relatives' homes and to fulfill one's career ambitions.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Student associations in Graz were a crucible of Slovene identity and Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.
Nowadays, the city is cosmopolitan and quite fond of Slovenes. Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes had found employment there, while being formally unemployed in Slovenia. For Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.
A symposium on the relation of Graz and Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.srl.si/arhiv/2002-01/pdf/sumrada.pdf |title=Janez Nepomuk Primic in ustanovitev stolice za slovenski jezik na liceju v Gradcu 1811 |language=Slovene, with an English summary |trans_title=Janez Nepomuk Primic and the Establishment of the Chair of Slovene at the Lyzeum in Graz in 1811 |journal=Slavistična revija of Slavic Linguistics |volume=50 |date=January–March 2002 |issue=1 |issn=1855-7570[/tpl] A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.posta.si/downloadfile.aspx?fileid=18801 |journal=Razgledi: glasilo Pošte Slovenije The Bulletin of the Post of Slovenia |title=Predstavitev znamke v baročni dvorani graškega semenišča |publisher=Pošta Slovenije of Slovenia |first=Bojan |last=Bračič |date=November–December 2011 |editor=Korber, Mateja |issn=	1318-5705[/tpl]

==Main sights==

In the last few years some strikingly modern new public buildings have been erected in the city. The most famous include the Kunsthaus (house of modern art) designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier, a museum constructed right next to the river Mur, and the "Murinsel" (island in the Mur), an island made of steel, situated in the river. It was designed by the American architect Vito Acconci and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.

===Old town===

The old town was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/606777/EN/|title=A Short History of the City|last=Strobl|first=Alexander|date=8 July 2008|publisher=Stadt Graz - Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. |accessdate=7 May 2010|location=Graz[/tpl] due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the old town consists of over 1000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to Contemporary.
The most important sights in the old town are:

==Culture==

During 2003 Graz held the title of "European Capital of Culture" and is (as of 2011) one of the UNESCO "Cities of Design".

===Museums===

The most important museums in Graz are:

===Architecture===

There are currently 228 buildings in Graz that are classified as high-rise: the floor of at least one room is 22 metres above ground level. Such buildings have to adhere to much more stringent fire safety regulations because the ladders of the majority of fire appliances used by Graz Fire Brigade cannot reach higher than 22 metres.
There are some new high-rise buildings in the pipeline; the only ones that currently (June 2009) seem certain to be built are a 15-storey office block opposite the "Stadthalle" on the southern edge of the city centre and a 21-storey officeblock next to the motorway leading from the Graz Ost Interchange (road) into town.

==Transportation==

An extensive public transportation network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the new underground tramstop at the main train station (Hauptbahnhof)on to the old town before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.
The Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schloßberg.
From the main train station (Graz Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains also run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Prague in the Czech Republic, Budapest in Hungary and Zürich in Switzerland. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many train stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the "S-Bahn Graz", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.
Graz Airport is about [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the city centre and has a railway station ("S-Bahn") within walking distance (east of the airport). Graz Airport has flights to various destinations including Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin in Germany and Vienna.

==Health==

In Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.
The LKH-Universitätsklinikum Graz is one of the hospitals that can provide maximum care, with 1556 beds and 7190 employees. It covers the east of the city. In the west of the city there is the LKH Graz-West in Eggenberg with 280 beds and about 500 employees, the Landesnervenklinik Sigmund Freud (LSF) in Straßgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees, as well as the Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA in Eggenberg with 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.
Furthermore there is the geriatric hospital Albert-Schweitzer-Klinik in the west of the city with 304 beds, the Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Brüder I in Lend with 225 beds, the Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Brüder II in Eggenberg with 260 beds and the Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen in Gries with 182 beds.
There are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.
EMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF - Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen - ambulances staffed with a doctor in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen - regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW - Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross in order to organise transportation of non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs (Labor-Samaritan-Alliance), the Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria (the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps) and the Grünes Kreuz (Green Cross) operate various non-emergency ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transportation. In addition to the land-ambulances there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, which is also staffed with an emergency doctor in addition to regular personnel.
