[[Monoclea]]

CATEGORIES: Marchantiales

Monoclea is a genus of two species, of liverworts. It may be regarded as a family, Monocleaceae (of two species) in order Marchantiales.   Classifications of the late twentieth century recognized a separate order, Monocleales, but later molecular studies show that it is closely related to the liverwort genus Dumortiera.
