The system on higher education in Austria distinguishes between federal universities (Universitäten), private universities (Privatuniversitäten) and universities of applied science (Fachhochschulen). The three types are based on different laws. One of the main differences (but not the only) is funding. Two institutions in Lower Austria have a special legal status.
