Vincent Walker "Vince" Foster, Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was a Deputy White House Counsel during the first few months of President Bill Clinton's administration, and also a law partner and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton. As a private lawyer, Foster was rated one of the best in the United States. He was unhappy with work in politics, and spiraled into depression, leading to his suicide in 1993. His death remains a subject of interest among conspiracy theorists.

==Early life and education==

Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/docs/fosteriv.htm | title=Factual Summary: Mr. Foster's Background and Activities on July 20, 1993 | work=Whitewater: The Foster Report | publisher=United States Office of the Independent Counsel via The Washington Post | date=1997-10-11 | accessdate=2008-12-09[/tpl] mirror  His father was in real estate sales, and he had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.

Foster attended Davidson College, graduating in 1967. His father wanted him to go into the family real estate business, but he chose law instead.
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War.  In order to be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he was managing editor of the law review"Tribute to Vincent Foster, Jr.", Congressional Record, July 29, 1993. and received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1971, graduating first in his class.  Additionally he scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[tpl]cite web| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:H23JY3-401:/| title=Vince Foster: One of the Best and Brightest| accessdate=2006-05-02[/tpl]
Foster met Elizabeth (Lisa) Braden during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.  They married on April 20, 1968.[tpl]cite book | last=Kelley | first=Sarah Foster | title=Children of Nashville: Lineages from James Robertson | publisher=Blue & Gray Press | year=1973[/tpl] p. 423.

==Arkansas lawyer==

In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,Hillary Rodham Clinton, Living History, Simon & Schuster, 2003, ISBN 0-7432-2224-5, pp. 78–81. and in 1974 was made partner, one of only nine in the firm at the time. He was the head of the Arkansas Bar association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.  Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate (and later partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.Carl Bernstein, A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Knopf, ISBN 0-375-40766-9. pp. 128–131.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch role in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.  Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien...elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."
Foster practiced mostly corporate law,Jason DeParle, " A Life Undone: Portrait of a White House Aide Ensnared by His Perfectionism", The New York Times, August 22, 1993. Accessed July 29, 2007. eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.
By the time Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, Vince Foster was at the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr940701.htm| title=Foster's Death a Suicide| publisher=The Washington Post| author=David Von Drehle, Howard Schneider| date=1994-07-01| accessdate=2009-03-31| page=A01[/tpl] mirror
having received the Outstanding Lawyer Award from the Arkansas Bar Association, while being described as the "soul" of Rose Law Firm and soon being named one of "The Best Lawyers in America."

==White House Counsel==

After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined his White House staff in early 1993, after initially being reluctant to do so. The Foster residence was on Cambridge Place in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fbicover-up.com/photos/house.htm| title=Vince Foster Home| accessdate=2006-05-02[/tpl]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington. He found his involvement in vetting new presidential appointments during the transition period to be causing him depression and anxiety, and he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination.  The failed Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also within his purview.  His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his junior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock. Foster handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork,[tpl]cite news | publisher=PBS | location= WGBH educational foundation | work=Frontline | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/arkansas/docs/recs.html | title=Rose Law Firm billing records[/tpl] and several Whitewater-related tax returns as Deputy White House counsel.Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton, " Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment", The New York Times, August 6, 1995. Accessed April 30, 2007.
In early May 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:
Days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.
Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993, with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?" He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing at which he may have been called to testify.  Disliking the public spotlight and suffering from weight loss and insomnia, he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.

==Death==

Wrestling with evident depression (which after his death would be assessed as clinical depression),[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/docs/fosterix.htm | title=State of Mind | work=Whitewater: The Foster Report | publisher=United States Office of the Independent Counsel via The Washington Post | date=1997-10-11 | accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl]   Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication Trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, though he was given an insufficient initial dosage to have much effect. The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. He was found with a gun in his hand and gunshot residue on that hand. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body. A suicide note of sorts, in actuality a draft resignation letter, was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of complaints, specifically including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[tpl]cite news|author=Steinberg, Jacques| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/11/nyregion/robert-l-bartley-66-dies-led-journal-editorial-page.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm| title=Robert L. Bartley, 66, Dies; Led Journal Editorial Page| publisher=The New York Times| date=December 11, 2003| accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl] and lamenting, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral Mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock. Bill Clinton gave an emotional eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from  Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."Jason DeParle, " President Returns Home To Bury Boyhood Friend", The New York Times, July 24, 1993. Accessed July 28, 2007. Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.

===Subsequent investigations===

There have been three official investigations into Foster's death, all of which concluded that he committed suicide.Office of the Independent Counsel. "Report on the Death of Vincent W. Foster, Jr." October 10, 1997
The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell. Due to Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released in 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide. Theories of a cover-up still persisted, some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken StarrFull text of the report on the 1993 death of White House counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., compiled by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Washington Post versionReport: Starr Rules Out Foul Play In Foster Death CNN February 23, 1997 released a report in 1997 also concluding that the death was a suicide.  In addition, two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide.Gerald S. Greenberg, Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations, Greenwood Press, 2000. ISBN 0-313-30735-0. pp 133–134.

==Legacy==

Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff."One Death Altered Path of Presidency", Peter Baker, Washington Post, July 20, 1998.  White House chief-of-staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."  Fellow White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum felt that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint Independent Counsels, and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency, might not have happened.  As it happened, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret Williams in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself."Memo Links First Lady To Handling Of Suicide Note", CNN, August 27, 1996.
