London Heathrow Airport or Heathrow [tpl]Airport codes|LHR|EGLL[/tpl] is a major international airport serving London, England, known as London Airport from 1946 until 1965. Located in the London Borough of Hillingdon, in West London, Heathrow is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom and the third busiest airport in the world ([tpl]as of|2012|lc=y[/tpl]) in total passenger traffic, handling more international passengers than any other airport around the globe.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-'-1379_666_2__ | title = Year to date International Passenger Traffic November 2010 | date = 16 February 2011 | publisher=Airports Council International | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5x5F2XC3a | archivedate = 10 March 2011 [/tpl] It is also the busiest airport in Europe by passenger traffic and the third busiest by traffic movements, with a figure surpassed only by Charles de Gaulle Airport and Frankfurt Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/busiestairports.htm |title=Busiest Airports – The Busiest Airports in the World |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=21 April 2011[/tpl] Heathrow is London's main airport, having replaced RAF Northolt and the earlier Croydon Airport. The airport sustains 76,600 jobs directly and around 116,000 indirectly in the immediate area,[tpl]cite web |author=Optical Economics Ltd |title= Heathrow Related Employment |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/.../Heathrow/.../Heathrow-Related-Employment-Report.pdf |publisher=BAA plc|accessdate=September 2011[/tpl] and this, together with the large number of global corporations with offices close to the airport, makes Heathrow a modern aerotropolis which contributes an estimated 2.7% to London's total GVA.
The airport is owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings, which also owns and operates three other UK airports, and is itself owned by FGP TopCo Limited, an international consortium led by the Spanish Ferrovial Group that includes Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information |title=Company information |year=2014 |publisher=Heathrow Airport Holdings |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] Heathrow is the primary hub for British Airways and the primary operating base for Virgin Atlantic.

The airport holds a Civil Aviation Authority Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P527), which allows flights for public transportation of passengers or for flying instruction.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/375/srg_asd_publiclicencesandmapsKtoO.pdf |title=Licence No. P527 |publisher= Civil Aviation Authority |accessdate=2 November 2013[/tpl]

==Location==

Heathrow is [tpl]convert|14|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west of central London, near the south end of the London Borough of Hillingdon on a parcel of land that is designated part of the Metropolitan Green Belt. The airport is surrounded by the built-up areas of Harlington, Harmondsworth, Longford and Cranford to the north and by Hounslow and Hatton to the east. To the south lie Bedfont and Stanwell while to the west Heathrow is separated from Colnbrook in Berkshire by the M25 motorway. Heathrow falls entirely under the Hounslow post town of the TW postcode area.
As the airport is west of London and as its runways run east–west, an airliner's landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of London when the wind is from the west.
Along with Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, Southend and London City, Heathrow is one of six airports with scheduled services serving the London area, although only Heathrow and London City are within Greater London.

==History==

Heathrow Airport started in 1929 as a small airfield (Great West Aerodrome) on land south-east of the hamlet of Heathrow from which the airport takes its name. At that time there were farms, market gardens and orchards there: there was a "Heathrow Farm" about where Terminal 1 is now, a "Heathrow Hall" and a "Heathrow House". This hamlet was largely along a country lane (Heathrow Road) which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area.
Development of the whole Heathrow area as a very big airfield started in 1944: it was stated to be for long-distance military aircraft bound for the Far East. But by the time the airfield was nearing completion, World War II had ended. The government continued to develop the airfield as a civil airport; known as London Airport and later as Heathrow.

==Heathrow today==

Heathrow Airport is used by over 90 airlines flying to 170 destinations worldwide. The airport is the primary hub of British Airways, and is a base for Virgin Atlantic.
Of Heathrow's 69 million passengers in 2011, 7% were bound for UK destinations, 41% were short-haul international travellers and 52% were long-haul.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/facts-and-figures |title=Heathrow: Facts and figures |publisher=Heathrow Airport |accessdate=12 April 2011[/tpl] The busiest single destination in passenger numbers is New York, with over 3.8 million passengers between Heathrow and JFK / Newark airports in 2011.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/2011Annual/Table_12_1_Intl_Air_Pax_Route_Analysis_2011.pdf |title=International Air Passenger Traffic To and From Reporting Airports for 2011 |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl] The airport has four passenger terminals (Terminals 1, 3, 4 and 5) and a cargo terminal. The new passenger Terminal 2 is due to open in 2014, replacing the previous Terminal 2.
In the 1950s, Heathrow had six runways, arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a hexagram (✡) with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field, and two of its runways would always be within 30° of the wind direction. As the required length for runways has grown, Heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east–west. These are extended versions of the two east-west runways from the original hexagram. From the air, almost all of the original runways can still be seen, incorporated into the present system of taxiways. North of the northern runway and the former taxiway and aprons, now the site of extensive car parks, is the entrance to the access tunnel and the site of Heathrow's unofficial 'gate guardian'. For many years the home of a 40% model of a British Airways Concorde, G-CONC, the site has been occupied by a model of an Emirates Airbus A380 since 2008.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow airport's BA Concorde landmark replaced by foreign airline's Airbus |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1037560/Heathrow-airports-BA-Concorde-landmark-replaced-foreign-airlines-Airbus.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |location= London |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]
Policing of the airport is the responsibility of the aviation security unit of the Metropolitan Police, although the army, including armoured vehicles of the Household Cavalry, has occasionally been deployed at the airport during periods of heightened security. Heathrow's reputation for thefts has led to its sometimes being referred to as 'Thiefrow'.[tpl]Cite news |title= Thiefrow gang lifts £1m of duty-free |work=The Sun |date=11 November 2008 |url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1915827.ece |accessdate=29 November 2009 |location=London[/tpl]
Full body scanners are now used at the airport, and passengers who object to their use after being selected are not allowed to fly. These display passengers' bodies as a cartoon-style figure, with indicators showing where concealed items may be.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/heathrow-airport-guide/heathrow-security/faqs#scanneroptout |title=Security (body) scanners |publisher=Heathrow Airport |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] The new imagery was introduced initially as a trial in September 2011 following complaints over privacy.[tpl]cite news |title=Airport body scanners: Heathrow trials new 'privacy friendly' security technology |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2033918/Airport-body-scanners-Heathrow-trials-new-privacy-friendly-security-technology.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |location= London |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]
Heathrow Airport has Anglican, Catholic, free church, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh chaplains. There is a multi-faith prayer room and counselling room in each terminal, in addition to St. George's Interdenominational Chapel in an underground vault adjacent to the old control tower, where Christian services take place. The chaplains organise and lead prayers at certain times in the prayer room.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/heathrow-airport-guide/services-and-facilities/worship |title=Prayer and Worship |publisher=Heathrow Airport |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]
Heathrow airport has its own resident press corps, consisting of six photographers and one TV crew, serving all the major newspapers and television stations around the world.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/TRAVEL/07/13/bt.citytips/index.html |title= Heathrow's hidden gems |work=CNN |date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2011[/tpl]
Most of Heathrow's internal roads are initial letter coded by area: N in the north (e.g. Newall Road), E in the east (e.g. Elmdon Road), S in the south (e.g. Stratford Road), W in the west (e.g. Walrus Road), C in the centre (e.g. Camborne Road).
The original 1950s red-brick control tower was demolished in early 2013 to enable access roads for the new Terminal 2 to be laid. The Central Terminal Area, as it was named, was designed by Frederick Gibberd and opened in 1955. Air Traffic Control moved to a new control tower in 2007.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow Airport demolishes Old Control Tower after almost 60 years service |author=Evans, Becky |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2259928/Heathrow-Airport-demolishes-Old-Control-Tower-60-years-service.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |location= London |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]

===Operations===

Aircraft destined for Heathrow usually enter its airspace via one of four main reporting points: Bovingdon (BNN) over Hertfordshire, Lambourne (LAM) over Essex, Biggin Hill (BIG) over Bromley and Ockham (OCK) over Surrey.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7196158.stm |title= Landing at Heathrow |work=BBC News |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl] Each is defined by a VOR radio-navigational beacon. When the airport is busy, aircraft orbit in the associated hold patterns. These holding areas lie to the north-west, north-east, south-east and south-west of the London conurbation. Aircraft hold between 7000 feet and 15000 feet at 1000 foot intervals. If these holds become full, aircraft are held at more distant points before being cleared onward to one of the four main holds.
Air traffic controllers at Heathrow Approach Control (based in Swanwick, Hampshire) then guide the aircraft to their final approach, merging aircraft from the four holds into a single stream of traffic, sometimes as close as [tpl]convert|2.5|NM[/tpl] apart. Considerable use is made of continuous descent approach techniques to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night.[tpl]Cite journal |author=BAA Heathrow |title=Flight Evaluation Report 2004/05 |date=2004/05 |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/assets//B2CPortal/Static%20Files/New2005Booklet.pdf |accessdate=2 November 2007[/tpl] Once an aircraft is established on its final approach, control is handed over to Heathrow Tower.
When runway alternation was introduced, aircraft generated significantly more noise on departure than when landing, so a preference for westerly operations during daylight was introduced, which continues to this day.During periods of westerly operation, aircraft continue to fly in a westerly direction with an easterly tailwind component of up to [tpl]convert|5|kn|km/h mph[/tpl], if the runway is dry and there is no significant crosswind. In this mode, aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over London, thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas. Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the departure runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded Cranford Agreement, pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.
Night-time flights at Heathrow are subject to restrictions. Between 23:00 and 07:00, the noisiest aircraft (rated QC/8 and QC/16) cannot be scheduled for operation. In addition, during the night quota period (23:30–06:00) there are four limits:
A trial of "noise relief zones" ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out. The zones used alternated weekly, meaning residents in the "no-fly" areas received respite from aircraft noise for set periods.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow begins trial of noise relief zones |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20591037 |newspaper=BBC News  |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl] However, it was concluded that some residents in other areas experienced a significant disbenefit as a result of the trial and that it should therefore not be taken forward in its current form.

===Regulation===

Until it was required to sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports, Heathrow Airport Holdings held a dominant position in the London aviation market, and has been heavily regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as to how much it can charge airline to land. The annual increase in landing charge per passenger was capped at inflation minus 3% until 1 April 2003. From 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5% per year, taking the fee to £9.28 per passenger in 2007. In March 2008, the CAA announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5% to £12.80 from 1 April 2008, and by inflation plus 7.5% for each of the following four years.[tpl]cite news |title=IATA attacks higher landing charges at British airports |date= 12 March 2008 |agency=Agence France-Presse |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131102083857/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5izyYRsZKFHEIOR6WYbdtInUOLqgA?hl=en |archivedate= 2 November 2013 |deadurl=no |url= http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5izyYRsZKFHEIOR6WYbdtInUOLqgA |accessdate=14 March 2008[/tpl] In April 2013, the CAA announced a proposal for Heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3%, continuing until 2019.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow and Gatwick face new airline fee caps |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22349054 |newspaper=BBC News |date=30 April 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013[/tpl] Whilst the cost of landing at Heathrow is determined by the CAA and Heathrow Airport Holdings, the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/static/HeathrowAboutUs/Downloads/PDF/Economic_regulation_of_Heathrow_and_Gatwick_airports.pdf |title=Economic Regulation of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports 2008–2013 |date=11 March 2008 |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]
Until 2008, air traffic between Heathrow and the United States was strictly governed by the countries' bilateral Bermuda II treaty. The treaty originally allowed only British Airways, Pan Am and TWA to fly from Heathrow to the US. In 1991, PAA and TWA sold their rights to United Airlines and American Airlines respectively, while Virgin Atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes. The Bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the Right of Establishment of the United Kingdom in relation to its EU membership, and as a consequence the UK was ordered to drop the agreement in 2004. A new "open skies" agreement was signed by the United States and the European Union on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008. Since then, additional US Airlines including Continental (now United Airlines), US Airways and Delta have started services to Heathrow.
The airport has been criticised in recent years for overcrowding and delays;[tpl]Cite news |title=BA boss joins attack on Heathrow |work=BBC News |date=1 August 2007 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6926150.stm |accessdate=28 October 2007[/tpl] according to Heathrow Airport Holdings, Heathrow's facilities were originally designed to accommodate 55 million passengers annually. The number of passengers using the airport reached a record 70 million in 2012.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow airport hits record 70 million passengers |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21496856 |newspaper=BBC News |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl] In 2007 the airport was voted the world's least favourite, alongside Chicago O'Hare in a TripAdvisor survey.[tpl]Cite news |title=Heathrow voted world's least favourite airport |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=30 October 2007 |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml?xml=/travel/2007/10/30/et-airport-130.xml |accessdate=30 October 2007 |first=David |last=Millward[/tpl] However, the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008 has relieved some pressure on terminal facilities, increasing the airport's terminal capacity to 90 million passengers per year. A tie-up is also in place with McLaren Applied Technologies to optimise the general procedure, reducing delays and pollution.[tpl]Cite news |title=Work Smarter: McLaren |date=1 March 2010 |url= http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/04/features/work-smarter-mclaren |work=Wired |accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl]
With only two runways, operating at over 98% of their capacity, Heathrow has little room for more flights, although the increasing use of larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 will allow some increase in passenger numbers. It is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport, or for new airlines to start operations.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Airport Coordination Ltd |title= Submission to the CAA Regarding Peak Periods at Heathrow |date=February 2002 |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/5/ergdocs/baajan03/acl2baajan03.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2008[/tpl] To increase the number of flights, Heathrow Airport Holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in 'mixed mode' whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway. This would increase the airport's capacity from its current 480,000 movements per year to as many as 550,000 according to British Airways CEO Willie Walsh.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.uk-airport-news.info/heathrow-airport-news-161206a.htm |title=BA pushes for 'mixed mode' at Heathrow |work=UK Airport News |accessdate=31 May 2008[/tpl] Heathrow Airport Holdings has also proposed building a third runway to the north of the airport, which would have significantly increased traffic capacity (see Future expansion below).[tpl]Cite news |title= Heathrow is defeated in its attempt to ban environmental campaigners |work=The Times |date=7 August 2007 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2211142.ece |accessdate=9 August 2007 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Webster[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl]

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 opened in 1968 and was formally inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II in May 1969.Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA – 1991 (Michael Donne – BAA plc), p. 40 Before Terminal 5 opened, Terminal 1 was the base for British Airways' domestic network from Heathrow and for a few of its long haul routes.
In 2005, a substantial redesign and redevelopment of the terminal saw the opening of the new Eastern Extension, doubling the size of the departure lounge and creating additional seating as well as retail space. With an area of [tpl]convert|74601|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl], the terminal is home to Ireland's Aer Lingus, and several Star Alliance airlines. Since the buyout of British Midland International, British Airways serves some short-haul and medium-haul destinations from this terminal. Some of the newer boarding gates used by airlines present in Terminal 1 are numbered in Terminal 2 (i.e. gate 2xx instead of gate 1xx). Those recently built gates will be retained as part of the new Terminal 2 after Terminal 2 officially opens. A temporary connector is in place between the older Terminal 1 and the new gates.
Terminal 1 will be closed by the end of 2016 once all airlines have moved to other Heathrow terminals, following the opening of T2 in June 2014.

===Terminal 2 (under construction)===

Heathrow's current major project is the construction of a vast new Terminal 2 on the site of the original Terminal 2 and the Queen's Building.
The new development was originally named Heathrow East Terminal. It is designed by Luis Vidal + Architects (LVA), and it is due to open on 4 June 2014. Terminal 2 was completed in November 2013 and is currently undergoing 6 months of testing.
It will be used by all 23 Star Alliance members currently operating at Heathrow (consolidating the airlines under Star Alliance's co-location policy "Move Under One Roof"), Aer Lingus, Little Red (Virgin Atlantic's domestic operations) and Germanwings. The airlines will move from their current terminals in phases over a period of six months with only 10% of flights operating in the first 3 weeks to avoid the opening challenges witnessed at Terminal 5. The project includes the main Terminal 2 building, a [tpl]convert|522|m|ft|adj = on[/tpl] satellite pier (T2B), a 1,340 space car park and an energy centre and cooling station. Passengers will be able to choose from a selection of 52 shops and 17 bars and restaurants.[tpl]cite press release|title= The new Terminal 2: Only one year to go|publisher= Heathrow Airport|date= [tpl]Date|2013-6-4[/tpl]|url= http://mediacentre.heathrowairport.com/Press-releases/The-new-Terminal-2-Only-one-year-to-go-585.aspx|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140426135108/http://mediacentre.heathrowairport.com/Press-releases/The-new-Terminal-2-Only-one-year-to-go-585.aspx|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2014-4-26[/tpl] [/tpl] It was reported it is set to open on [tpl]Date|2014-6-23[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|title= London Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 2 set to open June 23|first= Anne|last= Paylor|work= Air Transport World|date= [tpl]Date|2014-4-25[/tpl] |url= http://atwonline.com/airports-routes/london-heathrow-airport-s-terminal-2-set-open-june-23|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140426010648/http://atwonline.com/airports-routes/london-heathrow-airport-s-terminal-2-set-open-june-23|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2014-4-26[/tpl] [/tpl]
The building will replace the original Terminal 2, which was the airport's oldest terminal. It opened as the Europa Building in 1955, and had an area of [tpl]convert|49654|m2|sqft[/tpl] Originally the terminal was designed to handle around 1.2 million passengers annually; in its final years of operation it often accommodated around 8 million. A total of 316 million passengers passed through the terminal in its lifetime. The terminal was demolished in 2010,[tpl]Cite news|title= Demolition work begins at Heathrow's Terminal 2|work= BBC News|date= [tpl]Date|2010-4-29[/tpl]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8650872.stm |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140426134155/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8650872.stm|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2014-4-26[/tpl] [/tpl] and the site was combined with that of the Queen's Building to form the site under development.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 opened as The Oceanic Terminal on 13 November 1961 to handle flight departures for long-haul routes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/our-history |title=Our history |publisher=Heathrow Airport Holdings |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] At this time the airport had a direct helicopter service to Central London from the gardens on the roof of the terminal building. Renamed Terminal 3 in 1968, it was expanded in 1970 with the addition of an arrivals building. Other facilities added included the UK's first moving walkways. In 2006, the new £105 million Pier 6 was completed[tpl]Cite news |title= Debut A380 flight lands in London |work=BBC News |date=18 March 2008 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7301455.stm |accessdate=19 March 2008[/tpl] to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo; Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas now operate regular flights from Terminal 3 using the Airbus A380. These three airlines have nearly a dozen daily A380 flights.
Redevelopment of Terminal 3's forecourt through the addition of a new four lane drop-off area and a large pedestrianised plaza, complete with canopy to the front of the terminal building, was completed in 2007. These improvements were intended to improve passengers' experiences, reduce traffic congestion and improve security.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/baa-heathrow-unveils-plans-to-re-develop-terminal-3-155771575.html |title=BAA Heathrow unveils plans to re-develop Terminal 3 |publisher=BAA |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] As part of this project, Virgin Atlantic was assigned its own dedicated check-in area, known as 'Zone A', which features a large sculpture and atrium.
The terminal is due to be demolished after the second phase of Terminal 2 is completed on the site of Terminal 1 that is due to close and be demolished in 2016.[tpl]cite news |last=Thomas |first=Nathalie |date=4 June 2013 |title=Heathrow to open new £2.5bn terminal next year |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10099482/Heathrow-to-open-new-2.5bn-terminal-next-year.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl]
As of 2013, Terminal 3 has an area of [tpl]convert|98962|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] and in 2011 handled 19.8 million passengers on 104,100 flights.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/facts-and-figures |title=Heathrow facts and figures |publisher=Heathrow Airport Limited|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl]

===Terminal 4===

Opened in 1986, Terminal 4 is situated to the south of the southern runway next to the cargo terminal and is connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 by the Heathrow Cargo Tunnel. The terminal has an area of [tpl]convert|105481|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] and is now home to the SkyTeam alliance, as well as some unaffiliated carriers. It has recently undergone a £200m upgrade to enable it to accommodate 45 airlines with an upgraded forecourt to reduce traffic congestion and improve security. An extended check-in area with renovated piers and departure lounges, a new baggage system installed as well as the construction of two new stands to accommodate the Airbus A380 with Malaysia Airlines operating regular A380 flights.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/page/Heathrow%5EGeneral%5EOur%20business%20and%20community%5EMedia%20centre%5ENews%20releases%5EResults/97dd2706f959/ |title= Terminal 4's £100m new check-in area reaches the top |publisher=BAA |accessdate=30 November 2008[/tpl]

===Terminal 5===

Terminal 5 lies between the northern and southern runways at the west end of the Heathrow site and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 March 2008,[tpl]Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7294618.stm |title=Queen opens new Heathrow Terminal |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=14 March 2008 |work=BBC News[/tpl] some 19 years after its inception. It opened to the public on 27 March 2008. The first passenger to enter Terminal 5 was a UK ex-pat from Kenya who passed through security at 04:30 on the day to be presented with a boarding pass by the British Airways CEO Willie Walsh for the first departing flight, BA302 to Paris. During the two weeks after its opening, operations were disrupted by problems with the terminal's IT systems, coupled with insufficient testing and staff training, which caused over 500 flights to be cancelled.[tpl]cite news |title=British Airways reveals what went wrong with Terminal 5|work=Computer Weekly |url= http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/05/14/230680/british-airways-reveals-what-went-wrong-with-terminal.htm |date=14 May 2008|accessdate=17 May 2008[/tpl] Until March 2012, Terminal 5 was exclusively used by British Airways as its global hub; however, because of the merger, on 25 March Iberia's operations at Heathrow were moved to the terminal, making it the home of International Airlines Group.
Built at a cost of £4.3 billion, the new terminal consists of a four-storey main terminal building (Concourse A) and two satellite buildings linked to the main terminal by an underground people mover transit system. The second satellite (Concourse C), includes dedicated aircraft stands for the Airbus A380. It became fully operational on 1 June 2011.
The main terminal building (Concourse A) has an area of [tpl]Convert|300000|m2|sqft[/tpl] while Concourse B covers [tpl]Convert|60000|m2|sqft[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Heathrow Terminal 5|url=http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/1065_t5/RSHP_A_JS_1065_L_E_GB.pdf[/tpl] It has 60 aircraft stands and capacity for 30 million passengers annually as well as more than 100 shops and restaurants.[tpl]cite news |title=Heathrow Terminal 5: The Vital Statistics |work=Sky News |url= http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806413649522 |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2011[/tpl]
A further building, designated Concourse D and of similar size to Concourse C, may yet be built to the East of the existing site, providing up to another 16 stands. Following British Airways' merger with Iberia, this may become a priority since the newly combined business will require accommodation at Heathrow under one roof to maximise the cost savings envisaged under the deal. A proposal for Concourse D featured in Heathrow's most recent capital investment plan.
The transport network around the airport has been extended to cope with the increase in passenger numbers. A dedicated motorway spur links the M25 between junctions 14 and 15 to the terminal, which includes a 3,800 space multi-storey car park. A more distant long-stay car park for business passengers is connected to the terminal by a personal rapid transit system, which became operational in Spring 2011. New branches of both the Heathrow Express and the Underground's Piccadilly Line serve a new shared Heathrow Terminal 5 station.

===Cargo terminal===

Heathrow's cargo terminal is located south of the runways, towards the west. It was built in or soon before 1968.[tpl]when|date=October 2012[/tpl] The Cargo Tunnel connects it to Terminals 1, 2 and 3, with the Western Tug Road connecting it to Terminal 5.  Stands 607, 608 & 609, as well as the 'Zulu' cul de sac, are the main areas used for the dedicated cargo flights.
In 1948 (see map) the area was still farm or market garden land around Eglantine Cottage.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===

===Terminal moves and rearrangements===

Following the opening of Terminal 5 in March 2008, a hugely complex programme of terminal moves was implemented. This saw many airlines move so as to be grouped in terminals by airline alliance as far as possible."Heathrow looks ahead", Airports (Key Publishing), September/October 2007, p. 30. However, the process was complicated by the acquisition of Star Alliance member BMI by Oneworld member British Airways, the transfer of Continental Airlines from SkyTeam to Star Alliance prior to its merger with United Airlines, and formerly non-aligned carriers such as EVA Air and Malaysia Airlines joining alliances.  As of November 2013, the terminals are assigned to airline alliances as follows:
Non-aligned airlines operate from Terminals 1, 3 and 4.  Virgin Atlantic's domestic flights operate from Terminal 1.
When Phase 1 of the new Terminal 2 opens (expected to be 4 June 2014), all Star Alliance member airlines (along with Aer Lingus, El Al and Virgin Atlantic domestic flights) will relocate there in a gradual process, beginning with United Airlines and followed two weeks later by Air Canada and Air China.  All British Airways services will be moved to Terminals 3 and 5 and US Airways will move to Terminal 3.  Terminal 1 will then be gradually demolished to make way for Phase 2 of the new Terminal 2, with all airlines operating from Terminal 1 moving to other terminals Heathrow: Airline moves | Heathrow terminal changes. Heathrowairport.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. by 22 October 2014.
The move details for the other airlines at Terminals 1 and 3 have not yet been released.
Once the moves are complete the terminal assignments are expected to be as follows:

==Traffic and statistics==

Although Heathrow Airport Holdings claims that Heathrow is the "world's busiest international airport", in 2011 it ranked third-busiest by total passenger traffic, after Atlanta and Beijing which are both international airports. However, Heathrow does have the highest number of international passengers.
In 2011, Heathrow was the busiest airport in Europe in total passenger traffic,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=80&pagetype=88&pageid=3&sglid=3 |title=UK Airport Statistics |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |accessdate=6 March 2012[/tpl] with 13.9% more passengers than Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/Resources/b075cd65-a887-4cae-9d36-3f71768f055b-122011trafficfigures.pdf |title=Record Traffic in 2011 |publisher=Aeroports De Paris |accessdate=6 March 2012[/tpl] and 23.0% more than Frankfurt Airport,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adv.aero/verkehrszahlen/archiv/statistiken-ivf-2011 |title=German ADV Statistics |publisher=ADV |accessdate=6 March 2012[/tpl] However, it was in second place behind Charles de Gaulle in total aircraft movements in 2011 with 5.1% fewer landings and take offs than its French counterpart.

===Public transport===

====Train====

====Bus and coach====

Many buses and coaches operate from the large Heathrow airport central bus station serving Terminals 1 and 3, and also from bus stations at Terminals 4 and 5. Services include the following:
Between 1981 and 2004, the airport was linked to central London by a group of routes known as Airbus. These routes carried A prefixes before their numbers; one route, A10, operates with such a number to Uxbridge.

===Inter-terminal transport===

Terminals 1 and 3 are within walking distance of each other. Transfers to Terminal 4 and 5 are by Heathrow Express trains or bus. Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect services between Heathrow Central and Terminals 4 and 5 are free of charge.[tpl]cite web |title=Travel between terminals – Heathrow terminal transfers |url= http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/page/Heathrow^General^Airport+information^Travel+between+terminals/aedd3db5569a9110VgnVCM10000036821c0a/448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a/ |publisher=Heathrow Airport |accessdate=7 October 2012[/tpl] Normal fare rules apply to London Underground services between terminals. Local buses throughout the airport area are provided free of charge under the "Heathrow FreeFlow" scheme;[tpl]cite web|title=Heathrow Airport Buses – Free Bus Routes|url=http://www.milesfaster.co.uk/information/heathrow-airport/heathrow-london-bus.htm|publisher=Milesfaster.co.uk|accessdate=7 October 2012[/tpl] passengers should tell the driver their destination to ensure they are not charged a fare.
Transit passengers remaining airside are provided free dedicated transfer buses between terminals.
ULTra Personal Rapid Transport opened in April 2011 to shuttle passengers to and from Terminal 5 at a speed of up to [tpl]convert|40|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The initial trial had 18 pods running. ULTra are small transportation pods that can fit four adults, two children, and their luggage and carry passengers directly to the terminal. The pods are battery powered and are used on a four kilometre track. If the trial is successful there are plans for a roll out airport-wide. The capsules run on demand. The provider claims a 95% availability rate and no accidents so far.[tpl]Cite news|title=Heathrow to Debut Futuristic Travel Pods|work=PopSci.com.au|date=27 January 2009|url=http://www.popsci.com.au/scitech/article/2009-01/heathrow-debut-futuristic-travel-pods|accessdate=27 January 2009[/tpl]

There are further car parks, not run by Heathrow Airport Holdings, just outside the airport: the most recognisable is the National Car Parks facility, although there are many other options; these car parks are connected to the terminals by shuttle buses.
Four parallel tunnels under the northern runway connect the M4 motorway and the A4 road to Terminals 1–3. The two larger tunnels are each two lanes wide and are used for motorised traffic. The two smaller tunnels were originally reserved for pedestrians and bicycles; to increase traffic capacity the cycle lanes have been modified to each take a single lane of cars, although bicycles still have priority over cars. Pedestrian access to the smaller tunnels has been discontinued, with the free bus services being used instead.

===Bicycle===

There are (mainly off-road) bicycle routes to some of the terminals.Transport for London free maps 'London Cycling Guide 6' covers Terminals 1, 2 & 3 while 'London Cycling Guide 9' covers Terminal 4 (as of the June 2007 revision). Free bicycle parking places are available in car parks 1 and 1A, at Terminal 4, and to the North and South of Terminal 5's Interchange Plaza.Cycling and Motorcycling map.

===Runway and terminal expansion===

In January 2009 the Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that the UK government supported the expansion of Heathrow by building a third [tpl]Convert|2200|m|adj=on[/tpl] runway and a sixth terminal building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/heathrowconsultations/heathrowdecision/decisiondocument/decisiondoc.pdf|title=Britain's Transport Infrastructure: Adding Capacity at Heathrow: Decisions Following Consultation, January 2009|publisher=Department of Transport|accessdate=16 January 2009[/tpl] This decision followed the 2003 white paper on the future of air transport in the UK,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/thefutureofairtransportwhite5694|title=The Future of Air Transport|format=PDF|date=1 December 2003[/tpl] and a public consultation in November 2007.[tpl]Cite news|title=Industry backs third Heathrow runway as consultation opens|work=Flight International|date=22 November 2007|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/11/22/219826/industry-backs-third-heathrow-runway-as-consultation-opens.html|accessdate=8 December 2007[/tpl] This was a controversial decision which met with widespread opposition because of the expected greenhouse gas emissions, impact on local communities, as well as noise and air pollution concerns.
Before the 2010 General Election the Conservative and Liberal Democrats parties announced that they would prevent the construction of any third runway or further material expansion of the airport's operating capacity. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has taken the position that London needs more airport capacity, but favours constructing an entirely new airport in the Thames Estuary rather than expanding Heathrow.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7722261.stm |title= Heathrow's new runway |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=21 April 2011[/tpl] After the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition took power, it was announced that the third runway expansion was cancelled. Two years later, leading Conservatives were reported to have changed their minds.[tpl]Cite news |title=Top Tories admit: we got it wrong on third runway |work=The Observer |location=London |date=24 March 2012 |url= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/24/tories-third-runway-heathrow |author=Helm, Toby; Doward, Jamie[/tpl]
Another proposed plan for expanding Heathrow's capacity is the Heathrow Hub, which aims to extend both runways to a total length of about 7,000 metres and divide them into four so that they each provide two, full length runways, allowing simultaneous take-offs and landings while actually decreasing noise levels.Financial Times – Pilot plots longer Heathrow runways – 10 March 2013CPS paper – Double Upon Heathrow – July 2013
In July 2013, the airport submitted three new proposals for expansion to the Airports Commission, which was established to review airport capacity in the south-east of England. Each involved the construction of a third runway, either to the north, north-west or south-west of the airport.[tpl]cite news |date=17 July 2013 |title=Heathrow submits third runway options to Davies Commission |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23337754 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl] The commission released its interim report in December 2013, shortlisting the north-west third runway option at Heathrow, extending an existing runway at Heathrow and a second runway at Gatwick Airport.

===Heathrow/Gatwick rail link===

In late-2011 the Department for Transport began studying the feasibility of a high-speed rail link between Gatwick and Heathrow Airport. This rail link would form part of a plan to combine the UK's two biggest airports into a "collective" or "virtual hub" dubbed Heathwick. The scheme envisages a [tpl]convert|35|mi|km|adj = on[/tpl] high-speed rail route linking the two airports in 15 minutes, with trains travelling at a top speed of [tpl]convert|180|mph|km/h[/tpl] parallel to the M25 and passengers passing through immigration or check-in only once.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15227879 | work=BBC News | title=Heathrow and Gatwick airports: Ministers mull rail link | date=8 October 2011[/tpl]
