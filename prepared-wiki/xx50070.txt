==History==

The station went on the air as WRLB on June 7, 1984. On February 1, 1992, the station changed its call sign to the current WIFI.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=55310&Callsign=WIFI |title=WIFI Call Sign History |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division [/tpl] The WIFI call letters had previously been used in the market for some 20 years on the station now known as WXTU. The station previously ran a brokered format under the "MyWifi 1460" brand.
The 1460 frequency was previously used in WIFI's coverage area by WJJZ, a daytime-only station licensed to Mount Holly Township, New Jersey with a transmitter site on Burlington Island. WJJZ operated from the early 1960s until its license was revoked in the early 1980s.
In 2008 John Forsythe of Forsythe Broadcasting took over operations of the station as operator with Florence Broadcasting Partners, LLC.  Forsythe got the station from a $400 a month billing up to $20,000 month billing in under 2 years.
On November 1, 2013 The operating contract between Real Life Broadcasting and Florence Broadcasting expired and was not renewed. The station is currently being operated by Omega Broadcasting, LLC with a format change from Variety to Gospel / Praise & Worship.
