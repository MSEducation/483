The Hamoaze ([tpl]IPAc-en|h|æ|m|ˈ|oʊ|z[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-kw|ˈhɒmøz|Cornish pronunciation:[/tpl]) is an estuarine stretch of the tidal River Tamar, between the River Lynher and Plymouth Sound, England.
The name first appears as ryver of Hamose in 1588 and it originally most likely applied just to a creek of the estuary that led up to the manor of Ham, north of the present-day Devonport Dockyard. The name evidently later came to be used for the estuary's main channel. The ose element derives from Old English wāse meaning 'mud' (as in 'ooze') – the creek consisting of mud-banks at low tide.
The Hamoaze flows past Devonport Dockyard, which belongs to the Royal Navy. The presence of large numbers of small watercraft are a challenge and hazard to the warships using the naval base and dockyard.
Settlements on the banks of the Hamoaze are Saltash, Wilcove, Torpoint and Cremyll in Cornwall as well as Devonport, Plymouth in Devon.
