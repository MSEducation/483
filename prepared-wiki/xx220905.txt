==History==

===Early years===

Richard David James was born in Limerick, Ireland, and grew up in Lanner, Cornwall with two older sisters, a "very happy" childhood during which they "were pretty much left to do what they wanted".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aphextwin.nu/learn/100771194880071.shtml|title=Untitled |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=O'Connell |first=John |date=October 2001 |work=The Face |publisher=EMAP | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080615033834/http://www.aphextwin.nu/learn/100771194880071.shtml| archivedate= 15 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He liked living there as he felt excluded from nearby cities and the rest of the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aphextwin.nu/learn/98494129834161.shtml |title=Interview by Theresa Stern |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Stern |first=Theresa |date=September 1997 |work=The Aphex Twin Community |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080402004414/http://xltronic.com/nostalgia/aphextwin.nu/v4/learn/98494129834161.shtml  |archivedate = 2008-04-02[/tpl] James attended Redruth School, located in Redruth, Cornwall.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuartaitken.com/post/43555798376/aphextwin |title=Rephlexology |date=28 November 2003|author=Stuart Aitken|work=mad.co.uk [/tpl] Richard claims to have produced sound on a Sinclair ZX81 (a machine with no sound hardware) at the age of 11:
 When I was 11, I won 50 pounds in a competition for writing this program that made sound on a ZX81. You couldn't make sound on a ZX81, but I played around with machine code and found some codes that retuned the TV signal so that it made this really weird noise when you turned the volume up. 
According to musician Benjamin Middleton, James started producing music at the age of 12.[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.rave/browse_thread/thread/bd94e30720889cc4?pli=1|title=~~ rephlex ~~ aphex ~~ drn ~~ |last=Middleton |first=Benjamin |date=October 1992[/tpl] As a teenager he was a disc jockey at the Shire Horse Inn in St Ives, with Tom Middleton at the Bowgie Inn in Crantock, and also along the numerous beaches around Cornwall. James studied for a National Diploma in Engineering from 1988 to 1990 (aged 16 to 18) at Cornwall College. Talking about his studies, James has said that "music and electronics went hand in hand".[tpl]cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Dave |date=April 1993 |title=The Aphex Effect |journal=Future Music [/tpl] James graduated from college; according to an engineering lecturer, however, he often had his headphones on during practical lessons, "no doubt thinking through the mixes he'd be working on later".[tpl]cite news |first=Janet |last=Murray |title=College days |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,2100257,00.html |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-14 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080626093339/http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,2100257,00.html| archivedate= 26 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Early career: early 1990s===

In 1989 James met and befriended Grant Wilson-Claridge when working as a DJ on alternate weeks at the Bowgie pub, near Newquay in Cornwall. Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by James' sets and was surprised to discover that James was playing tapes of his own music. When he noticed this, Wilson-Claridge suggested that they press up some records. In the beginning, committing Aphex Twin’s recordings to vinyl was a way of making music the duo's friends wanted to hear. Due to their geographical dislocation they did not have access to the music they wanted to hear and so they decided to create their own.
James' first release was the 12-inch EP Analogue Bubblebath on Mighty Force Records in 1991. It was first released under the moniker Aphex Twin, later changed to AFX. The track "En Trance to Exit" was made in collaboration with Tom Middleton, also known as Schizophrenia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.rave/browse_thread/thread/bd94e30720889cc4/7958a9d0de1c453d? |title= ~~ rephlex ~~ aphex ~~ drn ~~ |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Middleton |first=Benjamin |date=30 October 1992 |work=alt.rave | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080614093608/http://groups.google.com/group/alt.rave/browse_thread/thread/bd94e30720889cc4/7958a9d0de1c453d?| archivedate= 14 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The EP got on the playlist of Kiss FM, an influential London radio station, which helped the release to become a success.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx |title=Aphex Twin - The Contrarian |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Turenne |first=Martin |date=April 2003 |work=Exclaim! | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080603022308/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx| archivedate= 3 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 1991, James and Wilson-Claridge founded Rephlex Records to promote "innovation in the dynamics of Acid — a much-loved and misunderstood genre of house music forgotten by some and indeed new to others, especially in Britain".[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.rave/browse_thread/thread/2b1d14ae853ba101/7a4d8b6191bb3e55? |title=~~~ The definitive RePHLeX ~~~ |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Wilson-Claridge |first=Grant |authorlink=Grant Wilson-Claridge |date=30 November 1992 |work=alt.rave | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080621184226/http://groups.google.com/group/alt.rave/browse_thread/thread/2b1d14ae853ba101/7a4d8b6191bb3e55?| archivedate= 21 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Between 1991 and 1993, James released two Analogue Bubblebath EPs as AFX, and an EP under Bradley Strider, Bradley's Beat. James moved to London to take an electronics course at Kingston Polytechnic, but at the time admitted to David Toop that his "electronics studies were already slipping away as a career in the techno business took precedence". After quitting his course, James remained in London and released a number of albums and EPs on Warp Records and other labels under many aliases including AFX, Polygon Window, and Power-Pill. A number of James' tracks (released under the aliases Blue Calx, The Dice Man, and others) appeared on various compilations. Local legend has it that James lived on the roundabout in Elephant and Castle, South London during his early years in the capital - in fact, he lived in a nearby disused bank.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xltronic.com/nostalgia/aphextwin.nu/v4/learn/98136154898147.shtml |title=Lost in space |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink=David Toop |date=March 1994 |work=The Face |publisher=EMAP |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603074638/http://xltronic.com/nostalgia/aphextwin.nu/v4/learn/98136154898147.shtml  |archivedate = 2008-06-03[/tpl]

===Gaining success: 1992–1995===

The first full-length Aphex Twin album, Selected Ambient Works 85–92, was released in 1992 on R&S Records. It received high ratings and praise from critics. John Bush of Allmusic described it as a "watershed of ambient music".[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r191406/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Review |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Bush |first=John |work=Allmusic |publisher=All Media Guide [/tpl] In 2002, Rolling Stone wrote of the album: "Aphex Twin expanded way beyond the ambient music of Brian Eno by fusing lush soundscapes with oceanic beats and bass lines."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/albums/album/218371/review/6067595/selected_ambient_works_8592 |title=Selected Ambient Works 85-92 |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Blashill |first=Pat |date=19 November 2002 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Publishing | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080612021837/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/albums/album/218371/review/6067595/selected_ambient_works_8592| archivedate= 12 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Pitchfork Media's review called it "among the most interesting music ever created with a keyboard and a computer".[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/14986-selected-ambient-works-85-92  |title=Selected Ambient Works 85-92  |accessdate=2008-10-19  |last=Pecoraro  |first=David  |date=20 February 2002  |work=Pitchfork Media | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080920140017/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/14986-selected-ambient-works-85-92| archivedate= 20 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Critics also noted that the songs were recorded on cassette and that the sound quality was "relatively poor".
In 1992, he also released the EPs Xylem Tube EP and Digeridoo (first played by DJ Colin Faver on London's Kiss FM) as Aphex Twin, as Power-Pill the Pac-Man EP based on the arcade game Pac-Man, and two of his four Caustic Window EPs. "Digeridoo" reached #55 in the UK Singles Chart, and was later described as foreshadowing drum and bass by Rolling Stone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/biography |title=Biography |accessdate=2008-06-14 |year=2001 |work=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080622142914/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/biography| archivedate= 22 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] "Digeridoo" was recorded initially for the benefit of FIZZ-BOMB (at the Shire Horse, St Ives, Cornwall). These early releases came out on Rephlex Records, Mighty Force of Exeter, and R&S Records of Belgium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/maryannehobbs/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20051206 |title=tracklisting |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Hobbs |first=Mary Anne |authorlink=Mary Anne Hobbs |date=6 December 2005 |work=Mary Anne Hobbs |publisher=BBC [/tpl]
In 1993, James released Analogue Bubblebath 3. He also released a single titled "On"; his second Bradley Strider EP, Bradley's Robot; two more Caustic Window EPs; and his first releases on Warp Records, Surfing on Sine Waves and "Quoth" under the alias Polygon Window.
Warp Records pressed and released a follow-up to Selected Ambient Works 85-92, Selected Ambient Works Volume II in 1994. The sound was much less beat and melody-driven than the previous volume. All the track names were described with pie chart symbols, each of which was meant to be paired with a corresponding image in the album jacket, with exception for one song, which was named "Blue Calx". To decipher song titles, listeners had to compare the length of each track with the size of each pie chart symbol. For example, the first title, which is often labelled cliffs, is realised by pairing the first symbol with the first image, which is that of a rocky cliffside.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xltronic.com/nostalgia/aphextwin.nu/v4/learn/98491895499398.shtml |title=The Saw II Graphical F.A.Q |accessdate=2008-06-14 |year=2001 |work=The Aphex Twin Community |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080304212918/http://xltronic.com/nostalgia/aphextwin.nu/v4/learn/98491895499398.shtml |archivedate = 2008-03-04[/tpl] James claimed in The Wire magazine and other media that these songs were inspired by lucid dreams and synaesthesia. Other releases are a fourth Analogue Bubblebath; GAK, derived from early demos sent to Warp Records; and Classics, a compilation album that includes "Digeridoo" and the Xylem Tube EP.
For his 1995 release, ...I Care Because You Do, James used an image of his face for the album cover, a motif that would continue on many of his later records. The album was a compilation of songs composed between 1990 and 1994 and represented a mish-mash of Aphex Twin's various music styles. This was James' last record of the 1990s to use mostly analogue synthesizers. He commissioned Western classical-music composer Philip Glass to create an orchestral version of one of the songs from this album, "Icct Hedral", which appeared on the Donkey Rhubarb EP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aphextwin.nu/learn/98136333384401.shtml |title=The Aphex Twin Community / Learn / Interviews & Articles / Eponymous Rex Interview |publisher=Aphextwin.nu |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl]
In November 1995, The Wire published an article titled "Advice to Clever Children". In the process of producing the interview, a package of tapes containing music from several artists, including Aphex Twin, was sent to Karlheinz Stockhausen. Stockhausen commented:
Aphex Twin, a fan of Stockhausen, responded:
[tpl]quote|"I thought he should listen to a couple of tracks of mine: "Digeridoo", then he'd stop making abstract, random patterns you can't dance to".[tpl]cite journal |last=Witts |first=Dick |authorlink=Dick Witts |author2=Young, Rob |date=November 1995 |title=Advice to Clever Children |journal=The Wire |issue=141 |url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/425/print |accessdate=2008-06-14 |doi=10.2175/106143095X135840 |volume=67 |page=553 [/tpl] [/tpl]
===Jungle, DSP, and laptops: 1995–1999===	
In 1995 (primarily with Hangable Auto Bulb, a near anagram of Analogue Bubblebath), James began releasing more material composed on computers, combining a jungle sound with nostalgic childhood themes and computer-generated acid lines.
James' early adoption of software synthesizers predated the later popularity of using computers to make music. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his music gradually gained more mainstream appeal, as he released Richard D. James Album and Expert Knob Twiddlers (a collaboration with fellow dance producer µ-ziq) in 1996, "Come to Daddy" in 1997 (#36 on UK charts) and "Windowlicker" in 1999 (#16 on UK charts). Two pop songs that heavily use Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques, "Come to Daddy" and "Windowlicker" were shown on MTV and became cover features for music magazines such as NME. The videos for both singles were directed by British artist Chris Cunningham and caused controversy on release because of their disturbing images and themes.
In 1998, Aphex Twin's track "rhubarb" (from Selected Ambient Works Volume II) appeared as part of the BBC's digital widescreen test transmission, which was on loop for many months as the service was introduced across the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok06G7E07Ik |title=BBC Widescreen Digital Test Transmission - 1998 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl]

===Prepared piano, laptops, and more DSP: 2000–2003===

In 2001 Aphex Twin released Drukqs, a two-CD album that featured computer controlled piano songs influenced by Erik Satie and John Cage. Many of the tracks' names are written in the Cornish language (i.e., 'jynweythek' translatable as 'machinemusic'). Also included were abrasive, fast, and meticulously programmed computer-made songs. Rolling Stone described the piano songs as "aimlessly pretty".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/182317/drukqs |title=Drukqs |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Blashill |first=Pat |date=17 October 2001 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Publishing | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080612021848/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/182317/drukqs| archivedate= 12 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Some reviewers concluded that Drukqs was released as a contract breaker with Warp Records—a credible guess, as James' next big release was released on his own Rephlex label. James claimed to interviewers he had accidentally left an MP3 player labelled "Aphex Twin—unreleased tracks" on a plane, containing a large set of new songs, and rushed the album release to preempt an Internet leak.[tpl]cite news |title=Synths, drukqs and rock'n'roll |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/08/1073437402717.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=9 January 2004 |accessdate=2008-06-14 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080612015041/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/08/1073437402717.html| archivedate= 12 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He also released a short EP titled 2 Remixes By AFX the same year as Drukqs. It featured two remixes, the originals being from 808 State and DJ Pierre. In addition, there is one untitled third track that consists of an SSTV image, which consists of mostly of high-pitched sounds, which can be decoded to a viewable image by proper software such as MultiMode (for Macintosh) or MMSSTV (for Windows).

===Synthesizers and drum machines: 2004–present===

In late 2004, James released his Analord series, an 11-part series of EPs with 42 total tracks, initially averaging 2–4 tracks per EP. The series was created by playing and sequencing analogue and digital electronic music equipment such as synthesizers and drum machines. The series was recorded on magnetic tape and then later pressed on vinyl.
James was meticulous about the whole process of recording, mastering, and pressing. James has said Rephlex Records was strict on quality control, trying out various pressing-plant companies until they felt it sounded perfect. To James' ears, vinyl or tape is better than digital, as no two copies are the same. However, label co-owner Grant Wilson-Claridge convinced James to release a CD compilation, Chosen Lords, which included 10 selected tracks from the Analord series. For the Analord series James used his collection of vintage synthesizer and drum machines, some of which were quite rare by that time. Some record inserts have pictures of rare synthesizers like the Synton Fenix, and the notoriously difficult-to-program Roland MC-4 sequencer, as well as the Roland TB-303.
In 2007 media reports indicated that Aphex Twin was recording under a new alias called The Tuss. Rephlex Records has denied that Aphex Twin is The Tuss, but Aphex Twin fans and the media have ignored Rephlex's denial and The Tuss is treated as yet another Aphex Twin project;[tpl]cite news |first=Louis |last=Pattison |title=Dancing in the dark |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/electronic/story/0,,2088396,00.html |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-14 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080618101712/http://music.guardian.co.uk/electronic/story/0,,2088396,00.html| archivedate= 18 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Phelan |title=Ghost in the Machine |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0731,phelan,77377,22.html |work=The Village Voice |publisher=Village Voice Media |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-14 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080608231419/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0731,phelan,77377,22.html| archivedate= 8 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] further evidence being provided by the fact that all Tuss tracks are published in the BMI Repertoire under the name JAMES RICHARD DAVID.[tpl]cite web |url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&page=1&fromrow=1&torow=25&querytype=WriterID&keyid=533933&keyname=JAMES%20RICHARD%20DAVID&CAE=176937227&Affiliation=PRS |title=BMI's entries for RICHARD DAVID JAMES |accessdate=25 November 2008[/tpl]
Twenty more tracks were added to the Analord series in December 2009, only available through download from the Rephlex Records website, such that each EP now contains up to 9 tracks.
In an October 2010 interview with British magazine Another Man, James stated that he had completed 6 albums, one of which was a remake of the unreleased Melodies from Mars, originally produced around the time of Richard D. James Album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40543-aphex-twin-says-hes-got-six-albums-completed/ |title=Aphex Twin Says He's Got Six Albums Completed | News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl] In June 2011, he spoke to Spanish magazine EL PAIS. When asked about the 6 albums, he answered 'More than 10 or 11 are already compiled, and many more songs are orphans.' He also revealed that a new album 'will show in a while' and that the reason it has been so long since his last album was that he was waiting for a divorce from his wife.[tpl]cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&langpair=esen&u=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Odio/publico/elpepicul/20110617elpepicul_3/Tes |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com|accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl]

==Musical style==

James said he composed ambient techno music at the age of 13; he claims to have "over 100 hours" of unreleased music, and to have made his own software to compose with, including algorithmic processes that automatically generate beats and melodies; in addition he claims to experience synaesthesia, and that he is able to incorporate lucid dreaming into the process of making music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.space-age-bachelor.com/archives/aphex-twin |title=Aphex Twin: Mad Musician or Investment Banker? |accessdate=2011-03-10 |last=Anderson |first=Don |year=1999 |work=Space Age Bachelor [/tpl]
Richard's own Rephlex Records label, which he co-owns with Grant Wilson-Claridge, coined the term Braindance in 1991 to describe Aphex Twin's music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A795639 |title=Rephlex - the Record Label |accessdate=2008-06-14 |date=28 August 2002 |work=h2g2 |publisher=BBC [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/music/rephlex.htm |title=The Braindance Coincidence |date=May 2001 |accessdate=2008-06-14 |work=The Milk Factory [/tpl] Rephlex Records' official definition of Aphex Twin and his followers' music is quoted as follows: "Braindance is the genre that encompasses the best elements of all genres, e.g. traditional, classical, electronic music, popular, modern, industrial, ambient, hip-hop, electro, house, techno, breakbeat, hardcore, ragga, garage, drum and bass, etc."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rephlex.com/braindance.htm |title=what is braindance? |accessdate=2008-06-14 |work=rephlex.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010302124112/http://www.rephlex.com/braindance.htm |archivedate=2001-03-02 [/tpl] Braindance applies to forward-thinking electronic music that can appeal to the mind as well as the desire to dance and party, including Ed-DMX's Breakin' records label, µ-ziq's Planet-mu label, the Aphex Twin EP Come to Daddy and Astrobotnia Parts 1, 2 & 3.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15080-parts-1-2-3?artist_title=15080-parts-1-2-3 |title=Astrobotnia Parts 1, 2 & 3 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |last=Cooper |first=Paul |date=4 October 2002 |work=Pitchfork Media | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080407101034/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15080-parts-1-2-3?artist_title=15080-parts-1-2-3| archivedate= 7 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 2001, The Guardian described James' musical lineage as Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and  May.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/oct/05/artsfeatures3 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Tank boy | first=Paul | last=Lester | date=5 October 2001 | accessdate=2010-04-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100529161147/http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/oct/05/artsfeatures3| archivedate= 29 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In acknowledgment of another influence, James released Music from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, a compilation of music recorded by the pioneers of BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which included artists such as Delia Derbyshire,[tpl]cite news |first=Matthew |last=Sweet |title=Queen of the wired frontier |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/mar/17/featuresreview.review |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=2008-06-14 | location=London[/tpl] on his own label, Rephlex Records. Aphex Twin has said, "I don't really like rock & roll." Despite this, he has mentioned being a fan of Led Zeppelin, citing them as a source of "great breakbeats", as well as Pink Floyd for their psychedelic music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kludgemagazine.com/interviews/Aphex_Twin/2002-07-18/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090501160746/http://kludgemagazine.com/interviews/Aphex_Twin/2002-07-18/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 |title=Interview: Aphex Twin |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Perez |first=Arturo |date=16 March 2002 |work=Kludge Magazine [/tpl]
The term 'intelligent dance music', or IDM, was coined in August 1993 by the IDM mailing list based at hyperreal.org, as a term to describe the sound pioneered by the Warp Records Artificial Intelligence Series. The series featured Aphex Twin tracks (under a different pseudonym), as well as early productions from labelmates such as Autechre and LFO. The usage of this term spread in the USA and on internet messageboards, but the term is still a source of controversy and derision amongst the artists and fans, including Aphex Twin. As of October 2011 the list is still active.
[tpl]quote|I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying, 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music.

==Usage of James' face==

James' own face, grinning or distorted in some way, is a common theme in his album covers, his music videos, and the songs themselves. According to him, it began in spite of Techno producers who chose to conceal their identities.
[tpl]quote|I did it because the thing in techno you weren’t supposed to do was to be recognized and stuff. The sort of unwritten rule was that you can’t put your face on the sleeve. It has to be like a circuit board or something. Therefore I put my face on the sleeve. That’s why I originally did it. But then I got carried away.|Aphex Twin[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aphextwin.nu/images/interviewsarticles/afx_interview_by_heiko.pdf |title=Aphex Twin Interview By Heiko Hoffmann|accessdate=2013-05-22|month=September |work= [/tpl][/tpl]
The cover of ...I Care Because You Do features an unsettling painting of James, while the cover of Richard D. James Album presents a close-up photograph. His face is transplanted onto other people's bodies in the music videos of "Come to Daddy" and "Windowlicker". Near the end of the second track of the "Windowlicker" single (commonly referred to as "Equation"), a photo of James' face is embedded as a steganogram which is revealed when run through spectral analysis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php |title=The Aphex Face |accessdate=2008-06-14 |work=bastwood.com | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080617152125/http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php| archivedate= 17 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Another embedded image of James, along with collaborator Tom Jenkinson, appears in the third track of 2 Remixes by AFX, "Bonus High Frequency Sounds", encoded in SSTV format, with text relating to the release.
James has used his own photography for some of his releases, such as the elaborate album sleeve for Selected Ambient Works Volume II.

==Influence and legacy==

The London Sinfonietta has performed arrangements of Aphex Twin tracks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38533-london-sinfonietta-tackles-aphex-twin-squarepusher |title=London Sinfonietta Tackles Aphex Twin, Squarepusher |accessdate=2008-06-14 |author=Llewellyn, Kati; Solarski, Matthew |date=13 September 2006 |work=Pitchfork Media | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080621160947/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38533-london-sinfonietta-tackles-aphex-twin-squarepusher| archivedate= 21 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 2005, the orchestra Alarm Will Sound released Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin. The album consists of acoustic arrangements of some of James' electronic tracks. He has also had an influence on rock bands like Radiohead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1080983 |title=Everything in its Right Place... |accessdate=2008-06-14 |last=Tranter |first=Rhys |date=17 June 2003 |work=Collective |publisher=BBC [/tpl] However, he has dismissed the notion of going on tour with them: "I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them."
Despite his previous comments, he premièred new music alongside Radiohead guitarist/composer Jonny Greenwood in a 2011 collaboration with Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki.[tpl]cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/09/video-jonny-greenwood-aphex-twin-perform-alongside-krzysztof-penderecki/ |title=Video: Jonny Greenwood, Aphex Twin perform alongside Krzysztof Penderecki  |accessdate=2011-09-12 |last=Robbins |first=Winston |date=11 September 2011 |work=Consequence of Sound [/tpl] The animator David Firth has much of his work influenced and soundtracked by Aphex Twin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.semantikon.com/RESaladFingers.htm |title=Re: Salad Fingers |publisher=Semantikon.com |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl]
Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk has also mentioned Aphex Twin (particularly his song, Windowlicker) as an influence on their work.[tpl]cite web|title=Daft Punk: Voyage of Discovery|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/d/daft_punk01/index3.jhtml|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=12 April 2014|quote=MTV: Were there any specific events or records that affected the shift in styles between albums? Bangalter: The only one that I can really see is "Windowlicker" 1999 single by Aphex Twin. We asked ourselves what would be the meaning of the music we were doing: Could electronic music, outside of a club, be the soundtrack of our lives? "Windowlicker" was a real shock for us because it was neither a purely club track at one extreme of the electronic-music spectrum, nor just a very chilled-out downtempo relaxation track at the other end. Right now the two categories in electronic music are this downtempo music and DJ/club music, and we found that there is a middle that could have a very strong emotional dimension and that was instantly accessible to our ears and very experimental at the same time.[/tpl] 
In recent interviews, former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist and solo artist John Frusciante has stated that he thinks Aphex Twin is 'the best thing since sliced bread' and his recent albums and EPs, Outsides and PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone for example, have been heavily influenced by him.

==Personal life==

Describing himself in an interview in The Guardian, James has said: "I'm just some irritating, lying, ginger kid from Cornwall who should have been locked up in some youth detention centre. I just managed to escape and blag it into music." He lives in southeast London in a converted bank, which was formerly the Bank of Cyprus and then HSBC. Contrary to popular opinion, however, he does not own the silver structure in the centre of the roundabout at Elephant and Castle. This is, in fact, the Michael Faraday Memorial, containing a power transformer for the Northern Line, which James jokingly claimed to be buying in an interview with The Face magazine in 2001. Some of these rumours are hard to confirm as he has been known to spread mistruths in the prankster tradition, making such claims as only sleeping two to three hours a night.[tpl]cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |title=Generation Ecstasy |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1998 |pages=186, 189 |isbn=0-316-74111-6 [/tpl]
