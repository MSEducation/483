Moss Arbeiderblad was a Norwegian newspaper, published in Moss in Østfold county. It was affiliated with the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway.
Moss Arbeiderblad was started on 13 November 1920 as Ekstrabladet. In 1921, when the Social Democratic Labour Party broke away from the Norwegian Labour Party, the newspaper sided with the former party. The name was changed to Moss Arbeiderblad in July 1922.[tpl]cite book|last=Zakariassen|first=Olav|coauthors=Jacobsen, Frank Kiel|editor=Flo, Idar|title=Norske aviser fra A til Å|series=Volume four of Norsk presses historie 1660–2010|year=2010|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-15-01604-7|page=223|chapter=Moss Dagblad[/tpl] In 1927 the Social Democratic Labour Party reconciled with the Labour Party, and the two parties again became one.
