Tanjung Bungah (also spelt as Tanjong Bunga) is a suburb of Penang, Malaysia. It is situated in the northern part of Penang Island, with a postal code of 11200. It is one of the suburbs en route to Batu Ferringhi and thus a tourist attraction. Many hotels, which are lower priced than those in Batu Ferringhi, are located in Tanjung Bungah. 
A tourist attraction in Tanjung Bungah is the Floating Mosque, which was built at a cost of 15 million Malaysian ringgit and completed in 2005. Penang Toy Museum is another tourist attraction.
In recent years the area has witnessed rapid development, with the construction of apartments and condominiums. Tanjung Bungah has become a favorite spot for foreigners to settle down in because of its proximity to the educational facilities at Dalat International School and to leisure venues, as well as its proximity to the leisure areas of Batu Ferringhi and Gurney Drive. The Penang Branch Campus of Tunku Abdul Rahman College (TARC), which has its main campus in Kuala Lumpur is located here.
Tanjung Bungah is a valley 1.5 km across and 4 km long flanked by hills on the west, south and east, and the sea on the north. The hill to the east is known as Pearl Hill or Mount Erskine and is 194 meters high. The hill to the south leads to Bukit Bendera.
