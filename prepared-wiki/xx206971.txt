The Fußball-Bezirksoberliga ([tpl]lang-en|Football County Premier League[/tpl]) was the seventh tier of the German football league system in the state of Bavaria from 1988 to 2012. The Bezirksoberligas have also existed in other states of Germany, like Hesse and Lower Saxony. In Hesse, they were renamed to Gruppenligas, in Lower Saxony to Landesligas. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Bavaria abolished its Bezirksoberligas, too, leaving Germany without such a league in senior men's football unless another federation would opt to rename or introduce a league.Das deutsche Fußball-Archiv [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Historical German domestic league tablesFussball.de - Ergebnisse [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Tables and results of all German football leaguesAmateurligen [tpl]de icon[/tpl] The German amateur leagues at kicker.de
