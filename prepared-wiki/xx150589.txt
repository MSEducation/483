Nicktoons Racing is a Nickelodeon crossover racing video game. The game was first developed and released for the Game Boy Color in 1999, while versions for different platforms were released in subsequent years. Nearly all versions were developed by Software Creations with the exception of the Game Boy Advance version, which was developed by Firemint & the arcade version, which was developed by Chicago Gaming.
Nicktoons Racing focuses on engaging players in go-kart racing on various Nicktoons-themed tracks, similar to the Mario Kart line of games. The game features a wide selection of playable characters from various Nicktoons, including characters from Rugrats, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, The Wild Thornberrys, The Angry Beavers, CatDog, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Hey Arnold! and SpongeBob SquarePants.

A sequel to Nicktoons Racing, entitled Nicktoons Winners Cup Racing, was released in 2005 for the Microsoft Windows platform. This is the last Nickelodeon game to feature Ren & Stimpy characters until the release of 2007's Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots & 2011's Nicktoons MLB.
