Political party strength in Illinois is highly dependent upon the county. Cook County, the most populous county in Illinois and encompasses most of Chicago, is a Democratic stronghold. However, Illinois' reputation as a blue state rests upon the fact that the majority of its population and political power is concentrated in Chicago. Outside of Chicago, Illinois is a purple state. DuPage County, including the western suburbs of Chicago, on the other hand, has traditionally been a Republican stronghold, although Democrats have gained some ground in the 2012 congressional elections there. The majority of the state is mostly Republican, although the state atmosphere tends to be moderate. 
Illinois' electoral college votes have gone towards the Democratic presidential candidate for the past six elections, although its congressional makeup tends to remain evenly balanced between Republicans and Democrats.
For years in which a presidential election was held, the table indicates which party's nominees received the state's electoral votes.
