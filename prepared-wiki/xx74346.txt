Bashar Hafez al-Assad ([tpl]lang-ar|بشار حافظ الأسد[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Baššār Ḥāfiẓ al-ʾAsad[/tpl], Levantine pronunciation: [tpl]IPA-ar|baʃˈʃaːr ˈħaːfezˤ elˈʔasad|[/tpl]; born 11 September 1965) is the President of Syria, General Secretary of the Ba'ath Party and Regional Secretary of the party's branch in Syria. He has served as President since 2000, when he succeeded his father, Hafez al-Assad, who led Syria for 30 years until his death.
Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988, and started to work as a physician in the army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital, in London, specializing in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel was killed in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon in 1998. In December 2000, Assad married Asma Assad, née Akhras. Assad was reconfirmed by the national electorate as President of Syria in 2000 and 2007, after the People's Council of Syria had voted to propose the incumbent each time.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052701117.html | publisher=The Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|title=Syrians Vote For Assad in Uncontested Referendum|date=28 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6700021.stm |work=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|title=Syria's Assad wins another term|date=29 May 2007[/tpl]

==Early life==

Bashar al-Assad was born in Damascus on 11 September 1965, the son of Aniseh and Hafez al-Assad.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=20[/tpl] His father, born to a poor family of Alawite background, rose through the Ba'ath Party ranks to take control of the Syrian branch of the Party in the 1970 Corrective Revolution, culminating in his rise to the Syrian presidency.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Hafez al-Assad promoted his supporters within the Ba'ath Party, many of whom were of also Alawite background.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Hafez al-Assad|author=Patrick Seale|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 June 2000|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2000/jun/15/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1|accessdate=19 March 2011|location=London[/tpl] His last name in Arabic means "the lion".[tpl]sfn|Houghton Mifflin|2003|p=74[/tpl]
Unlike his brothers, Bassel and Maher, and sister, Bushra, Bashar was quiet and reserved and says that he lacked interest in politics or the military.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=21[/tpl] He later said that he only entered his father's office once while he was in power and he never spoke about politics with him.[tpl]cite news| url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/11/syria/belt-text/2|newspaper=National Geographic| title=Syria|date=November 2009|accessdate=24 November 2011|page=2|page=9[/tpl] He received his primary and secondary education in the Arab-French al-Hurriya School in Damascus.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=21[/tpl] In 1982, he graduated from high school and went on to study medicine at Damascus University.[tpl]sfn|Leverett|2005|p=59[/tpl]

===Medicine===

In 1988, Assad graduated from medical school and began working as an army doctor in the biggest military hospital, "Tishrin", on the outskirts of Damascus.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article2604469.ece |newspaper=The Times|location=London|title=‘We are going to send him on a trip. Bye, bye Hariri. Rot in hell’|date=22 October 2005| accessdate=26 April 2010|first1=Richard|last1=Beeston|first2=Nick|last2=Blanford[/tpl] Four years later, he went to the United Kingdom to begin postgraduate training in ophthalmology at the Western Eye Hospital, part of the St Mary's group of teaching hospitals in London.[tpl]sfn|Leverett|2005|p=60[/tpl] Bashar at the time had few political aspirations.[tpl]sfn|Minahan|2002|p=83[/tpl] His father had been grooming Bashar's older brother Bassel as the future president, but he never declared this intent.[tpl]sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2008|p=167[/tpl] Bashar, however, was recalled in 1994 to the Syrian Army, after Bassel's death in a car accident.

==Rise to power==

Soon after the death of Bassel, Hafez Assad made the decision to make Bashar the new heir-apparent.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=35[/tpl] Over the next six and half years, until his death in 2000, Hafez went about systematically preparing Bashar for taking over power. Preparations for a smooth transition were made on three levels. First, support was built up for Bashar in the military and security apparatus. Second, Bashar's image was established with the public. And lastly, Bashar was familiarized with the mechanisms of running the country.[tpl]sfn|Leverett|2005|p=61[/tpl]
To establish his credentials in the military, Bashar entered in 1994 the military academy at Homs, north of Damascus, and was propelled through the ranks to become a colonel in January 1999.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=30[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/10/bn.01.html |title=CNN Transcript - Breaking News: President Hafez Al-Assad Assad of Syria Confirmed Dead |publisher=CNN |date=10 June 2000 |accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl]
[/ref] To establish a power base for Bashar in the military, old divisional commanders were pushed into retirement, and new, young, Alawite officers with loyalties to him took their place.[tpl]sfn|Ma'oz|Ginat|Winckler|1999|p=41[/tpl]
Parallel to his military career, Bashar was engaged in public affairs. He was granted wide powers and became a political adviser to President Hafez al-Assad, head of the bureau to receive complaints and appeals of citizens, and led a campaign against corruption. As a result of his campaign against corruption, Bashar was able to remove his potential rivals for president.[tpl]cite news|title=Асад Башар : биография|trans_title=Bashar Assad: A Biography|url=http://www.ladno.ru/person/asad/bio/|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=Ladno|language=Russian[/tpl]
In 1998, Bashar took charge of Syria's Lebanon file, which had since the 1970s been handled by Vice President Abdul Khaddam, one of the few Sunni officials in the Assad government, who had until then been a potential contender for president.[tpl]sfn|Ma'oz|Ginat|Winckler|1999|p=41[/tpl] By taking charge of Syrian affairs in Lebanon, Bashar was able to push Khaddam aside and establish his own power base in Lebanon.[tpl]sfn|Zisser|2007|p=34–35[/tpl] In that same year after minor consultation with Lebanese politicians, Bashar installed Emile Lahoud, a loyal ally of his, as the President of Lebanon and pushed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri aside, by not placing his political weight behind his nomination as prime minister.[tpl]sfn|Blanford|2006|p=69–70[/tpl]
To further weaken the old Syrian order in Lebanon, Bashar replaced the long serving de facto Syrian High Commissioner of Lebanon, Ghazi Kanaan, with Rustum Ghazali.[tpl]sfn|Blanford|2006|p=88[/tpl]

==Presidency: 2000–present==

On 27 May 2007, Bashar was approved as president for another seven-year term, with the official result of 97.6% of the votes in a referendum without another candidate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm |title=Syria |publisher=United States Department of State |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl]
In his foreign policy, Assad is an outspoken critic of the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.[tpl]cite news|last=Issacharoff |first=Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/syria-s-assad-regime-strong-because-of-my-anti-israel-stance-1.340454 |title=Syria's Assad: Regime strong because of my anti-Israel stance |newspaper=Haaretz |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2012 |location=Tel Aviv[/tpl] Until he became president, Assad was not greatly involved in politics; his only public role was head of the Syrian Computer Society, which introduced the Internet to Syria in 2001. Al-Assad was confirmed as president by an unopposed referendum in 2000. He was expected to take a more liberal approach than his father.
Immediately after he took office a reform movement made cautious advances during the Damascus Spring, which led al-Assad to shut down Mezzeh prison and release hundreds of political prisoners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] However, security crackdowns commenced again within the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/02/201129103121562395.html |title=Syria: 'A kingdom of silence' |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=6 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/683/syrian-reform-what-lies-beneath |first=Farid N. |last=Ghadry |title=Syrian Reform: What Lies Beneath |date=Winter 2005 |publisher=Middle East Quarterly [/tpl] By July 2012, according to analysts, Assad had amassed for himself, his family and associates a fortune of perhaps $1.5bn, which is held in Russia, Hong Kong and offshore tax havens to spread the risk of seizure.[tpl]cite news |last= Inman |first= Phillip |date= 19 July 2012 |title= Bashar al-Assad has amassed fortune of up to £950m, analysts estimate |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/19/bashar-al-assad-950m-fortune |publisher= The Guardian |accessdate=20 July 2012|location=London[/tpl]

===Secularism===

In an interview he stated that he saw democracy in Syria as 'a tool to a better life' but then argued that it would take time for democracy to come about and that it could not be rushed. Bashar al-Assad has been described as even more secular than his father, Hafez al Assad. This includes minimal references to religion in public speeches and minimal public association with religious figures.Everyday Arab Identity: The Daily Reproduction of the Arab World, p 59, 2012

===Economy===

Economic liberalization in Syria has been limited, with industry still heavily state-controlled. However some changes have occurred including the introduction of private banking and the encouragement of foreign involvement, most notably in the oil sector. The need for a diversification of the economy has been pressed for by some[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1stjordan.net/actuuk/archivesuk/resultat.php?id=1152&debut=0|title=Syria's economy requires broader reforms to reach and sustain higher growth|publisher=1stjordan.net|date=1 October 2006|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl] as it has been predicted that Syria will change from exporting to having to import oil by 2015. The reliance upon oil is reflected by manufacturing exports representing only 3.1 percent of Syria's GDP.[tpl]cite web|author=Meir Javedanfar|author2=Tal Gurevich|url=http://www.meepas.com/Syriaeconomicsnapshot.htm|title=Syria – Economic Snapshot|publisher=meepas|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl] These issues are especially relevant as Syria's population is predicted to more than double to over 34 million by 2050.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Countries/Syria.aspx|title=Syria|publisher=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl] There have been mild economic sanctions (the Syria Accountability Act) applied by the United States which further complicate the situation. Of major importance are the negotiations for a free trade association agreement with the European Union.

===Foreign relations===

The Middle East Quarterly noted that "As in the case of Iraq, there are lingering questions of Syrian payments to French politicians. Many French politicians join associations and charitable boards both for financial and political gain."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/772/the-chirac-doctrine |title=The Chirac Doctrine |publisher=Middle East Quarterly |date=Fall 2005 |author=Olivier Guitta[/tpl][tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The United States, European Union, the March 14 Alliance, Israel, and France accuse Assad of providing practical support to militant groups active against Israel and against opposition political groups. The latter category would include most political parties other than Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7021986.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | title=Assad sets conference conditions | date=1 October 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, Assad claimed the United States could benefit from the Syrian experience in fighting organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood at the Hama Massacre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=syria&ID=SP33202 |title=Bashar Assad Teaches Visiting Members of U.S. Congress How to Fight Terrorism |publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute |date=16 January 2002 |accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl]
Assad opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite a long-standing animosity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments. Assad used Syria's seat in one of rotating positions on the United Nations Security Council to try to prevent the invasion of Iraq.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan | date=16 September 2004 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] Following the Iraq invasion by US and allied forces, Assad was accused of supporting the Shia insurgency in Iraq.

Assad argued that Syria's gradual withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, beginning in 2000, was precipitated as a result of the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and ended in May 2005.
In 2011, Assad told the Wall Street Journal that he considered himself "anti-Israel" and "anti-West", and that because of these policies he was not in danger of being overthrown.

====Involvement in Lebanon====

Despite gaining re-election in 2007, Assad’s position was considered by some to have been weakened by the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following the Cedar Revolution in 2005. There has also been pressure from the U.S. concerning claims that Syria is linked to terrorist networks, exacerbated by Syrian condemnation of the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah military leader, in Damascus in 2008. Interior Minister Bassam Abdul-Majeed stated that, "Syria, which condemns this cowardly terrorist act, expresses condolences to the martyr family and to the Lebanese people.”[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7242383.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | title=Bomb kills top Hezbollah leader | date=13 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl]

====Arab–Israeli conflict====

In a speech about the 2006 Lebanon War in August 2006, Assad said that Hezbollah had "hoisted the banner of victory," hailing its actions as a "successful resistance."[tpl]cite web|last=Rogers|first=Paul|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict/lebanon_war_3992.jsp|title=Lebanon: the war after the war|publisher=openDemocracy|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl] He claimed that Arab resistance was growing stronger, and warned Israel that "your warplanes, rockets, and your atomic bomb will not protect you in the future." He called Israel an enemy with whom no peace could be achieved as long as they and their allies (especially the U.S.) support the practice of preemptive war. In the same speech, he also called Arab leaders that have criticized Hezbollah "half-men."
In April 2008, Assad told a Qatari newspaper that Syria and Israel had been discussing a peace treaty for a year, with Turkey as a go-between. This was confirmed in May 2008, by a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. As well as a peace treaty, the future of the Golan Heights is being discussed. Assad was quoted in The Guardian as telling the Qatari paper:
 ... there would be no direct negotiations with Israel until a new US president takes office. The US was the only party qualified to sponsor any direct talks, Assad told the paper, but added that the Bush administration "does not have the vision or will for the peace process. It does not have anything."[tpl]cite news|first=Peter|last=Walker|author2=News Agencies|title=Olmert confirms peace talks with Syria|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/21/israelandthepalestinians.syria|work=The Guardian|date=21 May 2008|accessdate=21 May 2008|quote=Israel and Syria are holding indirect peace talks, with Turkey acting as a mediator...|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521213948/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/21/israelandthepalestinians.syria|archivedate= 21 May 2008 |deadurl=no[/tpl] 
According to leaked American cables, Assad called Hamas an "uninvited guest" and said "If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence," comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father Hafez al-Assad. He then claimed Hamas would disappear if peace was brought to the Middle East.[tpl]cite news|title=Assad: Iran won't attack Israel with nukes|author=Roee Nahmias|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3992202,00.html|newspaper=Ynetnews|date=30 November 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Syria's Assad seems to suggest backing for Hamas negotiable, leaked cables say|author=Meris Lutz|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/02/world/la-fg-wikileaks-syria-20101202|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2 December 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl]
Assad has indicated that the peace treaty that he envisions would not be the same kind of peace treaty Israel has with Egypt where there is a legal border crossing and open trade. In a 2006 interview with Charlie Rose, Assad said "There is a big difference between talking about a peace treaty and peace. A peace treaty is like a permanent ceasefire. There's no war, maybe you have an embassy, but you actually won’t have trade, you won't have normal relations because people will not be sympathetic to this relation as long as they are sympathetic with the Palestinians: half a million who live in Syria and half a million in Lebanon and another few millions in other Arab countries."[tpl]cite web|title=An hour with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/484|work=Charlie Rose|date=27 March 2006|accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl]
During the visit of Pope John Paul II to Syria in 2001, Assad requested an apology to Muslims for the medieval Crusades and criticised Israeli treatment of Palestinians. Comparing their suffering to that endured by Jesus Christ in Palestine, Assad claimed that followers of Judaism "tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad."[tpl]cite news|title=Syria and Judaism: The disappearance of the Jews|url=http://www.economist.com/node/617242|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=The Economist|date=10 May 2001|quote=The pope's pilgrimage in the steps of St Paul was widely seen as a success, even if it did not elicit an apology to the Muslim world for the medieval crusades. Syria's president, Bashar Assad, basked in international praise for his religious tolerance. But, notably, this tolerance was not extended to Judaism. Welcoming John Paul, Assad compared the suffering of the Palestinians to that of Jesus Christ. The Jews, he said, "tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad." The pope was taken on a detour to the town of Quneitra, flattened by the Israelis in their partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and called upon to bless the president's vision of a Christian-Islamic alliance to vanquish the common threat of colonising Jews.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Polish experience shaped Pope's Jewish relations|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/pope/polish_experience.html|accessdate=7 May 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=April 2005|quote=The decision to beatify Pius IX, the pope who kidnapped a Jewish child in Bologna and who put Rome's Jews back in their ghetto, was one question mark.
