The Blenheim Riot was an incident that occurred in Blenheim, New Zealand when 150 youths clashed with police after a party on the morning of October 15, 2006. It began when a fight broke out at an 18th birthday party. Hayley Spicer, a witness who was at the party told TVNZ "A fight just broke out next to us and I got pushed against the wall 'cause some guy was here and he pushed me... ...I pushed him and he just went whack and hit me."  Another witness, Tepaea Gear, also claimed to see a fight break out: "And then I see weapons and I just go inside 'cause I see one fella he's got a golf club. So I just run go for the phone and pretty much when I come out there's two fellas knocked out."[tpl]cite web | title = Police fed up with drunken youths | work = TVNZ | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411419/856707 | date = 2006-10-16[/tpl] People spilled out of the party onto Nelson Street and began to throw missiles and damage parked cars; Newstalk ZB described the event as a "rampage".[tpl]cite web | title = Youths run riot in Blenheim | work = Newstalk ZB | url = http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=105614 | date = 2006-10-15[/tpl]
Police sergeant Mike Western stated that the partygoers were blocking traffic and causing a potentially dangerous situation as Nelson Street is also a state highway linking Blenheim with Nelson. "There were probably 150 kids, everyone was drunk and they were throwing bottles. There were cars and trucks driving through getting bottles thrown at them – not just cops."[tpl]cite web | title = Rioting youths keep police busy in Blenheim | work = Stuff.co.nz | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3829559a11,00.html | date = 2006-10-15[/tpl] Police arrived just after 11 pm and ordered everyone to leave the party.[tpl]cite web | title = Fines for teens in clash at party | work = Stuff.co.nz | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3830712a12855,00.html | date = 2006-10-17[/tpl] Because of the size of the crowd, extra police were called in, including off-duty officers as well as officers from Nelson, to control the street fighting that went on for over an hour. Arrests were made until 3:30 am and police said more arrests could follow, 22 people, between the ages of 15 and 22 were charged with offences including disorderly behaviour, wilful damage, resisting police, assaulting police and possession of an offensive weapon. They were put into the police station's holding cells, some joining prisoners already being held there.[tpl]cite web | title = Several in court after party turns into riot | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10406115 | date = 2006-10-16[/tpl]
Cory Hampton, a labourer, pleaded guilty to one charge of disorderly behaviour and one of assaulting police.  When appearing in court the following Monday, he was convicted and fined $500. A number of other people involved in the riot were fined $250 after charges of disorder and wilful damage. Senior sergeant Tony Sampson said that "A number of the partygoers who were largely responsible for the violence and disorderly behaviour, those people have been involved in similar incidents in town over recent weeks and months," One motor sales company on Nelson Street suffered damage worth several thousand dollars and another incurred minor damage to windscreen wipers. Blenheim police and witnesses believe alcohol was a major factor in the riot.
