The venue has a purpose-built slalom course for the Olympic white-water canoe events (flatwater canoeing and kayaking events took place at Dorney Lake, Buckinghamshire, west of London). The main competition channel is an international- and Olympic-standard 300-metre canoe and kayak slalom course.  It and the shorter warm-up course empty into the warm-up and cool-down lake. The white water is created by a system of pumps which lift water into the two start pools. All of the water contained in the system is slightly chlorinated in order to retain water quality.Planning green light for London 2012 Canoe / Kayak slalom venue London2012.com Press Release, 1 October 2008 During the Games, temporary seating was installed around the venue for 12,000 spectators.

===Pre-Games use===

Lee Valley White Water Centre was the only brand new London 2012 venue available for public use before the Games. On 8 September 2012 it became the first London 2012 venue to reopen to the public.  The centre is intended to provide canoeing and rafting activities for users of all abilities who will be able to take advantage of the Olympic and intermediate course.Lee Valley White Water Centre Information Page Retrieved 4 October 2010 The venue is owned, funded and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority; it will join the other London 2012 venues – the Velopark, Hockey Centre and Tennis centre at Eton Manor – that the Park Authority will also own, fund and manage in legacy.

===Gate maps for 2012 Olympics===

Two gate sets were used for the Olympic Games, one for the first two days (left) and another for the last three days (right).  Each gate set had six upstream gates (red numbers), but gate #12 of the first set was a flush gate with the second pole directly downstream of the first.  Paddlers entered gate #12 from the left wall side and exited into the main current.  Gate #18 of the second set was a downstream flush gate, with entrance from the flow and exit into the eddy.  A 90-degree right turn direct from #18 to #19 was faster than the 270-degree eddy spin used by many contenders. All the gates were double-pole.  There was no use of single-pole gates.http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/canoe-kayak/heats-mens-c-1-k-1.html Accessed 2012-08-08http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/canoe-kayak/semifinal-final-mens-c-1.html Accessed 2012-08-08

One of these changes was the conceptualization, design and implementation of the RapidBlocs Obstacle system.  The RapidBlocs system allows course operators to reconfigure the placement of boulders, eddies, and rapids to meet design objectives.  S2o and EPD were further responsible for course tuning and commissioning.  Sources: Institute of Civil Engineers,  ICE Proceedings volume 165  Issue CE 1 February 2012
