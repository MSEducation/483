==Criticism of Wikipedia==

On February 9, 2011, Govier wrote an article published in the Ottawa Citizen which discussed a previous January 2011 New York Times article on the disparity of female to male writers who contribute to the writing and editing of Wikipedia.[ref]Govier, Katherine. http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/archives/story.html?id=4968c08d-0bf5-4ad1-ae2d-9a831e49befb&p=1, The world according to men
As with much of history, it seems Wikipedia is being written mostly by males. The rest of us need to log on, writes Katherine Govier. Ottawa Citizen online, February 9, 2011.

Retrieved online February 27, 2011. The original N.Y. Times article correctly noted that Wikipedia is unwilling to apply gender based quotas to its contributors –its works have never been subject to such restrictions and can be both created and edited anonymously, with or without a user account.Wikimedia.org.

Govier's article criticized Wikipedia's stance on who should be permitted to contribute to the encyclopedia, stating: "Wikipedia disdains rules, hierarchies and orthodoxies. It pledges to be open "even to misogynists." It will not adopt a new way to gather information. The result is that "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit" is in danger of losing its legitimacy."
