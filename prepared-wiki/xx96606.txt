[[Cuthred of Wessex]]

CATEGORIES: West Saxon monarchs, 756 deaths, 8th-century English monarchs, Year of birth unknown, House of Wessex

Cuthred or Cuþræd was the King of Wessex from 740 (739 according to Simeon of Durham, 741 according to John of Worcester) until 756.  He succeeded Æthelheard, his relative and possibly his brother.
Cuthred inherited the kingdom while Mercia was at its peak. The two kingdoms often fought, but it appears that Æthelbald of Mercia was Wessex's overlord and that Æthelbald compelled Cuthred to join him in fighting the Welsh in 743.
Cuthred's reign was a troubled time.  In 748, Cuthred's aetheling Cynric, possibly his son, was killed (according to Henry of Huntingdon in a mutiny), while in 750 the ealdorman Æthelhun led an unsuccessful rebellion.
In 752, Cuthred led a successful rebellion against Æthelbald at Battle Edge in Burford and secured independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign.  He is also said to have fought the Cornish in 753.
