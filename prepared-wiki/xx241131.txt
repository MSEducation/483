Qingshuihe County (Mongolian: [tpl]MongolUnicode|ᠴᠢᠩ[/tpl] [tpl]MongolUnicode|ᠱᠦᠢ[/tpl] [tpl]MongolUnicode|ᠾᠧ[/tpl] [tpl]MongolUnicode|ᠰᠢᠶᠠᠨ[/tpl] [tpl]Unicode|Čiŋ šüi hė siyan[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|s=清水河县 |t=清水河縣 |p=Qīngshuǐhé Xiàn[/tpl]) is a county of Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China, bordering Shanxi province to the south and east. It is the southernmost county-level division of the regional capital of Hohhot, which lies more than [tpl]convert|100|km[/tpl] to the north.
In 2005, the county council started development on a new city, [tpl]convert|20|km[/tpl] north of the existing town[tpl]Which?|date=April 2011[/tpl], closer to Hohhot. Chinese media reports said the scheme would have cost more than $6b yuan ($880m, £610m) in total, many times more than the county government's annual expenditure. The council expected either local, regional or national help to complete the project, but this was not approved. In 2007, money for the project ran out, and development stopped, leaving both a half-developed and unoccupied city, as well as a lack of finances and resource to maintain the existing town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8698184.stm|title=China's unfinished ghost town|publisher=BBC News|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=2011-04-14[/tpl]
