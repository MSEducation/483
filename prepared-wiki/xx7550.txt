===Loanwords===

Foreign loan words are primarily Norse and English with a smaller number coming from French. Examples of Norse loanwords include garey ("garden", from garðr, "enclosure") and sker meaning a sea rock. Examples of French loanwords include danjeyr ("danger", from danger) and vondeish ("advantage", from avantage).
English loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. boy ("boy"), badjer ("badger"), rather than the more usual Gaelic guilley and brock. Henry Jenner, on asking someone what he was doing, was told Ta mee smokal pipe ("I am smoking a pipe"), and that "he certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it." In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, a number of calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its users.
Some religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew e.g. casherick (holy), from the Latin consecrātus; mooinjer (people) from the Latin monasterium (originally a monastery; agglish (church) from the Greek ἐκκλησία (ekklesia, literally meaning assembly) and abb (abbot) from the Hebrew "אבא" (abba, meaning "father"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via early forms of Irish, and English.  In more recent time, ulpan has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. çhellveeish and çhellvane meaning television and telephone respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are also used occasionally especially for ethnic food e.g. chorizo, spaghetti and customs.
To make up for deficiencies in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have also referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.
Going in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include: tholtan (the "th" is pronounced as a "t") meaning a ruined farmhouse, qualtagh meaning a first-foot, keeil meaning a church (especially an old one), cammag, traa-dy-liooar meaning "time enough", and tynwald (tinvaal), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is also suggested that the "House of Keys" takes its name from Kiare as Feed (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.

==Official recognition==

===Parliament and politics===

Although Manx is commonly used for written slogans by local businesses, and appears on departmental letterheads and promotional materials within the Isle of Man Government, it is not used as a spoken language within the business community, or spoken within the Government. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
Manx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony, with new laws being read out by [tpl]lang|gv|Yn Lhaihder[/tpl] ('the Reader') in both Manx and English.
Manx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is also one of the regional languages recognised in the framework of the British-Irish Council.
Political parties have not generally been prominent in Manx politics, but notably two of them, Mec Vannin and Liberal Vannin bear Manx names, although the former no longer stands in elections.

===Education===

Manx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools and also at the Isle of Man College and Centre for Manx Studies. Manx is used as the sole medium for teaching at five of the Island's preschools by a company named [tpl]lang|gv|Mooinjer Veggey[/tpl],Mooinjer Veggey – Official site which also operates the [tpl]lang|gv|Bunscoill Ghaelgagh[/tpl].
The first native speakers of Manx (bilingual with English) in many years have now appeared: children brought up by Manx-speaking parents. Primary immersion education in Manx is provided by the Manx government: since 2003, the former St John's School building has been used by the sole Manx primary school, the [tpl]lang|gv|Bunscoill Ghaelgagh[/tpl] (Manx language-medium primary school). Degrees in Manx are available from the Isle of Man College and the Centre for Manx Studies, while the University of Edinburgh offers an Honours course on the Culture, History, and Language of the Isle of Man.

===Media===

Occasional broadcasts in Manx are made on local stations such as Manx Radio (Radio Vannin), including the news.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manxradio.com/news.aspx?m=70&b1=20&b2=22&b3=24 |title=The Isle of Man's Premier Radio Station :: |publisher=Manx Radio |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] ChellVeeish, an independent production company based on the Island are currently looking into broadcasting television in the language, but currently, there are no television broadcasts.
Manx newspapers also carry a few short pieces in the language.
The first film to be made in Manx – the 22-minute long Ny Kiree fo Niaghtey (The Sheep Under the Snow) – premiered in 1983 and was entered for the 5th Celtic Film and Television Festival in Cardiff in 1984. It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song.
The first Manx television show, Cronk ny Marrey piloted in 2013.

===Signage===

Bilingual road and street signs, and village and town boundary signs, are gradually being introduced throughout the Isle of Man as signage is replaced (unless a village has only a Manx name). All other roadsigns are in English only.
Business signage in Manx is gradually being introduced, but is not mandated by law. 

===Church===

Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now.
The Manx Bible was reprinted in the 1970s, in a "family" edition. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as ben-oast[tpl]ref|http://www.mannin.info/MHF/test.php?book=6&chap=2[/tpl], a hostess or female inn-keeper.
Manx was used in some churches into the late 19th century.

==Classification and dialects==

Manx is one of the three descendants of Old Irish (via Middle Irish and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these), but also shows a number of unique changes. There are two dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 1:xxvii–xxviii, 160
Manx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive palatalisation of labial consonants; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants [tpl]IPA|/pˠ bˠ fˠ w mˠ/[/tpl] contrast phonemically with palatalised [tpl]IPA|/pʲ bʲ fʲ vʲ mʲ/[/tpl], in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both Mayo Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also Ó Baoill 1978, 87) A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final [tpl]IPA|əβʲ[/tpl] (spelled -(a)ibh, -(a)imh in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with [tpl]IPA|əβ[/tpl] (-(e)abh, -(e)amh) in Manx; both have become [tpl]IPA|u[/tpl], spelled -oo or -u(e). Examples include [tpl]lang|gv|shassoo[/tpl] ("to stand"; Irish [tpl]lang|ga|seasamh[/tpl]), [tpl]lang|gv|credjue[/tpl] ("religion"; Irish [tpl]lang|ga|creideamh[/tpl]), [tpl]lang|gv|nealloo[/tpl] ("fainting"; Early Modern Irish [tpl]lang|ga|(i) néalaibh[/tpl], lit. in clouds), and [tpl]lang|gv|erriu[/tpl] ("on you (plural)"; Irish [tpl]lang|ga|oraibh[/tpl]).O'Rahilly 1932, 77–82; Broderick 1984–86, 2:152  However, Manx is further advanced in this than is Scottish, where the verb ending -ibh second person plural is consistently -iv, as it is in the second plural pronoun sibh (shiu in Manx).
Like western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters [tpl]IPA|/kn ɡn mn tn/[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|/kr ɡr mr tr/[/tpl]. For example, Middle Irish [tpl]lang|mga|cnáid[/tpl] ("mockery") and [tpl]lang|mga|mná[/tpl] ("women") have become [tpl]lang|gv|craid[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|gv|mraane[/tpl] respectively in Manx.O'Rahilly 1932, 22 The affrication of [tpl]IPA|d̪ʲ[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|dʒ[/tpl] is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.O'Rahilly 1932, 203
Also like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre), the unstressed word-final syllable [tpl]IPA|iʝ[/tpl] of Middle Irish (spelled -(a)idh and -(a)igh) has developed to [tpl]IPA|iː[/tpl] in Manx, where it is spelled -ee, as in [tpl]lang|gv|kionnee[/tpl] ("buy"; cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|ceannaigh[/tpl]) and [tpl]lang|gv|cullee[/tpl] ("apparatus"; cf. Gaelic [tpl]lang|gd|culaidh[/tpl]).O'Rahilly 1932, 57
Another property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] rather than [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl] appears in unstressed syllables before [tpl]IPA|/x/[/tpl] (in Manx spelling, agh), for example [tpl]lang|gv|jeeragh[/tpl] ("straight") [tpl]IPA|ˈdʒiːrax[/tpl] (Irish [tpl]lang|ga|díreach[/tpl]), [tpl]lang|gv|cooinaghtyn[/tpl] ("to remember") [tpl]IPA|ˈkuːnʲaxt̪ən[/tpl] (Gaelic [tpl]lang|gd|cuimhneachd[/tpl]).O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55
Similarly to Munster Irish, historical bh [tpl]IPA|βʲ[/tpl] and mh (nasalised  [tpl]IPA|βʲ[/tpl]) have been lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as u resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx [tpl]lang|gv|geurey[/tpl] ("winter") [tpl]IPA|ˈɡʲeurə, ˈɡʲuːrə[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|gv|sleityn[/tpl] ("mountains") [tpl]IPA|ˈsleːdʒən[/tpl] correspond to Irish [tpl]lang|ga|geimhreadh[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|ga|sléibhte[/tpl] (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation gíre ([tpl]IPA|ˈɟiːɾʲə[/tpl]) and sléte ([tpl]IPA|ˈʃlʲeːtʲə[/tpl])).O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984–86 3:80–83; Ó Sé 2000:15, 120 Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs [tpl]IPA|ai[/tpl] before velarised consonants (spelled ao in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to [tpl]IPA|eː[/tpl] in many words, as in [tpl]lang|gv|seyr[/tpl] ("carpenter") [tpl]IPA|seːr[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|gv|keyl[/tpl] ("narrow") [tpl]IPA|keːl[/tpl] (spelled [tpl]lang|ga|saor[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|ga|caol[/tpl] in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).Jackson 1955, 47–50; Ó Cuív 1944, 38, 91
Like southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants. For example, [tpl]lang|gv|cloan[/tpl] ("children") [tpl]IPA|klɔːn[/tpl], [tpl]lang|gv|dhone[/tpl] ("brown") [tpl]IPA|d̪ɔːn[/tpl], [tpl]lang|gv|eeym[/tpl] ("butter") [tpl]IPA|iːᵇm[/tpl] correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic [tpl]lang|ga|clann[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ga|donn[/tpl], and [tpl]lang|ga|im[/tpl] respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus western Irish [tpl]IPA|klˠɑːn̪ˠ[/tpl], Southern Irish/Northern Scottish [tpl]IPA|kl̪ˠaun̪ˠ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|d̪ˠaun̪ˠ/d̪ˠoun̪ˠ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|iːm/ɤim[/tpl]), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, [tpl]IPA|kl̪ˠan̪ːˠ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|d̪ˠon̪ːˠ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|imʲː[/tpl].O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57–58; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41
Another similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed [tpl]IPA|əð[/tpl], spelled -(e)adh in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl] in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|caggey[/tpl] ("war") [tpl]IPA|ˈkaːɣə[/tpl], [tpl]lang|gv|moylley[/tpl] ("to praise") [tpl]IPA|ˈmɔlə[/tpl]; cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|cogadh[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|ga|moladh[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA|ˈkˠɔɡˠə[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ˈmˠɔl̪ˠə[/tpl] in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 68; Broderick 1984–86, 2:56, 308 In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) [tpl]IPA|əð[/tpl] became [tpl]IPA|ax[/tpl] in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|voyllagh[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|ˈvɔlax[/tpl] ("would praise"), cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|mholfadh[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA|ˈvˠɔl̪ˠhəx[/tpl] in southern Irish.O'Rahilly 1932, 75
Linguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from Maughold in the northeast of the island to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the Sheading of Rushen.
In Southern Manx, older á and in some cases ó have become [tpl]IPA|eː[/tpl]. In Northern Manx the same happens, but á sometimes remains [tpl]IPA|aː[/tpl] as well. For example, [tpl]lang|gv|laa[/tpl] ("day", cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|lá[/tpl]) is [tpl]IPA|leː[/tpl] in the south but [tpl]IPA|leː[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|laː[/tpl] in the north. Old ó is always [tpl]IPA|eː[/tpl] in both dialects, e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|aeg[/tpl] ("young", cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|óg[/tpl]) is [tpl]IPA|eːɡ[/tpl] in both dialects.Broderick 1984–8,6 1:160
In Northern Manx, older (e)a before nn in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong. For example, [tpl]lang|gv|kione[/tpl] ("head", cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|ceann[/tpl]) is [tpl]IPA|kʲaun[/tpl] in the north but [tpl]IPA|kʲoːn[/tpl] in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161
In both dialects of Manx, words with ua and in some cases ao in Irish and Scottish are spelled with eay in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is [tpl]IPA|iː[/tpl], while in Southern Manx it is [tpl]IPA|ɯː[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|uː[/tpl], or [tpl]IPA|yː[/tpl]. For example, [tpl]lang|gv|geay[/tpl] ("wind", cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|gaoth[/tpl]) is [tpl]IPA|ɡiː[/tpl] in the north and [tpl]IPA|ɡɯː[/tpl] in the south, while [tpl]lang|gv|geayl[/tpl] ("coal", cf. Irish [tpl]lang|ga|gual[/tpl]) is [tpl]IPA|ɡiːl[/tpl] in the north and [tpl]IPA|ɡyːl[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|ɡɯːl[/tpl], or [tpl]IPA|ɡuːl[/tpl] in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:161–62
In both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short [tpl]IPA|d[/tpl] sound before a word-final [tpl]IPA|n[/tpl] in monosyllabic words, as in [tpl]IPA|sleᵈn[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|gv|slane[/tpl] ("whole") and [tpl]IPA|beᵈn[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|gv|ben[/tpl] ("woman"). This phenomenon is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is also pre-occlusion of [tpl]IPA|d[/tpl] before [tpl]IPA|l[/tpl] and of [tpl]IPA|ɡ[/tpl] before [tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl], as in [tpl]IPA|ʃuːᵈl[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|gv|shooyl[/tpl] ("walking") and [tpl]IPA|lɔᶢŋ[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|gv|lhong[/tpl] ("ship"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of [tpl]IPA|b[/tpl] before [tpl]IPA|m[/tpl], on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in [tpl]lang|gv|trome[/tpl] ("heavy"), which is [tpl]IPA|t̪roᵇm[/tpl] in the north but [tpl]IPA|t̪roːm[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|t̪roːᵇm[/tpl] in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:162–63 This feature is also found in Cornish.
Southern Manx tends to lose word-initial [tpl]IPA|ɡ[/tpl] before [tpl]IPA|lʲ[/tpl], while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|glion[/tpl] ("glen") is [tpl]IPA|ɡlʲɔᵈn[/tpl] in the north and [tpl]IPA|lʲɔᵈn[/tpl] in the south, and [tpl]lang|gv|glioon[/tpl] ("knee") is [tpl]IPA|ɡlʲuːn[/tpl] in the north and [tpl]IPA|lʲuːᵈn[/tpl] in the south.Broderick 1984–86, 1:164–65

==Orthography==

The Manx orthography is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use closely related modernised variants of the orthography of Early Modern Irish, the language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it is called Classical Gaelic) until the mid-19th century. These orthographies in general show both word pronunciation and word derivation from the Gaelic past, though not in a one-to-one system, there being only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes.  While Manx in effect uses the English alphabet, except for [tpl]angle bracket|x[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|z[/tpl], the 24 letters of its alphabet likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.
The orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in Welsh and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography shows the pronunciation of words mainly from the point of view of early Modern English "phonetics", and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from the Gaelic point of view.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Kelly|1870|p=xiii[/tpl] footnote in Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography, credited to W. Mackenzie.  The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonetic spelling system, in the same way that English orthographic practices are inconsistent and only partially phonetic. T. F. O'Rahilly expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with a corrupt spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.O'Rahilly 1932, 128
Below is an example of Manx written using Manx Orthography and Gaelic Orthography.
There is no evidence of Gaelic script having been used on the island.

===Cedilla===

Manx uses relatively few diacritics, but a cedilla is often (but not always) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of "ch".

===Examples===

The following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.

====Gaelic versions of the Lord's Prayer====

The Lord's Prayer has been translated into all the Goidelic tongues. Although the wording is not completely cognate, they demonstrate the different orthographies.

===Spelling to sound correspondences===

====Vowels====

====Consonants====

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

The consonant phonemes of Manx are as follows:Thomson 1992, 128–29; Broderick 1993, 234
The voiceless plosives are pronounced with aspiration. The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives [tpl]IPA|/t̪ d̪ tʲ dʲ kʲ/[/tpl] are affricated to [tpl]IPA|d̪͡ð t͡ʃ d͡ʒ kʲ͡ç[/tpl] in many contexts.
Manx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones [tpl]IPA|ð z ʒ[/tpl] to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative [tpl]IPA|ʒ[/tpl] may be further lenited to [tpl]IPA|j[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|ɣ[/tpl] may disappear altogether. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:3–13; Thomson 1992, 129
Another optional process of Manx phonology is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive consonant before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:Broderick 1984–86, 3:28–34; 1993, 236
The trill [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] is realised as a one- or two-contact flap [tpl]IPA|ɾ[/tpl] at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill [tpl]IPA|r[/tpl] when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] can be pronounced either as a strong trill [tpl]IPA|r[/tpl] or, more frequently, as a weak fricative [tpl]IPA|ɹ̝[/tpl], which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic [tpl]IPA|ə̯[/tpl] or disappear altogether.Broderick 1984–86; 3:17–18 This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is itself a non-rhotic accent.Jackson 1955, 118; Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, 1998, Isle of Man, retrieved 2008-09-28 Examples of the pronunciation of [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] include:

===Vowels===

The vowel phonemes of Manx are as follows:Broderick 1993, 230–33
The status of [tpl]IPA|æ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|æː[/tpl] as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as [tpl]lang|gv|ta[/tpl] "is", [tpl]lang|gv|mraane[/tpl] "women", and so on.  An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/aː/[/tpl] have allophones ranging from [tpl]IPA|ɛ/ɛː[/tpl] through [tpl]IPA|æ/æː[/tpl] to [tpl]IPA|a/aː[/tpl]. As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of [tpl]IPA|/a/, /aː/[/tpl].  This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:
When stressed, [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl] is realised as [tpl]IPA|ø[/tpl].Broderick 1993, 232–33
Manx has a relatively large number of diphthongs, all of them falling:

===Stress===

Stress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable.Broderick 1993, 236 Examples include:

==Morphology==

Manx nouns fall into one of two genders, masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for number (the plural being formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix -yn [tpl]IPA|ən[/tpl]), but usually there is no inflection for case, except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways (most common is the addition of the suffix -ey [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl] to feminine nouns). Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in compounds even when they are no longer productive forms; for example [tpl]lang|gv|thie-ollee[/tpl] "cowhouse" uses the old genitive of [tpl]lang|gv|ollagh[/tpl] "cattle".Thomson 1992, 118–19; Broderick 1993, 239–40
Manx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs [tpl]lang|gv|ve[/tpl] "to be" or [tpl]lang|gv|jannoo[/tpl] "to do" are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.Broderick 1984–86, 75–82; 1993, 250, 271; Thomson 1992, 122 Examples:
The future and conditional tenses (and in some irregular verbs, the preterite) make a distinction between "independent" and "dependent" forms. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|cha[/tpl] "not") does precede the verb. For example, "you will lose" is [tpl]lang|gv|caillee oo[/tpl] with the independent form [tpl]lang|gv|caillee[/tpl] ("will lose"), while "you will not lose" is [tpl]lang|gv|cha gaill oo[/tpl] with the dependent form [tpl]lang|gv|caill[/tpl] (which has undergone eclipsis to [tpl]lang|gv|gaill[/tpl] after [tpl]lang|gv|cha[/tpl]). Similarly "they went" is [tpl]lang|gv|hie ad[/tpl] with the independent form [tpl]lang|gv|hie[/tpl] ("went"), while "they did not go" is [tpl]lang|gv|cha jagh ad[/tpl] with the dependent form [tpl]lang|gv|jagh[/tpl].Broderick 1984–86, 1:92; 1992, 250; Thomson 1992, 122 This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as [tpl]lang|sga|beirid[/tpl] ("(s)he carries") vs. [tpl]lang|sga|ní beir[/tpl] ("(s)he does not carry"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g. [tpl]lang|gd|gabhaidh[/tpl] ("will take") vs. [tpl]lang|gd|cha ghabh[/tpl] ("will not take"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g. [tpl]lang|ga|chonaic[/tpl] ("saw") vs. [tpl]lang|ga|ní fhaca[/tpl] ("did not see").
Like the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has so-called inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object. For example, the preposition [tpl]lang|gv|ec[/tpl] "at" has the following forms:

===Numbers===

===Initial consonant mutations===

Like all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment.Broderick 1984–86, 1:7–21; 1993, 236–39; Thomson 1992, 132–35 Manx has two mutations: lenition and nasalisation, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not nasalisation. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.

==Syntax==

Like most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb–subject–object word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the subject, which itself precedes the direct object.Broderick 1993, 276 However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of [tpl]lang|gv|bee[/tpl] ("be") or [tpl]lang|gv|jannoo[/tpl] ("do"). Particles like the negative [tpl]lang|gv|cha[/tpl] ("not") precede the inflected verb. Examples:
 
  
 

When the auxiliary verb is a form of [tpl]lang|gv|jannoo[/tpl] ("do"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle [tpl]lang|gv|y[/tpl]:
 
 
As in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning "to be"), there are two ways of expressing "to be" in Manx: with the substantive verb [tpl]lang|gv|bee[/tpl], and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase.Broderick 1993, 276–77 Examples:
 
  
 

Where the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition [tpl]lang|gv|in[/tpl] ("in") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:
 
 
Otherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form [tpl]lang|gv|is[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|gv|she[/tpl] in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:
 
  

In questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is [tpl]lang|gv|nee[/tpl]:
 
  

==Vocabulary==

Manx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).Broderick 1993, 282–83
