The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, often called the "4R Act," is a United States federal law that established the basic outlines of regulatory reform in the railroad industry and provided transitional operating funds following the 1970 bankruptcy of Penn Central Transportation Company.Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, Pub. L. 94-210, [tpl]USStat|90|31[/tpl], [tpl]USC|45|801[/tpl]. 1976-02-05. The law approved the "Final System Plan" for the newly created Conrail and authorized acquisition of Northeast Corridor tracks and facilities by Amtrak.
The Act was the first in a series of laws which collectively are described as the deregulation of transportation in the United States. It was followed by the Airline Deregulation Act (1978), Staggers Rail Act (1980), and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.

==Background==

Following the massive bankruptcy of the Penn Central in 1970, Congress created Amtrak to take over the failed company's intercity passenger train service, under the Rail Passenger Service Act.Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91-518, [tpl]USStat|84|1327[/tpl]. 1970-10-30. Congress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (the "3R Act") to salvage viable freight operations from Penn Central and other failing rail lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and midwestern regions, through the creation of Conrail.

==Overview of law==

The 4R Act:
The "Declaration of policy" in the Act (Section 101), was as follows:
{{Quote box|width=95%|align=center|quote=(a) Purpose

It is the purpose of the Congress in this Act to provide the means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities, improve the operations and structure, and restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States, and to promote the revitalization of such railway system, so that this mode of transportation will remain viable in the private sector of the economy and will be able to provide energy-efficient, ecologically compatible transportation services with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and economy, through - 
(b) Policy

It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this Act to -
The financial assistance provisions of the Act were largely palliative and transitional. They were extended on the condition that changes in the regulatory system governing railroads be enacted, with the hope that a regulatory system which gave railroads more freedom in pricing and service arrangements, subject to greater competitive constraints, would yield a more viable industry and better service for its users. Studies of the legislative history of the Act indicate that the Gerald Ford administration secured the regulatory provisions only by threatening a veto of any act containing financial assistance for railroads but no reform of the regulatory system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
The changes in regulation provided for were as follows:
In a signing statement, President Ford stated,

==Initial reaction to the act==

Many of the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) at the time of law's enactment were highly unsympathetic to the aims and provisions of the 4R Act. The regulatory provisions had been enacted over several commissioners' objections, and the Commission's implementation of the Act initially had little impact on the way the rail industry functioned.
When President Jimmy Carter nominated A. Daniel O’Neal (originally appointed by President Richard Nixon) to chair the ICC, O’Neal began to develop the possibilities for opening up the rail market to competition and innovation. Also, in 1978 a group of major railroads formed an organization called TRAIN (Transportation by Rail for Agricultural and Industrial Needs) to support further deregulation of the industry. These carriers’ perception was that with collective rate making limited, and a Commission apparently more interested in letting their rates go down than go up, the regulatory system, as a whole, in the net, no longer favored them.[tpl]cite book |title=The Politics of Deregulation |last1=Derthick |first1=Martha |last2=Quirk |first2=Paul J. |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Brookings Institution |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-8157-1817-8 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
Large shippers of goods by rail also wished to have more flexibility in the rail market. The net result of compromise between the carriers and the shippers, and the Jimmy Carter administration’s push for a more competitive transport was the Staggers Act of 1980. The Staggers Act worked from the 4R Act template, but extended its provisions. One of the key changes from the 1976 Act was allowance of secret contracts between carriers and shippers, not limited to large-investment situations and not effectively subject to regulatory review. According to former Congressional Budget Office analyst Christopher Barnekov, such contracts allowed the rail carriers and their shippers much more opportunity readily to develop more efficient transport arrangements which lowered costs for the carriers, yielding better returns for the carriers  and lower rates for the shippers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Thus railroad "deregulation" was a two step process, starting with the 4R Act and concluding with the Staggers Act. In substance, the railroad regulatory reform legislation, in the 1970-1980 period, turned toward greater use of market systems to deal with the problems of the rail industry in the United States, rather than resorting to nationalization, which had been considered from time to time.
