[[Alismatidae]]

CATEGORIES: Monocots

Alismatidae is a botanical name at the rank of subclass.  Circumscription of the subclass will vary with the taxonomic system being used (there are many such systems); the only requirement being that it includes the family Alismataceae. It is a relatively new name: earlier systems, such as the Engler and Wettstein systems, used the name Helobiae for a comparable unit.

==Alismatidae in the Cronquist system==

The Cronquist system treats this as one of four subclasses within the class Liliopsida (=monocotyledons). It consists of (1981):
This subclass comprises less than five hundred species total: many of these are aquatic or semiaquatic plants (see 
Alismatidae info).

==APG II system==

The APG II system does not use formal botanical names above the rank of order; it assigns most of the plants involved to the (expanded) order Alismatales, in the clade 'monocots', although the plants in Cronquist's order  Triuridales are assigned to quite different placements.
