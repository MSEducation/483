==History==

The [tpl]convert|47,00000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] on [tpl]convert|1270|acre|km2[/tpl] facility employs approx. 6,000 people including the new stamping plant for the Ford Transit to begin production in the winter of 2013.  Plant tours were discontinued on September 12, 2001 due to the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks. In 2006, the plant tours were brought back to the public since many visitors criticized the plant for not bringing back the tours. 
The KCAP is responsible for building the popular F-150 (Ford F-Series). In December 2010 Ford announced it was moving the Ford Escape and Ford Escape Hybrid to the Louisville Assembly Plant, which is undergoing $600 million in renovations. The move stirred fears that it could result in the loss of half the jobs at the 3,700-person plant.[tpl]cite web|author=St. Louis Business Journal - by James Dornbrook |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2010/12/09/ford-to-move-escape-work-from-missouri.html |title=Ford to move Escape work from Missouri | St. Louis Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2010-12-10[/tpl]
Missouri had been anticipating changes at the plant. In 2010 it passed the Missouri Manufacturing Jobs Act providing tax incentives for companies that invest in plants in the state by allowing them to keep employee withholding taxes.  While the bill would benefit all industrial businesses it was specifically targeting the plant and was introduced by Jerry Nolte, whose district includes the plant.http://www.tradingmarkets.com/news/stock-alert/f_even-with-missouri-tax-breaks-ford-might-not-upgrade-the-claycomo-plant-1022664.html  Ford could save $150 million over 10 years if it invests in the plant.http://www.kansascity.com/2010/12/09/2510245/ford-to-bring-new-model-to-claycomo.html  The bill had been the subject of a filibuster by United States Senate candidate Chuck Purgason who objected to the favoritism extended to Ford and read aloud sections of Allan W. Eckert's The Frontiersman into the record.http://www.kmbc.com/r/24242995/detail.html
