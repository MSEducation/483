The park is a good example of untouched Kimberley wilderness featuring open woodland, gorges, cliffs and the pools, waterfalls and creeks of the Drysdale River. The park is home to two large waterfalls: Morgan Falls and Solea Falls with numerous smaller falls along the course of the river.
The area provides habitat for a large number of rare plants and animals. Almost 600 species of plants are known to exist within the park. About 30 of these plants are aquatic and swamp varieties that inhabit the permanent pools found along the Drysdale and Carson River. About 25 species of fern also inhabit the area, two of which are not found elsewhere. Species such as fan palms, kalumbaru gums and paperbarks are also found along the watercourses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturebase.net/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,68/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment - Park Finder|year=2010|accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl]

The first European to visit the area was a surveyor with a squatting company, CA Burrowes, who did so in 1886. Both Brockman and Crossman[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] visited the area in separate expeditions in 1901. The first vehicular track was constructed through the region during an expedition and survey in 1954, it ran from Gibb River Station to Kalumburu. The park was gazetted in September 1974, using the boundaries recommended by the Australian Academy of Science committee on National Parks in 1955.[tpl]cite AHD|106017|Drysdale River National Park|date=2010|accessdate=27 November 2010[/tpl]
