The betel (Piper betle) is the leaf of a vine belonging to the Piperaceae family, which includes pepper and kava. It is valued both as a mild stimulant[tpl]cite web|title=Betelnut - stimulant|url=http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/betelnut_stimulant.html[/tpl]  and for its medicinal properties. Betel leaf is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel quid or paan, with or without tobacco, in an addictive psycho-stimulating and euphoria-inducing formulation with adverse health effects. Betel is notable for staining the teeth of regular users.
The betel plant is an evergreen and perennial creeper, with glossy heart-shaped leaves and white catkin. The betel plant originated from South and South East Asia.

==Etymology==

Betel or bétele (Portuguese) derived from the Malayalam word vettila. Vetel in Malayalam means Betel and ila means leaf.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=betelhttp://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/nov252005/1672.pdf>

==Cultivation==

The betel leaf is cultivated in most of South and Southeast Asia. Since it is a creeper, it needs a compatible tree or a long pole for support. Betel requires high land and especially fertile soil. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation.
In Bangladesh, farmers called barui prepare a garden called a barouj in which to grow betel.  The barouj is fenced with bamboo sticks and coconut leaves. The soil is plowed into furrows of 10 to 15 metres' length, 75 centimetres in width and 75 centimetres' depth. Oil cakes, manure, and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of the furrows and wood ash. The creeper cuttings are planted at the beginning of the monsoon season.
Proper shade and irrigation are essential for the successful cultivation of this crop. Betel needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Irrigation is frequent and light, and standing water should not remain for more than half an hour.
Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cow dung slurry is sprinkled. Application of different kinds of leaves at monthly intervals is believed advantageous for the growth of the betel. In 3 to 6 months the vines reach 150 to 180 centimeters in height and they will branch. Harvest begins, with the farmer plucking the leaf and its petiole with his right thumb. The harvest lasts 15 days to one month. The harvested leaves are consumed locally or exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States. Betel is an important part of the economy in rural Bangladesh.
Varieties include 'Magadhi' from Bihar, Gundi, Rasi & Bada varieties from Hinjilicut, Orissa which is more popular in Benaras, Mirzapur, Tunda, Agra & southern districts of Orissa, in India, and 'Venmony Vettila' from Kerala.

The betel quid contains betel leaf, areca nut and slaked lime, and may contain tobacco.[tpl]cite book |year=2012 |title=Betel-quid and Areca-nut |series=IARC Monograph Volume 100E |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer, Geneva |pages=333–364|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100E/mono100E.pdf[/tpl]
Arecoline is the primary active ingredient responsible for the central nervous system effects of the areca nut. Arecoline has been compared to nicotine; however, nicotine acts primarily on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Arecoline is known to be a partial agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, M3 receptors and M4,145 which is believed to be the primary cause of its parasympathetic effects (such as pupillary constriction, bronchial constriction, etc.).
LD50: 100 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously in mouse.2
Other substances are often added to the betel quid, in particular spices, such as cardamom, saffron, cloves, aniseed, turmeric, mustard or sweeteners according to local preferences. Numerous commercially produced mixtures containing some or all of these ingredients are also available in various parts of the world. The betel quid is thus a mixture of substances, placed in the mouth; and betel leaf is not consumed alone. For a predominant majority, the paan usually contains the betel leaf with two basic ingredients, either tobacco or areca nut or both, in raw or any processed form.
The betel quid, or paan, as consumed in various parts of the world, consists of,: 
There is archaeological evidence that the betel leaves have been chewed along with the areca nut since very ancient times. It is not known when these two different stimulant substances were first put together. In most countries, the mixture of both has a ceremonial and highly symbolic value.Betel-Chewing in Vietnam, Its Past and Current Importance
In India, Burma, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and other parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia, the leaves are chewed together in a wrapped package along with the areca nut (which, by association, is often inaccurately called the "betel nut") and mineral slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). Catechu, called Kattha in Hindi, and other flavoring substances and spices might be added.  The lime acts to keep the active ingredient in its freebase or alkaline form, thus enabling it to enter the bloodstream via sublingual absorption. The areca nut contains the alkaloid arecoline, which promotes salivation (the saliva is stained red), and is itself a stimulant. This combination, known as a "betel quid", has been used for several thousand years. Tobacco is sometimes added.
Betel leaves are used as a stimulant, an antiseptic and a breath-freshener.  Betel quid with tobacco is strongly carcinogenic.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/carcin/4.2.169 |title=A study of betel quid carcinogenesis. 1.

In India, the betel and areca play an important role in Indian culture, especially among Hindus.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Many traditional ceremonies governing the lives of Hindus use betel and areca. For example, when paying money to a priest one might place money in a betel leaf.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The betel and areca also play an important role in Vietnamese culture.  In Vietnamese there is a saying that "the betel begins the conversation", referring to the practice of people chewing betel in formal occasions or "to break the ice" in awkward situations.  The betel leaves and areca nuts are used ceremonially in traditional Vietnamese weddings.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Per tradition a groom might offer the bride's parents betel and areca, the leaf and the nut symbolizing the ideal married couple bound together. In Vietnamese the phrase "matters of betel and areca" (chuyện trầu cau) is synonymous with marriage.[tpl]cite web|title=Traditional Vietnamese Wedding|url=http://www.vietnamcharms.com/traditional-vietnamese-wedding.html[/tpl]
In Papua New Guinea, betel is prepared with a mustard stick dipped in lime powder and acts as a stimulant to suppress hunger, reduce stress and heighten the senses. Most families have backyard gardens and many grow betel there. The lime must be purchased. It is processed from corals, especially the fast-growing staghorn corals of genus Acropora.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.panda.org/coral_triangle/2010/07/25/making-lime-for-betelnut-chewing-in-mbuke-manus-png/|title=Making Lime for Betelnut Chewing in M'Buke, Manus, PNG[/tpl][tpl]self-published inline|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Health effects==

The betel leaf is predominantly consumed as betel quid or paan, which is a mixture of substances. The paan almost always contains a betel leaf with two basic ingredients, either areca nut or tobacco or both, with lime (calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04860-1 |title=The new pan-asian paan problem |year=2001 |last1=Mack |first1=TM |journal=The Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9269 |pages=1638[/tpl][tpl]cite book |year=1985 |title=Tobacco Habits Other than Smoking; Betel-Quid and Areca-Nut Chewing; and Some Related Nitrosamines |series=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|pages=33–34,173–221 |isbn=978-92-832-1537-0 |pmid=3866741[/tpl] Areca nut is considered carcinogenic when consumed with tobacco.[tpl]cite book |title=WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008: the MPOWER package |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |isbn=978-92-4-159628-2 |url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7341.799 |title=Areca nut use: An independent risk factor for oral cancer |year=2002 |last1=Warnakulasuriya |first1=S. |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7341 |pages=799–800 |pmid=11934759 |last2=Trivedy |first2=C |last3=Peters |first3=TJ |pmc=1122751[/tpl]
In an extensive scientific research monograph, the World Health Organization expert group for research on cancer reported in 2004 that the percentage of oral cancer among all cancers diagnosed in hospitals in Asia has always been much higher than that usually found in western countries, where the habit of chewing betel quid, with or without tobacco, is virtually unknown. In many descriptive studies, investigators have obtained histories of chewing betel quid with tobacco from series of patients with oral cancer; and in all these studies the percentage of patients who practice betel leaf chewing was found to be extremely large. Researchers also noted that the cancer generally develops at the place where the betel quid is kept.
In an earlier ca. 1985 study, scientists linked malignant tumors to the site of skin or subcutaneous administration of aqueous extracts of betel quid in mice. In hamsters, forestomach carcinomas occurred after painting of the cheek-pouch mucosa with aqueous extracts or implantation of a wax pellet containing powdered betel quid with tobacco into the cheek pouch; carcinomas occurred in the cheek pouch following implantation of the wax pellets. In human populations, they report observing elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells in buccal mucosa of people who chew betel quid in Philippines and India. The scientists also found that the proportion of micronucleated exfoliated cells is related to the site within the oral cavity where the betel quid is kept habitually and to the number of betel quids chewed per day. This proportion, they report, could be reduced by administration for two to three months of vitamin A or β-carotene or a mixture of the two. In related studies, the scientists reported that oral leukoplakia shows a strong association with habits of betel-quid chewing in India. Some follow-up studies have shown malignant transformation of a proportion of leukoplakias. Oral submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, which are generally accepted to be precancerous conditions, appear to be related to the habit of chewing betel quid, that is paan.
In a study conducted in Papua New Guinea, scientists found[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92109-S |title=Slaked lime and betel nut cancer in Papua New Guinea |year=1992 |last1=Thomas |first1=S.J. |last2=MacLennan |first2=R. |journal=The Lancet |volume=340 |issue=8819 |pages=577–8 |pmid=1355157[/tpl] oral squamous cell cancer as the most common malignant tumour in Papua New Guinea. They report that the oral cancer is concentrated at the corner of the mouth and cheek, and corresponds precisely with chewing site of betel leaf with lime in 77% of 169 cases. Powdered slaked lime applied to the chewed areca nut placed inside a betel leaf causes the mean pH to rise to 10, at which reactive oxygen species are generated from betel quid ingredients in vitro. Reactive oxygen species, together with sustained lime-induced cell proliferation, the scientists claim suggest a possible mechanism of carcinogenesis for this tumor.
In a study conducted in Taiwan, scientists found[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/oby.2009.38 |title=Betel Nut Chewing is Strongly Associated with General and Central Obesity in Chinese Male Middle-aged Adults |year=2009 |last1=Lin |first1=Wen-Yuan |last2=Pi-Sunyer |first2=F.

In this study, they investigated the association between betel nut chewing and general obesity (BMI 25 kg/m2) and central obesity. Using multiple linear regression analyses, after adjusting for potential confounders, they claim betel consumption was statistically significantly associated with obesity. The reason for this link between obesity and betel leaf chewing, the scientists admit is unclear.
In another study, scientists report[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10552-010-9570-1 |title=Cancer risks from betel quid chewing beyond oral cancer: A multiple-site carcinogen when acting with smoking |year=2010 |last1=Wen |first1=Chi Pang |last2=Tsai |first2=Min Kuang |last3=Chung |first3=Wen Shen Isabella |last4=Hsu |first4=Hui Ling |last5=Chang |first5=Yen Chen |last6=Chan |first6=Hui Ting |last7=Chiang |first7=Po Huang |last8=Cheng |first8=Ting-Yuan David |last9=Tsai |first9=Shan Pou |journal=Cancer Causes & Control |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=1427–35 |pmid=20458529|display-authors=9 [/tpl] the extent of cancer risks of betel quid chewing (without tobacco added) beyond oral cancer. In addition to oral cancer, significant increases were seen among chewers for cancer of the esophagus, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, and all cancer. Chewing and smoking, as combined by most betel chewers, interacted synergistically and was responsible for half of all cancer deaths in this group. Chewing betel leaf quid and smoking, the scientists claim shortened the life span by nearly 6 years.
A Lancet Oncology publication claims that betel leaf quid, or paan masala, may cause tumours in different parts of the body and not just the oral cavity as previously thought.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(01)00444-2 |title=Indian betel quid more carcinogenic than anticipated |year=2001 |last1=Sharma |first1=Dinesh C |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=464[/tpl]

In October, 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including betel leaf quid with areca nut, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. They concluded there is sufficient evidence that betel quid without tobacco leads to tumor in oral cavity and oesophagus, and that betel quid with added tobacco is a carcinogen to oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70326-2 |title=A review of human carcinogens—Part E: Tobacco, areca nut, alcohol, coal smoke, and salted fish |year=2009 |last1=Secretan |first1=Béatrice |last2=Straif |first2=Kurt |last3=Baan |first3=Robert |last4=Grosse |first4=Yann |last5=El Ghissassi |first5=Fatiha |last6=Bouvard |first6=Véronique |last7=Benbrahim-Tallaa |first7=Lamia |last8=Guha |first8=Neela |last9=Freeman |first9=Crystal |last10=Galichet |first10=Laurent |last11=Cogliano |first11=Vincent |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1033–4 |pmid=19891056|display-authors=8 |author12=WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group [/tpl]
The high rate of oral cancer in South Asia is thought to be due to the chewing of betel preparations; the inclusion of tobacco may worsen the risk, but there is also evidence that the areca nut, alone or as part of a betel quid, may cause cancer even without tobacco.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000401)86:13.0.CO;2-M |title=Paan without tobacco: An independent risk factor for oral cancer |year=2000 |last1=Merchant |first1=Anwar |last2=Husain |first2=Syed S.

Some reports may suggest that betel leaf by itself has adverse health effects, in part because of tannins delivered by the leaf and for reasons currently not fully understood.Morton, J. F. (1992). Widespread tannin intake via stimulants and masticatories, especially guarana, kola nut, betel vine, and accessories (pp. 739-765).

===Effects of chewing betel quid during pregnancy===

Scientific teams from Taiwan, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea have reported that expectant mothers who chew betel quid, during pregnancy, significantly increase adverse outcomes for the baby. The effects of betel quid and areca nut were similar to those reported for mothers who consume alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy. Lower birth weights, reduced birth length and early term were found to be significantly higher.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.01.003 |title=The effect of maternal betel quid exposure during pregnancy on adverse birth outcomes among aborigines in Taiwan |year=2008 |last1=Yang |first1=Mei-Sang |last2=Lee |first2=Chien-Hung |last3=Chang |first3=Shun-Jen |last4=Chung |first4=Tieh-Chi |last5=Tsai |first5=Eing-Mei |last6=Ko |first6=Allen Min-Jen |last7=Ko |first7=Ying-Chin |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=95 |pages=134–9 |pmid=18282667 |issue=1–2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.06.021 |title=Betel nut chewing during pregnancy, Madang province, Papua New Guinea |year=2009 |last1=Senn |first1=M. |last2=Baiwog |first2=F. |last3=Winmai |first3=J. |last4=Mueller |first4=I. |last5=Rogerson |first5=S. |last6=Senn |first6=N. |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=105 |pages=126–31 |pmid=19665325 |issue=1–2[/tpl]

==Economics==

Betel leaves are cultivated throughout southeast Asia. The leaves grow on betel vines, and the average size of vine plots range from 0.5 to 50 decimals (1 decimal = 0.01 acre).
Malaysian farmers cultivate four types of betel plants: sirih India, sirih Melayu, sirih Cina and sirih Udang. The harvest is then sold in bundles of 10 leaves, each bundle costing in 2011 between RM 0.30 to 0.50 ($0.10 to $0.15 per leaf).
In Sri Lanka, betel is grown all over the country but the commercial production of betel, with bigger leaves with dark green colour combined with thickness, known as “kalu bulath” is confined to a few districts such as Kurunagala, Gampaha, Kegalle, Kalutara and Colombo.[tpl]cite web|title= Betel - Piper Betle L |author=Government of Sri Lanka| url= http://www.exportagridept.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=159&lang=ta[/tpl] These are sold at a whole seller lots of 1000 leaves.

According to FAO, the market prices for betel leaves vary with wet and dry season in Sri Lanka, and in 2010 averaged SL Rs. 200-400 per 1000 leaves ($1.82 to $3.64 per 1000 leaves).[tpl]cite web|title=Life in the hill country of Sri Lanka|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/telefood/telefood-projects/slideshows/life-in-the-hill-country-of-sri-lanka/en/ [/tpl] The FAO study assumes no losses from erratic weather, and no losses during storage and transportation of perishable betel leaves. These losses are usually between 35% to 70%.
In Bangladesh, betel leaf farming yields vary by region and vine variety. In one region where betel leaf cultivation is the main source of income for farmers, a total of 2,825 hectares of land is dedicated to betel vine farming.[tpl]cite web|title= Betel-leaf farming benefiting farmers, May 6, 2011|publisher= The Independent|url= http://theindependentbd.com/national/48153-betel-leaf-farming-benefiting-farmers.html [/tpl] The average production cost for these betel farms in Bangladesh are about Tk 300,000 per hectare ($4000 per hectare, $16 per decimal), and the farm owners can earn a profit of over Tk 100,000 per hectare ($1334 per hectare, $5.34 per decimal).

The betel farming industry, the report claims, supports about 400,000 - 500,000 agricultural families.
A March 2011 report claims that betel farming is on a decline in India.[tpl]cite web|title= Too costly to grow| publisher= CSE|url = http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/too-costly-grow [/tpl] While in ideal conditions, some farms may gross annual incomes after expenses of over IN Rs. 26,000 per 10 decimal farm ($5,780 per acre), a betel farm income is highly erratic from year to year, because of rainfall patterns, temperature, and spoilage rates of 35% to 70% during transport over poor infrastructure. Simultaneously, the demand for betel leaves has been dropping in India because of contagious acceptance of gutkha (chewing tobacco) by consumers over betel leaf-based ‘‘paan’’ preparation;[tpl]cite web|title= Paan loses flavour|publisher= CSE|url= http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/paan-loses-flavour [/tpl] the report cites betel leaf trading has dropped  by 65% from 2000 to 2010, and created an over supply. As a result, the report claims Indian farmers do not find betel farming lucrative anymore.
