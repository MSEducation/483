[[Child sexuality]]

CATEGORIES: Childhood, Sexuality and age, Child sexuality

Child sexuality is concerned with the biological, psychological and social influences upon the sexual development of children, and the range of sensational, emotional and consequent sexual activities that may occur before or during puberty, but before full sexual maturity is established.

==History==

Human evolution of social systems seems to favor nurture kinship relations between adults and children, which implies cultures intended to protect children from harm.[tpl]cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009[/tpl] Cultures and religions codified these principles into rules in which children learn to control their natural bodily functions by publicly pleasing adults and privately exploring the world and testing the bounds of adult tolerance.[tpl]cite book |title=Obedience to Authority|first=Stanley | last = Milgram|year=1983|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0061319839[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stamford Prison Experiment|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/|first=Philip G. | last = Zimbardo|year=1971|accessdate=2013-03-13[/tpl]

===Ancient cultures===

Adults are attracted to children in various ways. In some cultures, such as Ancient Greece, adults managed in a way that today would be considered child abuse.
In the traditions of Confucianism, as in humanism, sexual activity and sexual education are generally less regulated but often considered a private matter, so that discussing it may be 'very bad taste'.[tpl]cite book|title=Confucius and Socrates: Teaching Wisdom|first=Sanderson | last = Beck |publisher=World Peace Communications|year=2006|isbn=978-0976221081[/tpl]

===Christianity===

In Western Europe, the predominant religion was Catholicism and theologians such as Bishop Augustine of Hippo considered orgasm a sin. Later, theologians amplified this idea and in medieval times clerics were urged to interrogate the laity and if errant, castigate them by a regime of supervised penance and a diet of bread and holy water for weeks or months (in the sixth century, the Irish St. Columban issued penitence tables which prescribed 20 days).[tpl]cite book |title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven - the Catholic Church and Sexuality|first=Uta | last = Ranke.Heinman|publisher=Penguin Books USA|year=1988|ISBN=0 385 26527 1[/tpl]
Within the wider Christian traditions, sex of any sort, except for the deliberate purpose of conception, was variously said by clerics to cause blindness, deafness and mental confusion, as well as (in Catholicism) eternal damnation of the sinner's soul if not fully 'confessed'.

===Islam===

In Islam, mixing between men and women is strongly discouraged, especially when in private. Although touching and kissing people beyond one's immediate family is not permissible, some socialization is encouraged so that men and women may come to know each other (Surah Al-Hujurat) as long as there is no obscenity, touching, secret meetings or flirting.Sexuality in Islam

===Modern times===

Little is known of child sexuality before the Age of Enlightenment, but it is presumed (considering the number of servants needed to run great households and the simple design of ordinary homes) that many children would have observed sexual activity as a frequent and natural phenomenon.[tpl]cite book |title=The Sexual life of Children|first=Floyd M. | last = Martinson|year=1994|isbn=978-0897893763[/tpl] In the 19th century, with the arrival of industrialization and literacy, sexual repression appears to have become institutionalized and extra-marital activity generally criminalized to the point where newly married couples experienced difficulty in achieving consummation of their marriage.

===Freud===

Until Sigmund Freud published his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1905, children were often regarded as asexual, having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality. While his ideas, such as psycho-sexual development and the Oedipus complex, have been rejected, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a significant change. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions –  they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in genital play or masturbation. Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in puberty (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs.

===Contemporary situation===

In the latter part of the 20th century, sexual liberation probably arose within a massive cultural explosion in the United States of America known as Age of Aquarius following the upheaval of the Second World War, and the vast quantity of audiovisual media distributed worldwide by the new electronic and information technology. Children are apt to gain access and be influenced by material, despite censorship and content-control software.[tpl]cite book |title=How Fantasy Becomes Reality: Seeing Through Media Influence|first=Karen | last = Dill|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0195372083[/tpl]

==Child sexualization in Western cultures==

Children can discover the pleasure of genital stimulation naturally at an early age.[tpl]cite book|title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective Edn 7|first=Garry | last = Kelly|publisher=McGraw-Hill Tx USA|year=2003|isbn=978-0072558357[/tpl] Boys often lie on their stomachs and girls may sit and rock. Manual stimulation occurs about the time of adolescence and mutual masturbation or other sexual experimentation between adolescents of similar ages may also occur, though cultural or religious coercion may inhibit or occult such activity if there is negative peer pressure or if authority figures are likely to disapprove.
Some cultural critics in the Western world have postulated that over recent decades, children have been subject to a premature sexualization, as indicated by a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behavior inappropriate for their age group. The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing; the lack of parental oversight and discipline; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school sex education programs.APA, 2007; Lamb, 2006
For girls and young women in particular, studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "self-image and healthy development".
When an adult or older adolescent has a sexual relationship with a child, it is considered to be a form of child abuse known as child sexual abuse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |title=Child Sexual Abuse |work=Medline Plus|date = 2008-04-02 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine,[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Guidelines for psychological evaluations in child protection matters.

===Theories and research===

Research into youthful sexuality has been largely conducted over the 20th century in the Western World and is mostly concerned with suppression for reasons of religion and/or fears about the spread of sexually transmitted infections.History of sexual research(PDF)

====Freud and Kinsey====

Sigmund Freud in his 1905 work Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality outlined a theory of psycho-sexual development with five distinct phases: the oral stage (0–1.5 years), the anal stage (1.5–3.5 years), the phallic stage (3.5–6 years) which culminates in the resolution of the Oedipus complex, latency phase (6–12 years of age), and the genital (or adult) stage.
Alfred Kinsey in the Kinsey Reports (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). While there were initially concerns that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation of or participation in child sexual abuse,[tpl]cite book|title=Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims: A Practical Guide|last=Salter, Ph.D.|first=Anna C.|year=1988|pages=22–24 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn= 0-8039-3182-4[/tpl] the data was revealed much later in the 1990s to have been gathered from the diary of a single pedophile who had been molesting children since 1917.[tpl]cite news|last = Pool|first = Gary|title = Sex, science, and Kinsey: a conversation with Dr. John Bancroft - head of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|publisher = Humanist|date = Sep–Oct 1996|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_n5_v56/ai_18640605/pg_1|accessdate = 2008-01-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/cont-akchild.html |title=Kinsey Institute director denies allegations by Reisman |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04[/tpl]  This effectively rendered the data-set nearly worthless, not only because it relied entirely on a single source, but the data was hearsay reported by an a highly  unreliable observer. In 2000, Swedish researcher Ing-Beth Larsson noted, "It is quite common for references still to cite Alfred Kinsey", due to the scarcity of subsequent large-scale studies of child sexual behavior.Larsson, IngBeth. Child sexuality and sexual behavior (2000), Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (report), Article number 2000-36-001. English translation (Lambert & Tudball) Article number 2001-123-20.

===Current methodology of study===

Empirical knowledge about child sexual behavior is not usually gathered by direct interviews of children, partly due to ethical consideration. Information about child sexual behavior is gathered by the following methods:

===Behavior===

As mentioned above, most published sexual research material emanates from the Western World, and a great deal of dramatic audio-visual material which might influence social attitudes to child sexuality are generated either in the United States of America or else for that audience. 'Normative' may therefore relate to Western culture rather than to the general complexity of human experience.

====Normative and non-normative behaviors====

Although there are variations between individual children, children are generally curious about their bodies and those of others, and explore their bodies through explorative sex play.SEX PLAY: parenting strategies by Dr. Marilyn HeinsPPP: Health and Safety || When Children's Play Involves Sexuality || Sex play is normal  Playing doctor is one example of such childhood exploration. Such games are generally considered to be normal in young children.  Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more goal-driven.  Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Friedrich|first1=WN|last2=Fisher|first2=J|last3=Broughton|first3=D|last4=Houston|first4=M|last5=Shafran|first5=CR |title=Normative sexual behavior in children: a contemporary sample |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=E9 |year=1998 |pmid=9521975|doi=10.1542/peds.101.4.e9[/tpl] and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors.Larsson & Svedin, 1999, op. cit.; Larsson & Svedin, publication data unavailable; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. Such behaviors are more common among children who have been sexually abused.
A 1997 study based on limited variables found no correlation between early childhood (age 6 and under)  peer sexual play and later adjustment.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224499709551902 | last1 = Okami | first1 = Paul | last2 = Olmstead | first2 = Richard | last3 = Abramson | first3 = Paul R. | year = 1997 | title = Sexual experiences in early childhood: 18-year longitudinal data from the UCLA family lifestyles project - University of California, Los Angeles | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_n4_v34/ai_20536042/pg_1 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 339–347 [/tpl]  The study notes that its results do not demonstrate conclusively that no such correlation exists.  The study also does not address the question of consequences of intense sexual experiences or aggressive or unwanted experiences.(Okami, p. 9)

====Symptomatic behaviors====

Children who have been the victim of child sexual abuse sometimes display overly sexualized behavior,Friedrich et al., 1992, 1993, op. cit.; Kendall-Tackett, K. E., Williams, L., Finkelhor, D. (1993). "The impact of sexual abuse on children: A review and synthesis of recent empirical studies". Psychological Bulletin, 113:164 – 180.; Cosentino, C. E, Meyer-Mahlenburg, H., Alpert, J., Weinberg, S., Gaines, R. (1995). "Sexual behavior problems and psychopathology symptoms in sexually abused girls". Journal of American Academy Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 34, 8:1033–1042.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.Friedrich et al. (1992), op. cit.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. which may be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture. Typical symptomatic behaviors may include excessive or public masturbation and coercing, manipulating or tricking other children into non-consensual or unwanted sexual activities, also referred to as "child-on-child sexual abuse". Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused.
Children who exhibit sexualized behavior may also have other behavioral problems. Other symptoms of child sexual abuse may include manifestations of post-traumatic stress in younger children; fear, aggression, and nightmares in young school-age children; and depression in older children.

====Normative behavior in early childhood====

From the ages of three to seven, the following behaviors are normal among children:

====Normative behavior in early school age====

Early school age covers approximately ages five to seven, and masturbation is common at these ages. Children become more aware of gender differences, and tend to choose same-sex friends and playmates, even disparaging the opposite sex.Sex education: Talking to toddlers and preschoolers about sex - MayoClinic.com Children may drop their close attachment to their opposite-sex parent and become more attached to their same-sex parent.
During this time, children, especially girls, show increased awareness of social norms regarding sex, nudity, and privacy.Richardson, Justin, M.D., and Schuster, Mark, M.D., Ph.D. Everything You Never Wanted Your Kids to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid They'd Ask), 2003, Three Rivers Press Children may use sexual terms to test adult reaction. "Bathroom humor" (jokes and conversation relating to excretory functions), present in earlier stages, continues.Planned Parenthood - Sexuality Development

====Normative behavior in middle childhood====

"Middle childhood" covers the ages from about six to eleven, depending on the methodology and the behavior being studied, individual development varies considerably.
As this stage progresses, the choices of children picking same-sex friends becomes more marked and extending to disparagement of the opposite sex.Adolescent and child sexuality
By the age of 8 or 9 children become aware that sexual arousal is a specific type of erotic sensation and will seek these pleasurable experiences through various sights, self-touches, and fantasy.
Reinisch, June M. (1990). “The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex”. New York: St. Martin's. ISBN 0-312-05268-5

====Sex play among siblings====

In 1980, a survey of 796 undergraduates, 15 percent of females and 10 percent of males reported some form of sexual experience involving a sibling; most of these fell short of actual intercourse. Approximately one quarter of these experiences were described as abusive or exploitative.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01542244[/tpl] A 1989 paper reported the results of a questionnaire with responses from 526 undergraduate college students in which 17 percent of the respondents stated that they had preadolescent sexual experiences with a sibling.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01541971[/tpl]

==In non-Western cultures==

At seven or eight years of age, children of the Trobriand Islands begin to play erotic games with each other and imitate adult seductive attitudes. About four or five years later, they begin to pursue sexual partners in earnest. They change partners often. Girls are just as assertive and dominant as boys in pursuing or refusing a lover. This is not only allowed but encouraged.Weiner, Annette B. The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. United States of America: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 1988.
A much earlier study (1915–1920) of Trobriand children reports that these children attempted to imitate adult sexual intercourse by the time they were 10 years old.Malinowski, B.; H. Ellis (1929). The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia. An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage, and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands, British New Guinea. London. Similar behavior at the same or earlier age was observed among the children in traditional families of the Tahagmyut of Ungava Peninsula, Canada; the Tunumiit of Angmagssalik, Greenland;Kjellström, Rolf. (1973). "Eskimo Marriage: An Account of Traditional Eskimo Courtship and Marriage." Stockholm : Nordiska museet."Eskimo Marriage: An Account of Traditional Eskimo Courtship and Marriage." OCLC WorldCat. Accessed 3 February 2014. and the children of the San in Southern Africa.Tobias, Phillip V. (1978). The bushmen : San hunters and herders of southern Africa. Capetown : Human & Rousseau.
Observations of early Tahitian society indicate childhood sexual activity was more openly encouraged than normally found in other societies.GUS

===The Marquesas===

Explorers and researchers discovered that the Marquesas, had unique sexual customs, considered deviant to Westerners. Contact with Western societies has changed many of these customs, so research into their pre-Western social history has to be done by reading antique writings.
Yuri Lisyansky in his memoirsVoyage round the world in the Ship "Neva", Lisiansky, London 1814, p67 reports that "age was no test of innocence ... practised all the arts of lewd expression and gesture to get aboard.... Among them were some not more than ten years of age. These infants rivaled their mothers in wantonness of their motions and the arts of allurement." Several authors reported about children (eight to twelve years old) who "offered" themselves and had sex.Adam Johann von Krusenstern: Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1803, 1804, 1805 und 1806 auf Befehl Seiner Kaiserliche Majestät Alexanders des Ersten auf den Schiffen Nadeschda und Newa (Journey around the World in the Years 1803, 1804, 1805, and 1806 at the Command of his Imperial Majesty Alexander I in the Ships Nadezhda and Neva) published in Saint Petersburg in 1810. volume I,p116Theodor Waitz: Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker (1872) volume6 p124Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu and Étienne Marchand: Voyage autour du monde, précédé d'une introduction historique ; auquel on a joint des recherches sur les terres australes de Drake, et un examen critique de voyage de Roggeween, avec cartes et figures, Paris, years VI-VIII, 4 vol. p109
