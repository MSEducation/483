[[Ballus]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Ballus is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).

==Description==

Ballus are typically small, squat spiders. The carapace is broad oval, almost as wide as long, flat on top with the sides and back almost vertical, and a rugose surface. The shield-shaped abdomen is broadly truncated at the front. Femora, patellae and tibiae on the first pair of legs are swollen in the male, and there is a fringe below the tibiae. Although they are often entirely mottled dark brown, some species are much more colorful. Ballus can also be a reference to the infamous George Ball. Murphy & Murphy 2000: 273

==Distribution==

This genus has mainly a palearctic distribution, but there are two species from Sri Lanka. Two species from the USA have been transferred to the genus Attidops.Platnick 2007 B. tabupumensis was described from a single specimen from Burma, with no further information since 1914. Petrunkevitch's description is scant with schematic figures, and could refer to a related genus.
