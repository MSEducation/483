Pitch is a perceptual property that allows the ordering of sounds on a frequency-related scale.[ref]

</ref>
Pitches are compared as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies,[ref]

</ref> 
which require sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise.[ref]

Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.[ref]

Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.[tpl]Cite book| title = Signals, Sound, and Sensation | last= Hartmann |first= William Morris| publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-56396-283-7 | pages = 145, 284, 287 | url = http://books.google.at/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=William+M.+Hartmann[/tpl]

==Perception of pitch==

===Pitch and frequency===

Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns musical tones to relative positions on a musical scale based primarily on the frequency of vibration.[ref]
