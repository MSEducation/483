==History==

Feel is an album Hughes’ claims he made for himself, as he was 'tired of being told what to do' http://www.glennhughes.com/discography.html. It is distinctive to Hughes’ other work in that the album has more of a pop, soul and funk sound rather than the hard rock he is generally known for.
This CD marks the first collaboration between Hughes and Pat Thrall since the 1982 Hughes/Thrall album, Thrall plays guitar on eight of the thirteen tracks and co-wrote two of them. Also performing on the album are former Guns N' Roses, now Velvet Revolver drummer Matt Sorum, former Stevie Wonder keyboardist Greg Phillinganes and guitarists Bruce Gowdy and George Nastos.
This is the first solo studio album Hughes made that featured his bass playing on every track since 1977's Play Me Out.
Feel features a cover of the Stevie Wonder song Maybe Your Baby from Talking Book. The Japanese version of the album also includes a new recording of the Deep Purple track Holy Man, which originally featured on Stormbringer.
