==Names and history==

The etymology of caraway is complex and poorly understood.
Caraway has been called by many names in different regions, with names deriving from the Latin cuminum (cumin), the Greek karon (again, cumin), which was adapted into Latin as carum (now meaning caraway), and the Sanskrit karavi, sometimes translated as "caraway" but other times understood to mean "fennel".Katzer's Spice Pages: Caraway Caraway (Carum carvi L.)
English usage of the term caraway dates back to at least 1440,Walter William Skeat,  Principles of English etymology, Volume 2, page 319. 1891 Words of Arabic Origin and is considered by Skeat to be of Arabic origin, though Katzer believes the Arabic al-karawya (cf. Spanish alcaravea) to be derived from the Latin carum.

==Uses==

==Cultivation==

The plant prefers warm, sunny locations and well-drained soil rich in organic matter.  In warmer regions it is planted in the winter months as an annual.  In temperate climates it is planted as a summer annual or biennial. There is however a polyploid variant (with four haploid sets=4n) of this plant that was found to be perennial.
Finland produces approximately 28% (2011) of the world's caraway production.http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/archive/news/finland-a-global-leader-in-caraway-exports/  Caraway cultivation is well suited to the Finnish climate and latitudes which ensure long hours of sunlight in the summer. This results in fruits that contain higher levels of essential oils than those produced in other main growing areas which include Canada, the Netherlands, Egypt and central Europe.

===Companion plant===

Caraway, like many umbellifers, is a useful companion plant. It can hide the scent of neighboring crops from pest insects, as well as attracting beneficial insects like predatory wasps and predatory flies to its flowers.

==Similar herbs==

Caraway thyme has a strong caraway scent and is sometimes used as a substitute for real caraway in recipes.
Other similar members of the family Apiaceae include anise, fennel, dill, cumin, licorice-root (Ligusticum), and coriander (cilantro).
