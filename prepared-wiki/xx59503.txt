CATEGORIES: Daher al-Omar fortifications, District of Acre, Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War

Khirbat Jiddin ([tpl]lang-ar|خربة جدين[/tpl]) was the site of a fortress destroyed by Mamluk Sultan Baibars in 1265. The Bedouin Sheikh Daher el-Omar constructed a larger fortress around the old Crusader period ruins in the 1760's. Shortly afterwards, circa 1775, it was destroyed by Jezzar Pasha.Yeruham National Park, English version, 18/8/2013.Pringle et al., 1994.; later, it was again inhabited by Bedouins. According to a 1945 census, there were 1,500 Muslims living in the area. Khirbat Jiddin lands totaled 7,587 dunums, 4,238 owned by Arabs and 3,349 dunums owned by Jews. Kibbutz Yehiam was established in the area in 1946.About Kibbutz Yehiam
Today this an Arab castle in the Galilee is to be found within Yehi'am Fortress National Park, located 16 km northeast of Acre. 

==History==

The site was inhabited in the Byzantine period.
The Crusaders called  the place Judyn or Iudin. A Crusader castle was built there some time after May 1220, when the Teutonic Order acquired the nearby village of Shifaya. The village fell to Sultan Baybars between 1268 and 1271. In 1283, Burchard of Mount Sion described a destroyed castle on the site that had belonged to the Teutonic Order.Pringle, 1998,  p. 126. The castle was built around two towers with an outer enclosure wall.Petersen, 2001, p. 251 
The fortress as it now exists was built in the eighteenth century by Dhaher al-Omar, the Bedouin leader who became Ottoman governor of the Galilee.Cohen, 1973, p 124. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 19Meron Benvenisti,Sacred Landscape: The Buried History of the Holy Land Since 1948, University of California Press, (2000) 2002 p.302:'The arbitrary designation of any especially massive structure as "Crusader" verges on the absurd in the case of Jidin Castle (on Kibbutz Yehiam), which was built by Sheikh Dahr al-'Omar al-Zaidani . .Within this large fortress are remnants of a small Crusader fort; nevertheless the Israelis refer to Yehiam Castle (as Dahr al-'Omar's fortress is called today) as "a Crusader castle that was destroyed at the time of the Muslim conquest and partially reconstructed by Dahr al-'Omar."  .   It was Dhaher al-Omar who had the enclosure walls, towers and moat (hewn out of rock) constructed, together with an angled entrance gatehouse, vaulted in a manner faithful to the Crusader style.[ref]Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani,
Israel and the Palestinian Territories,Rough Guides, 1998  p.235.[/ref] This hall was the basement of a palatial residence that included a small mosque and a bathhouse. [tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The vaulted roof rested on a series of square pillars on the hillside. The walls featured well shafts and gun-slits. The mosque was a small square building originally roofed with four cross-vaults resting on a central pillar. The bath house was a small building supplied with water from the wells below.
An Italian monk, Mariti, who visited "Geddin" in the 1760s, says he was given a generous reception by the local sheik who guarded the place for Daher.Mariti p. 333, p.388, also cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 251. Jezzar Pasha destroyed the fortress around 1775.
The ruins were later inhabited by Bedouin of the al-Suwaytat tribe whose primary occupation was animal husbandry. In 1944/45, they also cultivated barley and tobacco on 22 dunums of land.Khalidi, 1992, p. 19

===1948 War and aftermath===

Khirbat Jidden was in the territory envisaged as an Arab state in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. On July 11, 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the khirba was captured by Israel's Sheva' Brigade as part of Operation Dekel.
Arab nationalist leader Abu Maher al-Yamani describes preparing for an attack on Jiddin fortress, which was a "gathering site for the enemy forces" prior to 1948.Remembering Abu Maher al Yamani: Forever in the Forefront of Struggle The Jews of Kibbutz Yehiam concur, also noting that the first attack was 20 January 1947 by Qawukji, then Arabs cutting off roads to besiege only 60 Jews with only 20 bullets each; Zvi Gershon describes some individual Arabs continuing to visit the Jews; with airdropped supplies and by moving around the few mortars they possessed, to make it appear they had more numbers and equipment, with 4 Jewish defenders dying during this period, until a convoy attempted to reinforce Yehiam.Kibbutz Yehiam
