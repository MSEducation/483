XEW-AM is a radio station in Mexico City, Mexico. It is branded as W-Radio. It is also simulcast on FM radio station 96.9.

==History==

It began regular broadcasts at 20:00 CST on 18 September 1930. Broadcasting from a room (later to become a proper studio) at the Olympia Cinema on 16 September Street in Mexico City, it initially had only 5 kW of transmitter power, although this was increased to 50 kW by 1934. With the installation of new transmitters, the power became 250 kW by 1935.
It was the first Mexico City station in Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta's Chain of the Americas, the forerunner to today's Televisa whose radio unit still owns XEW-AM.  XEW-AM originally was affiliated with the NBC Radio Networks (NBC and Blue); its future sister stations would take affiliation with rival networks, XEQ-AM with CBS and XEX-AM with Mutual.  As radio in Mexico evolved with the country's growth and more radio stations signed on, XEW-AM became flagship to the country's largest radio network.  Several radio and television stations have derived their call signs from XEW radio and television, all of them affiliated at one time or another with Televisa.
In the United Sates, the call letters for KXEW, a commercial AM radio station in Tucson, Arizona, owned by Pan American Radio Corporation, that went on the air May 10, 1963, were chosen by its president and CEO, J. Carlos McCormick, because of his admiration of Don Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta whom he had met as a teenager during a 1950 visit to Mexico City.
