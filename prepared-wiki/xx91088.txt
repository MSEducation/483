CATEGORIES: Taoyuan County, Taiwan

Taoyuan County ([tpl]zh|t=桃園縣|p=Táoyuán Xiàn[/tpl]) is a county in northwestern Taiwan near New Taipei, Hsinchu County, and Yilan County. Taoyuan City is the county seat. Including Zhongli, the county is a large metropolitan area, home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Taoyuan County developed from a satellite city of Taipei metropolitan area to be the fourth largest metropolitan area in Taiwan. Taoyuan County's easy commute to New Taipei and Taipei City causes it to be the most immigrated county in Taiwan.
"Taoyuan" means "garden of peach", since the area used to have many peach blossoms. Taoyuan is the native home to the Pingpu tribe of Aborigines. It is now an important industrial region of Taiwan. Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which serves Taipei and northern Taiwan, is located in this county.
On 25 December 2014, Taoyuan County will be reorganised as a special municipality named Taoyuan City (桃園市), while the original county-controlled Taoyuan City will become Taoyuan District.[tpl]Cite news|title=桃園縣103年改制直轄市 名為「桃園市」|date=24 April 2012|newspaper=The Epoch Times|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/12/4/24/n3573148.htm|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Early History===

Anciently, the Taoyuan plateau was the home of the Pingpu aboriginal tribe. In prehistory, the Ketagalan Tribe of the Pingpu Aboriginal Tribe settled in Nankan (南崁). In the early years of Dutch colonization, Spanish colonization, and Cheng He of the Ming Dynasty, there were no large-scale cultivation or industrial activities. During the Qing Dynasty, a number of people from Fujian Province and Guangdong province began to immigrate into present-day Taoyuan to develop and farm the land. They planted peach trees, which, when fully bloomed in spring, were so beautiful that the people named the land "Taoziyuan" (桃仔園) which in Chinese means "Peach Garden", which became the present name Taoyuan.

===[tpl]anchor|Japanese occupation (1885-1945)[/tpl]Japanese occupation (1885–1945)===

During the Japanese occupation, the staged migration policy of the Japanese government caused Taoyuan City to develop into a city with a variety of cultures. For example, temples and worshipping paths (currently the Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine) symbolized cultural systems. Wude Temple (武德殿) was used to represent military systems, and the old Taoyuan City Office signified political systems. Taoyuan Area was a part of Shinchiku Prefecture during this time.

===Republic of China (1945-present)===

In 1950, Taoyuan County was established by Republic of China government.  At the edge of the Greater Taipei Region, this caused some structural and life-style changes within its society.  Trade prosperity in recent years and the proliferation of job opportunities helped Taoyuan develop into a major economic district in Northern Taiwan. Population has increased ever since. As part of the Ten Major Construction Projects pursued by the government in the 1970s, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport opened on February 26, 1979. With large numbers of passengers and increasing freight transport, Taoyuan International Airport is now the most important international gateway to Taiwan.
On 25 December 2014, the government plans for Taoyuan County to be reorganised as a special municipality named Taoyuan City (桃園市).
