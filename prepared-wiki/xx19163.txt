[[Scombridae]]

CATEGORIES: Scombridae

The Scombridae are the family of the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos, so includes many of the most important and familiar food fishes. The family consists of 51 species in 15 genera and two subfamilies. All species are in the subfamily Scombrinae, except the butterfly kingfish - which is the sole member of subfamily Gasterochismatinae.[tpl]cite journal|last=Orrell|first=T.M.|last2=Collette |first2=B.B |last3=Johnson |first3=G.D. |title=Molecular data support separate Scombroid and Xiphioid Clades |journal=Bulletin of Marine Science |year=2006 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=505–519 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/download?pub=infobike%3a%2f%2fumrsmas%2fbullmar%2f2006%2f00000079%2f00000003%2fart00007&mimetype=application%2fpdf|accessdate=28 October 2012|format=PDF[/tpl]
Scombrids have two dorsal fins, and a series of finlets behind the rear dorsal fin and anal fin. The caudal fin is strongly divided and rigid, with a slender, ridged base.  The first (spiny) dorsal fin and the pelvic fins are normally retracted into body grooves. Species lengths vary from the [tpl]convert|20|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] of the island mackerel to the [tpl]convert|4.58|m|abbr=on[/tpl] recorded for the immense Atlantic bluefin tuna.
Scombrids are generally predators of the open ocean, and are found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. They are capable of considerable speed, due to a highly streamlined body and retractable fins. Some members of the family, in particular the tunas, are notable for being partially endothermic (warm-blooded), a feature that also helps them to maintain high speed and activity. Other adaptations include a large amount of red muscle, allowing them to maintain activity over long periods. Two of the fastest recorded scombrids are the wahoo and the yellowfin tuna, which can each attain speeds of [tpl]convert|75|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Johnson, G.D. & Gill, A.C.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes |publisher= Academic Press |location=San Diego |pages=190 |isbn=0-12-547665-5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Block|first=Barbara A.|coauthors=Booth, David; Carey, Francis G.|title=Direct measurement of swimming speeds and depth of blue marlin|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |year=1992 |volume=166 |pages=267–284 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/166/1/267.full.pdf |accessdate=19 September 2012 |publisher=Company of Biologists Ltd. |format=PDF |issn=0022-0949[/tpl]

==Classification==

Jordan, Evermann and Clark (1930) divide these fishes into the four families: Cybiidae, Katsuwonidae, Scombridae, and Thunnidae,[tpl]cite book|author = David Starr Jordan, Barton Warren Evermann and H. Walton Clark|year = 1930|title = Report of the Commission for 1928|publisher = U.S. Commission for Fish and Fisheries, Washington, D.C.[/tpl] but taxonomists later classified them all into a single family, Scombridae.[tpl]ITIS |id=202065 |taxon=Gasterochisma melampus |accessdate=18 April 2006[/tpl][tpl]FishBase family | family = Scombridae | month = January | year = 2006[/tpl]
The 51 extant species are in 15 genera and two subfamilies – with the subfamily Scombrinae further grouped into four tribes, as:
