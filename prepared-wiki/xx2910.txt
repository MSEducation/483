==Administration==

The euro is managed and administered by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem (composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of notes and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,[tpl]cite web|title=The Euro |publisher=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm |accessdate=29 January 2009[/tpl] while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.

==Issuing modalities for banknotes==

Since 5 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis.The  European Central Bank history, role and functions by Hanspeter K. Scheller Second Revised Edition 2006, ISBN 92-899-0022-9 (print) ISBN 92-899-0027-X (online) page 103 at the pdf online version Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of the euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares in the capital key of the ECB, calculated using national share of European Union population and national share of European Union GDP, equally weighted.

==Characteristics==

===Coins and banknotes===

The euro is divided into 100 cents (sometimes referred to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English usage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication6336_en.pdf |title=Spelling of the words "euro" and "cent" in official Community languages as used in Community Legislative acts |accessdate=26 November 2008 |author=European Commission |format=PDF[/tpl] Otherwise, normal English plurals are recommended and used,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf |title=English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Commission Directorate-General for Translation |format=PDF[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm |title=Interinstitutional style guide, 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Union[/tpl] with many local variations such as centime in France.
All circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the linguistic plurality of Europe, the Latin alphabet version of euro is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and Arabic numerals (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, that map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country) the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the Union like Norway. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.
The coins are issued in €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c denominations. To avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law).[tpl]cite web|author=European Commission |title=Euro cash: five and familiar |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/een/005/article_4324_en.htm |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date = January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2009[/tpl] This practice is discouraged by the Commission, as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes.Pop, Valentina (22 March 2010) Commission frowns on shop signs that say: '€500 notes not accepted', EU Observer
Commemorative coins with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector's coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/introducing_euro_practical_aspects/l25058_en.htm |title=Commission communication: The introduction of euro banknotes and coins one year after COM(2002) 747 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |author=European Commission |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=15 February 2003[/tpl]
The design for the euro banknotes has common designs on both sides. The design was created by the Austrian designer Robert Kalina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/changeover/2002/photos/html/image12.en.html |title=Robert Kalina, designer of the euro banknotes, at work at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in Vienna |publisher=European Central Bank |accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl] Notes are issued in €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, €5. Each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture. The front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges, symbolising links between countries and with the future. While the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, the initial designs by Robert Kalina were of specific bridges, including the Rialto  and the Pont de Neuilly, and were subsequently rendered more generic; the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes; thus they are not truly generic. The monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone.[tpl]cite news|last=Schmid |first=John |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/03/news/03iht-euro_ed3_.html |title=Etching the Notes of a New European Identity|work=International Herald Tribune |date=3 August 2001 |accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl]

===Payments clearing, electronic funds transfer===

Capital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one country to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R2560:EN:HTML|title=Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro |publisher=EUR-lex – European Communities, Publications office, Official Journal L 344, 28 December 2001 P. 0013 – 0016 |accessdate=26 December 2008[/tpl] This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euro.gov.uk/crossborder.asp |title=Cross border payments in the EU, Euro Information, The Official Treasury Euro Resource |publisher=United Kingdom Treasury |accessdate=26 December 2008[/tpl] Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/paym/target/html/index.en.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121081217/http://www.ecb.int/paym/target/html/index.en.html |archivedate=21 January 2008 |title=TARGET |author=European Central Bank |accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]

===Currency sign===

A special euro currency sign (€) was designed after a public survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two. The European Commission then chose the design created by the Belgian Alain Billiet.
[tpl]quote|Inspiration for the € symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon (Є)In the quotation, the epsilon is actually represented with the Cyrillic capital letter Ukrainian ye (Є, U+0404) instead of the technically more appropriate Greek lunate epsilon symbol (ϵ, U+03F5). – a reference to the cradle of European civilisation – and the first letter of the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to 'certify' the stability of the euro.|sign=European Commission[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/symbol/index_en.htm |title= How to use the euro name and symbol |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=7 April 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
The European Commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground and background colour tones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/notes_and_coins/symbol_en.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011043046/http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/notes_and_coins/symbol_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007 |title=The €uro: Our Currency |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers made it clear that they intended to design their own variants instead.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Jürgen |last=Siebert |url=http://www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/002/02_euro/ |title=The Euro: From Logo to Letter |journal=Font Magazine |issue=2 |year=2002 [/tpl] Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', backspacing and overstriking it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation, but for texts in English the symbol (or the ISO-standard "EUR") should precede the amount.[tpl]cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm#position|title=Position of the ISO code or euro sign in amounts|date=5 February 2009|work=Interinstitutional style guide|publisher=Europa Publications Office|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=Bruxelles, Belgium[/tpl]
There is no official symbol for the cent.

==History==

===Introduction===

The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than three per cent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty per cent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro.
Economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include Fred Arditti, Neil Dowling, Wim Duisenberg, Robert Mundell, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa and Robert Tollison.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=What are the criteria for inclusion in this list|date=December 2009[/tpl] (For macroeconomic theory, see below.)
The name "euro" was officially adopted in Madrid on 16 December 1995. Belgian Esperantist Germain Pirlot, a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, suggesting the name "euro" on 4 August 1995.[tpl]Cite news| title= Germain Pirlot 'uitvinder' van de euro | url= http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | publisher=De Zeewacht | language= Dutch | date=16 February 2007 | accessdate=21 May 2012 [/tpl]
Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro. The definitive values of one euro in terms of the exchange rates at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right.
The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union,by means of Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC) of 31 December 1998. based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.
The procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the Greek drachma and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.by Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC) of 19 June 2000
The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.
The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever (the latter in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia for banknotes and coins. Also, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia will accept banknotes forever, but not coins). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

===Eurozone crisis===

Following the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011[/tpl] This included eurozone members Greece,[tpl]Cite news| author=Brian Blackstone, Tom Lauricella, and Neil Shah | title = Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery |  work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 5 February 2010 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982.html |accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl] Ireland and Portugal and also some EU countries outside the area.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/3274-greek-debt-crisis-worsens | title= Greek Debt Crisis Worsens | author=Bruce Walker |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=The New American |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl] Iceland, the country which experienced the largest crisis in 2008 when its entire international banking system collapsed, has emerged less affected by the sovereign-debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out.

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2011, "If the area is treated as a single entity, its and fiscal position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK" and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the United States. "Moreover", they write, "private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon economies". The authors conclude that the crisis "is as much political as economic" and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of "institutional paraphernalia (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state".[tpl]cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/EuroDebtPaperMarch2011.pdf |title=State of the Union: Can the euro zone survive its debt crisis?|page=4 |format=PDF |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011[/tpl]

In May 2012, socialist François Hollande was elected as president of France and a month later the French socialist legislative position was strengthened, while German leader Angela Merkel "has appeared to be floundering and been badly let down by her advisers in recent months", one commentator said. As such, "serious discord between French and German monetary decision-makers was to that of ... 1992–93, at the height of the crisis over the European Monetary System, the forerunner to EMU" (European Monetary Union). "Hitherto relatively dormant signs of euro skepticism in German public opinion and throughout industry have been multiplying in recent months, making Hollande's proposals increasingly unpalatable to a broad swathe of German opinion. Although considerable controversy will continue to swirl over Greece and Spain, the real battle lines over the future of the euro will be drawn up between Germany and France", the commentary concluded.David Marsh, "Vote for French Left weakens Merkel’s position", MarketWatch, 11 June 2012.

==Direct and indirect usage==

===Direct usage===

The euro is the sole currency of 18 EU member states: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. These countries constitute the "eurozone", some 332 million people in total as of 2013.
With all but two of the remaining EU members obliged to join, together with future members of the EU, the enlargement of the eurozone is set to continue. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of Montenegro and Kosovo and several European micro states (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City) as well as in four overseas territories of EU states that are not themselves part of the EU (Saint Barthélemy, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Akrotiri and Dhekelia). Together this direct usage of the euro outside the EU affects nearly 3 million people.
It is also gaining increasing international usage as a trading currency, in Cuba,[tpl]Cite news| title= Cuba to adopt Euro in foreign trade | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/210441.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=8 November 1998 | accessdate=2 January 2008 [/tpl] North Korea, and Syria.[tpl]Cite news| title= US row leads Syria to snub dollar | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4713622.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=14 February 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2008 [/tpl] There are also various currencies pegged to the euro (see below).

===Use as reserve currency===

Since its introduction, the euro has been the second most widely held international reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period the share of the U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and the Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built on the status of the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/cofer.pdf |title=Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) – Updated COFER tables include first quarter 2009 data. June 30, 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl] the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1 trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.
The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |title=Will the Euro Eventually Surpass the Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |format=PDF |accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl] Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it is "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency".[tpl]Cite news| title=Euro could replace dollar as top currency – Greenspan | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | accessdate=17 September 2007 | date=17 September 2007 |agency=Reuters  [/tpl] In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.
