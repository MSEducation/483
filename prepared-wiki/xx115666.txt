Agecroft Colliery was a coalmine on the Manchester Coalfield in the Agecroft district of Pendlebury that first opened in 1844 in the historic county of Lancashire, England. It exploited the coal seams of the Middle Coal Measures of the Lancashire Coalfield. The colliery had two spells of use; the first between 1844 and 1932 when the most accessible coal seams were exploited and a second lease of life after extensive development in the late 1950s to access the deepest seams.. 

==First colliery (1844–1932)==

The first pit was sunk by Andrew Knowles and Sons and worked an area to the south of the Pendleton Fault. The fault to the north, with a displacement of 695 metres to the northeast, formed a natural boundary to the colliery. The colliery was located close to Clifton Hall Colliery (Lumns Lane, Clifton), and had access to the Manchester and Bolton Railway line and the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal. In 1896 Agecroft Nos 1 & 2 pits employed 371 underground and 111 surface workers while Agecroft Nos 3 & 4 employed 15 underground and 39 on the surface. In 1923 Nos 1 & 2 pits employed 272 workers and Nos 3 & 4 a total of 371. Floor upheaval on 4 November 1926 resulted in the deaths of six miners.[tpl]citation |title=Andrew Knowles & Sons Ltd.|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/k1001.htm|publisher=Durham Mining Museum |accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl]

==Second colliery (1960–1991)==

In the late 1940s and early 1950s the National Coal Board (NCB), aware that coal reserves in its collieries were becoming exhausted, looked at re-opening Agecroft. The NCB carried out deephole-boring in July 1951. In total seven boreholes were drilled; the deepest to 1,155 metres (3,790 feet). In early 1953 it was deduced that there was an estimated 80 million tonnes of workable coal in seams varying from 68 cm to 213 cm (2 ft 2½ in to 7 ft 0 in) in thickness.
The second Agecroft Colliery was the first coal mine to be sunk in Lancashire after World War II. It cost £9 million to realign and restructure the pit. The new colliery was situated between Agecroft Road (A6044), Dell Avenue and the Manchester to Bolton railway line. The old Nos 3 & 4 shafts were realigned for coal extraction, and a new No 5 shaft sunk (610 metres in depth, 7.3 metres in diameter) to provide ventilation and for winding men and equipment into the mine. A tunnelling programme commenced in August 1957 and 10,060 metres of tunnel was driven to allow for development of initial output. New surface buildings were built and the colliery was substantially complete by 1960. The first coal winding began in August 1960. 

===Disaster of 1958===

In 1958, while construction workers were sinking shafts, an underground explosion killed one man and injured twelve, trapping them at the bottom of the [tpl]convert|1900|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] shaft. The accident was attributed to a misunderstanding in signalling, when men at the top mistakenly believed that the men at the bottom had left the pit and commenced demolition sending tonnes of rock and debris down the shaft.http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Snt3jP83c&feature=related

===Final years of operation===

Some workers at the pit participated in the miners' strike from 1984–1985. The colliery closed in March 1991 and demolition began later that year.

==Agecroft Power Station==

The colliery's main customer was the Central Electricity Generating Board’s Agecroft Power Station close to the River Irwell. Coal was transported directly to the power station via an enclosed conveyor belt on a bridge over Agecroft Road (A6044). Some coal was moved by merry-go-round coal hopper trains shuttling between coal mines and the power station. Its closure was announced in November 1992 and demolition on the site commenced in 1993 culminating in the destruction of its four cooling towers in May 1994.

==Redevelopment==

In the late 1990s, a business enterprise park opened on the colliery site. Much of the land remains unused. An international railfreight terminal was planned next to the Manchester to Bolton railway line but, though a spur line was built, the development did not materialise. A housing development has been built on Agecroft Road on the Thermalite factory site and a prison, HMP Forest Bank and Youth Offenders' Institute, built close to the power station site. The land has been landscaped, and footpaths constructed to encourage recreational use.
Swinton RLFC plans to build a 6,000-seat stadium on land immediately east of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal between Agecroft Road and the prison in 2013-14.
