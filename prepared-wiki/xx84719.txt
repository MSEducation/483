[[Teachers' Day]]

CATEGORIES: Teaching, Schoolteachers, Unofficial observances, Generic types of holidays

In many countries, Teachers' Days (or Teachers Day) are intended to be special days for the appreciation of teachers, and may include celebrations to honour them for their special contributions in a particular field area, or the community in general. The date on which Teachers' day is celebrated varies from country to country. Teachers' days are distinct from World Teachers' Day which is officially celebrated across the world on October 5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.5oct.org |title=World Teachersâ€™ Day, October 2 |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]

==History==

The idea of celebrating Teachers' Day took ground independently in many countries during the 20th century; in most cases, they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education (for example, Argentina commemorates Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death on September 11 since 1915,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jardindeinfantesdfs.com.ar/historia.htm#El%20Maestro%20Argentino:%20Domingo%20F.%20Sarmiento |title=Historia |publisher=Jardindeinfantesdfs.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02[/tpl] while India celebrates Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's birthday on September 5 since 1962[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianchild.com/teachers_day_india.htm |title=Teachers day, Teachers Day in India - Presidents abdul speech |publisher=Indianchild.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02[/tpl]).  This is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days.
