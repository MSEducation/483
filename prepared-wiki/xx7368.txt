[[Emergency contraception]]

CATEGORIES: Hormonal contraception, Intrauterine contraception

Emergency contraception (EC), or emergency postcoital contraception, are birth control measures that, if taken after sexual intercourse, may prevent pregnancy.
Forms of EC include:

==Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)==

Emergency contraceptive pills (sometimes referred to as emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) in Great Britain) may contain higher doses of the same hormones (estrogens, progestins, or both) found in regular combined oral contraceptive pills. Taken after unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure, such higher doses may prevent pregnancy from occurring.[tpl]cite journal |author=Food and Drug Administration (FDA) |date=February 25, 1997 |title=Certain combined oral contraceptives for use as postcoital emergency contraception |journal=Federal Register |volume=62 |issue=37 |pages=8610–8612 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-02-25/pdf/97-4663.pdf[/tpl]
The phrase "morning-after pill" is a misnomer; ECPs are most effective when used shortly after intercourse.

===Types of ECPs===

Three types of emergency contraceptive pills are available: combined estrogen and progestin pills, progestin-only (levonorgestrel) pills, and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills.[tpl]cite web|last1=Trussell|first1=James|last2=Raymond|first2=Elizabeth G.|last3=Cleland|first3=Kelly|date=February 2014|title=Emergency contraception: a last chance to prevent unintended pregnancy|location=Princeton|publisher=Office of Population Research at Princeton University, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals|url=http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ec-review.pdf|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl] Progestin-only and antiprogestin pills are available as dedicated (specifically packaged for use as) emergency contraceptive pills.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gemzell-Danielsson|first1=Kristina|last2=Rabe|first2=Thomas|last3=Cheng|first3=Linan|date=March 2013|title=Emergency contraception—an update|journal=Gynecological Endocrinology|volume=29|issue=Supplement 1|pages=1–14|doi=10.3109/09513590.2013.774591|pmid=23437846[/tpl] Combined estrogen and progestin pills are no longer available as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills, but certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills may be used as emergency contraceptive pills.
Progestin-only emergency contraceptive pills contain 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel, either as a single 1.5 mg tablet or as a split dose of two 0.75 mg tablets taken 12 hours apart, effective up to 72 hours after intercourse. Progestin-only ECPs are sold under many different brand names, including NorLevo (in over 50 countries, including Canada), Escapelle, Levonelle, Postinor, Plan B (United States and Canada), Next Choice (United States and Canada), My Way (United States), and generic levonorgestrel.[tpl]cite web|last1=Trussell|first1=James|last2=Cleland|first2=Kelly|date=February 13, 2013|title=Dedicated emergency contraceptive pills worldwide|location=Princeton|publisher=Office of Population Research at Princeton University, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals|url=http://ec.princeton.edu/pills/Dedicated_ECPs.pdf|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=ICEC|year=2014|title=EC pill types and countries of availability, by brand|location=New York|publisher=International Consortium for Emergency Contraception (ICEC)|url=http://www.cecinfo.org/country-by-country-information/status-availability-database/ec-pill-types-and-countries-of-availability-by-brand/|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=ECEC|year=2014|title=Emergency contraception availability in Europe|location=New York|publisher=European Consortium for Emergency Contraception (ECEC)|url=http://www.ec-ec.org/emergency-contraception-in-europe/emergency-contraception-availability-in-europe/|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl] Progestin-only ECPs are available over-the-counter (OTC) in several countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, India, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, United States), and are available from a pharmacist without a prescription in many countries, and available with a prescription in some other countries.
The antiprogestin ulipristal acetate is available as a micronized 30 mg emergency contraceptive tablet, effective up to 120 hours after intercourse. Ulipristal acetate ECPs developed by HRA Pharma are available by prescription in over 50 countries under the brand names ellaOne, ella (marketed by Watson Pharmaceuticals in the United States), Duprisal 30, Ulipristal 30, and UPRIS.[tpl]cite web|author=HRA Pharma|date=March 2013|title=Countries where ellaOne was launched|location=Paris|publisher=HRA Pharma|url=http://www.ellaone.com/#countries|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl]
The antiprogestin mifepristone is available in five countries as a low-dose (10 mg or 12.5 mg) or mid-dose (25 mg) emergency contraceptive tablet, effective up to 120 hours after intercourse.  Low-dose mifepristone ECPs are available by prescription in Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, and Vietnam, and from a pharmacist without a prescription in China.  Mid-dose mifepristone ECPs are available by prescription in China and Vietnam.
Combined estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel or norgestrel) pills used to be available as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills under several brand names: Schering PC4, Tetragynon, Neoprimavlar, and Preven (in the United States), but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive pills with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral contraceptive pills can be taken in split doses 12 hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72 hours after intercourse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26 brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel or norgestrel available in the United States that can be used in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen.

===Effectiveness of ECPs===

The effectiveness of emergency contraception is presented differently from the effectiveness of ongoing methods of birth control: it is expressed as a percentage reduction in pregnancy rate for a single use of EC. Different ECP regimens have different effectiveness levels, and even for a single regimen different studies may find varying rates of effectiveness.  Using an example of "75% effective", an article in American Family Physician explains the effectiveness calculation thus:  ... these numbers do not translate into a pregnancy rate of 25 percent. Rather, they mean that if 1,000 women have unprotected intercourse in the middle two weeks of their menstrual cycles, approximately 80 will become pregnant. Use of emergency contraceptive pills would reduce this number by 75 percent, to 20 women.

The progestin-only regimen (using levonorgestrel) is reported by the U.S. FDA to have an 89% effectiveness.  [tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], the labeling on the U.S. brand Plan B explained this effectiveness rate by stating, "Seven out of every eight women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant."[tpl]cite web |publisher =Food and Drug Administration |date=August 24, 2006 |title=Plan B label information |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021045s011lbl.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-07-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070124182515/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021045s011lbl.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-01-24[/tpl]

While most studies of emergency contraception have only enrolled women within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, a 2002 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that reasonable effectiveness may continue for up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse.[tpl]cite journal|last1=von Hertzen|first1=Helena|last2=Piaggio|first2=Gilda|last3=Peregoudov|first3=Alexandre|last4=Ding|first4=Juhong|last5=Chen|first5=Junling|last6=Song|first6=Si|last7=Bártfai|first7=György|last8=Ng|first8=Ernest|last9=Gemzell-Danielsson|first9=Kristina|last10=Oyunbileg|first10=Amindavaa|last11=Wu|first11=Shangchun|last12=Cheng|first12=Weiyu|last13=Lüdicke|first13=Frank|last14=Pretnar-Darovec|first14=Alenka|last15=Kirkman|first15=Rosemary|last16=Mittal|first16=Suneeta|last17=Khomassuridze|first17=Archil|last18=Apter|first18=Dan|last19=WHO Research Group on Post-ovulatory Methods of Fertility Regulation|date=December 7, 2002|title=Low dose mifepristone and two regimens of levonorgestrel for emergency contraception: a WHO multicentre randomised trial|volume=360|issue=9348|pages=1803–1810|journal=Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11767-3|pmid=12480356[/tpl]

HRA Pharma changed its packaging information for Norlevo (which has dosage and chemical makeup identical to many other EHCs) in November 2013 warning that the drug loses effectiveness in women who weigh more than 165 pounds and is completely ineffective for women who weigh over 176 pounds.http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/11/plan-b-morning-after-pill-weight-limit-poundshttp://www.popsci.com/article/science/fyi-why-doesnt-plan-b-work-heavier-women?src=SOC&dom=fb

====History of calculation methods====

Early studies of emergency contraceptives did not attempt to calculate a failure rate; they simply reported the number of women who became pregnant after using an emergency contraceptive. Since 1980, clinical trials of emergency contraception have first calculated probable pregnancies in the study group if no treatment were given.  The effectiveness is calculated by dividing observed pregnancies by the estimated number of pregnancies without treatment.
[tpl]cite journal|author=Dixon GW, Schlesselman JJ, Ory HW, Blye RP |title=Ethinyl estradiol and conjugated estrogens as postcoital contraceptives |journal=JAMA |year=1980 |volume=244 |issue=12 |pages=1336–9 |pmid=6251288 | doi = 10.1001/jama.244.12.1336[/tpl]
Placebo-controlled trials that could give a precise measure of the pregnancy rate without treatment would be unethical, so the effectiveness percentage is based on estimated pregnancy rates. These are currently estimated using variants of the calendar method.
[tpl]cite journal |author=Trussell J, Ellertson C, Stewart F |year=1996 |title=The effectiveness of the Yuzpe regimen of emergency contraception |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=58–64, 87 |pmid=8777940 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3634/is_199603/ai_n8736107/print | doi = 10.2307/2136125 |jstor=2136125[/tpl]
Women with irregular cycles for any reason (including recent hormone use such as oral contraceptives and breastfeeding) must be excluded from such calculations. Even for women included in the calculation, the limitations of calendar methods of fertility determination have long been recognized.  In their February 2014 emergency review article, Trussell and Raymond note:
 Calculation of effectiveness, and particularly the denominator of the fraction, involves many assumptions that are difficult to validate...The risk of pregnancy for women requesting ECPs appears to be lower than assumed in the estimates of ECP efficacy, which are consequently likely to be overestimates. Yet, precise estimates of efficacy may not be highly relevant to many women who have had unprotected intercourse, since ECPs are often the only available treatment. 
In 1999, hormonal assay was suggested as a more accurate method of estimating fertility for EC studies.

===Safety===

Existing pregnancy is not a contraindication in terms of safety, as there is no known harm to the woman, the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined emergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not indicated for a woman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women who are already pregnant.[tpl]cite journal|author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|date=October 2005|title=Emergency contraception|journal=Pediatrics|volume=116|issue=4|pages=1026–1035|doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1877|pmid=16147972|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/4/1026.full.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David A.|last2=Raymond|first2=Elizabeth G.|date=August 6, 2002|title=Emergency contraception|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=137|issue=3|pages=180–189|pmid=12160366[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|date=May 2010|title=ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 112: Emergency contraception|journal=Obstet Gynecol|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1100–1109|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181deff2a|pmid=20410799[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|date=August 22, 2006|title=Plan B Rx to OTC switch Medical Reviews|location=Beltsville, Md.|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|pages=32–7, 133–77|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2006/021045s011_Plan_B__MedR.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-13[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research|year=2009|chapter=Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)|title=Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use|edition=4th|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156388-8|page=63|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241563888_eng.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=RCOG Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare|year=2009|chapter=Emergency contraception|title=UK medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use|location=London|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|pages=107–115|url=http://www.fsrh.org/pdfs/UKMEC2009.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=CDC Division of Reproductive Health|date=June 18, 2010|title=U.S. Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2010|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|volume=59|issue=RR-4|pages=1–86|pmid=20559203|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5904.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Davidoff|first1=Frank|last2=Trussell|first2=James|date=October 11, 2006|title=Plan B and the politics of doubt (commentary)|journal=JAMA|volume=296|issue=14|pages=1775–1778|doi=10.1001/jama.296.14.1775|pmid=17032991[/tpl]
The World Health Organization (WHO) lists no medical condition for which the risks of emergency contraceptive pills outweigh the benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that progestin-only ECPs may be preferable to combined ECPs containing estrogen in women with a history of blood clots, stroke, or migraine.
The AAP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, WHO, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and other experts on emergency contraception state that there are no medical conditions in which progestin-only ECPs are contraindicated. RCOG specifically note current venous thromboembolism, current or past history of breast cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute intermittent porphyria as conditions where the advantages of using emergency contraceptive pills generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.
The herbal preparation of St John's wort and some enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants or rifampicin) may reduce the effectiveness of ECP, and a larger dose may be required.[tpl]cite book|author=RCOG Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare, Clinical Effectiveness Unit|date=January 2012|title=Clinical guidance: emergency contraception|location=London|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|issn=1755-103X|url=http://www.fsrh.org/pdfs/CEUguidanceEmergencyContraception11.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl] p.3: How does EC work? In 2002, a judicial review ruled that pregnancy begins at implantation, not fertilisation.8 The possible mechanisms of action should be explained to the patient as some methods may not be acceptable, depending on individual beliefs about the onset of pregnancy and abortion. Copper-bearing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD). Copper is toxic to the ovum and sperm and thus the copper-bearing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is effective immediately after insertion and works primarily by inhibiting fertilisation.9–11 A systematic review on mechanisms of action of IUDs showed that both pre- and postfertilisation effects contribute to efficacy.11 If fertilisation has already occurred, it is accepted that there is an anti-implantation effect,12,13 Levonorgestrel (LNG). The precise mode of action of levonorgestrel (LNG) is incompletely understood but it is thought to work primarily by inhibition of ovulation.16,17 Ulipristal acetate (UPA). UPA’s primary mechanism of action is thought to be inhibition or delay of ovulation.2 [tpl]cite book|author=RCOG Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare, Clinical Effectiveness Unit|date=January 2012|title=Clinical guidance: drug interactions with hormonal contraception| location=London|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|issn=1755-103X|url=http://www.fsrh.org/pdfs/CEUguidancedruginteractionshormonal.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl]
The AAP, ACOG, FDA, WHO, RCOG, and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that ECPs, like all other contraceptives, reduce the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy by preventing pregnancies, and that the best available evidence, obtained from over 7,800 women in randomized controlled trials, indicates there is no increase in the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant after using progestin-only ECPs.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Trussell|first1=James|last2=Hedley|first2=Allison|last3=Raymond|first3=Elizabeth|date=October 2003|title=Ectopic pregnancy following use of progestin-only ECPs (letter)|journal=J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care|volume=29|issue=4|page=249|doi=10.1783/147118903101197944|pmid=14662065|url=http://jfprhc.bmj.com/content/29/4/249.2.full.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=UNDP/UNFPA/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP)|date=March 25, 2010|title=Fact sheet on the safety of levonorgestrel-alone emergency contraceptive pills (LNG ECPs)|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2010/WHO_RHR_HRP_10.06_eng.pdf[/tpl] Can LNG ECPs cause an abortion? LNG ECPs do not interrupt an established pregnancy or harm a developing embryo.15 The evidence available to date shows that LNG ECP use does not prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine lining. The primary mechanism of action is to stop or disrupt ovulation; LNG ECP use may also prevent the sperm and egg from meeting.16 [tpl]cite journal|last1=Cleland|first1=Kelly|last2=Raymond|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Trussell|first3=James|last4=Cheng|first4=Linan|last5=Zhu|first5=Haoping|date=June 2010|title=Ectopic pregnancy and emergency contraceptive pills: a systematic review|journal=Obstet Gynecol|volume=115|issue=6|pages=1263–1266|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181dd22ef|pmid=20502299[/tpl]

===Side effects===

The most common side effect reported by users of emergency contraceptive pills was nausea (50.5% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 23.1% of 977 levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 14.3% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial); vomiting is much less common and unusual with levonorgestrel-only ECPs (18.8% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 5.6% of levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 1.4% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial).

Other common side effects (each reported by less than 20% of levonorgestrel-only users in both the 1998 and 2002 WHO trials) were abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and breast tenderness. Side effects usually do not occur for more than a few days after treatment, and they generally resolve within 24 hours.
Temporary disruption of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced. If taken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel treatments may induce progestogen withdrawal bleeding a few days after the pills are taken. One study found that about half of women who used levonorgestrel ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the pills.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Goldberg|first2=Alisa|last3=Trussell|first3=James|last4=Hays|first4=Melissa|last5=Roach|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Taylor|first6=Douglas|date=April 2006|title=Bleeding patterns after use of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills|journal=Contraception|volume=73|issue=4|pages=376–381|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2005.10.006|pmid=16531171[/tpl] If levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation, it may increase the length of the luteal phase, thus delaying menstruation by a few days.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gainer|first1=Erin|last2=Kenfack|first2=Bruno|last3=Mboudou|first3=Emile|last4=Doh|first4=Anderson Sama|last5=Bouyer|first5=Jean|date=August 2006|title=Menstrual bleeding patterns following levonorgestrel emergency contraception|journal=Contraception|volume=74|issue=2|pages=118–124|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2006.02.009|pmid=16860049|pmc=1934349[/tpl] Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may delay ovulation by 3–4 days.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gemzell-Danielsson|first1=Kristina|last2=Marions|first2=Lena|date=July–August 2004|title=Mechanisms of action of mifepristone and levonorgestrel when used for emergency contraception|journal=Hum Reprod Update|volume=10|issue=4|pages=341–348|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh027|pmid=15192056[/tpl] (Delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation.) These disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ECPs were taken; subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected. If a woman's menstrual period is delayed by two weeks or more, it is advised that she take a pregnancy test. (Earlier testing may not give accurate results.)

An alternative to emergency contraceptive pills is the copper-T intrauterine device (IUD) which can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Insertion of an IUD is more effective than use of Emergency Contraceptive Pills - pregnancy rates when used as emergency contraception are the same as with normal IUD use.  IUDs may be left in place following the subsequent menstruation to provide ongoing contraception (3–10 years depending upon type).[tpl]cite journal |author=Gottardi G, Spreafico A, de Orchi L |title=The postcoital IUD as an effective continuing contraceptive method | journal = Contraception | volume = 34 | issue = 6 |pages=549–58 |year=1986 | pmid = 3549140 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(86)80011-7[/tpl]

ECPs are generally recommended for backup or "emergency" use, rather than as the primary means of contraception. They are intended for use when other means of contraception have failed—for example, if a woman has forgotten to take a birth control pill or when a condom is torn during sex.

==Relationship to high risk sex and abortion==

The current (December 2012) American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Policy Statement on Emergency Contraception says: "Despite multiple studies showing no increased risk behavior and evidence that hormonal emergency contraception will not disrupt an established pregnancy, public and medical discourse reflects that personal values of physicians and pharmacists continue to affect emergency-contraception access, particularly for adolescents."[tpl]cite journal|author=Committee on Adolescence|date=December 2012|title=Policy statement: Emergency contraception|journal=Pediatrics|volume=130|issue=6|pages=1174–1182|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2962|pmid=23184108|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/6/1174.full.pdf+html|accessdate=December 23, 2013[/tpl]

In September 2006, emergency contraception expert Anna Glasier wrote a BMJ editorial entitled "Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?" that said in closing: "So is emergency contraception worth the fuss? If you are a woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the CMAJ’s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it."

In randomized trials, 10 mg mifepristone was as effective as 25, 50, or 600 mg. preventing about 80-85% of expected pregnancies (the same efficacy and side effects as with the levonorgestrel method), with a slight decrease in efficacy when treatment was delayed to 5 days after intercourse.16,52–54 Ulipristal Acetate. Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) has similar biologic effects as mifepristone and is approved for emergency contraception in Europe and is expected to become available in the U.S.in a single oral dose of 30 mg. Randomized trials demonstrated that ulipristal acetate is slightly more effective than the single 1.5 mg dose of levonorgestrel when used within 72 h after sexual intercourse and even between 72 h and 120h.55,56 … Progesterone receptor modulators like ulipristal acetate and mifepristone suppress ovarian follicular growth and also delay endometrial maturation, manifested in a delay in menstruation after treatment. Ovulation can be temporarily postponed. Other methods Another method of emergency contraception is the insertion of a copper IUD, anytime during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle and up to 5 days after ovulation. The failure rate (in a small number of studies) is very low, 0.1%.34,35 This method definitely prevents implantation, but it is not suitable for women who are not candidates for intrauterine contraception, e.g., multiple sexual partners or a rape victim. The use of a copper IUD for emergency contraception is expensive, but not if it is retained as an ongoing method of contraception.

Levonorgestrel emergency contraception does not affect implantation and is not abortifacient.

Implications of the research: • Inhibition or delay of ovulation is LNG ECPs principal and possibly only mechanism of action. • Review of the evidence suggests that LNG ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling. • The fact that LNG ECPs have no demonstrated effect on implantation explains why they are not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy, and are less effective the later they are taken. Women should be given a clear message that LNG ECPs are more effective the sooner they are taken. • LNG ECPs do not interrupt a pregnancy (by any definition of the beginning of pregnancy). However, LNG ECPs can prevent abortions by reducing unwanted pregnancies.

The primary mechanism of action of progesterone receptor modulator emergency contraceptive pills like low-dose (10 mg) and mid-dose (25 mg) mifepristone and ulipristal acetate (micronized 30 mg) is to prevent fertilization by inhibition or delay of ovulation.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Linan|last2=Che|first2=Yan|last3=Gülmezoglu|first3=A.

The European EMA-approved labels for ulipristal acetate emergency contraceptive pills do not mention an effect on implantation, but the U.S. FDA-approved label says: "alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy."[tpl]cite web|author=HRA Pharma|date=March 15, 2012|chapter=|title=Summary of Product Characteristics: ellaOne 30 mg; 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties|location=London|publisher=European Medicines Agency|page=7|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/001027/WC500023670.pdf|quote=Ulipristal acetate is an orally-active synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator which acts via high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor.

The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy... The pharmacodynamics of ulipristal acetate depends on the timing of administration in the menstrual cycle. Administration in the mid-follicular phase causes inhibition of folliculogenesis and reduction of estradiol concentration. Administration at the time of the luteinizing hormone peak delays follicular rupture by 5 to 9 days. Dosing in the early luteal phase does not significantly delay endometrial maturation but decreases endometrial thickness by 0.6 ± 2.2 mm (mean ± SD).[/tpl]
The primary mechanism of action of copper-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) as emergency contraceptives is to prevent fertilization because of copper toxicity to sperm and ova. The very high effectiveness of copper-releasing IUDs as emergency contraceptives means they must also prevent some pregnancies by post-fertilization effects such as prevention of implantation.
