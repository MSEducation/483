==History==

In February 2002, Larry Sanger wrote an e-mail stating that Bomis was considering selling advertisements. Edgar Enyedy, a user on the Spanish Wikipedia, criticized the proposal. Jimmy Wales and Sanger responded by saying that they did not immediately plan to implement advertisements,Lih, p. 137. but Enyedy began establishing a fork. Enciclopedia Libre was established by February 26, 2002. Enyedy persuaded most of the Spanish Wikipedians into going to the fork. By the end of 2002 over 10,000 articles were posted on the new site, and the Spanish Wikipedia was inactive for the rest of the year. Andrew Lih wrote that "for a long time it seemed that Spanish Wikipeda[tpl]sic[/tpl] would be the unfortunate runt left from the Spanish fork."Lih, p. 138. The general popularity of Wikipedia attracted new users to the Spanish Wikipedia who were unfamiliar with the fork and these users came by June 2003. By the end of that year the Wikipedia had over 10,000 articles. The size of the Spanish Wikipedia overtook that of the fork in the northern hemisphere fall of 2004.
Lih stated in 2009 that the concepts of advertising and forking were still sensitive issues for the Wikipedia community because "It took more than a year for the Spanish Wikipedia to get back on its feet again" after the fork had been initiated.
After the spin-off, the Spanish Wikipedia had very little activity until the upgrade to the Phase III of the software, later renamed MediaWiki, when the number of new users started to increase again.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] Both projects continue to co-exist, but the Spanish Wikipedia is by far the more active of the two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://enciclopedia.us.es/index.php/Especial:Statistics |title=Enciclopedia Libre Universal: Special Stats |language=[tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Enciclopedia.us.es |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Especial:Statistics |title=Wikipedia: Special Stats |language=[tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Es.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl]

==Differences from other Wikipedias==

==Controversy==

A comparative study by the Fundación Colegio Libre de Eméritos Universitarios, made by Prof. Arias Maldonado (University of Malaga) and published in 2010, compared some articles with those of the English and German Wikipedias. It concluded that the Spanish version of Wikipedia was the least reliable of the three. It found it to be more cumbersome and imprecise than the German and English Wikipedias, stated that it often lacked reliable sources, including much unreferenced data, and found it to be too dependent on online references.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.colegiodeemeritos.es/docs/repositorio//es_ES//documentos/wikipedia_un_estudio_comparado_%28vf%29.pdf | author=Manuel Arias Maldonado | title=Wikipedia: un estudio comparado | page=49 | language=Spanish | accessdate=2010-06-16[/tpl]
During Wikimania 2009, free-software activist Richard Stallman criticized the Spanish Wikipedia for restricting links to the Rebelion.org left-wing web site and allegedly banning users who had complained about what had happened. Participants in the Spanish Wikipedia responded that Rebelion.org is primarily a news aggregator, that links to aggregators should be replaced with links to original publishers whenever possible, and that they considered the issue to be one of spam.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/a-war-of-words-over-wikipedias-spanish-version/|title=A War of Words Over Wikipedia’s Spanish Version|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-27 | first=Noam | last=Cohen | date=August 27, 2009[/tpl]
According to a 2013 Oxford University study, five of the ten most disputed pages on the Spanish Wikipedia were football (soccer) clubs, including Club América, FC Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, Alianza Lima, and Newell's Old Boys.Gross, Doug.
