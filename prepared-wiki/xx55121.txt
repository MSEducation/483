[tpl]Nihongo|Mobile Suit Gundam SEED|機動戦士ガンダムSEED (シード)|Kidō Senshi Gandamu Shīdo[/tpl] is an anime series developed by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuo Fukuda. As with other series from the Gundam franchise, Gundam SEED takes place in a parallel timeline, in this case the Cosmic Era, the first to do so. In this era, mankind has developed into two subspecies: Naturals, who reside on Earth and Coordinators, genetically-enhanced humans capable of withstanding the rigors of space who inhabit orbital colonies. The story revolves around a young Coordinator Kira Yamato who becomes involved in the war between the two races after a neutral space colony is invaded by the Coordinators.
The television series was broadcast in Japan between 2002 and 2003, on the Tokyo Broadcasting System and Mainichi Broadcasting System networks, beginning a broadcast partnership with the Gundam franchise that lasted until Mobile Suit Gundam AGE ended its run in 2013. The series spawned three compilations films and was adapted into a manga as well as various light novels. A sequel series, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny followed in 2004. Various types of merchandising have also been released, including models, CD soundtracks and video games. Gundam SEED was licensed by Bandai Entertainment for broadcast in North America, and began airing in the United States and Canada in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The films and the sequel were also licensed by Bandai. The manga and light novels as well as the spin off series, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray, were also licensed. A number of video games were also released in North America.
Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was widely popular with the public in Japan, winning numerous awards, with high sales of both the series DVD and music. The character development and animation has gained praise, but similarities with previous Gundam series have drawn both comparisons and criticism from Gundam fans.

==Plot==

The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the "Cosmic Era" in which mankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as "Naturals", and the genetically altered humans known as "Coordinators", who live in space colonies.
The story begins in the neutral space colony Heliopolis, where secret development of advanced mobile suits for the Naturals' war effort is being conducted. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the Coordinators, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion a teenager Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board an Archangel class assault ship belonging to the Earth Alliance, the Natural's military, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska.[tpl]cite book |last=Fujie |first=Kazuhisa |coauthors=Martin Foster |title=The Gundam Explorer: Wing, First, G, Seed and More!|publisher=DH Publishing |year=2004 |page=139|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=FW22Qpvilz0C&pg=PA119&dq=gundam+seed&hl=es&ei=gSPlTczTIYfY0QHs1ZyQBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-9723124-8-6 [/tpl] During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he is nearly killed.[tpl]cite web |title=Anime Review: Gundam Seed Vol. 5–6|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Gundam_Seed_Vol._5_&_6.html|date=September 25, 2005 |author=Liversidge, Ross|publisher=UK Anime Network|accessdate=April 14, 2011[/tpl] Kira survives the attack and is treated in one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies.
Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the Coordinator Lacus Clyne daughter of Siegel Clyne, President of the Supreme Council of PLANT. Using Freedom, Kira ends the battle between the two armies, but the base is subsequently destroyed. The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. They subsequently join Lacus Clyne's faction to form the Three Ships Alliance, with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover Freedom.[tpl]cite web |title=Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Vol. #08|url=http://www.mania.com/mobile-suit-gundam-seed-vol-08_article_77970.html|date=March 22, 2006 |author=Wolstenholm, Kim|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=May 1, 2011[/tpl] However, after learning of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's father and the radical faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance.

The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the Earth Alliance's forces and destroy the GENESIS ending the battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/background/timeline.html |title=Cosmic Era timeline (C.E. 55) |accessdate=April 14, 2007|publisher=GundamOfficial|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120309021828/http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/background/timeline.html|archivedate=March 9, 2012 [/tpl]

==Development==

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was directed by Mitsuo Fukuda (Future GPX Cyber Formula and Gear Fighter Dendoh) with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. The series was first announced in June 2002, while a trailer was available in September on the series' official website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-07-13/gundam-seed-on-tv-in-october |title=Gundam Seed on TV in October|date=July 13, 2002 |publisher= Anime News Network |accessdate=June 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-09-03/gundam-seed-trailer|title=Gundam Seed Trailer|date=September 3, 2002 |publisher= Anime News Network |accessdate=June 1, 2011[/tpl] A total of eight writers were in charge of the series. The characters were designed by Hisashi Hirai, while the mechanical designs were made by Kunio Okawara and Kimitoshi Yamane.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/seed/credits/index.html |title=Credits |accessdate=August 11, 2009|work=GundamOfficial |publisher=Bandai America Incorporated|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110525105014/http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/seed/credits/index.html|archivedate=May 25, 2011[/tpl] Mobile Suit Gundam planning manager Koichi Inoue stated that the staff making Gundam SEED was a new and young team that would continue working with following Gundam series. Inoue, however, would work with anime based on the original Gundam series.[tpl]cite journal|author=GameAxis Unwired staff|date=September 2004|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=G-kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT42&dq=Gundam+SEED&hl=es&ei=i9XkTdrIGMj50gHSoPCyBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-preview-link&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQuwUwAw#v=onepage&q=Gundam%20SEED&f=false|title=Comics Fever Strikes Hong Kong!|work=GameAxis Unwired|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|issn=0219-872X|location=7|year=2004|accessdate=May 30, 2011[/tpl] Fukuda stated that Gundam SEED was initially told from Kira's point of view, but deeper into the series the point of view would shift to other characters. His main focus with the series was to entertain the audience, pointing out that the drama would develop through the series in a similar vein to previous Gundam series. The first part worked on was the plot followed by action sequences, stating that the human characters were more important than the combat sequences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gundam-seed.net/special/interview/inter_01.html|title=福田監督インタビュー|accessdate=May 1, 2011|publisher=Sunrise|language=Japanese|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703091348/http://www.gundam-seed.net/special/interview/inter_01.html|archivedate=April 9, 2008[/tpl] In retrospect, Fukuda said that Kira's wish to fight was forced upon him stemming from his desire to protect his friends. Moreover, he considered these actions as being based on Japanese thoughts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gundam-seed-d.net/special/inter_01.html|title=福田己津央 監督インタビュー 04.0925|accessdate=May 4, 2011|publisher=Sunrise|language=Japanese|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080111183039/http://www.gundam-seed-d.net/special/inter_01.html|archivedate=January 11, 2008[/tpl]

DVD Verdict writer Mitchell Hattaway further noted that while it used elements from other anime series, it still "drew him in so quickly he soon found himself wrapped up in the proceedings".[tpl]cite web |title=Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Grim Reality (Volume 1)|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/msgsvol1.php|date=September 9, 2004 |author=Hattaway, Mitchell|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=May 30, 2011[/tpl] Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network stated that Gundam SEED adapted the original Mobile Suit Gundam series from 1979 for a modern audience in the same way Mobile Suit Gundam 00 would  adapt Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2007-10-21|title=The Fall 2007 Anime Season Guide|publisher=Anime News Network|date=October 21, 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2007[/tpl] Bamboo Dong from the same site stated that while this caused the appearance of "hardcore anti-Gundam Seed zealots" who criticized the series for these traits, it was nevertheless entertaining to watch and give anime fans a step into the "Gundam fandom".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2004-10-24|title=Shelf Life I Heart You Too|publisher=Anime News Network|date=October 24, 2004|accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl]

===Controversy===

The sixteenth episode of Gundam SEED features a scene in which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6 pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-03-13/mainichi-condemned-for-implied-sexuality-in-gundam-seed |title=Mainichi condemned for implied sexuality in Gundam Seed |publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl] The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2009/10/28/ask-john-how-common-is-sex-in-anime/ |title=Ask John: How Common is Sex in Anime?|date=October 28, 2009 |publisher=Anime Nation |accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl]
