Substituting the Draper point into this equation produces a frequency of 46.9 terahertz—which is infrared, and largely invisible except for a dull red, at a small fraction of the peak intensity, that is visible to the human eye.[tpl]cite book | title = Biology: Concepts and Applications | author = Cecie Starr | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-534-46226-X | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&pg=PA94[/tpl]
