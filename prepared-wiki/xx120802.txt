Immortality, Inc. is a 1959 science fiction novella by American writer Robert Sheckley, about a fictional process whereby a human's consciousness may be transferred into a brain-dead body. A striking foreshadowing in the novel is its description of random killings of strangers by people who intend to die. The serialised form (published under the title Time Killer in the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction) was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel.http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1959-hugo-awards/
The story was loosely adapted into the 1992 film Freejack. A famous scene from the novel involving a character lost in a future New York City and mistakenly getting in line for a suicide booth was dramatized in the pilot episode of Futurama.
