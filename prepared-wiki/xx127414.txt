Happy Days, 1880–1892 (1940) is the first of an autobiographical trilogy by H.L. Mencken, covering his days as a child in Baltimore, Maryland.  
The book was received with some surprise by Mencken's readers, since, unlike his commentaries on current events, it is written with great warmth and affection.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]  Mencken's childhood was apparently happy and secure, and he enjoyed both living through it and reminiscing about it in later years.
