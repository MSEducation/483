[[Haddocks' Eyes]]

CATEGORIES: British poems, 1871 poems, Alice in Wonderland

Haddocks' Eyes is a term for the name of a poem by Lewis Carroll from Through the Looking-Glass. It is sung by The White Knight in chapter eight to a tune that he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as "I give thee all, I can no more".
By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.
It is a parody of "Resolution and Independence" by William Wordsworth.[tpl]cite book |first=Lewis |last=Carroll |editor-first=Martin |editor-last=Gardner |title=The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-04847-6[/tpl]

==Naming==

The White Knight explains a confusing nomenclature for the song.
The complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' entails the use–mention distinction.[tpl]cite web |first=Norman |last=Swartz |title=Use and Mention |url=http://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/use_and_mention.htm |publisher=Simon Fraser University |date=27 September 1997 |accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl]

==Upon the Lonely Moor==

Like "Jabberwocky," another poem published in Through the Looking Glass, "Haddocks’ Eyes" appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name Upon the Lonely Moor. It bears an obvious resemblance to "Haddocks' Eyes."
