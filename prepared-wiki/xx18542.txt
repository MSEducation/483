CATEGORIES: Algebraic structures, Mathematical structures, Ring theory

In mathematics, and more specifically in algebra, a ring is an algebraic structure with operations generalizing the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.  By means of this generalization, theorems from arithmetic are extended to non-numerical objects like polynomials, series, matrices and functions.
Rings were first formalized as a common generalization of Dedekind domains that occur in number theory, and of polynomial rings and rings of invariants that occur in algebraic geometry and invariant theory. They are also used in other branches of mathematics such as geometry and mathematical analysis. The formal definition of rings is relatively recent, dating from the 1920s.
Briefly, a ring is an abelian group with a second binary operation that is distributive over the abelian group operation and is associative. The abelian group operation is called "addition" and the second binary operation is called "multiplication" in analogy with the integers. One familiar example of a ring is the set of integers.  The integers are a commutative ring, since a times b is equal to b times a.  The set of polynomials also forms a commutative ring. An example of a non-commutative ring is the ring of square matrices of the same size.  Finally, a field is a commutative ring in which one can divide by any nonzero element: an example is the field of real numbers.
Whether a ring is commutative or not has profound implication in the study of rings as abstract objects, the field called the ring theory. The development of the commutative theory, commonly known as commutative algebra, has been greatly influenced by problems and ideas occurring naturally in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry: important commutative rings include fields, polynomial rings, the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic variety, and the ring of integers of a number field. On the other hand, the noncommutative theory takes examples from representation theory (group rings), functional analysis (operator algebras) and the theory of differential operators (rings of differential operators), and the topology (cohomology ring of a topological space.)

==Definition and illustration==

The most familiar example of a ring is the set of all integers, Z, consisting of the numbers
The familiar properties for addition and multiplication of integers serve as a model for the axioms for rings.

===Definition===

A ring is a set R equipped with binary operationsImplicit in the assumption that + is a binary operation is that R is closed under +, meaning that for any a and b in R, the value of a + b is defined to be an element of R.  The same applies to multiplication.  Closure would be an axiom, however, only if, instead of binary operations on R, we had functions + and · a priori taking values in some larger set S. + and · satisfying the following eight axioms, called the ring axioms:

===Notes on the definition===

Warning: As explained in the history section below, many authors follow an alternative convention in which a ring is not required to have a 1. This article adopts the convention that, unless otherwise stated, a ring is assumed to have a 1.  A structure satisfying all the axioms except the sixth (existence of a multiplicative identity 1) is called a rng (or sometimes pseudo-ring).  For example, the set of even integers with the usual + and · is a rng, but not a ring.
The operations + and ⋅ are called addition and multiplication, respectively. The multiplication symbol ⋅ is often omitted, so the mere juxtaposition of ring elements is interpreted as multiplication.  For example, xy means x⋅y.
Although ring addition is commutative, ring multiplication is not required to be commutative: ab need not necessarily equal ba. Rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication (such as the ring of integers) are called commutative rings.  Books on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry often adopt the convention that "ring" means "commutative ring", to simplify terminology.

===Basic properties===

Some basic properties of a ring follow immediately from the axioms:

===Example: Integers modulo 4===

===Example: 2-by-2 matrices===

The set of 2-by-2 matrices with real number entries is written
More generally, for any ring R, commutative or not, and any nonnegative integer n, one may form the ring of n-by-n matrices with entries in R: see matrix ring.

==History==

===Dedekind===

The study of rings originated from the theory of polynomial rings and the theory of algebraic integers.The development of Ring Theory  In 1871 Richard Dedekind defined the concept of the ring of integers of a number field.Kleiner 1998, p. 27.  In this context, he introduced the terms "ideal" (inspired by Ernst Kummer's notion of ideal number) and "module" and studied their properties.  But Dedekind did not use the term "ring" and did not define the concept of a ring in a general setting.

===Hilbert===

The term "Zahlring" (number ring) was coined by David Hilbert in 1892 and published in 1897.Hilbert 1897. In 19th century German, the word "Ring" could mean "association", which is still used today in English in a limited sense (e.g., spy ring),http://mathoverflow.net/questions/117292/why-is-a-ring-called-a-ring so if that were the etymology then it would be similar to the way "group" entered mathematics by being a non-technical word for "collection of related things".  According to Harvey Cohn, Hilbert used the term for a ring that had the property of "circling directly back" to an element of itself.[tpl]Citation|last=Cohn|first=Harvey|title=Advanced Number Theory|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=1980|page=49|isbn=978-0-486-64023-5[/tpl] Specifically, in a ring of algebraic integers, all high powers of an algebraic integer can be written as an integral combination of a fixed set of lower powers, and thus the powers "cycle back".  For instance, if a3 − 4a + 1 = 0 then a3 = 4a − 1, a4 = 4a2 − a, a5 = −a2 + 16a − 4, a6 = 16a2 − 8a + 1, a7 = −8a2 + 65a − 16, and so on; in general, an is going to be an integral linear combination of 1, a, and a2.

===Fraenkel and Noether===

The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by Adolf Fraenkel in 1914,Fraenkel, pp. 143–145Jacobson (2009), p. 86, footnote 1. but his axioms were stricter than those in the modern definition. For instance, he required every non-zero-divisor to have a multiplicative inverse.Fraenkel, p. 144, axiom R8).   In 1921, Emmy Noether gave the modern axiomatic definition of (commutative) ring and developed the foundations of commutative ring theory in her monumental paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen.Noether, p. 29.

===Multiplicative identity: mandatory or optional?===

Fraenkel required a ring to have a multiplicative identity 1,Fraenkel, p. 144, axiom R7). whereas Noether did not.
Most or all books on algebraVan der Waerden, 1930.Zariski and Samuel, 1958. up to around 1960 followed Noether's convention of not requiring a 1. Starting in the 1960s, it became increasingly common to see books including the existence of 1 in the definition of ring, especially in advanced books by notable authors such as Artin,Artin, p. 346. Atiyah and MacDonald,Atiyah and MacDonald, p. 1. Bourbaki,Bourbaki, p. 96. Eisenbud,Eisenbud, p. 11. and Lang.Lang, p. 83. But even today, there remain many books that do not require a 1.
Faced with this terminological ambiguity, some authors have tried to impose their views, while others have tried to adopt more precise terms.
In the first category, we find for instance Gardner and Wiegandt, who argue that if one requires all rings to have a 1, then some consequences include the lack of existence of infinite direct sums of rings, and the fact that proper direct summands of rings are not subrings. They conclude that "in many, maybe most, branches of ring theory the requirement of the existence of a unity element is not sensible, and therefore unacceptable."Gardner and Wiegandt 2003.
In the second category, we find authors who use the following terms:Wilder 1965, p. 176.Rotman 1998, p. 7.

==Basic concepts==

===Elements in a ring===

===Subring===

For example, the ring Z of integers is a subring of the field of real numbers and also a subring of the ring of polynomials ZX (in both cases, Z contains 1, which is the multiplicative identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even integers 2Z does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does not qualify as a subring.
The intersection of subrings is a subring. The smallest subring containing a given subset E of R is called a subring generated by E. Such a subring exists since it is the intersection of all subrings containing E.

===Ideal===

The definition of an ideal in a ring is analogous to that of normal subgroup in a group. But, in actuality, it plays a role of an idealized generalization of an element in a ring; hence, the name "ideal". Like elements of rings, the study of ideals is central to structural understanding of a ring.
Given right (or left, or two-sided) ideals A and B of R, it is possible to show that the set intersection of A with B is an ideal of the same type as A and B. It is also possible to define a product of ideals such that AB is another ideal of the same sidedness as A and B. The sum of ideals A+B is also an ideal of the same type as A and B.
Like a group, a ring is said to be a simple if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring is precisely a field.
Rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals. For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left Noetherian ring. A ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left Artinian ring. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem). The integers, however, form a Noetherian ring which is not Artinian.

===Homomorphism===

A homomorphism from a ring (R, +, ·) to a ring (S,  ‡, *) is a function f from R to S that preserves the ring operations; namely, such that, for all a, b in R the following identities hold:
If one is working with not necessarily unital rings, then the third condition is dropped.
Examples:

===Quotient ring===

The quotient ring of a ring, is analogous to the notion of a quotient group of a group. More formally, given a ring (R, +, · ) and a two-sided ideal I of (R, +, · ), the quotient ring (or factor ring) R/I is the set of cosets of I (with respect to the additive group of (R, +, · ); i.e. cosets with respect to (R, +)) together with the operations:
for every a, b in R.

==Constructions==

===Direct product===

Let R and S be rings. Then the product [tpl]nowrap|R × S[/tpl] can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:
as a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to R. Equivalently, the above can be done through central idempotents. Assume R has the above decomposition. Then we can write
The notion of a subdirect product of rings generalizes a direct product of rings.

===Polynomial ring===

Given a symbol t (called a variable) and a commutative ring R, the set of polynomials
Finally, there is a closely related notion: ring of polynomial functions on a vector space V. If V is a vector space over an infinite field, then, by choosing a basis, it may be identified with a polynomial ring.

===Matrix ring and endomorphism ring===

which is clearly an isomorphism.
Any ring homomorhism R → S induces [tpl]nowrap|Mn(R) → Mn(S)[/tpl]; in fact, any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises in this way.
The Artin–Wedderburn theorem states any semisimple ring (cf. below) is of this form.
A ring R and the matrix ring Mn(R) over it are Morita equivalent: the category of right modules of R is equivalent to the category of right modules over Mn(R). In particular, two-sided ideals in R correspond in one-to-one to two-sided ideals in Mn(R).
Examples:

===Localization===

The most important properties of localization are the following: when R is a commutative ring and S a multiplicatively closed subset

===Completion===

Let R be a commutative ring, and let I be an ideal of R.
See also: Hensel's lemma.
A complete ring has much simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the Cohen structure theorem, which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends to look like a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the integral closure and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of excellent ring.

===Group ring===

Finally, essentially the same construction is possible for a unital semigroup instead of a group except the multiplication is given by:[tpl]harvnb|Lang|2002|loc=Ch II, §3[/tpl]

===Tensor product===

For algebras A, A'  over k and their subalgebras B, B', resp.,

===Rings with generators and relations===

==Special kinds of rings==

===Domains===

Any nonzero subring of a field is necessarily an integral domain. The converse is also true: an integral domain is always a subring of its field of fractions. This only partially generalizes to a noncommutative setting.
In algebraic geometry, UFD's arise because of smoothness. More precisely, a point in a variety (over a perfect field) is smooth if the local ring at the point is a regular local ring. A regular local ring is a UFD.[tpl]harvnb|Weibel|loc=Ch 1, Theorem 3.8[/tpl]
The following is a chain of class inclusions that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:

===Division ring===

A division ring is a ring such that every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division ring is a field. A prominent example of a division ring that is not a field is the ring of quaternions. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring is a field. It turned out that every finite domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).
The study of conjugacy classes figures prominently in the classical theory of division rings. Cartan famously asked the following question: given a division ring D and a proper sub-division-ring S that is not contained in the center, does each inner automorphism of D restrict to an automorphism of S? The answer is negative: this is the Cartan–Brauer–Hua theorem.

===Semisimple rings===

A ring is called a semisimple ring if it is semisimple as a left module (or right module) over itself. A ring is called a semiprimitive ring if its Jacobson radical is zero. (The Jacobson radical is the intersection of all maximal left ideals.) A ring is semisimple if and only if it is artinian and is semiprimitive.
An algebra over a field k is artinian if and only if it has finite dimension. Thus, a semisimple algebra over a field is necessarily finite-dimensional, while a simple algebra may have infinite-dimension; e.g., the ring of differential operators.
Any module over a semisimple ring is semisimple. (Proof: any free module over a semisimple ring is clearly semisimple and any module is a quotient of a free module.)
Examples of semisimple rings:

===Central simple algebra and Brauer group===

The Skolem–Noether theorem states any automorphism of a central simple algebra is inner.
Azumaya algebras generalize the notion of central simple algebras to a commutative local ring.

==Rings with extra structure==

A ring may be viewed as an abelian group (by using the addition operation), with extra structure. In the same way, there are other mathematical objects which may be considered as rings with extra structure. For example:

==Some examples of the ubiquity of rings==

Many different kinds of mathematical objects can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of some associated ring.

===Cohomology ring of a topological space===

To any topological space X one can associate its integral cohomology ring
The ring structure in cohomology provides the foundation for characteristic classes of fiber bundles, intersection theory on manifolds and algebraic varieties, Schubert calculus and much more.

===Burnside ring of a group===

To any group is associated its Burnside ring which uses a ring to describe the various ways the group can act on a finite set.  The Burnside ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the disjoint union of the action.  Expressing an action in terms of the basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents.  The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of the representation ring: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as a permutation module.  The ring structure allows a formal way of subtracting one action from another.  Since the Burnside ring is contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients from integers to the rational numbers.

===Representation ring of a group ring===

To any group ring or Hopf algebra is associated its representation ring or "Green ring".  The representation ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the direct sum.  Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an indecomposable decomposition of the module.  The multiplication is the tensor product.  When the algebra is semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring from character theory, which is more or less the Grothendieck group given a ring structure.

===Function field of an irreducible algebraic variety===

To any irreducible algebraic variety is associated its function field.  The points of an algebraic variety correspond to valuation rings contained in the function field and containing the coordinate ring.  The study of algebraic geometry makes heavy use of commutative algebra to study geometric concepts in terms of ring-theoretic properties.  Birational geometry studies maps between the subrings of the function field.

===Face ring of a simplicial complex===

Every simplicial complex has an associated face ring, also called its Stanley–Reisner ring.  This ring reflects many of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of particular interest in algebraic combinatorics.  In particular, the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of simplicial polytopes.

==Category theoretical description==

Let (A, +) be an abelian group and let End(A) be its endomorphism ring (see above). Note that, essentially, End(A) is the set of all morphisms of A, where if f is in End(A), and g is in End(A), the following rules may be used to compute f + g and f · g:
where + as in f(x) + g(x) is addition in A, and function composition is denoted from right to left. Therefore, associated to any abelian group, is a ring. Conversely, given any ring, (R, +, · ), (R, +) is an abelian group. Furthermore, for every r in R, right (or left) multiplication by r gives rise to a morphism of (R, +), by right (or left) distributivity. Let A = (R, +). Consider those endomorphisms of A, that "factor through" right (or left) multiplication of R. In other words, let EndR(A) be the set of all morphisms m of A, having the property that m(r · x) = r · m(x). It was seen that every r in R gives rise to a morphism of A: right multiplication by r. It is in fact true that this association of any element of R, to a morphism of A, as a function from R to EndR(A), is an isomorphism of rings. In this sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring of some abelian X-group (by X-group, it is meant a group with X being its set of operators).Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2. In essence, the most general form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian X-group.
Any ring can be seen as a preadditive category with a single object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be translated to this more general context. Additive functors between preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism, and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets of morphisms closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary morphisms.

==Generalization==

Algebraists have defined structures more general than rings by weakening or dropping some of ring axioms.

===Rng===

A rng is the same as a ring, except that the existence of a multiplicative identity is not assumed.Jacobson 2009.

===Nonassociative ring===

A nonassociative ring is an algebraic structure that satisfies all of the ring axioms but the associativity and the existence of a multiplicative identity. A notable example is a Lie algebra. There exists some structure theory for such algebras that generalizes the analogous results for Lie algebras and associative algebras.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Semiring===

A semiring is obtained by weakening the assumption that (R,+) is an abelian group to the assumption that (R,+) is a commutative monoid, and adding the axiom that 0 · a = a · 0 = 0 for all a in R (since it no longer follows from the other axioms).

==Other ring-like objects==

===Ring object in a category===

===Ring scheme===

In algebraic geometry, a ring scheme over a base scheme S is a ring object in the category of S-schemes.  One example is the ring scheme Wn over Spec Z, which for any commutative ring A returns the ring Wn(A) of p-isotypic Witt vectors of length n over A.Serre, p. 44.
