[[Listerine]]

Listerine is a brand of antiseptic mouthwash product. It is promoted with the slogan "Kills germs that cause bad breath", and was named after Joseph Lister who advocated the idea of sterile surgery by sterilizing instruments.
Originally marketed by the Lambert Pharmacal Company (which later became Warner-Lambert), it has been manufactured and distributed by Johnson & Johnson since that company's acquisition of Pfizer's consumer healthcare division in late December 2006.
The Listerine brand name is also used in toothpaste, Listerine Whitening rinse, Listerine Fluoride rinse (Listerine Tooth Defense), Listerine SmartRinse (children's fluoride rinse), PocketPaks, and PocketMist. In September 2007, Listerine began selling its own brand of self-dissolving teeth whitening strips.

==History==

Formulated by Dr. Joseph Lawrence and Jordan Wheat Lambert in St. Louis, Missouri,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sheilabarrett.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/listerine/|title=Sheila Barrett's blog|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] in 1879 as surgical antiseptic, it was given to dentists for oral care in 1895 and it was the first over-the-counter mouthwash sold in the United States, in 1915.
In 1885, Lawrence sold his share to the Lambert Pharmacal Company.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.rdhinstl.com/mm/rs335xxx.htm|title= Lambert Pharmacal Company[/tpl]
According to Freakonomics:[ref]
<br/>Note that previous editions of ''Freakonomics'' incorrectly described halitosis as a "faux medical term", which this Wikipedia article previously reflected.</ref>
In this way, Listerine became a clear and early example of a larger trend: marketing campaigns inventing problems that the product is alleged to solve.
In 1955, Lambert Pharmacal merged with New York-based Warner-Hudnut and became Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company and incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in Morris, New Jersey.Warner-Hudnut, Inc.

From 1921 until the mid-1970s, Listerine was also marketed as preventive and remedy for colds and sore throats. In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that Listerine had "no efficacy" at either preventing or alleviating the symptoms of sore throats and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and to include in the next $10.2 million worth of Listerine ads specific mention that "contrary to prior advertising, Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity."[tpl]cite web |work = Time | date = 1976-01-05 | url = http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947635,00.html | title = Three by the FTC | accessdate = 2006-12-05 [/tpl] The preamble "contrary to prior advertising" was not included in the court order. Business Its Legal, Ethical, and Global Environment by Marianne M. Jennings 8th edition page 324, Given these safeguards, we believe the preamble "Contrary to prior advertising" is not necessary.
For a short time, beginning in 1927, the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company marketed Listerine Cigarettes.[ref]

From the 1930s into the 1950s, advertisements claimed that applying Listerine to the scalp could prevent "infectious dandruff".[ref]

Listerine was packaged in a glass bottle inside a corrugated cardboard tube for nearly 80 years before the first revamps were made to the brand; in 1992, Cool Mint Listerine was introduced in addition to the original Listerine Antiseptic formula and, in 1994, both brands were introduced in plastic bottles for the first time. In 1995, FreshBurst was added,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-192416_ITM |title=Article: Warner-Lambert reenters the dentrifice business. | AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1995-07-31 |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] then in 2003 Natural Citrus. In 2006 a new addition to the "less intense" variety, Vanilla Mint, was released. Eight different kinds of Listerine are on the market in the U.S. and elsewhere: Original, Cool Mint, FreshBurst, Natural Citrus, Vanilla Mint, UltraClean (formerly Advanced Listerine), Tooth Defense (mint shield), and Whitening pre-brush rinse (clean mint). The most recent addition is Listerine Naturals, a natural formula antiseptic mouthwash.

==Composition==

The active ingredients listed on Listerine bottles are essential oils which are menthol 0.042%, thymol 0.064%, methyl salicylate 0.06%, and eucalyptol 0.092%. In combination all have an antiseptic effect and there is some thought that methyl salicylate may have an anti inflammatory effect as well[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]. Ethanol, which is toxic to bacteria at concentrations of 40%, is present in concentrations of 21.6% in the flavored product and 26.9% in the original gold Listerine Antiseptic[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]. At this concentration, the ethanol serves to dissolve the active ingredients.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

==Effectiveness==

In a January 6, 2005, decision, Judge Denny Chin of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that an advertising campaign by Pfizer, claiming that the mouthwash Listerine is as effective as flossing in fighting tooth and gum decay, is false and misleading and poses a public health risk.
In 2010 a study was published that noted that performing a brief 30 second rinse with Listerine (Vanilla Mint Flavor) prior to applying topical lidocaine to patients mouths masks the unpleasant flavor of topical lidocaine. It is suspected this may help improve the comfort of a variety of oral procedures performed by dentists and oral surgeons.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=20122351 | volume=39 | issue=1 | title=Reducing the flavour of oral lidocaine: randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of mint-flavoured mouthwash |date=February 2010 | journal=J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | pages=96–101 | author=Bonaparte JP, Corsten M, Rourke R[/tpl]

==Safety==

There has been concern that the use of alcohol-containing mouthwash such as Listerine may increase the risk of developing oral cancer.

However, a review of a study carried out in Cuba, Argentina, and Brazil published December 2008 in the Australian Dental Journal concluded that:[tpl]quote|There is now sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that developing oral cancer is increased or contributed to by the use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Whilst many of these products may have been shown to be effective in penetrating oral microbial biofilms in vitro and reducing oral bacterial load, it would be wise to restrict their use to short-term therapeutic situations if needed. Perhaps the use of mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol may be equally effective. Further, mouthrinses should be prescribed by dentists, like any other medication. There may well be a reason for the use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, but only for a particular situation and for a limited and controlled period of time. As such, patients should be provided with written instructions for mouthwash use, and mouthwash use should be restricted to adults for short durations and specific, clearly defined reasons. It is the opinion of the authors that, in light of the evidence available of the association of alcohol-containing mouthwashes with the development of oral cancer, it would be inadvisable for oral healthcare professionals to recommend the long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes.[/tpl]
In January 2009, Andrew Penman, chief executive of The Cancer Council New South Wales, called for further research on the matter.[tpl]cite news |first=Clair |last=Weaver |coauthors= |title=Mouthwash linked to cancer |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24896583-5001021,00.html |work= |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2009 [/tpl]
