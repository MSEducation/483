"Petit bonhomme" (English translation: "Little Boy") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, performed in French by Luxembourgish singer Camillo Felgen. 
This was Felgen's second appearance on the Eurovision stage, in the 1960 Contest he had also represented Luxembourg, singing "So laang we's du do bast" in Luxembourgish. 
"Petit bonhomme" is a ballad, with Felgen singing to a boy he identifies as his son near the end of the lyric. He tells him that there are many more experiences for his generation than the older one and that this is a good thing. Felgen also recorded his entry in a German language version, as "Du kleiner Mann" ("You, Little Man").
The song was performed fourteenth on the night (following the United Kingdom's Ronnie Carroll with "Ring-A-Ding Girl" and preceding Italy's Claudio Villa with "Addio, addio"). At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 3rd in a field of 16.
It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1963 Contest by Nana Mouskouri with "Ã€ force de prier".
