CATEGORIES: Comets, Non-periodic comets

 
C/1980 E1 is a non-periodic comet discovered by Edward L. G. Bowell on February 11, 1980.  C/1980 E1 is leaving the Solar System on a hyperbolic trajectory with a higher velocity than any other natural object ever observed.
Before entering the inner Solar System for a 1982 perihelion passage, C/1980 E1 had a barycentric (epoch 1950-Jan-01) orbit with an apoapsis distance of 74,600 AU (1.17 light-years), and a period of approximately 7.1 million years.
As the comet was approaching perihelion on December 9, 1980, it passed within 0.228 AU of Jupiter,[ref]
</ref> which accelerated the comet briefly giving an (epoch 1981-Jan-09) eccentricity of 1.066.<ref name=barycenter/>  The comet came to perihelion on March 12, 1982.<ref name=jpldata/> Since the epoch of 1977-Mar-02, C/1980 E1 has had a barycentric eccentricity greater than 1,<ref name=barycenter/> keeping it on a hyperbolic trajectory that will eject it from the Solar System.
Since February 2008, the comet has been more than 50 AU from the Sun.[ref]

The production of OH was observed pre-perihelion while the comet was nearly 5AU from the Sun. CN was not detected until the comet was near perihelion. The comet nucleus was estimated to be have a radius of several kilometers. The surface crust was probably a few meters thick.
