In January 2001, IMADEC became the second private school in Austria to achieve legal recognition by the state as a private university,[tpl]Cite news | last=Horvath | first=Christian | title="Rüstzeug für Manager" (Munition for Managers) | language = German | publisher=medianet | date=2006-03-17 | url=http://www.imadec.ac.at/press/231/231.pdf [/tpl] a status it held until January 2006. It soon had a number of prominent Austrians on its staff and among its sponsors, such as Otto von Habsburg, Peter Zöllner (executive director of Austria's central bank) and Gerhard Swarovski.[tpl]Failed verification|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Void honorary degrees===

On 28 April 2006, the Austrian Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) ruled that an honorary DBA degree bestowed upon Alexandre Lamfalussy by IMADEC in 2003 was void, as private universities are not authorised to grant any honorary degrees.[ref]
