==Gameplay==

The basic idea of the game is to sink ships. The game features a rotating cannon situated underneath the playfield used to aim the ball at targets to award letters in the word "SINK SHIP". During multiball you also get letters for shooting flashing ramps. Once SINK SHIP is spelled, you load the cannon to light the center shot (the "Broadside") to get big points.

==Digital versions==

Black Rose is a playable table in Williams Pinball Classics (2001) by Encore, Inc. for PC.http://www.gamegenie.com/reviews/pc/wpinball.html and  is available as licensed table of  The Pinball Arcade on several platforms.
