The Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science ("TAMS") is a two-year residential early entrance college program serving approximately 375 students at the University of North Texas.https://tams.unt.edu/admissions/enrollment Students are admitted from every region of the state.https://tams.unt.edu/admissions/enrollment TAMS is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.
TAMS was established in 1987 by the Texas legislature, in order to provide high school students seeking careers in math, science, and engineering an opportunity to take advanced coursework.Texas Education Code, Title 3, Subtitle F, 105.301 (http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/ED/htm/ED.105.htm)http://tams.unt.edu/admissions/eligibility  TAMS operates wholly within the University of North Texas.http://tams.unt.edu/ Students take UNT classes for their two years at TAMS, and graduate with a TAMS high school diploma, as well as a UNT college transcript with a minimum of 57 hours of transferable college credits.http://tams.unt.edu/admissions/eligibility

TAMS has a number of student activities and events, ranging from academic clubs like Math Club and Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) to performance groups like Academy Players (theater) and Dull Roar (music), to cultural groups such as FACES (Fellowship for the Advancement of Cultural Education for Students).https://tams.unt.edu/studentlife/clubinfo A complete list of clubs is available here.

===McConnell Hall===

All TAMS students live in McConnell Hall. The hall consists of three floors, segregated by gender. The hall is furnished with a kitchenette, multiple meeting rooms, and two common rooms. One of the common rooms, the Smitty Study, serves as a public recreation room when it is not functioning as a study area during quiet hours. The other common room, Mac Caf√©, aptly named because it once was home to a university cafeteria, hosts various student activities and serves as a gathering place for both academic and social interaction.
