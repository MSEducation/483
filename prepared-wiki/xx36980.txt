==Early life==

Jewison was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Dorothy Irene (née Weaver) and Percy Joseph Jewison, who managed a convenience store and post office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/44/Norman-Jewison.html |title=Norman Jewison Film Reference biography |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl] He attended Kew Beach School and Malvern Collegiate Institute, and while growing up in the 1930s displayed an aptitude for performing and theatre. Jewison was often mistaken for Jewish due to his surname, though he and his family were actually Protestant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.ca/This-Terrible-Business-Been-Good/dp/1552632113 |title=This Terrible Business has been Good to Me |publisher=Amazon.ca |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl] He served in the Royal Canadian Navy (1944–1945) during World War II, and after being discharged traveled in the American South, where he encountered segregation, an experience that would influence his later work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/ID=1328479250 |title=Jewison interview in CBCs "The Hour", May 27, 2009 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl]
Jewison attended Victoria College in the University of Toronto, graduating with a B.A. in 1949. As a student he was involved in writing, directing, and acting in various theatrical productions, including the All-Varsity Revue in 1949. Following graduation, he moved to London, where he worked sporadically as a script writer for a children's show and bit part actor for the British Broadcasting Corporation, while supporting himself with odd jobs. Out of work in Britain in late 1951, he came back to Canada to become a production trainee at CBLT in Toronto, which was preparing for the launch of CBC Television.[tpl]cite web|last1=Sears|first1=Alex Asher|last2=LoBrutto|first2=Vincent|year=2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5W40bXoCg|title=Norman Jewison Receives the ACE Golden Eddie Award|work=American Cinema Editors|url=http://www.ace-filmeditors.org/newace/eddieSpecHonoree.html|archivedate=March 4, 2008[/tpl]

==Career==

===Television===

When CBC Television went on the air in the fall of 1952, Jewison was an assistant director. During the next seven years he wrote, directed, and produced a wide variety of musicals, comedy-variety shows, dramas, and specials, including the The Big Revue, Showtime and The Barris Beat. In 1953 he married Margaret Ann "Dixie" Dixon, a former model. They would have three children – Michael, Kevin, and Jennifer – who would all pursue careers in the entertainment world.Jewison biography, Internet Movie Database
In 1958 Jewison was recruited to work for CBS in New York, where his first assignment was Your Hit Parade, followed by The Andy Williams Show. The success of these shows led to directing specials featuring performers such as Harry Belafonte, Jackie Gleason, and Danny Kaye. The television production that proved pivotal to Jewison's career was the Judy Garland "comeback" special that aired in 1961, which included Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and led to a weekly show that Jewison was later called in to direct. Visiting the studio during rehearsal for the special, actor Tony Curtis suggested to Jewison that he should direct a feature film. It was not until the early 1990s that he would branch back into television, starting with producing the TNT biographical film Geronimo (1993).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=236961 |title=TNT Norman Jewison Profile |publisher=Tcm.com |date=March 14, 1999 |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl]

===Film===

Jewison's career as a film director began with the comedy Forty Pounds of Trouble (1962), starring Curtis. The next three films he directed, including two with Doris Day, The Thrill of It All (1963) and Send Me No Flowers (1964), were also light comedies done under contract for Universal Studios. After The Art of Love (1965), Jewison was determined to escape from the genre and tackle more demanding projects. His breakthrough film proved to be The Cincinnati Kid (1965), a drama starring Steve McQueen, now considered one of the finest movies made about gambling, and Jewison considers it one of his personal favorites because it was his first challenging drama.Bierlich, Jenny. Interview with Norman Jewison – 58th Annual ACE Eddie Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, February 17, 2008 This triumph was followed in 1966 by the acclaimed satire on Cold War paranoia, The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming, which was the first film Jewison also produced, and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
Continuing the string of successes was one of the films that has become closely identified with its director, In the Heat of the Night (1967), a crime drama set in a racially divided Southern town and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while Jewison was nominated for Best Director. As a follow-up he directed and produced another film with McQueen, using innovative multiple screen images in the crime caper The Thomas Crown Affair (1968). From that point Jewison produced all feature films he directed, often with associate Patrick Palmer, and he also acted as producer for films directed by others, beginning with his former film editor Hal Ashby's directoral debut The Landlord (1970).Jewison filmography, Internet Movie Database
After the completion of the period comedy Gaily, Gaily (1969), Jewison, having become disenchanted with the political climate in the United States, moved his family to England. At Pinewood Studios northwest of London, and on location in Yugoslavia, he worked on what would become one of the top grossing films of all time, the musical Fiddler on the Roof (1971, re-issued 1979), which won three Oscars and was nominated for five others, including Best Picture and Director. During the filming of Fiddler, Jewison was also the subject of the 1971 National Film Board of Canada documentary, "Norman Jewison, Filmmaker" directed by Douglas Jackson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=10595 |title=National Film Board of Canada archives "Norman Jewison, Filmmaker" |publisher=Onf-nfb.gc.ca |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl]
Jewison's next project was the musical Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), based on the Broadway musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It was filmed in Israel, where Jewison also produced the western Billy Two Hats (1974), starring Gregory Peck. Superstar, controversial for its treatment of a sacred subject, was followed by another movie that sparked critical debate, this time over violence, Rollerball (1975), set in the near future when corporations ruled the world and entertainment centered around a deadly game. The next film he directed, the labor union drama F.I.S.T. (1978), loosely based on the life of Jimmy Hoffa, also provided some controversy, this time regarding the screenwriting credit. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was unhappy to share the screenwriting credit with the film's star Sylvester Stallone, as he felt that Stallone's input had been minor, while Stallone claimed to have basically rewritten the whole script.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/joe-eszterhas/contributor/30330/bio |title=Yahoo!

In 1978 Jewison returned to Canada, settling in the Caledon area in Ontario and establishing a farm that produced prize-winning cattle. Operating from a base in Toronto, as well as one maintained in California, he directed high profile actors Al Pacino in ...And Justice for All (1979), and Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn in the romantic comedy Best Friends (1982), and he produced The Dogs of War (1981) and Iceman (1984). During this period Jewison also produced the 53rd Annual Academy Awards (1981), which was slated to air the day President Ronald Reagan was shot and had to be rescheduled. Revisiting the theme of racial tension that had characterized In the Heat of the Night, Jewison's A Soldier's Story (1984), based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play, was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. His subsequent film was also based on an acclaimed play. The provocative Agnes of God (1985), set in a Quebec convent, starred Jane Fonda, Meg Tilly and Anne Bancroft; it received three Academy Award nominations.ImdB Awards for Agnes of God
Jewison's next film proved to be one of the most popular romantic films ever made. Moonstruck (1987), starring Cher, was a box office hit that garnered three Academy Awards, including Cher as Best Actress. It also competed for the Oscar for Best Picture, and provided Jewison his third Best Director nomination. During this period he became the force behind a project that had long been of interest: the Canadian Centre for Advanced Film Studies was incorporated in 1986. Renamed the Canadian Film Centre, it began operations in 1988. As founder, Norman Jewison has continued his efforts for the Centre in many capacities. Feature films such as House (directed by Laurie Lynd) and Shoemaker (directed by Colleen Murphy), as well as many short films such as the south Asian "Shanti Baba Ram & the Dancers of Hope" (directed by Steve Rosenberg), title track by Vikas Kohli of Fatlabs) and Elevated (directed by Vincenzo Natali) have all come from the Canadian Film Centre.
For the next decade Jewison continued to direct feature films released by major studios: In Country (1989), a drama concerned with Vietnam veterans and the daughter of a war casualty; Other People's Money (1991), a social comedy about greed in the 1980s; Only You (1994), a romantic comedy set in Italy; and Bogus (1996), a fantasy about a young boy and his imaginary friend. He also served as producer for the film January Man (1989), executive producer for the Canadian movie Dance Me Outside, and branched back into television both as director and producer, including the series The Rez (1996–1998).
The Hurricane (1999) was Jewison's third film to explore the effects of racism, telling the story of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who had been falsely convicted for a triple murder in New Jersey during the mid-sixties. Denzel Washington was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Carter. In 1999 Jewison's work was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when he was given the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement.

That same year his autobiography This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me was published, expressing the enthusiasm, conviction and creative passion that have sustained a rewarding career.University of Toronto, http://library.vicu.utoronto.ca/special/F56jewison.htm, 2003.
Jewison has been selected as the recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of America. Jewison received the honor at the 62nd Annual DGA Awards on January 30, 2010 at the Century Plaza in Los Angeles."Variety" December 1 2009
