S-Bus is a protocol based on RS485 connection Topology for intelligent buildings. S-bus is the developed protocol used 64 bits long code, 32 bits as short code,  to be an Asian and African Standard protocol that administered by the Smart Group Association, S-bus Known also as the "Smart-BUS"
Also another S-Bus known as (Saia-Burgess Bus) is a dedicated protocol for reading process data from devices provided by the Saia-Burgess company.

==Wire transmission==

Twisted pair of data using signaling speed of 9600 bit/s. flexible Bus power with 8-32 V DC, and 25 mA, Polarization critical. Can install up to 250 Devices in each bus, linking with network bridges,  up to 65280 device per network, Maximum bus  length is 1200 m. Topology also very flexible can be loop, star, ring or T connection.
Protocol format (ASCII):  bits protocol according to the code tables
