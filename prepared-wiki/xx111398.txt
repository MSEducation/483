After graduating from the University of Minnesota as a journalism major in 1955, Frishberg spent two years in the Air Force.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Jazz Police |title=Dave Frishberg at the Jazz Bakery Nov 29 - Dec 4th |url=http://www.jazzpolice.com/content/view/5077/95/ |author=Don Berryman|date=November 27, 2005[/tpl]
