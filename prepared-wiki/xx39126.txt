Shrove Tuesday (widely known as Pancake Day) is a day in February or March, preceding Ash Wednesday (the first day of Lent), which is celebrated in many countries by consuming pancakes.
Shrove Tuesday, a moveable feast, is determined by Easter. The expression "Shrove Tuesday" comes from the word shrive, meaning "confess".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PPDIx6WWuOQC&pg=PA354&dq=Anglican+Mardi+Gras&hl=en&ei=8am8Tp_PCqPg0QH0t5y-BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Anglican%20Mardi%20Gras&f=false|title=Entertaining from Ancient Rome to the Super Bowl|author=Melitta Weiss Adamson, Francine Segan|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|quote=In Anglican countries, Mardis Gras is known as Shrove Tuesday-from shrive meaning "confess"-or ''Pancake Day"-after the breakfast food that symbolizes one final hearty meal of eggs, butter, and sugar before the fast.

Being the last day before the penitential season of Lent, related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one sacrifices for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations, before commencing the fasting and religious obligations associated with Lent. The term Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday," referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season, which begins on Ash Wednesday.

==Terminology==

The word shrove is a form of the English word shrive, which means to obtain absolution for one's sins by way of Confession and doing penance. Thus Shrove Tuesday gets its name from the custom for Christians to be "shriven" before the start of Lent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13763a.htm |title=Thurston, Herbert. "Shrovetideer=Newadvent.org |date=1912-02-01 |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] Shrove Tuesday is the last day of "shrovetide", somewhat analogous to the Carnival tradition that developed separately in countries of Latin Europe.

==Traditions==

Pancakes are associated with the day preceding Lent because they were a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent.  The liturgical fasting emphasized eating plainer food and refraining from food that would give pleasure: in many cultures, this means no meat, dairy products, or eggs.
In Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand the day is also known as "Pancake Day" as it is a common custom to eat pancakes as a meal.[tpl]cite web | title = Shrove Tuesday - Pancake Day!| work = Irish Culture and Customs | url = http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/ShroveTues.html | accessdate = 17 November 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday) in the UK | work = British Embassy, Washington DC | url = http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&i=60062&L1=0&L2=0&a=41276| accessdate =  17 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070223204148/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&i=60062&L1=0&L2=0&a=41276  |archivedate = 23 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Easter in Australia | work = The Australian Government Culture and Recreation Portal | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/easter/ | accessdate =  17 November 2006 [/tpl]
In Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes. Children take delight in discovering the objects, which are intended to be divinatory. For example, the person who receives a coin will be wealthy; a nail indicates that they will become or marry a carpenter.[tpl]cite web | title = Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage | url = http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/custom.html | accessdate =  8 March 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Its Shrove Tuesday and Pancake Day|url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/2010-02-16/article-1501924/Its-Shrove-Tuesday-and-Pancake-Day/1|publisher=Cape Breton Post[/tpl]

===Festivities===

In England, as part of community celebration, many towns held traditional Shrove Tuesday "mob football" games, some dating as far back as the 12th century. The practice mostly died out in the 19th century after the passing of the Highway Act 1835 which banned playing football on public highways. A number of towns have maintained the tradition, including Alnwick in Northumberland, Ashbourne in Derbyshire (called the Royal Shrovetide Football) in County Durham and St Columb Major (called Hurling the Silver Ball) in Cornwall.
Shrove Tuesday was once known as a "half-holiday" in Britain. It started at 11:00am with the ringing of a church bell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cooksguide.co.uk |title=Cooks Guide |publisher=Cooks Guide |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] On Pancake Day, "pancake races" are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The tradition is said to have originated when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her frying pan and pancake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/lent_1.shtml |title="The origin of pancake racing", BBC |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28[/tpl] The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England, even today. Participants with frying pans race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan whilst running.
The most famous pancake race,2007 Pancake Race Video[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] at Olney in Buckinghamshire, has been held since 1445. The contestants, traditionally women, carry a frying pan and race over a 415 yard course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants have to toss their pancake at both the start and the finish, as well as wear an apron and a scarf. Traditionally, when men want to participate, they must dress up as a housewife (usually an apron and a bandanna). The race is followed by a church service.
Since 1950 the people of Liberal, Kansas, and Olney have held the "International Pancake Day" race between the two towns. The two towns' competitors race along an agreed-upon measured course. The times of the two towns' competitors are compared to determine a winner overall. After the 2009 race, Liberal was leading with 34 wins to Olney's 25.[tpl]cite web |title=Liberal wins 60th Int'l Pancake race |work=United Press International (UPI) |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2009/02/24/Liberal-wins-60th-Intl-Pancake-race/UPI-47121235507048/ |accessdate=30 April 2011[/tpl] A similar race is held in North Somercotes in Lincolnshire, England.
Scarborough celebrates by closing the foreshore to all traffic, closing schools early, and inviting all to skip. Traditionally, long ropes were used from the nearby harbour. The town crier rings the pancake bell, situated on the corner of Westborough (main street) and Huntress Row.
The children of the hamlet of Whitechapel, Lancashire keep alive a local tradition by visiting local households and asking "please a pancake", to be rewarded with oranges or sweets. It is thought the tradition arose when farm workers visited the wealthier farm and manor owners to ask for pancakes or pancake fillings.(7 February 2008), "Pancake traditions in village", Longridge News, accessed 2010-06-16
In Finland and Sweden the day is associated with the almond paste-filled semla pastry.
Pancakes are traditional in Christian festivals in Ukraine and Russia also at this time of year (Maslenitsa).
In London, the Rehab Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of Rehab, which provides a range of health and social care, training, education, and employment services in the UK for disabled people and others who are marginalised. In 2009 the Upper House won. The race was then won by the Lower House in 2010 with the Upper House reclaiming their winning title in 2011. In 2012, the Lower House were crowned the pancake flipping champions and they reclaimed their title for the second year running in 2013.
