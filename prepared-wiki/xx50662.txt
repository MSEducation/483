Lucius Aemilius Paullus (died 216 BC) was a Roman consul twice, in 219 and 216 BC.
He served his first consulship with Marcus Livius Salinator. During this year, he defeated Demetrius of Pharos in the Second Illyrian War and forced him to flee to the court of Philip V of Macedon. On his return to Rome, he was awarded a triumph. He was subsequently charged, along with his colleague, with unfairly dividing the spoils, although he was acquitted.T. Robert S.

During the Second Punic War, he was made consul a second time and served with Gaius Terentius Varro. He shared the command of the army with Varro at the Battle of Cannae. Varro led out the troops against the advice of Paullus and the battle became a crushing defeat for the Romans.T. Robert S. Broughton: The Magistrates Of The Roman Republic.
