ZZ Top's First Album is the first studio album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top. It was produced by manager Bill Ham, and was released on January 16, 1971, on London Records. Establishing their attitude and humor, ZZ Top incorporated boogie, hard rock, heavy metal and Southern rock influences into their sound. Thematically, the album is lively, playful and at times brash, filled with the band's personal experiences and sexual innuendos that became central to the group's image. Seeking inspiration from Fleetwood Mac, ZZ Top began recording the album at Robin Hood Studios in Tyler, Texas. Only one single was released from the album and failed to appear on the Billboard charts.
In 1987, this album was remixed for CD release. In 2013, the original vinyl mix was released on HD Tracks in high-resolution digital download formats.https://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=artistdetail&id=10702 The original mix of the album was released on CD in June 2013 as part of the box set The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990).[tpl]cite web|last=Gallucci|first=Michael|title=New ZZ Top Box Will Include Original Mixes of First 10 Albums|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-box-set-original-mixes/|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=2 May 2013[/tpl]
