[[Triangle-free graph]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families

In the mathematical area of graph theory, a triangle-free graph is an undirected graph in which no three vertices form a triangle of edges. Triangle-free graphs may be equivalently defined as graphs with clique number ≤ 2, graphs with girth ≥ 4, graphs with no induced 3-cycle, or locally independent graphs.
By Turán's theorem, the n-vertex triangle-free graph with the maximum number of edges is a complete bipartite graph in which the numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition are as equal as possible.

==Triangle finding problem==

The triangle finding problem is the problem of determining whether a graph is triangle-free or not. When the graph does contain a triangle, algorithms are often required to output three vertices which form a triangle in the graph.
It is possible to test whether a graph with m edges is triangle-free in time O(m1.41).[tpl]sfnp|Alon|Yuster|Zwick|1994[/tpl] Another approach is to find the trace of A3, where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph. The trace is zero if and only if the graph is triangle-free. For dense graphs, it is more efficient to use this simple algorithm which relies on matrix multiplication, since it gets the time complexity down to O(n2.373), where n is the number of vertices.
As [tpl]Harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|Mulder|1999[/tpl] show, triangle-free graph recognition is equivalent in complexity to median graph recognition; however, the current best algorithms for median graph recognition use triangle detection as a subroutine rather than vice versa.
The decision tree complexity or query complexity of the problem, where the queries are to an oracle which stores the adjacency matrix of a graph, is Θ(n2). However, for quantum algorithms, the best known lower bound is Ω(n), but the best known algorithm is O(n1.29) due to [tpl]harvtxt|Belovs|2011[/tpl].

==Coloring triangle-free graphs==

Much research about triangle-free graphs has focused on graph coloring. Every bipartite graph (that is, every 2-colorable graph) is triangle-free, and Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph may be 3-colored.[tpl]Harvtxt|Grötzsch|1959[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Thomassen|1994[/tpl]). However, nonplanar triangle-free graphs may require many more than three colors.
[tpl]harvtxt|Mycielski|1955[/tpl] defined a construction, now called the Mycielskian, for forming a new triangle-free graph from another triangle-free graph. If a graph has chromatic number k, its Mycielskian has chromatic number k + 1, so this construction may be used to show that arbitrarily large numbers of colors may be needed to color nonplanar triangle-free graphs. In particular the Grötzsch graph, an 11-vertex graph formed by repeated application of Mycielski's construction, is a triangle-free graph that cannot be colored with fewer than four colors, and is the smallest graph with this property.[tpl]sfnp|Chvátal|1974[/tpl]  [tpl]harvtxt|Gimbel &Thomassen||2000[/tpl] and [tpl]harvtxt|Nilli|2000[/tpl] showed that the number of colors needed to color any m-edge triangle-free graph is
and that there exist triangle-free graphs that have chromatic numbers proportional to this bound.
There have also been several results relating coloring to minimum degree in triangle-free graphs. [tpl]harvtxt|Andrásfai|Erdős|Sós|1974[/tpl] proved that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than 2n/5 neighbors must be bipartite. This is the best possible result of this type, as the 5-cycle requires three colors but has exactly 2n/5 neighbors per vertex. Motivated by this result, [tpl]Harvtxt|Erdős|Simonovits|1973[/tpl] conjectured that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has at least n/3 neighbors can be colored with only three colors; however, [tpl]Harvtxt|Häggkvist|1981[/tpl] disproved this conjecture by finding a counterexample in which each vertex of the Grötzsch graph is replaced by an independent set of a carefully chosen size. [tpl]Harvtxt|Jin|1995[/tpl] showed that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than 10n/29 neighbors must be 3-colorable; this is the best possible result of this type, because Häggkvist's graph requires four colors and has exactly 10n/29 neighbors per vertex. Finally, [tpl]Harvtxt|Brandt|Thomassé|2006[/tpl] proved that any n-vertex triangle-free graph in which each vertex has more than n/3 neighbors must be 4-colorable. Additional results of this type are not possible, as Hajnalsee [tpl]Harvtxt|Erdős|Simonovits|1973[/tpl]. found examples of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and minimum degree (1/3 − ε)n for any ε > 0.
