Bye Bye Baby I Don't Want to Take a Chance is the debut album by Motown recording artist Mary Wells, released on Motown in 1961. The album didn't chart but yielded two hit singles for the teenaged Wells including "Bye Bye Baby", which she issued in late 1960, and a song she had originally written as a demo for Jackie Wilson, and "I Don't Want to Take a Chance", a song written for her by Berry Gordy and Mickey Stevenson.  Wells' follow-up album, The One Who Really Loves You, was released in 1962.
