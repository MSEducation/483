The Chinese People's Party's President is Jeremy Lee, elected on 19th March 2013. He is concurrently the head of the New Revolutionary Alliance (新同盟會), which traces its party lineage to the anti-Japanese Tongmenghui found by Sun Yat-sen in 1905. Jeremy Lee caused international controversy recently by unfurling a Flag of the Republic of China in Canton, Kwangtung; and loudly proclaiming the rule of the Chinese Communist Party illegitimate. The photo has gone viral online, with netizens strongly supporting Jeremy Lee's firm stance for the reunification of China under the Republic of China banner. 
The Chinese People's Party has announced that they will hold a 2013 Penang Conference to discuss the next step forward in their goal to overthrow Communist Rule. The meeting will take place at the historical site of the 1910 Penang conference where Sun Yat-sen kickstarted the first steps towards overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.
