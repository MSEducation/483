[[I Move]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 albums, IZZ albums

I Move is the second album by IZZ, released in 2002. Although the music is primarily progressive rock with apparent influences by King Crimson and Yes, the band also incorporates a fair amount of pop and even Celtic rock. There is great variety from song to song, from gentle ballads ("Light From Your Eyes") to wild and complex instrumental workouts ("Star Evil Gnoma Su").
