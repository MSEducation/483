The following season was consistent, reaching the last 16 of all but one ranking event, but he failed to reach a single semi-final, causing him to slip down two places, to number 11 in the world rankings. At the Crucible he managed to reach the second round for the first time, beating Marco Fu 10–9 in a high quality match, but he was unable to progress further, going down 13–7 to Stephen Hendry.
However, he started the next season on a high by winning the Jiangsu Classic, beating Mark Selby 6–5 in the final.
On 16 December, in his Second Round match against John Higgins at the UK Championship, Ding scored a maximum 147 break in the third frame of the match.[ref]
