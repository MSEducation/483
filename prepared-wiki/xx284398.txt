Adnan Januzaj ([tpl]IPA-sq|adˈnan januˈzaj|Albanian pron[/tpl]; born 5 February 1995) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a winger for English club Manchester United. Born in Brussels, he began his career with Anderlecht before joining Manchester United in 2011 at the age of 16.

==Early life==

Januzaj was born in Brussels, Belgium, where his Kosovar-Albanian family had migrated in 1992 so his father Abedin could escape Yugoslav Army recruitment. Januzaj's father was the eldest of six children from Istog, Kosovo. Januzaj's uncles, Januz and Shemsedin, were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought for Kosovar independence in the Kosovo War. Januzaj's mother's family had been deported to Turkey by Yugoslavian authorities under a plan to suppress Albanian nationalism. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Januzaj has regularly visited his extended family in Kosovo during the summer.[tpl]cite news |first=Nick |last=Fagge |title=Inside Adnan Januzaj's world: Owned by United, chased by England... the wonder boy whose parents escaped the Kosovo war to move to Belgium |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2463191/Adnan-Januzaj-special-report--background-Manchester-United-star.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013 [/tpl]

Towards the end of the 2012–13 season, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson promoted Januzaj to the first-team and he was registered with the number 44 jersey; he did not feature in the remainder of the season, but he was an unused substitute in the final game of the season away to West Bromwich Albion.[tpl]cite news |first=Neil |last=Johnston |title=West Brom 5–5 Man Utd |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499117 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=19 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2013 [/tpl] For his performances during the season, Januzaj won the 2013 Denzil Haroun Reserve Team Player of the Year award.[tpl]cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Januzaj voted star man |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/may/manchester-united-reserve-team-player-of-the-year-2012-2013.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |work=Manchester United |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=15 May 2013 [/tpl] He was included in the first-team squad for the 2013–14 pre-season tour of Asia and scored in the final game of the tour against Hong Kong side Kitchee.

By waiting until 7 October 2013 to register Januzaj, he became eligible as a List B player, but this meant that he could not be selected for the club's first two matches in the competition, at home to Bayer Leverkusen and away to Shakhtar Donetsk. Despite being available from the third game of the tournament, at home to Real Sociedad, Januzaj was left out of both games against the Spanish club and the return match against Bayer Leverkusen. He made his Champions League debut at home to Shakhtar Donetsk on 10 December 2013.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Lynch |title=Van Persie benched for Shakhtar clash, Januzaj makes Champions League debut |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/robin-van-persie-benched-adnan-6392404 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl]
Towards the end of the first half of the 2013–14 season, Januzaj gathered somewhat of a reputation for diving, beginning with a yellow card for a "clear dive" on his full debut against Sunderland in October 2013.[tpl]cite news |first=Simon |last=Bajkowski |title=What's going on with Adnan Januzaj and his 'dive' bookings? |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/whats-going-adnan-januzaj-dive-6462463 |work=Manchester Evening News |publisher=MEN Media |date=2 January 2014 |accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Sunderland 1-2 Man Utd |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24350276 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 October 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl] He received another booking for simulation against West Ham United in December 2013, going to ground despite West Ham defender James Collins not offering a challenge. His third yellow card – which made him the joint second-most-booked player in the Premier League since sanctions for diving were introduced in 2008 – came against Tottenham Hotspur on 1 January 2014 and was the most contentious of the three; although Januzaj went to ground "easily" under a challenge from Tottenham defender Danny Rose, others are of the opinion that Rose "made no attempt to win the ball" and that Januzaj should not have been booked.[tpl]cite news |author=Republik of Mancunia |title=Has Adnan Januzaj really dived more times in his career than Luis Suarez? |url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/04/has-adnan-januzaj-really-dived-more-times-in-his-career-than-luis-suarez-4248957/ |work=Metro.co.uk |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=4 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014 [/tpl] David Moyes has admitted speaking to Januzaj about simulation, but he has repeatedly requested that match officials protect the winger from overzealous tackling by opposition defenders.[tpl]cite news |title=Moyes defends Januzaj after diving controversy |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/268269.html |work=ESPN.co.uk |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Mark |last=Froggatt |title=Januzaj needs protection |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2013/Dec/Moyes-demands-more-protection-for-Januzaj.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=15 December 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Boss protects Januzaj |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2013/Dec/david-moyes-protective-of-adnan-januzaj.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Mark |last=Froggatt |title=Moyes speaks to Januzaj |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/dec/david-moyes-speaks-to-adnan-januzaj-about-diving.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=James |last=Tuck |title=Adnan tipped for greatness |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2014/jan/david-moyes-tips-adnan-januzaj-for-greatness-at-manchester-united.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=3 January 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2014 [/tpl]

==International career==

===Eligibility and choice===

Januzaj is eligible to represent Belgium through birth and passport, Albania through his ethnic Albanian heritage, Turkey through his grandparents, and Serbia due to the disputed status of his parents' homeland of Kosovo. He is also eligible to represent Kosovo in international football; although Kosovo does not have a FIFA-affiliated senior team, it does have a FIFA-sanctioned youth team that plays in non-FIFA and non-confederation tournaments and exhibition games against full FIFA members. While Januzaj has yet to choose which national team he will represent, he stated in several interviews that his father, Abedin, will make this decision for him.[tpl]cite news |title=Adnan Januzaj's interview with Kosovan TV station KTV: the full transcript |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10389639/Adnan-Januzajs-interview-with-Kosovan-TV-station-KTV-the-full-transcript.html |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2013 [/tpl]

====Belgium====

In June 2013, the former coach of the Belgian Under-18 and Under-19 teams, Marc Van Geersom, declared that Januzaj has refused a call-up to the Belgian team a number of times, since he would prefer to play for Albania.[tpl]cite news |title=Van Geersom: Januzaj refuzoi Belgjikën, i ati preferon Shqipërinë |url=http://gazetaexpress.com/?cid=1,24,113750 |publisher=Gazeta Express |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Januzaj krijgt kans bij Man U |url=http://sportmagazine.knack.be/sport/nieuws/voetbal-internationaal/januzaj-krijgt-kans-bij-man-u/article-4000319495543.htm |publisher=Sportmagazine |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=13 August 2013 [/tpl]
On 7 October 2013, Wilmots attempted to select Januzaj for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying games against Croatia and Wales, but Januzaj refused the call-up, saying he still needs to make a choice. In response, Wilmots stated: "I wanted to send him a clear signal. Just as Zakaria Bakkali, Adnan is a very promising youngster and I would like to integrate him into the group. I do not want to force his hand. I respect his choice and consider discussing with Adnan and his family".[tpl]cite news |title=Croatie - Belgique : Adnan Januzaj a dit non à Marc Wilmots |url=http://www.lavenir.net/sports/cnt/dmf20131007_00371629 [/tpl]
On 16 October 2013, discussing rumours that suggested Januzaj would choose to represent Belgium if he is included in the 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, Wilmots declared: "The boy was born in Belgium, should he say that he wants to play for Belgium – from there, there is no haggling. I'm not going to play that game. If you're at the top level in Manchester or elsewhere, show me your skills and if I need you I will call. I make no promises, to Januzaj or any person".[tpl]cite news |title=Adnan Januzaj's chances of representing Belgium diminish after Marc Wilmots clashes with his father |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10384880/Adnan-Januzajs-chances-of-representing-Belgium-diminish-after-Marc-Wilmots-clashes-with-his-father.html |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2013 [/tpl]
On 17 October 2013, Januzaj's father told Kosovar TV station KTV he did not like the Belgian federation's approach: "I am not blackmailing them as I'm not asking for any national team to get my son. It is them who want Adnan. ... you have to be professional in this issue. Belgium should follow the rules as well. I run his career in sportive sense, and I have Belgium managers running the legal issues."
On 23 April 2014 Belgian national team coach Marc Wilmots announced that Januzaj had committed himself to the Belgian national team.Adnan Januzaj has committed international future to Belgium, says national team coach Marc Wilmots This message was confirmed the day itself by Januzaj's manager Dirk De Vriese.[tpl]cite news |title=Januzaj kiest "met het hart" voor de Rode Duivels |url=http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Rode_Duivels/140423_Januzaj_Belgie |newspaper=Sporza |language=Dutch |date = 23 April 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2014 [/tpl]

====Albania====

Albania's coach, Gianni De Biasi declared on 12 August 2013 that Januzaj is a great talent, and that he and the Albanian federation are waiting for the right moment to talk to him and to call him up for the Albanian national side.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rtv21.tv/home/?p=120367|title=De Biasi dëshiron Januzajn në kombëtare|accessdate=13 August 2013 |publisher=RTV21 |date=12 August 2013 [/tpl]
On 17 October 2013, Abedin Januzaj criticised the Albanian FA for its lack of professionalism, stating: "They never called us, the only thing they did was to misinform the public, saying they talked to Januzaj, which is not true."  Following this interview, on 18 October 2013, the Football Association of Albania (FSHF) reiterated its interest in Januzaj in a press statement.[tpl]cite web |title=FSHF: Pranojmë gjithçka, vetëm Januzaj të vishet kuqezi |url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/kombetarja/ke-do-zgjedhe-januzaj-talenti-i-shumekerkuar/ |publisher=Panorama Sport |date=18 October 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013 [/tpl]
Januzaj's childhood friend and former team-mate Jonathan Kindermans told media about Januzaj's admiration for Lorik Cana as a boy, and believes that Januzaj would choose to play for Albania rather than England or Belgium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2467629/Adnan-Januzaj-wont-play-England-hero-Albanias-Cana-reveals-childhood-friend.html|title=Januzaj won't play for England... his hero was Albania's Cana, reveals childhood friend|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Daily Mail|last=Kelner|first=Martha|date=19 October 2013 [/tpl]

====Kosovo====

The Football Federation of Kosovo have said that they respect Januzaj's right to decide his international future and that it is not fair to expect a player to represent a nation that cannot play competitive football.[tpl]cite web |title=Adnan Januzaj – MUFC, Belgium, Albania and the Kosovo Diaspora |url=http://daswunderkind.net/manchester-uniteds-next-prodigy-adnan-januzaj-the-kosovar-diaspora/#ZVTQLQbbZt5MbcAv.99 |publisher=Das Wunderkind.net |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2013 [/tpl]

====England====

In October 2013, England manager Roy Hodgson stated that The Football Association were monitoring the player with a view to calling him up in the future.[tpl]cite news |title=Adnan Januzaj being monitored by England - Roy Hodgson |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24416142 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 October 2013 |accessdate=5 October 2013 [/tpl] However, despite widespread press coverage, Januzaj would not meet the requirements to play for England under the unique rules set out in the Home Nations agreement.[tpl]cite web |first=Grant |last=Russell |title=Explained: Why Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj can't play for England |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/242115-explained-why-manchester-uniteds-adnan-januzaj-cant-play-for-england/ |work=STV Sport |publisher=STV |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2013 [/tpl] The Home Nations agreement requires that players engage in a minimum of five years of education before the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association and do not offer national team eligibility through residency.[tpl]cite web |title=Swansea City defender Angel Rangel ineligible for Wales |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18833190 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2013 [/tpl]

====Others====

On 17 October 2013, Januzaj's father discussed his son's chances to represent other countries, such as Turkey, Croatia and Serbia: "We have no connections at all with these countries. I have no idea how people think Adnan will engage with Serbia. There is no way that can happen. Probably, people think as many states were part of Yugoslavia they have the right to give citizenship to Adnan. But, Turkey, Serbia or Croatia stand no chance."
