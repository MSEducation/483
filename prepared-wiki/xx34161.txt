Ernie Kovacs (January 23, 1919 – January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer.
Kovacs' uninhibited, often ad-libbed, and visually experimental comedic style came to influence numerous television comedy programs for years after his death in an automobile accident. Many iconic and diverse shows have been influenced by Kovacs, such as Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, The Uncle Floyd Show, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street,  The Electric Company, and TV hosts such as David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and Craig Ferguson.[tpl]Cite news|author=O'Connor, John J.|title=TV View: Ernie Kovacs: A comic to the medium born|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260|work=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1987|accessdate=January 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMOTqwJ|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author=O'Connor, John J.|title=TV: Why Ernie Kovacs's humor grows with time|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260|work=The New York Times|date=November 17, 1982|accessdate=January 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMYfZr8|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile |last=Walley |first=David G. |year=1987 |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-918282-06-4 |page=202[/tpl]Chevy Chase, "The Unique Comedy of Ernie Kovacs," TV Guide, April 9, 1977, pp. 39–40.[tpl]cite web|author=Visconage, Matt|title=Conan O'Brien and the Legacy of Ernie Kovacs|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/conan-obrien-and-the-legacy-of-ernie-kovacs/ |work=Splitsider |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Willmore, Alison |title=Take a Look at the Unappreciated Genius of TV Pioneer Ernie Kovacs |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/ernie-kovacs |work=Indiewire |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl] Chevy Chase acknowledged Kovacs' influence and thanked him during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.Hofer, Stephen F.(2006).

His solution was to hire a taxi driver to come into their apartment with his own key and whose job was to make breakfast for them both, then take him to the WABC studios.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg |title=Mayhem in the A.

While Kovacs and his wife Edie Adams received Emmy nominations for best performances in a comedy series in 1957, his talent was not formally recognized until after his death. The 1962 Emmy for outstanding electronic camera work and the Directors' Guild award came a short time after his fatal accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search?search_api_views_fulltext=ernie+kovacs&submit=Search&search_api_views_fulltext_1=&search_api_views_fulltext_3=&search_api_views_fulltext_2=&search_api_views_fulltext_4=&field_nominations_year=All&field_nomination_category=All|title=Emmy Awards Database-Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|accessdate=September 20, 2013[/tpl] A quarter century later, he was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/hall-fame/hall-fame-archives-honorees|title=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame Inductees|year=1987|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in television.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/television/ernie-kovacs/1837|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame-Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] In 1986, the Museum of Television & Radio (now the Paley Center for Media) presented an exhibit of Kovacs' work, called The Vision of Ernie Kovacs. The Pulitzer Prize winning television critic, William Henry III wrote for the museum's booklet:[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5NcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sBIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1118,3817667&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title='Vision of Ernie Kovacs' honors first video artist|author=Dudek, Duane|date=June 16, 1986|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs was more than another wide-eyed, self-ingratiating clown. He was television's first significant video artist.  He was its first surrealist... its most daring and imaginative writer.  He was... television's first and possibly only auteur.  And he was a genius.  In commercial terms, a genius is any entertainer... who finds a new way to make money. Kovacs never fit that description. Kovacs' genius lay in the realm of art. There, a genius is someone who causes an audience to look at the world in a new way. 

==Early life and career==

Kovacs' father Andrew immigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.[tpl]Cite news|author=Goodman, Mark|title='Nothing in moderation'|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE133FF930A25756C0A966958260&scp=4|work=The New York Times|date=May 13, 1990|accessdate=December 10, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMrLUJ4|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl]
Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced deeply by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Mr. Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression brought hard financial times to the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7rceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q2UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5709,4130335&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs:Serious-Minded Clown| date=January 21, 1962|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|author=Ryan, Jack|accessdate=August 6, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NMoqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4MwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2654,3557750&dq=edie+adams&hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs-what a husband!|author=Kovacs, Edie Adams|date=July 20, 1958|publisher=Palm Beach Post|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl] During this time, Ernie managed to see a lot of "Grade B" movies (admission was only a dime); many of them were the spark of his routines later on.
A 1938 local news story shows him as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet sporting his trademark mustache.[tpl]cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N_-W1PmSNqg/SXvT2gIbqRI/AAAAAAAAJgM/dJ-LCaJ8Y8k/s1600-h/1938+Ernie+Kovacs+in+a+Prospect+Presbyterian+Playweb.jpg|title=Discussing Plot and Action|date=March 6, 1938|publisher=Trenton Sunday Times Advertiser|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl] Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont in 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. Over the next year and a half, his comedic talents emerged as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oOkKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4k8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6625,2617383&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs Doing Fine 'Living on Borrowed Time'|date=December 18, 1959|author=Thomas, Bob|publisher=Prescott Evening Courier|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl] While hospitalized, he also developed a lifelong love and understanding of classical music through the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and he went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He took work as a cigar salesman, which was the beginning of a lifelong habit.

His first paid entertainment work came in 1941, as a disc jockey on Trenton's WTTM radio. Ernie spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events along the way; in this position he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved in local theater; a news clipping from a local paper ran a photo and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941.[tpl]cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N_-W1PmSNqg/RoMQJPnPYdI/AAAAAAAABmU/qK3L03jhlJY/s1600-h/1941+ERNIE+KOVACS.jpg|title=Directs Play|date=January 19, 1941|publisher=Tom Glover|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl] The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered him a column in June 1945; Ernie called it "Kovacs Unlimited".[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2010/05/02/news/doc4bde3ede47e68167292280.txt |title=Look Who's Talking|author=Edelstein, Jeff|date=May 2, 2010|publisher=The Trentonian|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl]

==Start in television==

Showing up at NBC's Philadelphia affiliate, WPTZ (now KYW-TV), for an audition wearing a barrel and shorts got Kovacs his first television job in January, 1950. His first show was Pick Your Ideal, a fashion and promotional program for the Ideal Manufacturing Company. Before long he was also the host of  Deadline For Dinner and Now You're Cooking, shows featuring tips from local chefs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,166670-3,00.html|title=Philly Fifties: TV|author=Corliss, Richard|date=July 7, 2001|publisher=Time|accessdate=February 9, 2011[/tpl]subscription required) When Kovacs' guest chef did not show up in time to go on the air, Ernie offered a recipe for "Eggs Scavok" (Kovacs spelled backward). They soon led to a show called Three to Get Ready, named for WPTZ's dial spot on channel 3.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html|title=Ernie Kovacs|publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl]
Premiering in November, 1950, Three to Get Ready was groundbreaking, as the first regularly scheduled early morning (7–9am) show in a major TV market, predating NBC's Today by over a year. Prior to this, it had been assumed that no one would watch TV at such an early hour.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sh8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|title=WPTZ's Kovacs Reaps Early Scanner Harvest|publisher=Billboard|date=April 7, 1951|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] While the show was billed as early morning news and weather, Kovacs provided this and more in an original manner.  When rain was in the weather forecast, Kovacs would get on a ladder and pour water down on the staff member reading the report. Goats were auditioned for a local theater performance and tiny women appeared to walk up his arm.[tpl]cite book|publisher=Billboard|date=December 1, 1951|title=Kovacs Gets His Own Goat|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B0UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/03/23/tvs-tiniest-actress/?Qwd=./MechanixIllustrated/9-1955/tiny_actress&Qif=tiny_actress_0.jpg&Qiv=thumbs&Qis=XL#qdig|title=TV's Tiniest Actress|date=September 1955|publisher=Mechanix Illustrated|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs also went outside of the studio for some of his sketches, running through a downtown Philadelphia restaurant in a gorilla suit in one, and looking into a construction pit saying it was deep enough to see to China, when a man in Chinese clothing popped up, said a few words in the language, and ran off. Since the weekly prop budget for the show was a scant $15, Kovacs once asked his viewers to send unwanted items to Channel 3; they filled the station's lobby.
The only character no one ever saw inspired more gifts; he was Howard, the World's Strongest Ant. From the time of his WPTZ debut, Howard received over 30,000 gifts from Kovacs' viewers, including a mink lined swimming pool. Ernie began his Early Eyeball Fraternal & Marching Society (EEFMS) while doing Three to Get Ready.  There were membership cards with by-laws and ties; the password was a favorite phrase of Kovacs' – "It's Been Real".[tpl]cite web|url=http://erniekovacs.blogspot.com/2008/10/good-ol-officer-boyle-of-eefms.html|title=Good Ol' Officer Boyle of the EEFMS|date=October 22, 2008|publisher=The Ernie Kovacs Blog|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y8vKoEsPMqsC&pg=PA106&dq=ernie+kovacs+tie#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs%20tie&f=false|title=Heritage Music & Entertainment Auction #7006|publisher=Heritage Auctions, Inc.|accessdate=November 8, 2010|isbn=9781599673691[/tpl] Ernie brought the EEFMS to New York in 1952 when he moved to WCBS.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=86Kntp6Kas8C&pg=PA34&dq=ernie+kovacs+auction+card#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs%20auction%20card&f=false |title=Heritage Music & Entertainment Auction #7004|publisher=Heritage Auctions, Inc. |accessdate=November 8, 2010 |isbn=9781599673370 |date=January 1, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/eefmsbig.jpg |title=WCBS-TV Early Eyeball Fraternal & Marching Society Membership Card|publisher=erniekovacs.net|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] The success of Three to Get Ready proved the theory wrong and was one of the factors that led NBC to create The Today Show. WPTZ did not begin broadcasting Today when it premiered on January 14, 1952; network pressure caused the station to drop Three to Get Ready for it at the end of March of that year.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=iR4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false |title=WPTZ To Shift Kovacs, Take Garroway TV|date=March 29, 1952|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8uErAAAAIBAJ&sjid=12UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1599,3971024&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Garroway-More at Large Than on TV |author=Perrigo, Lucia|date=November 9, 1951|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=July 10, 2010[/tpl]
In early 1952, Kovacs was also doing a late morning show for WPTZ called Kovacs on the Corner.  The show had a Sesame Street feel, as Kovacs would walk through an imaginary neighborhood, talking with various characters such as Pete the Cop (played by Pete Boyle, father of the late actor Peter Boyle) and Luigi the Barber. As with Three to Get Ready, Kovacs did some special segments.  "Swap Time" was one of them; viewers could bring their unwanted items to the WPTZ studios to trade them live on the air with Kovacs. Creative control was wrested from Kovacs soon after the show's debut; beginning on January 4, 1952, it ended on March 28, 1952—the same day as Three to Get Ready. Kovacs then moved on to WCBS-TV with a local morning show and a later network one. While both were cancelled, the morning program suffered the same fate as his WPTZ show-the air time being taken by the station's network in 1954.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lB4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=red+skelton#v=onepage&q=red%20skelton&f=false|title=Kovacs' Time is Pre-Empted|date=January 16, 1954|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl]

==Visual humor and characters==

At WPTZ, Kovacs began using the ad-libbed and experimental style that would become his reputation, including video effects, superimpositions, reverse polarities and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully timed non-sequitur gags and for carefully allowing the so-called fourth wall to be breached.[tpl]cite book|title=When Television Was Young: The Inside Story with Memories by Legends of the Small Screen|editor-last=McMahon|editor-first=Ed|editor2-last=Fisher|editor2-first=David|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|pages=288|isbn=1-4016-0327-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2uN_AkdwAioC&pg=PA93&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs' cameras commonly showed his viewers activity beyond the boundaries of the show set—including crew members and outside the studio itself. Kovacs also liked talking to the off-camera crew and even introduced segments from the studio control room. Ernie frequently made use of accidents and happenstance, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. One of Kovacs' Philadelphia broadcasts was "enlivened" by a homeless man who sought shelter inside the TV studio; Kovacs invited him onto the set, where he slept for the duration of the telecast, but nonetheless was introduced on camera to the audience as "Sleeping Schwartz."  He was once knocked out when a pie in the face still had the plate under it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ENAVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aBEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7220,772003&dq=edie+adams&hl=en|title=Edie Adams Thinks It's OK To Return To Marilyn Spoof|author=Wilson, Earl|date=February 5, 1970|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl]
Kovacs' love of spontaneity extended to his crew, who would occasionally play on-air pranks on him to see how he would react.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0fEvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A_0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2964,4341043&dq=bill+wendell&hl=en|title=Bill Wendell, 75, Television Announcer|date=April 16, 1999|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=November 23, 2010[/tpl] During one of his NBC shows, Kovacs was appearing as the inept magician Matzoh Heppelwhite. The sketch called for the magician to frequently hit a gong, which was the signal for a sexy female assistant to bring out a bottle and shot glass for a quick snort of alcohol. Stagehands substituted real liquor for the iced tea normally used for the gag. The look on Ernie's face upon taking the first shot was priceless when he realized that he would be called upon to drink a shot of liquor for each successive gong. Kovacs pressed on with the sketch and was quite inebriated by the end of the show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nnYfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MXYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5509,3178344&dq=percy+dovetonsils&hl=en|title=Channel Markers|date=February 18, 1961|publisher=The Norwalk Hour|accessdate=March 18, 2011[/tpl] On another occasion, as "Percy Dovetonsils", he found that his drink contained a live fish.
Kovacs helped develop camera tricks still common almost 50 years after his death, one of which became one of his signature gags. His character Eugene sat at a table to eat his lunch, but as he removed items one at a time from a lunch box, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a newspaper at the other end. When Kovacs poured milk from a thermos bottle, the stream flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on television before, the secret was using a tilted set in front of a camera tilted at the same angle.
He constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating visual effects that would later be done electronically. One innovative construction involved attaching a kaleidoscope made from a toilet paper roll to a camera lens with cardboard and tape and setting the resulting abstract images to music.[tpl]Cite book | editor-last=Silverblatt|editor-first=Art|title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook|year=2007|pages=258|publisher=M.

Used on a camera and turning it could put Kovacs seemingly on the ceiling. An underwater stunt involved inveterate cigar smoker Kovacs sitting in an easy chair, reading his newspaper and somehow smoking his cigar. Removing it from his mouth, Kovacs was able to exhale a puff of white smoke, all while floating underwater. The trick: the "smoke" was a small amount of milk which he filled his mouth with before submerging. Kovacs repeated the effect for a Dutch Masters commercial on his ABC game show, Take a Good Look.
One of the special effects he employed made it appear as if he was able to look through his assistant, Barbara Loden's, head.  The illusion was performed by placing a black patch on Loden's head and standing her against a black background while one studio camera was trained on her. A second one photographed Kovacs, who used the studio monitor to position himself exactly so that his eye would appear to be looking through a hole in her head.
He also developed such routines as an all-gorilla version of Swan Lake, a poker game set to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, the Silent Show, in which Eugene interacts with the world accompanied solely by music and sound effects, parodies of typical television commercials and movie genres, and various musical segments with everyday items (such as kitchen appliances or office equipment) moving in sync to music.[tpl]Cite book|title=Ernie Kovacs & Early TV Comedy|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zzXtobwmRZAC&pg=PA53&dq=ernie+kovacs+swan+lake#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs%20swan%20lake&f=false|editor-last=Horton|editor-first=Andrew|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn= 9780292779624|accessdate=September 3, 2013|date=March 1, 2010[/tpl] A popular recurring sketch was The Nairobi Trio, three derby-hatted apes miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune of Robert Maxwell's "Solfeggio".
Kovacs could use extended sketches and mood pieces or quick blackout gags lasting only seconds.

Kovacs reportedly disliked working in front of a live audience, as was the case with the shows he did for NBC in the 1950s. He found the presence of an audience distracting, and those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects, which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.
Like many comedians of the era, Kovacs created a rotation of recurring roles. In addition to the silent "Eugene," his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet Percy Dovetonsils, and the heavily accented German disc jockey, Wolfgang von Sauerbraten. Mr. Question Man, who answered viewer queries, was a satire on the long-run (1937–56) radio series, The Answer Man. Others included horror show host Auntie Gruesome, bumbling magician Matzoh Heppelwhite, Frenchman Pierre Ragout, and Miklos Molnar, the sardonic Hungarian host of a cooking show.[tpl]Cite book|editor-last=Castleman|editor-first=Harry|editor2-last=Podrazik|editor2-first=Walter|year=2004|title=Watching TV: Six Decades of American Television|pages=416|publisher=Syracuse University Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=A16TTK0vN7sC&pg=PA149&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|isbn=0-8156-2988-5|accessdate=July 12, 2010|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] The Miklos character wasn't always confined to a kitchen; Kovacs performed a parody of The Howdy Doody Show with "Buffalo Miklos" as the host.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=ernie+kovacs&f=all&c=all&advanced=1&p=4&item=B:22490|title=The Ernie Kovacs Show (NBC)|date=August 13, 1956|publisher=Paley Center for Media|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] Poet Percy Dovetonsils can also be found playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata on a disappearing piano and as a "Master Detective" on the "Private Eye-Private Eye" presentation of the US Steel Hour on CBS March 8, 1961.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoTWzZ893go|title=Video-YouTube-Percy Dovetonsils-Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata|accessdate=July 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rM8zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7fcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1178,633157&dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&hl=en|title=TV private eye took it on the chin Wednesday night|author=Danzig, Fred|date=March 9, 1961|publisher=The Bulletin|accessdate=July 15, 2010[/tpl] On the same show, the Nairobi Trio abandons their instruments for a safe cracking job; still with a background of "Solfeggio" but speaking, two of the three appear in an "Outer Space" sketch.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=--UQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0uIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6904,1154759&dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&hl=en|title=Private Eye-Private Eye Stars Kovacs Tonight|date=March 8, 1961|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=July 15, 2010[/tpl]
 
Kovacs never hesitated to lampoon those considered institutions of radio and television. In April 1954, he started late-night talk show The Ernie Kovacs Show on DuMont Television Network's New York flagship station, WABD. Stage, screen, and radio notables often dropped by as guests. Archie Bleyer, head of Cadence Records, came to chat one evening.  Bleyer had been the long-time orchestra leader for Arthur Godfrey's radio and television shows.  He had been fired by Godfrey the year before along with fellow cast member, Julius La Rosa, when it was discovered Bleyer's record company had a contract with LaRosa without Godfrey's knowledge. Bleyer and Kovacs were shown in split-screen, with Kovacs wearing a red wig, headphones, and playing a ukelele in a Godfrey imitation, while talking with his guest.
Kovacs' television programs included Three to Get Ready (an early morning program seen on Philadelphia's WPTZ from 1950 through 1952), It's Time for Ernie (1951, his first network series),[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1B4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|title=Time For Ernie|editor-last=Ackerman|editor-first=Paul|publisher=Billboard|date=June 2, 1951|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] Ernie in Kovacsland, (a summer replacement show for Kukla, Fran and Ollie, 1951),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043195/|title=Ernie in Kovacsland|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl] The Ernie Kovacs Show (1952–56 on various networks),[tpl]cite book|title=The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television|editor-last=Weinstein|editor-first=David|year=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|pages=240|isbn=1-59213-499-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tV7fXlQQdz4C&pg=PA175&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl] a twice-a-week job filling in for Steve Allen as host of The Tonight Show on Mondays and Tuesdays (1956–57), and game shows Gamble on Love, One Minute Please, Time Will Tell (all on DuMont), and Take a Good Look (1959–61).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/TAGL.html|title=Take A Good Look|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs later publicly accused Allen of stealing material and characters from him and then performing them in only slightly obfuscated form.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] (For example, Kovacs' "Mr. Question Man" bore a resemblance to Allen's "Answer Man," and later, Johnny Carson's long-running Carnac character.)[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm|title=The Ernie Kovacs Show|author=Pack, Lindsy E.|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs also had a short stint as a celebrity panelist on What's My Line?, but took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a legitimate question for the sake of a laugh. An example: Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, the founder of the automobile company, was the program's "mystery guest." Previous questioning had established that the mystery guest's name was synonymous with an automobile brand, Kovacs asked, "Are you – and this is just a wild guess – but are you Abraham Lincoln?"—a reference to the Ford Motor Company's brand of luxury automobile.[tpl]Cite book | editor-last=Allen|editor-first=Steve|title=Steve Allen's Private Joke File|year=2000|pages=432|publisher=Three River Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bi0-4WDPGrEC&pg=PA245&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|isbn=0-609-80672-6|accessdate=July 11, 2010 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] When Kovacs gave an interview admitting that he was absent from the show when he wanted to go out for dinner on a Sunday, his stint on the panel show was over.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MK0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qOoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=765,459345&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=What!

==TV specials==

He also did several television specials, including the famous Silent Show (1957), featuring his character, Eugene, the first all-pantomime prime-time network program. After the break-up of the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis partnership, NBC offered Lewis the opportunity to host his own 90-minute color TV special. Lewis opted to take only 60 minutes, leaving the network 30 minutes to fill; no one wanted this time slot, but Kovacs was willing to have it.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html  |title=Ernie's Life Magazine cover |author=Model, Ben|publisher=Model, Ben |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060208071526/http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html |archivedate = February 8, 2006[/tpl] The program contained no spoken dialogue and contained only sound effects and music.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7hRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pDkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3789,2560910&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=TV Key Previews|date=January 19, 1957|publisher= St. Joseph News-Press|accessdate=March 18, 2011[/tpl] Starring Kovacs as the mute, Chaplinlike character "Eugene," the program contained surreal sight gags.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ugUdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=14oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7113,2850782&dq=ernie+kovacs+eugene&hl=en|title=Radio & TV|author=Crosby, John|date=January 24, 1957|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs developed the Eugene character during the fall of 1956 when hosting The Tonight Show. Expectations were high for the Lewis program, but it was Kovacs' special that received the most attention; Kovacs received his first movie offer, had a cover story in Life, and received the Sylvania Award that year. In 1961, Kovacs and his co-director, Joe Behar, were recipients of the Directors Guild of America Award for a second version of this program over the ABC network.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kovaksernie/kovacsernie.htm |title=Ernie Kovacs, U.S. Comedian|author=Chorba, Frank J.|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=November 8, 2010[/tpl]
A series of monthly half-hour specials for ABC in 1961–62 is often considered his best television work. Shot on videotape using new editing and special effects techniques, it won a 1962 Emmy Award.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=ernie+kovacs&program=&start_year=1949&end_year=2010&network=All&web_category=All&winner=All|title=Primetime Emmy Award Database-Ernie Kovacs|publisher=American Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs and co-director Behar also won the Directors Guild of America award for an Ernie Kovacs Special based on the earlier silent "Eugene" program.

What made Kovacs unique may also have been what made him a hard sell to television viewers used to situation comedies and variety shows. Having a cult following at best, Kovacs rarely had a highly rated show. His friend Jack Lemmon was once quoted as saying that no one ever understood Kovacs' work because "he was always 15 years ahead of everyone else."[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
"The existence of these separate shows is testament to both the success and failure of Ernie Kovacs," says the Museum of Broadcast Communications. "A brilliant and innovative entertainer, he was a failure as a popular program host; praised by critics, he was avoided by viewers... The Ernie Kovacs shows were products of the time when television was in its infancy and experimentation was acceptable. It is doubtful that Ernie Kovacs would find a place on television today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps Jack Gould of The New York Times said it best for Ernie Kovacs: 'The fun was in trying'."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm|title=The Ernie Kovacs Show|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=September 5, 2010[/tpl]
Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacs' style. Laugh-In producer George Schlatter was married to actress Jolene Brand, who had appeared in Kovacs' comic troupes over the years and had been a frequent participant in his pioneering sketches. Laugh-In made frequent use of the quick blackout gags and surreal humor that marked many Kovacs projects. Another link was a young NBC staffer, Bill Wendell, Kovacs' usual announcer and sometimes a sketch participant. From 1980–95, Wendell was the announcer for David Letterman, whose show and style of humor were greatly influenced by Kovacs.
 

==The Music Man==

Kovacs loved music and its humor possibilities; he was also known for his eclectic musical taste. His main theme song was called "Oriental Blues" by Jack Newlon, which borrows heavily from "Rialto Ripples", a quirky piano number by George Gershwin. The rendition most often heard was a piano-driven trio version, but for his primetime show in 1956, music director Harry Sosnik presented a full-blown big band version.
The German song "Die Moritat von Mackie Messer" from The Threepenny Opera (later anglicized to the well-known "Mack the Knife"), frequently underscored his blackout routines. Robert Maxwell's "Solfeggio" became associated closely enough with the derby-hatted apes that it became better known among Kovacs admirers as "The Song of the Nairobi Trio."
An unusual treatment of "Sentimental Journey", by Mexican bandleader Juan García Esquivel, accompanied video of an empty office in which various items (pencil sharpeners, water coolers, wall clocks) come to life in rhythm with the music, a variation on several famous animations of a decade earlier. The original three-minute presentation was outlined by Kovacs in a four-page, single-spaced memo to his staff.  The perfectionist Kovacs can be seen by reading it, as he describes in minute detail what had to be done and how to do it. The memo ends with this: "I don't know how the hell you're going to get this done by Sunday – but 'rots of ruck." (signed) "Ernie (with love)".[tpl]Cite book|editor-last=Spigel|editor-first=Lynn|title=TV by design: modern art and the rise of network television|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=409|url=http://books.google.com/?id=q_dekIDkPtMC&pg=PA178&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|isbn=0-226-76968-2|accessdate=July 17, 2010|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Kovacs also made careful use of the shrill singer Leona Anderson—who had somewhat less than a classical (or even listenable) voice, by some estimations—in comic vignettes.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/andersonl.htm|title=Leona Anderson|publisher=Space Age Pop|accessdate=August 12, 2010[/tpl]
Kovacs used classical music as background for silent sketches or abstract visual routines, including "Concerto for Orchestra", by Béla Bartók; music from the opera "The Love of Three Oranges", by Sergei Prokofiev; the finale of Igor Stravinsky's suite "The Firebird"; and Richard Strauss' "Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks". He may have been best known for using Haydn's "String Quartet, Opus 3, Number 5" (the "Serenade," actually composed by Roman Hoffstetter), which was used in a series of 1960–61 commercials he created and videotaped for his sponsor, Dutch Masters.
For the show of May 22, 1959, Kovacs on Music, Kovacs began by saying, "I have never really understood classical music, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain it to others." Presented in the form of the gorilla version of Swan Lake which differed from the usual performance only in the persona of the dancers, giant paper clips moving to music and other sketches, Ernie's offerings showed his instinct for the classics and made them more comprehensible to his viewers.[tpl]Cite book|editor-last=Shepherdson|editor-first=K.

He also served as host on a jazz Album to benefit the American Cancer Society in 1957, Listening to Jazz with Ernie Kovacs. It was a 15-minute recording featuring some of the giants of the art, including pianists Jimmy Yancey and Bunk Johnson, soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet, guitarist Django Reinhardt, composer/pianist/bandleader Duke Ellington and longtime Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams.

Kovacs and Edie Adams were the guest stars on the final installment of the one-hour I Love Lucy format, known in network airings as The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show and in syndication as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour. Kovacs and Adams appeared in the episode, "Lucy Meets the Moustache," which filmed March 2 and aired April 1, 1960. It was the last time Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz appeared together before the breakup of their marriage.

Kovacs also appeared in roles on other television programs.  For General Electric Theater's "I Was a Bloodhound" in 1959, Kovacs played the role of detective Barney Colby, whose extraordinary sense of smell helped him solve many seemingly impossible cases.

In North to Alaska (1960), John Wayne's hairpiece flies off with the first punch of a fight with Kovacs as a con artist.
It is still rumored that Kovacs had been chosen to appear as Melville Crump in Stanley Kramer's star-packed comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, with Edie Adams portraying his wife, Monica Crump, and that after his death, the role went to comedian Sid Caesar. According to Adams, however, the rumor is unfounded. In a Sep 7, 2004 published interview with Steve Crum, she said, "That, I do not know," when asked if Ernie was slated to be in the movie. Kovacs had indeed been slated to appear with Jack Lemmon and Kim Novak in The Notorious Landlady but was posthumously replaced by Fred Astaire.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Personal life==

===First marriage===

Kovacs and his first wife, Bette Wilcox, were married on August 13, 1945. When the marriage ended, he fought for custody of their children, Elizabeth ("Bette") and Kip Raleigh ("Kippie"). The court awarded Kovacs full custody upon determining that his former wife was mentally unstable. The decision was extremely unusual at the time, setting a legal precedent. Wilcox subsequently kidnapped the children, taking them to Florida.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wiEhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3GQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1402,4911650&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Grandmother Again Held on Kidnapping|date=January 28, 1954|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=July 10, 2010[/tpl] After a long and expensive search, Kovacs regained custody.

Kovacs' first wife made a legal attempt to gain custody of her two daughters shortly after his death. She began August 2, 1962 by claiming $500,000 was her share of Kovacs' estate and charging her ex-husband had abducted the girls in 1955; Kovacs had been granted legal custody of his daughters in 1952.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IxMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fZwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1500,3856559&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Edie Adams Gets Club Property|date=July 26, 1962|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0RRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oTkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2080,5083867&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs' Widow and Divorced Wife in Custody Battle|date=August 4, 1962|publisher=St. Joseph News-Press|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] On August 30, Wilcox filed an affidavit claiming that Kovacs' widow, Edie Adams, the stepmother to the girls, was "unfit" to care for them.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y2gpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WMoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4822,36224&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Ex-Daytonian Files Charges in Child Case|date=September 1, 1962|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|accessdate=July 10, 2010[/tpl] Both daughters, Bette and Kippie, testified that they wanted to stay with their stepmother, Edie.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bOEiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JMwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4640,1198407&dq=bette+kovacs&hl=en|title=She Wants to Stay With Edie|date=September 8, 1962|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=November 12, 1962[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jbQrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5v4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3293,525574&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=In a Legal Tug of War|date=September 8, 1962|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sXYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1864,2363631&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=People in the News|date=September 9, 1962|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] Kippie's testimony was very emotional; in it she referred to Edie as "Mommy" and her birth mother as "the other lady."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tHYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6292,3510121&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Kovacs Girls Want Edie|date=September 12, 1962|publisher= Miami News|accessdate=July 10, 2010[/tpl] Upon hearing the verdict that the girls would remain in their home, Edie Adams broke down, saying, "This is what Ernie would have wanted.

===Second marriage===

Kovacs and his second wife, Edie Adams, met in 1951 when she was hired to work on his WPTZ show, Three To Get Ready. Her appearance on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts caught the eye of Kovacs' producer, and he asked her to audition for the program.  A classically trained singer, she was able to perform only three popular songs. Edie said later, "I sang them all during the audition, and if they had asked to hear another, I never would have made it."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/17/local/me-adams17|title=Tony award-winning actress, TV star|author=Thurber, Jon|date=October 17, 2008|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=August 16, 2010[/tpl] Quoting Kovacs, "I wish I could say I was the big shot that hired her, but it was my show in name only – the producer had all the say.

After the couple's first date, Kovacs proceeded to buy a Jaguar, telling Adams he wanted to take her out in style. He was seriously taken with the beautiful and talented young woman, courting her with imagination and flair.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6Q8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=syoMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1134,9683779&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=The Marquee: About Edith Adams|date=January 30, 1954|author=Kleiner, Dick|publisher=Gazette and Bulletin|accessdate=July 11, 2010[/tpl] Kovacs' attempts to win Adams' heart included hiring a mariachi band to serenade her backstage at the Broadway musical she was performing in and the sudden gift of a diamond engagement ring, telling her to wear it until she made up her mind.[tpl]Cite book | editor-last =Nachman|editor-first=Gerald|title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|year=2004|pages=659|publisher=Back Stage Books|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B_Yzl5uXacwC&pg=PA200&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false|isbn=0-8230-4786-5|accessdate=July 11, 2010 | postscript =[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Ernie continued this romantic quest after the show went out of town.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KCANAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lWoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6698,683999&dq=ernie+kovacs+adams&hl=en|title=On Broadway|author=Kilgallen, Dorothy|date=September 2, 1954|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=November 7, 2010[/tpl]
Adams booked a six-week European cruise which she hoped would let her make up her mind whether or not to marry Kovacs.

Adams also supported Kovacs' struggle to reclaim his two older children after the kidnapping by their mother. She also was a regular partner on his television shows. Kovacs usually introduced or addressed her in a businesslike way, as "Edith Adams". Adams was usually willing to do anything he envisioned, whether it was singing seriously, performing impersonations (including a well-regarded impression of Marilyn Monroe), or taking a pie in the face or a pratfall if and when needed. The couple had one daughter, Mia Susan Kovacs, born June 20, 1959.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KXhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Jz8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2325,4002722&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Littlest Star for the Kovacs|date=June 29, 1959|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=March 21, 2012[/tpl]

==Death==

Kovacs was killed in an automobile accident in Los Angeles in the early morning hours of January 13, 1962. Kovacs, who had worked for much of the evening, met his wife, Edie Adams, at a baby shower given by Billy Wilder for Milton Berle and his wife, who had recently adopted a three-year old boy. The couple left the party in separate cars.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HSMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vFgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6745,1128022&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en |title=Comedian Ernie Kovacs Is Killed in Traffic Accident |date=January 14, 1962 |publisher=Victoria Advocate |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 26, 2013[/tpl] After a light southern California rainstorm, Kovacs lost control of his Chevrolet Corvair station wagon while turning fast, and crashed into a power pole at the corner of Beverly Glen and Santa Monica Boulevards. He was thrown halfway out the passenger side, dying almost instantly from chest and head injuries.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cl4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rU4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7413,3280246&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en |title=Show World Mourns Death of Kovacs |date=January 14, 1962 |publisher=Pittsburgh Press |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 26, 2013[/tpl]

An official cupped his hand over the receiver, saying to a colleague, "It's Mrs. Kovacs, he's on his way to the coroner – what should I tell her?" With that, Edie Adams's fears were confirmed, and she became inconsolable. Jack Lemmon, who also attended the Berle party, identified Kovacs' body at the morgue because Adams was too distraught to do so.
After attending funerals for Hollywood friends, Kovacs had expressed his wishes to Adams that any funeral services for him be kept simple. In keeping with his request, Adams made arrangements for Presbyterian services held at the Beverly Hills Community Presbyterian Church.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I-cuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aTEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6332,4303182&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Hollywood Pays Its Final Respects to Ernie Kovacs|date=January 16, 1962|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|accessdate=August 6, 2010[/tpl] The active pallbearers were Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Billy Wilder, Mervyn Leroy, and Joe Mikolas.

==Tax evasion==

A frequent critic of the U.S. tax system, Kovacs owed the IRS several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes, thanks to his simple refusal to pay the bulk of them. Up to 90% of his earnings were garnished as a result. His long battles with the IRS inspired Kovacs to tie up his money in a convoluted series of paper corporations in the U.S. and Canada. He would give them bizarre names, such as "The Bazooka Dooka Hicka Hocka Hookah Company" to thumb his nose at the government.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/JoeMikolas.html|title=Conversations with Joe Mikolas|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] In 1961, Kovacs was served with a $75,000 lien for back taxes; that same day he bought the California Racquet Club with the apparent hope of being able to use it as a tax write-off.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YGcUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EgEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5928,847085&dq=ernie+kovacs+california&hl=en|title=The Lyons Den|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=July 8, 1961|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] The property had mortgages at the time of purchase which were later paid by Edie Adams.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FT4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7012,2583035&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Edie Adams Once Advised Ernie To Forego Deals Until Return|author=Lyons, Leonard|date=August 6, 1962|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=October 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJA0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=edUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3199,1903667&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=A New World for Edie Adams|date=November 18, 1962|publisher=Gadsden Times|author=Ryan, Jack|accessdate=October 15, 2010[/tpl]

He also filmed an unaired 1962 pilot episode for a proposed CBS series, Medicine Man (co-starring Buster Keaton, pilot episode titled "A Pony For Chris"). Kovacs' role was that of Dr. P. Crookshank, a traveling medicine salesman in the 1870s selling Mother McGreevy's Wizard Juice, also known as "man's best friend in a bottle".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=szoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4CYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4585,4182020&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|date=February 8, 1962|author=Spiro, J.

Some of the issues regarding Kovacs' tax problems were still unresolved years after his death.  Ernie had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961.  To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. In early 1966 their ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: "Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done Mary Kovacs."[tpl]cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/355/355.F2d.349.19953_1.html|title=Mary KOVACS, Appellant, v.

==Lost and surviving work==

Most of Kovacs' early television work was done live and has survived only in the form of a very few short film clips or kinescopes. Some videotapes of his ABC specials were preserved; others, such as his quirky game show,  Take a Good Look, exist only in short videotape segments. After his death, Edie Adams discovered not only that her husband owed ABC a lot of money, but also that some networks were systematically erasing and reusing tapes of Kovacs' shows or literally dumping the kinescopes and videotapes in New York Bay. She succeeded in buying the rights to the surviving footage and tapes with the proceeds from Kovacs' insurance policy and with her own earnings after Kovacs' IRS debts were paid.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/19980801roddy.asp|title=Edie Hits a High Note|author=Roddy, Dennis|date=August 1, 1998|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rZkiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y6oFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2689,7886996&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Edie Adams Arranges Ernie Kovacs' Special|author=Thomas, Bob|date=March 27, 1968|publisher=Sumter Daily Item|accessdate=July 16, 2010[/tpl] Most of Kovacs' salvaged work is available to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles Library's Department of Special Collections, and there is also some material available at both locations of the Paley Center for Media.[tpl]Cite web| last =Adams| first =Edie| authorlink =Edie Adams| coauthors =| title =Television/Video Preservation Study: Los Angeles Public Hearing| work =National Film Preservation Board| publisher =Library of Congress| date =March 6, 1996| url =http://www.loc.gov/film/pdfs/tvadams.pdf| doi =| accessdate =July 10, 2010[/tpl] (PDF)[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft729006px|title=Finding Aid for the Ernie Kovacs Papers|publisher=Online Archive of California|accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection?advanced=1&q=ernie+kovacs&c=all&f=all&x=13&y=12|title=Ernie Kovacs Collection|publisher=Paley Center for Media|accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl]

The 1984 television movie, Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter, helped return Kovacs to the public eye, though the focus was on his bid to retrieve his kidnapped children instead of his professional life. Edie Adams appeared in a cameo in this film, playing Mae West; it was one of the impressions she performed in shows with Kovacs.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15987/Ernie-Kovacs-Between-the-Laughter/overview|title=Movies-Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter|year=1984|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 11, 2010 | first=Stephen | last=Farber|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGMgwrPV|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7159,3233920&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Edie Adams Has Part in Kovacs Revival|date=May 14, 1984|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=July 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vCYzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tuoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=868,5670260&dq=edith+adams+kovacs&hl=en|title=Ernie Kovacs Vegas Star|date=November 29, 1957|author=Wilson, Earl|publisher=Miami News|accessdate=July 11, 2010[/tpl] Telecasts of edited compilations of some of his work by PBS (station WTTW, Chicago) under the title The Best of Ernie Kovacs in 1977, inspired the film.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ObU0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=y2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3234,7194044&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Old Ernie Kovacs Films Returning|author=Sharbutt, Jay|date=June 5, 1976|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl] These broadcasts are still available in a five volume VHS or two disc DVD set (released in 1992 and 2000 respectively); since these are out of print copies usually have to be acquired used. The DVD set features extras that are not in the VHS set.   The series, which was narrated by Ernie's close friend Jack Lemmon, was distributed by Kultur Films (formerly White Star Video).
In the early 1990s, The Comedy Channel broadcast a series of Kovacs' shows under the generic title of The Ernie Kovacs Show. The package included both the ABC specials and some of his 1950s shows from NBC. By 2008, there were no broadcast, cable, or satellite channels airing any of Kovacs' television work, other than his panel appearances on What's My Line? on the Game Show Network.
On April 19, 2011 Shout! Factory released The Ernie Kovacs Collection, six DVDs with over 13 hours of material spanning Kovacs' television career. The company's website also offers an extra disc with material from Tonight! and The Ernie Kovacs Show, as well as a rare color kinescope of the complete 30-minute, 1957 NBC color broadcast featuring "Eugene".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257356|title=Ernie Kovacs Collection|publisher=Shout Factory|accessdate=January 12, 2011[/tpl] On October 23, 2012, Shout!

In 1961, Kovacs recorded a record album of poetry in the character of Percy Dovetonsils called Percy Dovetonsils Thpeath, but was unable to release it due to contractual obligations with other record companies. After he was given the masters, Kovacs donated them to a Los Angeles area hospital.  Edie Adams was able to re-acquire the tapes in 1967, and they remained part of her private collection until her death in 2008. The tapes were labeled as film material and were thought to be such until further examination proved they were Kovacs as Percy reading his poems with no music background. Percy's poetry was finally released in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/percy-dovetonsilsthpeaks-mw0002371641|title=Percy Dovetonsils Thpeakth|author=Kovacs, Ernie|publisher=Omnivore|year=2012|accessdate=September 8, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/04/5782320/prescient-avant-garde-comedy-ernie-kovacs-and-edie-adams-recovered-c|title=The prescient, avant-garde comedy of Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams, recovered classics of early television|author=Matos, Michaelangelo|date=April 27, 2012|publisher=Capital New York|accessdate=September 8, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/percy_d.html|title=Perthy Dovetonthils Thpeakth|publisher=erniekovacs.info|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html|title=Ernie Kovacs-WPTZ|year=2005|publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia|accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl]
