==History==

The Kangerong Road District (adjoining Port Phillip) was created on 14 October 1862. The Flinders Road District, on the east of the peninsula, was created on 15 December 1868. They united to become the Shire of Flinders & Kangerong on 24 December 1874, which was renamed Flinders on 28 January 1914. On 19 October 1960, part of the Eastern Riding was transferred to the new Shire of Hastings, which had split from the Shire of Frankston.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=673â€“674[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. 
On 15 December 1994, the Shire of Flinders was abolished, and, along with the Shires of Hastings and Shire of Mornington and parts of the City of Frankston, was merged into the newly created Shire of Mornington Peninsula.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=10|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] The Age reported in July 1994 that the result had been supported by Hastings and Mornington councils from the beginning, but opposed by Flinders, which wanted to merge with the southern coastal section of Hastings.[tpl]cite news|title=Crunch time for councils in south and south-east|last=Neales|first=Sue|date=27 July 1994|page=8|work=The Age[/tpl]
