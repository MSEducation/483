===Boston City Council===

In 2005, Yoon became the first person in the history of Boston municipal elections to win an at-large council seat on the first attempt. Yoon won despite having lived in the city only for one year prior to his run. After placing 5th in the preliminary election, Yoon received 14.96% of the vote in the general election, placing third among eight candidates for four positions.http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7927882.html Yoon's election was hailed by the local media as an important sign of the emergence of "New Boston", in which the city's traditional insider politics are becoming less important than before.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
In his first term, he was praised for his efforts to secure $5 million in funding for programs to prevent youth violence. As a result of Yoon's efforts, hundreds of students rallied in the City Council Chambers during the 2006 budget hearing in support of the funding increases. When the measure was rejected and the students were expelled from the Chambers, Yoon voted against the budget. He also voted in favor of a salary increase for government employees, which he said would make positions more desirable for qualified candidates. The increase, which passed, included raising City Councilors' salaries from $75,000 to $87,500. Critics alleged that he did not regularly attend Wednesday Council meetings.[tpl]cite news |title=Boston's First Asian Councilor: 8 Months Later |work=Sampan |date=September 1, 2006 |first=M. |last=Thang |url=http://sampan.org/show_article.php?display=774&PHPSESSID=9d767f4a70da92e[/tpl]

===2009 Boston mayoral campaign===

On February 8, 2009, Yoon announced he would be running for Mayor of Boston.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/02/yoon_announces.html |title=Yoon announces candidacy for mayor |first=John C. |last=Drake |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 8, 2009 [/tpl]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J-yK0Eyx6o
Yoon ran on a platform that claimed transparency and accountability at City Hall. He proposed eliminating the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), an organization responsible for planning and development in Boston, and replacing it with community-focused development agency.http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1179165&srvc=next_article Yoon also proposed overhauling Boston’s transportation infrastructure, advocating a plan that would increase bike accessibility and would promote rapid transit.http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/sam-yoon-running-for-mayor-in-boston-on-transportation-reform-agenda.php
Yoon’s consultants include: Jim Spencer, of the Campaign Network, a direct mail specialist who was the chief strategist on Yoon’s city council runs; Jeff Hewitt, a media specialist who was his lead fundraising consultant; Joe Trippi, a social networking specialist who was the former campaign manager for Howard Dean's Presidential Campaign. Yoon’s pollster was Tom Kiley, who previously worked for Deval Patrick and Joe Kennedy.
Yoon’s strategy was to mobilize progressive voters in Boston who may have voted for Deval Patrick and Barack Obama, but who do not participate in municipal elections, which traditionally have low turnout.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/07/19/flaherty_yoon_pin_hopes_on_new_voters/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Flaherty, Yoon pin hopes on new voters | first=Eric | last=Moskowitz | date=July 19, 2009[/tpl]  On July 11, Yoon’s campaign had a volunteer recruitment session with Joe Trippi which detailed Yoon’s strategy for winning.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/07/12/yoon_ushers_in_new_wave_of_volunteers/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Yoon ushers in new wave of volunteers | first=Eric | last=Moskowitz | date=July 12, 2009[/tpl]
Yoon placed third among four candidates in the September 22nd primary, receiving 21.16% of the vote. Only the top two finishers advance to the general election.  After the election, second place finisher Michael Flaherty and Yoon announced they had teamed up with Yoon becoming an unofficial running mate to Flaherty, with Flaherty promising to appoint Yoon "deputy mayor" if he won. The City of Boston government charter does not officially include a position of deputy mayor. What Yoon as deputy mayor might have done, including how he might have been paid, was never officially announced.  Critics charged that this was a cheap political move by Flaherty designed to bring in minority and other voters that might not otherwise vote in the general electoral. Others praised it as a savvy strategic decision to bring more inclusiveness to City Hall.http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1201854[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/09/29/yoon_reported_ready_to_join_flaherty_team_as_deputy_mayor/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Yoon is joining Flaherty as deputy | first=Michael | last=Levenson | date=September 29, 2009[/tpl]
Michael Flaherty and his unofficial running mate Sam Yoon went on to lose to incumbent Mayor Thomas Menino in the November 3 general election with 42.43% to Menino's 57.27%.
