</ref> Earthworks were not completed until December 1958, with the extra [[railway platform|platforms]] at Willison, [[Burwood, Victoria|Burwood]] and [[Riversdale Road, Melbourne|Riversdale]] also under way, track work being complete by October 1954.<ref name="oc67"/> The first [tpl]convert|2.2|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long stage opened on 7 November 1954, from Hartwell to Ashburton stations, followed by the [[Double track|duplication]] and automatic signalling of the [tpl]convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Riversdale to Hartwell section on 31 July 1955. From 15 July 1955, [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]] station ceased to be a regular terminus.<ref name="elect85" /> 
However reduced loan funds for railway construction during 1955 and 1956 delayed the rest of the works, with the overpass and new line at Camberwell finally commissioned on 29 November 1959. The last stage of the works had to wait until 8 November 1962 when automatic signalling was introduced between Hartwell and Ashburton, and the signal bay at Hartwell station closed.
On 30 November 1959, off-peak services on the line were cut to 20 minutes during the day and about 35 minutes at night, and on 23 October 1961, the Saturday frequency was cut to every 40 minutes. From 26 February 1968 Alamein trains ran at 23 minute frequencies during working hours, otherwise every 46 minutes. A one car Tait train took over the service on Sundays, the train guard selling tickets as station staff were withdrawn from every station except Ashburton, which remained open for safeworking reasons. From 9 July 1972, the service was cut to every hour on Sundays, and from 10 December 1973 it was changed to 20 minutes during the day and every 40 minutes at night and on Saturday afternoons. Through trains to Flinders Street off-peak were provided from 20 January 1975 at a frequency of every 15 minutes Monday to Friday, with Box Hill trains running express from Camberwell.
Although moves were made to close the line or convert it to light rail in the 1980s, the Alamein line has remained open. 
The line was also the first in the city to receive new Metlink-branded signage, including the new, blue colour code for the train network, and signs directing passengers to connecting tram and bus services.
