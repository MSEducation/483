He continued the same schedule for EVI in 2002 making 13 races out of 25 improving on last season but scored just one top 20 finish at Fort Worth. He ran the first 2 races of 2003 for EVI with a 16th at Daytona and a 15th at Darlington.

Stan Boyd made his Busch Series debut at Dover in 2003 for MacDonald Motorsports starting 32nd and finishing 23rd, 5 laps down. It was his only start of the year.
Boyd moved full time to the Busch Series in 2004 with Ware Racing Enterprises. He attempted Daytona with the team's second car, the #57 with Kevin Conway as his teammate in the #51. Both failed to qualify. Boyd would not make another attempt until Darlington which he made where he suffered engine failure early on, finishing 41st. 
Boyd moved over to the #51 at Bristol with Morgan Shepherd taking over the #57. Boyd qualified 33rd and finished a solid 25th, 4 laps down. He failed to make the next two races and then Kim Crosby ran the car at Talladega. Boyd then made California but coming into the pits he spun knocking two tires into his own pit crew. He finished 38th. Boyd then finished 32nd after engine failure at Gateway. Shepherd ran the #51 at Richmond with Travis Powell running at Nazareth. Boyd returned at Charlotte making the field but Joe Gibbs Racing bought them out and placed J. J. Yeley who failed to qualify, in the car. Boyd made the field at Dover but crashed out on lap 34 finishing 38th. David Eshleman ran the #51 at Nashville but Boyd returned at Kentucky finishing last after parking the car on lap 2.
With Bobby Dotter, Kim Crosby and Blake Mallory running the next three races, Boyd did not see another race until New Hampshire, but he had to park the car on lap 17 as fundings were decreasing. Boyd moved back to the #57 with Crosby running the #51 at Pike's Peak. Both would start and park on lap 11. Boyd then got to run the whole Indianapolis Raceway Park race in the #57 finishing 27th, 4 laps down. Boyd then left Ware Racing to join MacDonald Motorsports.
His career with the MacDonald team began at California where he ran a backup car, the #71. He parked on lap 10 finishing 38th. He did not attempt any more races until Kansas where he failed to qualify. At Memphis Boyd ran a third car, the #70 but again failed to qualify. Boyd got to run the team's main #72 car for the final two races of the season finishing a solid 26th just three laps down at Darlington. At Homestead-Miami he finished 32nd, four laps down. However he wasn't kept on for 2005.
