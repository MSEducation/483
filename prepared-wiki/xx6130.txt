In antiquity, the Dardanian Kingdom, and later Roman province of Dardania was located in the region. It was part of Serbia in the Middle Ages, during which time many important Serbian Orthodox Christian monasteries, some of which are now UNESCO World Heritage sites, were built.
Many consider the Battle of Kosovo of 1389 to be a defining moment in Serbian medieval history and identity. In the 15th century, the region was conquered by the Muslim Ottoman Empire and remained under Ottoman rule for almost five centuries.
Kosovo again found itself within the Serbian state when it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia as a result of Ottoman defeat in the First Balkan War (1912–13). After a period of Yugoslav unitarianism in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the post-World War II Yugoslav constitution established the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (Serbian: Аутономна Покрајина Косово и Метохија, Autonomna Pokrajina Kosovo i Metohija) within the Yugoslav constituent republic of Serbia.It is still so regarded by Serbia (as declared in the 2006 Constitution of Serbia[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/site/dynamics/N_Opinion_ef.asp?L=E&OID=405 |title=Documents by Opinion and Study |publisher=Venice.coe.int |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl]
Long-term severe ethnic tensions between Kosovo's Albanian and Serb populations have left Kosovo ethnically divided, resulting in inter-ethnic violence, including the Kosovo War of 1999.Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship, New York: The United Nations University, 2001. Pp. 20. The war ended with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accepting that it would give up the exercise of its sovereignty pending a final status settlement. Under UNSCR 1244, governance passed to the United Nations in 1999.
In 2008, the Republic of Kosovo (Albanian: Republika e Kosovës; Serbian: Република Косово, Republika Kosovo) declared itself an independent state. It has control over most of the territory and has partial international recognition.[tpl]cite news|title=INTERVIEW-Kosovo warns Serbia seeking partition of north|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/interview-kosovo-warns-serbia-seeking-partition-of-north/|accessdate=21 December 2011|newspaper=trust.org|date=4 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Govt. has "insufficient control in northern Kosovo"|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=12&dd=18&nav_id=77858|accessdate=21 December 2011|newspaper=B92.net|date=18 December 2011[/tpl] North Kosovo, the largest Serb enclave, is administered locally with parallel structures which observe the institutions of the Republic of Serbia.[tpl]cite news | title= Merkel says wants 'no parallel structures in Kosovo' | publisher= Reuters Canada | date= 19 December 2011 | url= http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE7BI0S820111219 | quote= Serbia refuses to recognize it and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, who dominate in a small slice of the north, continue to function as part of Serbia.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Minister: We will not leave northern Kosovo|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=12&dd=22&nav_id=77920|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=B92|date=22 December 2011[/tpl] Serbia does not recognise the secession of KosovoStaff (23 July 2010) "Serbia rejects UN legal ruling on Kosovo's secession" BBC News and considers it a UN-governed entity within its sovereign territory, a position supported by a number of other countries.

==Background==

Kosovo is landlocked and is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia to the south, Albania to the west and Montenegro to the northwest. The remaining line of demarcation is the subject of controversy — seen by proponents of Kosovar independence as the Kosovo-Serbia border and seen by opponents of the independence as the boundary between Central Serbia and an autonomous Kosovo, both within Serbia. The largest city and the capital of Kosovo is Pristina (alternatively spelled Prishtina or Priština), while other cities include Peć (Albanian: Peja), Prizren, Đakovica (Gjakova), and Kosovska Mitrovica (Mitrovica). Nominally, the name of Kosovo has come to represent a number of different entities over the centuries and its borders have subsequently altered. There have also been periods when no political entity has existed with the name of Kosovo. Today's outline dates back to 1946, with minor changes in 1953 (Lešak, Belo Brdo, Vračevo, Berberište).
During classical antiquity, the territory roughly corresponding to present-day Kosovo was part of several tribal alliances, including that formed by the Dardani.Pannonia and Upper Moesia. A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire, A Mocsy. Pages, 9, 26, 65 Upon conquest, the Romans dissolved existing tribal alliances and re-integrated communities centred on Roman civitates as part of the Roman province of Moesia Superior. Subdivisions in Late Roman times created the region of "Dardania". After the collapse of Roman control, the region was contested among the Avars, Sklavenes and Byzantines, and later among the Byzantines, Bulgarians and Serbs.
The name and the region Kosovo first appears as part of a newly created region within an expanded Serbian medieval state, and soon became its ecclesiastical and secular centre; the region was subsequently enshrined by the Serbs as the cradle of their national identity.Cirkovic. The Serbs. p. 50: "The shift was more apparent to the south, at first, symbolised by the transfer of the Serbian archbishops from Zica to Pec....The rulers attached themselves to a complex of castles ..around a lake in Kosovo, Prizren, and Skopje."[tpl]cite book|last=Latawski, Smith|first=Paul Chester, Martin A. |title=The Kosovo Crisis and the Evolution of Post-Cold War European Security|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press| isbn=978-0-7190-5981-0| page=4| url=http://books.google.com/?id=mHB7DKYDBKUC&pg=PA4&dq=kosovo+cradle#v=onepage&q=kosovo%20cradle&f=false[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title= The road to war in Serbia: trauma and catharsis |author=Nebojša Popov|coauthors= Drinka Gojković |publisher=Central European University Press |year= 2000 |page= 32 |isbn=9789639116566 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC |ref= harv [/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title= The Kosovo crisis and the evolution of post-Cold War European security |author=Paul Chester Latawski, Martin A.

Islam was introduced to the population. During the late 19th century, Kosovo was the centre of the Albanian national awakening and the battlefield of the Albanian revolts of 1843–44, 1910 and 1912. In 1912, the Ottoman province was divided between Montenegro and Serbia, both of which became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, subsequently the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918. During World War II, the majority of Kosovo was part of Italian-occupied Albania, followed by a Nazi German occupation before becoming an autonomous province of SR Serbia under the 1946 Yugoslav Constitution.
After the Kosovo War and the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the territory came under the interim administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), most of whose roles were assumed by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) in December 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7772548.stm |title=EU launches Kosovo police mission |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=6 November 2011[/tpl] In February 2008 representatives of the people of Kosovo, acting outside the UNMIK's PISG framework (not representing the Assembly of Kosovo or any other of these institutions),The identity of the authors of the declaration of independence, ICJ ruling, par.102–109 declared Kosovo's independence as the Republic of Kosovo.

==Name==

Kosovo ([tpl]lang-sr-cyr|Косово[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sr|kôsoʋo|[/tpl]) is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of kos (кос) "blackbird","The name Kosovo". Dr John-Peter Maher, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics, Northeastern Illinois University an ellipsis for Kosovo Polje, 'blackbird field', the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field. The name of the field was applied to an Ottoman province created in 1864.
The region currently known as "Kosovo" became an administrative region in 1946, as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. In 1974, the compositional "Kosovo and Metohija" was reduced to a simple "Kosovo" in the name of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, but in 1990 the region was renamed the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The entire region is commonly referred to in English simply as Kosovo and in Albanian as [tpl]lang|sq|Kosova[/tpl] (definite form, [tpl]IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːva|[/tpl]) or [tpl]lang|sq|Kosovë[/tpl] ("indefinite" form, [tpl]IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːv|[/tpl]). In Serbia, a distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term [tpl]lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|sr|Косово[/tpl]) is used for the eastern part, while the western part is called Metohija ([tpl]lang|sr|Метохија[/tpl]).

==History==

===Early history===

During antiquity, the area which now makes up Kosovo was inhabited by various tribal ethnic groups, who were liable to move, enlarge, fuse and fissure with neighbouring groups. As such, it is difficult to locate any such group with precision. The Dardani, whose exact ethno-linguistic affiliation is difficult to determine, were a prominent group in the region during the late Hellenistic and early Roman eras.N G Hammond, The Kingdoms of Illyria c. 400 – 167 BC. Collected Studies, Vol 2, 1993Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, Page 85, "... Whether the Dardanians were an Illyrian or a Thracian people has been much debated and one view suggests that the area was originally populated with Thracians who [tpl]sic|?|where[/tpl] then exposed to direct contact with illyrians over a long period...""the Dardanians ... living in the frontiers of the Illyrian and the Thracian worlds retained their individuality and, alone among the peoples of that region succeeded in maintaining themselves as an ethnic unity even when they were militarily and politically subjected by the Roman arms ... and when at the end of the ancient world, the Balkans were involved in far-reaching ethnic perturbations, the Dardanians, of all the Central Balkan tribes, played the greatest part in the genesis of the new peoples who took the place of the old" The central Balkan tribes in pre-Roman times: Triballi, Autariatae, Dardanians, Scordisci and Moesians, Amsterdam 1978, by Fanula Papazoglu, ISBN 90-256-0793-4, page 131.
The area was then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and incorporated into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of 'barbarian' raids from the 4th century AD onwards, culminating with the so-called Slavic migrations of the 6th to 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record,F Curta. The Making of the Slavs. Pg 189 and whatever was left of the native provincial population fused with the Sklavene colonists.The Illyrians. A Stipcevic. Noyes Press. Pg 76 the Slavs merged with these people (the Illyrians), thus preserving in their own identity remains of ancient Illyrians
The subsequent political and demographic history of Kosovo is not known with absolute certainty until c. 13th century AD. Archaeological findings suggest that there was steady population recovery and progression of the Slavic culture seen elsewhere throughout the Balkans. The region was absorbed into the Bulgarian Empire in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018, and became part of the newly established Theme of Bulgaria. As the centre of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, the region often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of Rascia conquered it definitively by the end of the 12th century.John Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late 12th Century to the Ottoman Conquest (1994), pg. 7: "the Hungarian attack launched in 1183 with which Nemanja was allied...was able to conquer Kosovo and Metohija, including Prizren." An insight into the region is provided by the Byzantine historian-princess, Anna Comnena, who wrote of "Serbs" being the main inhabitants of the region (referring to it as "eastern Dalmatia" and the "former Moesia Superior").Anne Comnène, Alexiade – Règne de l'Empereur Alexis I Comnène 1081–1118, texte etabli et traduit par B. Leib, Paris 1937–1945, II, 147–148, 157, 166, 184 The earliest references to an Albanian population is derived from late 11th-century Byzantine chroniclers, who consistently located the Arber around the hinterland districts of Dyrrachium, modern Durrës.The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins.

The zenith of Serbian power was reached in 1346, with the formation of the Serbian Empire. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo became a political and spiritual centre of the Serbian Kingdom. In the late 13th century, the seat of the Serbian Archbishopric was moved to Pec, and rulers centred themselves between Prizren and Skopje,Denis P Hupchik. The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Page 93 "Dusan.. established his new state primate's seat at Pec (Ipek), in Kosovo" during which time thousands of Christian monasteries and feudal-style forts and castles were erected.Bieber, Pg 12 When the Serbian Empire fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities in 1371, Kosovo became the hereditary land of the House of Branković. In the late 14th and the 15th centuries parts of Kosovo, the easternmost area of which was located near Pristina, were part of the Principality of Dukagjini, which was later incorporated an anti-Ottoman federation of all Albanian principalities, the League of Lezhë.[tpl]cite book|last=Sellers|first=Mortimer|title=The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9Rx7_KyUp7cC&pg=PA207|accessdate=2 February 2011|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-3748-0|page=207[/tpl]

By 1455, it was finally and fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire.New York Times

===Ottoman Kosovo (1455–1912)===

Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the eyalet of Rumelia, and from 1864 as a separate province (vilayet). During this time, Islam was introduced to the population. The Vilayet of Kosovo was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the Sandžak region cutting into present-day Šumadija and Western Serbia and Montenegro along with the Kukës municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern Albania and also parts of north-western Macedonia with the city of Skopje (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day Republic of Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as Štip (İştip), Kumanovo (Kumanova) and Kratovo (Kratova).
The Serbian position is that archives reveal an overwhelming Serbian demographic majority in Kosovo, which was reversed by the end of Ottoman rule, as Banac summarised: "Ottoman raids, plunder, slaving forays, as well as the general devastation caused by constant wars uprooted large numbers of Serbs even before the Great Serb Migration".[tpl]harvtxt|Banac|p=42[/tpl] This was followed by the transplantation of Albanian pastoralists from the highlands of Albania to the fertile valleys of Kosovo. However, Anscombe highlights that the most common archives – those derived from the Ottomans – do not clarify unequivocally the 'ethnic' character of the region's inhabitants, because the Ottomans classified their subjects along religious lines (millets).Anscombe, Frederick F. (2006). "The Ottoman empire in recent international politics – II: the case of Kosovo", The International History Review 28 (4) 758–793. Anscombe suggests that records show that the demography of Kosovo was very much mixed, and that both Serbian and Albanian ethnic groups dominated at different times. Moreover, they seem to indicate more cases of Albanians rebelling than any other ethnicity in the region. Mainstream historiography clarifies that "there is no conclusive evidence that a people unambiguously identifiable as "Albanian" constituted the majority of the population in Kosovo prior to the Ottoman occupation". Even the relatively "pro-Albanian" history written by Noel Malcolm concedes that "the region probably had a predominantly Orthodox Christian and Slavic population from the eight to the mid-nineteenth centuries".The Balkans: A Post-Communist History, I Jeffries, R Bideleux. 2007. Pg 513 Allowing for the possibility of some connection between the region's inhabitants prior to successive Slavic/ Serbian inflows, the Albanians who 'returned' to Kosovo in modern times were certainly not the same people, having intermarried extensively with Vlachs, Slavs, Greeks and Turks.Bideleux, pg 513 Whilst there is little evidence of ethnic Albanian institutional presence in medieval Kosovo, they were often baptised into Orthodox Christianity and subjected to a process of "Serbianisation".Bideleux. Pg 514 Prior to Islamification, the Albanians might have existed as pastoralists inhabiting Balkan highland areas, like the Vlachs, engaging in a symbiotic existence with the predominantly agricultural Slavs who inhabited the valleys and plains.Understanding the War in Kosovo, Pg 12
Kosovo, like Serbia, was occupied by Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683–1699,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html |title=WHKMLA: Habsburg-Ottoman War, 1683–1699 |publisher=Zum.de |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] but the Ottomans re-established their rule of the region. Such acts of assistance by the Austrian Empire (then arch-rivals of the Ottoman Empire), or Russia, were always abortive or temporary at best.Cirkovic. Pg 115 Prior to the final conquest, the Turks often took inhabitants as slaves, frequently to Asia Minor In 1690, the Serbian Patriarch of Peć Arsenije III apparently led a group of 30 or 40 thousand people from Kosovo to the Christian north.The Serbs, Sima Cirkovic. Blackwell Publishing. Pg 144 Patriarch Arsenije III claimed that 30,000 people followed him (on another occasion the figure was 40, 000)Anscombe In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the Patriarchate of Peć and the position of Christians in Kosovo further deteriorated,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] including full imposition of jizya (taxation of non-Muslims).
Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamicisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Sar range).Fine (1994), p. 51.: "The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century. However, organized in tribes under their own chieftains, the Albanians dominated the mountains of most of what we today think of as Albania."  Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo,Cirkovic. Pg 244 "In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since the Middle Ages with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamicisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control." as well as northwestern Macedonia, although some might have been autochthonous to the region.[tpl]harvtxt|Banac|p=46[/tpl] However, Banac favours the idea that the main settlers of the time were Vlachs.[tpl]harvtxt|Banac|p=42[/tpl]
Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government; 42 Grand Viziers of the Empire were Albanian in origin, including Mehmet Akif Ersoy (1873–1936), an Albanian from Peć who in 1921 composed  "İstiklâl Marşı" (The Independence March), the Turkish National Anthem."Kosovo" (Bradt Travel Guide), by Gail Warrander (Author), Verena Knaus (Author), ISBN 1-84162-199-4; ISBN 978-1-84162-199-9, Publisher: Bradt Travel Guides; 1st edition (1 January 2008) As Hupchik states, "Albanians had little cause of unrest" and "if anything, grew important in Ottoman internal affairs",The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism, Dennis Hupchik and sometimes persecuted Christians harshly on behalf of their Turkish masters.
In the 19th century, there was an awakening of ethnic nationalism throughout the Balkans. The underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians. The ethnic Albanian nationalism movement was centred in Kosovo. In 1878 the League of Prizren ([tpl]lang-sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit[/tpl]) was formed. This was a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights,Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know by Tim Judah, Publisher Oxford University Press, US, 2008 ISBN 0-19-537673-0, ISBN 978-0-19-537673-9 page 36 although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire.Cirkovic. Pg 244 "Since Islamicised Albanians represented a significant portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily." The Balkan League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a national identity among Albanians.George Gawlrych, The Crescent and the Eagle, (Palgrave/Macmilan, London, 2006), ISBN 1-84511-287-3 Albanian ambitions competed with those of the Serbs. The Kingdom of Serbia wished to incorporate this land that had formerly been within its empire.

===20th century===

Kosovo's history during the 20th century has largely been characterised by wars and major population exchanges. The region formed a part of numerous entities, some internationally recognised, others not.

====Balkan Wars====

The Young Turk movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after a coup in 1912 which disposed of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire. An allegiance to Ottomanism was promoted instead.Erik Zurcher, Ottoman sources of Kemalist thought, (New York, Routledge, 2004), Page. 19. An Albanian uprising in 1912 exposed the empire's northern territories in Kosovo and Novi Pazar, which led to an invasion by the Kingdom of Montenegro. The Ottomans suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Albanians in 1912, culminating in the Ottoman loss of most of its Albanian-inhabited lands. The Albanians threatened to march all the way to Salonika and reimpose Abdul Hamid.Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1998), Page 248.
A wave of Albanians in the Ottoman army ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. Two months later in September of the same year, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most of their European possessions.
The rise of nationalism unfortunately hampered relations between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, due to influence from Russians, Austrians and Ottomans.[ref]See: Isa Blumi, Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and Political History of Albania and Yemen, 1878–1918

So the population of Serbs in Kosovo fell after World War II, but it had increased considerably before then.Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1995)
An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society.Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur, Ramesh (eds). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship. New York: The United Nations University, 2001. p. 20. Numerous colonist Serb families moved into Kosovo, equalising the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

====First World War and birth of Kingdom of Yugoslavia====

In the winter of 1915–16, during World War I, Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary.
In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the Central Powers out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians on 1 December 1918.
Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia (Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Raška and Zeta. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the Banate of Zeta, the Banate of Morava and the Banate of Vardar.
In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.
Albanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.Daskalovski, Židas.

====Second World War====

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.Malcolm, Noel Kosovo: A Short History, p.312 An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian.[tpl]cite book| last = Frank| first = Chaim| editor1-last = Petersen| editor1-first = Hans-Christian| editor2-last = Salzborn| editor2-first = Samuel| year = 2010| title = Antisemitism in Eastern Europe: History and Present in Comparison| publisher = Peter Lang| location = Bern| isbn = 978-3-631-59828-3| url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|pp=97–98[/tpl] It is not disputed that between 1941 and 1945 tens of thousands of Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo. Estimates range from 30,000 to 100,000.Malcolm, Noel, Kosovo: A Short History, p.313 There had been large-scale Albanian immigration from Albania to Kosovo which is by some scholars estimated in the range from 72,000[tpl]Citation |last=Vickers |first= Miranda |title=Between Serb and Albanian : a history of Kosovo |url= http://books.google.rs/books?ei=FAdKUNmRCJHitQb-p4DADA&id=S41pAAAAMAAJ&dq=inauthor%3A%22Miranda+Vickers%22&q=%22encouraged+an+extensive%22#search_anchor |year= 1998 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |page= |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=The Italian occupation force encouraged an extensive settlement programme involving up to 72,000 Albanians from Albania in Kosovo[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ramet|2006|p=141[/tpl] to 260,000 people (with a tendency to escalate, the last figure being in a petition of 1985). Some historians and contemporary references emphasize that a large-scale migration of Albanians from Albania to Kosovo is not recorded in Axis documents.Malcolm, Noel, Kosovo, A Short History, pp 312–313

====Kosovo in Communist Yugoslavia====

The province as in its outline today first took shape in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area. Until World War II, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo had been a political unit carved from the former vilayet which bore no special significance to its internal population. In the Ottoman Empire (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the Ottoman province had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to Albania, or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of Montenegro, or Macedonia (including its previous capital, Skopje) with another part in the Sandžak region of Šumadija and Western Serbia.
Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to national tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 35. Harsh repressive measures were imposed on Kosovo Albanians due to suspicions that there were Kosovo Albanian sympathisers of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha of Albania. In 1956, a show trial in Pristina was held in which multiple Albanian Communists of Kosovo were convicted of being infiltrators from Albania and were given long prison sentences. High-ranking Serbian communist official Aleksandar Ranković sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's nomenklatura.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 295.
Islam in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey. At the same time Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo. Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, accusing the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo as being colonialist, as well as demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania.
After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 296. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia by these changes.Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 301. In the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have its own administration, assembly, and judiciary; as well as having a membership in the collective presidency and the Yugoslav parliament, in which it held veto power.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 35–36.
In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the League of Prizren. Albanians felt that their status as a "minority" in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the "nations" of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a constituent republic, alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia.Independent International Commission on Kosovo. The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 36. Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed. In the aftermath of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded – including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.
Due to very high birth rates, the proportion of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example in 1986 the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide'.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&pg=PA215&dq=genocide+false+kosovo |title=Religion and the creation of race ... – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=20 July 2009|isbn=978-0-8147-6701-6|author1=Prentiss, Craig R|year=2003[/tpl]
Even though they were disproved by police statistics, they received wide play in the Serbian press and that led to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia along with human rights.New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia" The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested.Elsie, Robert. Historical Dictionary of Kosova. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8108-5309-4. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over" The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"

====Disintegration of Yugoslavia====

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s.
The 1986 Memorandum of the Serbian Academy warned that Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.SANU (1986): Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum. GIP Kultura. Belgrade. In February 1989 in protest, the Trepca miners began a hunger strike before the official abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo.
On 28 June 1989, Slobodan Milošević delivered the Gazimestan speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. Many think that this speech helped Milošević consolidate his authority in Serbia.The Economist, 5 June 1999, US Edition, 1041 words, "What's next for Slobodan Milošević?"
In 1989, Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political manoeuvring, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population.Rogel, Carole. "Kosovo: Where It All Began", International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, No. 1 (September 2003): 167–82. Kosovo Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.Clark, Howard. Civil Resistance in Kosovo. London: Pluto Press, 2000. ISBN 0-7453-1569-0.
On 2 July 1990, the self-declared Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo a republic in Yugoslavia and on 22 September 1991 declared Kosovo an independent country, the Republic of Kosova. In May 1992, r. Ibrahim Rugova was elected president.Babuna, Aydın. Albanian national identity and Islam in the post-Communist era. Perceptions 8(3), September–November 2003: 43–69. During its run, the Republic of Kosova was recognised only by Albania; it was formally disbanded in 2000, after the Kosovo War, when its institutions were replaced by the Joint Interim Administrative Structure established by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).

====Kosovo War====

The conflict had been going on since the early 1990s, when Slobodan Milošević, the former Yugoslav President, reduced Kosovo's autonomy, which the province has had since 1969. Kosovo Albanians protested and proclaimed the independent Republic of Kosovo, which, however, was only recognized by neighboring Albania, and refused to cooperate with authorities. Milosevic responded with the dismissal of all Kosovo Albanians in the local area and other harassment, which led to violence between Serbian military and Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo in the mid-1990s.
In 1995 the Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War, drawing considerable international attention. However, despite the hopes of Kosovar Albanians, the situation in Kosovo remained largely unaddressed by the international community, and by 1996 the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian guerilla group which used terrorist tactics such as assassinating local police, mail carriers, teachers and doctors, had prevailed over the non-violent resistance movement and had started offering armed resistance to Serbian and Yugoslav security forces, resulting in early stages of the Kosovo War.Rama, Shinasi A. The Serb-Albanian War, and the International Community’s Miscalculations. The International Journal of Albanian Studies, 1 (1998), pp. 15–19.
By 1998, as the violence had worsened and displaced scores of Albanians, Western interest had increased. The Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a ceasefire and partial retreat, monitored by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers according to an agreement negotiated by Richard Holbrooke. However, the ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998. The Račak massacre in January 1999 in particular brought new international attention to the conflict. Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the Rambouillet Accords, calling for restoration of Kosovo's autonomy and deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces. The Serbian party found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft.
NATO intervened by bombing Yugoslavia between 24 March and 10 June 1999, aiming to force Milošević to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/all-frce.htm|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO[/tpl] This military action was not authorised by the Security Council of the United Nations. However, other law experts disagree, stating "if NATO action is designed to ensure humanitarian relief for the people of Kosovo or merely to help them to repel armed aggression, one could argue that Security Council authorization may not be necessary."Retrieved 22 October 2012 Combined with continued skirmishes between Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav forces the conflict resulted in a further massive displacement of population in Kosovo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/partners/PARTNERS/3bb051c54.pdf|title=NATO and Humanitarian Action in the Kosovo Crisis|author=Larry Minear, Ted van Baarda, Marc Sommers|year=2000|publisher=Brown University|format=PDF[/tpl]
During the conflict, roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo. Altogether, more than 11,000 deaths have been reported to Carla Del Ponte by her prosecutors.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/514828.stm |title=World: Europe UN gives figure for Kosovo dead |work=BBC News | date=10 November 1999 | accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl] Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/781310.stm |title=3,000 missing in Kosovo |date= 7 June 2000 |work=BBC News | accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl] Ultimately by June, Milošević had agreed to a foreign military presence within Kosovo and withdrawal of his troops.
Since May 1999, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine Serbian and Yugoslavian commanders have been indicted so far for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war in Kosovo in 1999: Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milošević, Serbian President Milan Milutinović, Yugoslavian Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Šainović, Yugoslavian Chief of the General Staff Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanić, Serbian Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljković, Gen. Nebojša Pavković, Gen. Vladimir Lazarević, Deputy Interior Minister of Serbia Vlastimir Đorđević and Chief of the Interior for Kosovo Sreten Lukić. Stojiljković killed himself while at large in 2002 and Milošević died in custody during the trial in 2006. In 2009 Milutinovic was acquitted by the Trial Chamber; five defendants were found guilty (three sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and two to 22 years); and in 2011 the remaining defendant, who had been in hiding when the main trial started, was found guilty and sentenced to 27 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10095 |title=TPIY : Judgement List |publisher=ICTY |accessdate=26 March 2013[/tpl] The verdicts are under appeal. The indictment against the nine alleged that they directed, encouraged or supported a campaign of terror and violence directed at Kosovo Albanian civilians and aimed at the expulsion of a substantial portion of them from Kosovo. It has been alleged that about 800,000 Albanians were expelled as a result. In particular, in the indictment of June 2006, the accused were charged with murder of 919 identified Kosovo Albanian civilians aged from one to 93, both male and female.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/cis/en/cis_milosevic_slobodan.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milutinovic/cis/en/cis_milutinovic_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/ind/en/dor-3rdai070119.pdf |title=ICTY/org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl]
In addition, the Office of the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor has secured final judgements involving the conviction of 7 persons, sentenced to a total of 136 years imprisonment for war crimes in Kosovo involving 89 Albanian victims. As of June 2012, a trial of 12 defendants for an alleged massacre of 44 Albanian victims in Čuška (Alb: Qyshk) is ongoing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/predmeti_eng.htm |title=CASES |publisher=Tuzilastvorz.org.rs |date=25 February 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl]
Six KLA commanders were indicted in two cases: Fatmir Limaj, Isak Musliu and Haradin Bala,Another Albanian was indicted together with them, but the charges against him were promptly withdrawn after his arrest, as he turned out not to be the person referred to in the indictment. as well as Ramush Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. They were charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in Kosovo in 1998, consisting in persecutions, cruel treatment, torture, murders and rape of several dozens of the local Serbs, Albanians and other civilians perceived unloyal to the KLA. In particular, Limaj, Musliu and Bala were accused of murder of 22 identified detainees at or near the Lapušnik Prison Camp. In 2005 Limaj and Musliu were found not guilty on all charges, Bala was found guilty of persecutions, cruel treatment, murders and rape and sentenced to 13 years. The appeal chamber affirmed the judgements in 2007. In 2008 Ramush Haradinaj and Idriz Balaj were acquitted, whereas Lahi Brahimaj was found guilty of cruel treatment and torture and sentenced to six years. Notices of appeal are currently being considered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/cis/en/cis_limaj_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/haradinaj/cis/en/cis_haradinaj_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/ind/en/lim-2ai040212e.pdf|title=Second Amended Indictment – Limaj et al |publisher=Icty.org |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl]

===UN administration period===

On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised KFOR, a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 required the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops, and provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia while affirming the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.[tpl]Cite news|title=Resolution 1244 (1999) |date=17 June 1999 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |accessdate=19 February 2008 [/tpl]
Within three weeks of Resolution 1244, more than 600,000 Albanian refugees returned.http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html At the same time, many Serbs (and Roma) left with the Serb forces, or as a result of attacks and occupation of Serb properties in the aftermath of the conflict. Estimates of the number of Serbs thus displaced range from 65,000 to 250,000European Stability Initiative (ESI): The Lausanne Principle: Multiethnicity, Territory and the Future of Kosovo's Serbs (.pdf) , 7 June 2004.Coordinating Centre of Serbia for Kosovo-Metohija: Principles of the program for return of internally displaced persons from Kosovo and Metohija.UNHCR: 2002 Annual Statistical Report: Serbia and Montenegro, pg. 9US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI): Country report: Serbia and Montenegro 2006."Kosovo: The Human Rights Situation and the Fate of Persons Displaced from Their Homes (.pdf) ", report by Alvaro Gil-Robles, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, 16 October 2002, p. 30.UNHCR, Critical Appraisal of Responsee Mechanisms Operating in Kosovo for Minority Returns, Pristina, February 2004, p. 14.US Committee for Refugees (USCR), April 2000, Reversal of Fortune: Yugoslavia's Refugees Crisis Since the Ethnic Albanian Return to Kosovo, p. 2–3."Kosovo: The human rights situation and the fate of persons displaced from their homes (.pdf) ", report by Alvaro Gil-Robles, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, 16 October 2002.International Relations and Security Network (ISN): Serbians return to Kosovo not impossible, says report (.pdf) , by Tim Judah, 7 June 2004.  Given that the 1991 census recorded only 194,000 Serbs living in Kosovo, the higher estimates, if based on fact, must include Roma, Serbs displaced within Kosovo, and perhaps other elements. It is generally agreed by both Serbs and Albanians that the number of Serbs remaining in Kosovo is in the range of 100,000–120,000, although in most urban centres other than North Mitrovica and Kamenica the Serb population is now negligible. Although, since 2004, the Kosovo Government has been the largest funder of returns projects for displaced persons, the number of such returns remains relatively low, partly due to continued fears of possible violence or harassment.
International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm |title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock |publisher=BBC News |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2011[/tpl]
In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl]
Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date= 10 July 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl] Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30 March 2007 |work=Financial Times [/tpl]
After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a "Troika" consisting of negotiators from the European Union (Wolfgang Ischinger), the United States (Frank G. Wisner) and Russia (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the US, the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2209907,00.html |title=Bosnian nightmare returns to haunt EU |author=Simon Tisdall |date=13 November 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=UK [/tpl]
Under the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo had a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb and non-Albanian nations (e.g. Bosniaks, Roma, etc.). The Kosovo Assembly was responsible for electing the President, Prime Minister, and Government of Kosovo, and for passing legislation which was vetted and promulgated by UNMIK.

====Provisional Institutions of Self-Government====

In November 2001, the OSCE supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly."OSCE Mission in Kosovo – Elections ", Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected Ibrahim Rugova as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister."Power-sharing deal reached in Kosovo ", BBC News, 21 February 2002 After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publicinternationallaw.org/docs/BW2005/Balkan_Watch.11April_05.pdf |title=Publicinternationallaw.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl]
Parliamentary elections were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, Hashim Thaçi who was on course to gain 35 percent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaçi formed a coalition with current President Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote."Kosovo gets pro-independence PM ", BBC News, 9 January 2008 The turnout at the election was particularly low.

The Serbian Liberal Party (SLS), led by Slobodan Petrovič, is the dominant force in all Serb-majority municipalities south of the River Ibar, and is a coalition partner in the Kosovo Government. Turn-out in local elections in these municipalities approaches turn-out in most Albanian-majority municipalities. North of the River Ibar the picture is different. Turn-out in local elections organised under Kosovo applicable law is almost zero and the de facto authorities in these municipalities continue to reject Kosovo's Government.

===ICJ advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence===

Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence In Respect of Kosovo was a request for an advisory opinion referred to the International Court of Justice by the UN General Assembly regarding the 2008 unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo. This was the first case regarding a unilateral declaration of independence to be brought before the court.

===Republic of Kosovo===

The Republic of Kosovo set up after the 2008 Declaration of Independence continued to operate under international supervision by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX). The Constitution of Kosovo came into effect on 15 June 2008. It provides for an elected Assembly of Kosovo. Parliamentary elections were held on 12 December 2010. They were won by incumbent Hashim Thaçi's Democratic Party of Kosovo (DPK). The first post-independence local elections were held in 2009 and again in 2013. The Serb-inhabited parts of Kosovo that do not recognize the 2008 Declaration of Independence style themselves as the Community of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.

==Economy==

Kosovo was the poorest part of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), and in the 1990s its economy suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Yugoslav wars, Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees, and international sanctions on Serbia, of which it was then part.
After 1999, it had an economic boom as a result of post-war reconstruction and foreign assistance. In the period from 2003 to 2011, despite declining foreign assistance, growth of GDP averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the global financial crisis of 2009 and the subsequent eurozone crisis. Inflation was low.
Kosovo has a strongly negative balance of trade; in 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP, and was 39% of GDP in 2011. Remittances from the Kosovo diaspora accounted for an estimated 14 percent of GDP, little changed over the previous decade.  IMF Country Report No 12/100  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf "Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity."http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. The private sector which has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak. The economy, and its sources of growth, are therefore geared far more to demand than production, as shown by the current account, which was in 2011 in deficit by about 20% of GDP. Consequently Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora (the majority of these from Germany and Switzerland), FDI (of which a high proportion also comes from the diaspora), and other capital inflows.
Government revenue is also dependent on demand rather than production; only 14% of revenue comes from direct taxes and the rest mainly from customs duties and taxes on consumption. In part this reflects low levels of production as shown in the current account; but in part it reflects very low direct taxation rates. In 2009 corporation tax was halved from 20% to 10%; the highest rate of income tax is also 10%.
However, Kosovo has very low levels of general government debt (only 5.8% of GDP), although this would rise if Serbia recognised Kosovo and an agreement was reached on Kosovo's share of SFRY debt (which Serbia estimated in 2009 at $1.264 billion [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2637230220080226 |title=Serbia should stop servicing Kosovo debt: EconMin , International |agency=Reuters   |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] and which it is currently servicing, though Kosovo is putting money into a separate account to take account, on a conservative basis, of potential liabilities). The Government also has liquid assets resulting from past fiscal surpluses (deposited in the Central Bank and invested abroad). Under applicable Kosovo law, there are also substantial assets from privatisation of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs), also invested abroad by the Central Bank, which should mostly accrue to the Government when liquidation processes have been completed.
The net foreign assets of the financial corporations and the Pension Fund amount to well over 50% of GDP. Moreover, the banking system in Kosovo seems very sound. For the banking system as a whole, the Tier One Capital Ratio as of January 2012 was 17.5%, double the ratio required in the EU; the proportion of non-performing loans was 5.9%, well below the regional average; and the credit to deposit ratio was only just above 80%. The assets of the banking system have increased from 5% of GDP in 2000 to 60% of GDP as of January 2012. Since the housing stock in Kosovo is generally good by South-East European standards, this suggests that (if the legal system's ability to enforce claims on collateral and resolve property issues is trusted), credit to Kosovars could be safely expanded.
The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) introduced an external trade office and customs administration on 3 September 1999, when it established border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported to Kosovo face a flat 10% duty.Doing Business in Kosovo – U.S. Commercial Service Kosovo (UN Administered)[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]  These taxes are collected at all Customs Points at Kosovo's borders, including that between Kosovo and Serbia.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed free-trade agreements with Croatia,Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement, B92, 2 October 2006 Bosnia and Herzegovina,"UNMIK and Bosnia and Herzegovina Initial Free Trade Agreement".

The euro is the official currency of Kosovo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php |title=Invest in Kosovo – EU Pillar top priorities: privatisation process and focus on priority economic reforms |publisher=Euinkosovo.org |accessdate=26 March 2013[/tpl] Kosovo adopted the German mark in 1999 to replace the Serbian dinar,BBC News, Kosovo adopts Deutschmark and later replaced it with the euro, although the Serbian dinar is still used in some Serb-majority areas (mostly in the north). This means that Kosovo has no levers of monetary policy over its economy, and must rely on a conservative fiscal policy to provide the means to respond to external shocks. Officially registered unemployment stood at 40% of the labour force in January 2012, although some estimates have put it as high as 60%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&main_id=386 |title=News and analysis about Kosovo Economy in English |publisher=ECIKS |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl]  The IMF have pointed out, however, that informal employment is widespread, and the ratio of wages to per capita GDP is the second highest in South-East Europe; the true rate may therefore be lower. Unemployment among the Roma minority may be as high as 90%.Roma forced back to dire poverty, deprivation 28 October 2010.  The mean wage in 2009 was $2.98 per hour.
The dispute over Kosovo's international status, and the interpretation which some non-recognising states place on symbols which may or may not imply sovereignty, continues to impose economic costs on Kosovo. Examples include flight diversions because of a Serbian ban on flights to Kosovo over its territory; loss of revenues because of a lack of a regional dialling code (end-user fees on fixed lines accrue to Serbian Telecoms, while Kosovo has to pay Monaco and Slovenia for use of their regional codes for mobile phone connections; no IBAN code for bank transfers; and no regional Kosovo code for the internet.
A major deterrent to foreign manufacturing investment in Kosovo was removed in 2011 when the European Council accepted a Convention allowing Kosovo to be accepted as part of its rules for diagonal cumulative origination, allowing the label of Kosovo origination to goods which have been processed there but originated in a country elsewhere in the Convention. Since 2002 the European Commission has compiled a yearly progress report on Kosovo, evaluating its political and economic situation. Kosovo became a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 29 June 2009.

===Industry===

Kosovo has a slowly developing plain industry. In 2009, the Industry accounted for 22.60 of GDP and a general workforce of 800,000 employees. It's on the 150th place, compared to the rest of the world.[tpl]cite web|title= Kosovo International Rankings of Kosovo - 2013|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/kosovo/kosovo_international_rankings_2013.html [/tpl]
There are numerous reasons for this kind of stagnation, ranging from consecutive occupations, political turmoil and the recent War in Kosovo (1999).Asllan, Pushka. "Gjeografia 12". Libri Shkollor (2005). p. 77.

==Electrical energy==

The electricity sector of Kosovo relies on coal-fired power plants (97%)[tpl]cite web|title=Projekti Energjetik i Kosovës|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTENERGY2/Resources/Report_of_the_independent_Expert_Panel_in_ALBANIAN.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl] and is considered one of the sectors with the greatest potential of development. The inherited issues after the war in Kosovo and the transition period have had an immense effect on the progress of this sector.
Regulation of activities in energy sector in Kosovo is a responsibility of the Energy Regulatory Office (ZRrE). An additional factor in the energy sector in Kosovo is Ministry of Economic Development(MZHE), which has the responsibility of dealing with issues that have to do with energy. MZHE prepares legislation and drafts strategies and projects.[tpl]cite web|title=http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/files/KEK_u_dok./strategjia_e_energjise_kosoves_2009-2018_18shtator2009.pdf|url=http://pashtriku.beepworld.de/files/KEK_u_dok./strategjia_e_energjise_kosoves_2009-2018_18shtator2009.pdf|publisher=Government of Kosovo|accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl]

==Geography==

Kosovo represents an important link between central and southern Europe and the Adriatic and Black Seas. Kosovo has an area of 10,908 square km.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitkosova.org/test/?page=2,4 |title=Visit Kosova[/tpl] It lies between latitudes 41° and 44° N, and longitudes 20° and 22° E. The border of Kosovo is approximately [tpl]convert|602.09|km|2|abbr=in[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite web|author=Adrian Stabiszewski, Multimedia und IT |url=http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=53295 |title=OSM Relation Analyzer |publisher=Ra.osmsurround.org |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl]
Its climate is continental, with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. Most of Kosovo's terrain is mountainous, the highest peak is Đeravica ([tpl]convert|2656|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]). There are two main plain regions, the Metohija basin is located in the western part of Kosovo, and the Plain of Kosovo occupies the eastern part. The main rivers of the region are the White Drin, running towards the Adriatic Sea, with the Erenik among its tributaries), the Sitnica, the South Morava in the Goljak area, and Ibar in the north. The biggest lakes are Gazivoda, Radonjić, Batlava and Badovac.
39.1% of Kosovo is forested, about 52% is classified as agricultural land, 31% of which is covered by pastures and 69% is arable.Strategic Environmental Analysis of Kosovo. The Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe, Prishtina, July 2000. Phytogeographically, Kosovo belongs to the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the European Environment Agency, the territory of Kosovo belongs to the ecoregion of Balkan mixed forests.Currently, the 39,000 ha Šar Mountains National Park, established in 1986 in the Šar Mountains along the border with the Republic of Macedonia, is the only national park in Kosovo, although the Balkan Peace Park in the Prokletije along the border with Montenegro has been proposed as another one.Kosovo: Biodiversity assessment. Final Report submitted to the USAID, ARD-BIOFOR IQC Consortium, May 2003. The Bifurcation of Nerodimka river, near Urošeevac/Ferizaj, is the only example in Europe of a river dividing with its waters flowing into two different seas.
The largest cities are Pristina, the capital, with an estimated 198,000 inhabitants. The old city of Prizren is towards the south west, with a population of 178,000. Peć/Peja in the west has 95,000 inhabitants with Uroševac/Ferizaj in the south at around 108,000.

===Natural resources===

Kosovo is rich in natural resources. In Kosovo there are lots of reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite.[tpl]cite web|title=Kosovo: Natural resources key to the future, say experts|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Business/?id=1.0.1683003038|work=adnkronos.com|accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl]  There is also believed to be around 14,000 billion tonnes of lignite.

==Architecture==

The architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic Period and includes the Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages, Roman Antiquity and the Medieval Period. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilizations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.
The monasteries and churches from the 14th century represent the Byzantine Orthodox legacy. Architectural heritage from the Ottoman Period includes mosques and hamams from the 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include kullas from the 18th and 19th centuries as well as a number of bridges, urban centers and fortresses. While some vernacular buildings are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged.[tpl]cite journal|title=Cultural Heritage in South-East: Kosovo|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|page=5|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/culture/safeguarding-cultural-heritage/capacity-building/cultural-heritage-kosovo/|accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Prioritized Intervention List|journal=Regional programme for cultural and natural heritage in south-east europe|date=23 January 2009|page=8|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/see/countries/kosovo_en.asp|accessdate=2 March 2014[/tpl]

According to latest CIA The World Factbook estimated data, as of July 2009, Kosovo's population stands at 1,804,838 persons. It stated that ethnic composition is "Albanians 88%, Serbs 7%, other 5% (Bosniak, Gorani, Roma, Turk, Ashkali, Egyptian, Janjevci – Croats)".[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html#People |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |publisher=CIA |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl]
Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not quite coincide with the ethnic boundary by which Albanians compose an absolute majority in every municipality; for example, Serbs form a local majority in North Kosovo and two other municipalities, while there are large areas with an Albanian majority outside of Kosovo, namely in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia: the north-west of Macedonia, and in the Preševo Valley in Southern and Eastern Serbia.
At 1.3% per year, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the fastest rate of growth in population in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml |title=Albanian Population Growth |publisher=Files.osa.ceu.hu |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080227175620/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml|archivedate=27 February 2008[/tpl] Over an 82-year period (1921–2003) the population of Kosovo grew to 460% of its original size.

===Religion===

The two main religions of Kosovo are Christianity and Islam. A large portion of Albanians have Muslim family backgrounds, as do the Turkish communities and some of the Roma/Ashkali/Egyptian communities. Kosovo censuses do not ask questions on religious affiliation; it is therefore not clear how many maintain a Muslim affiliation. Kosovo society (like the constitution) remains largely secular.

===Relations between Albanian and Serb communities===

The relations between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian and Serb populations have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century, rivalry which became strong after Serbia gained Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire in 1913 and after Albania became independent in the same year. During the Tito-era of communist rule in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanian and Serb populations of Kosovo were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanian and Serb peoples in Kosovo rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages.Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 24. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between the ethnic Albanian and Serb communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer relations between each other.

===The Roma and other minorities===

Despite their planned integration into the Kosovar society and their recognition in the Kosovar constitution, Romani and other minorities (i.e. Ashkali and Egyptian communities) continue to face many difficulties, such as segregation and discrimination, in housing, education, health, employment and social welfare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/Articles/Rifati_Kosovo.htm |title=The Roma and "Humanitarian" Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo |publisher=Dissidentvoice.org |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl] Many camps around Kosovo continue to house thousands of Internally Displaced People, all of whom are from minority groups and communities.[tpl]cite web|author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountries)/165F03EE03E9D015C1257662005CE095?opendocument&count=10000 |title=IDMC , Internally Displaced persons (IDPs) in Kosovo |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl] Because many of the Roma are believed to have sided with the Serbs during the conflict, taking part in the widespread looting and destruction of Albanian property, Minority Rights Group International report that Romani people encounter hostility by Albanians outside their local areas.[tpl]cite web|author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpEnvelopes)/B4A8E121B6EA5BBB802570B8005AA863?OpenDocument |title=IDMC : Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Countries, Kosovo, Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptians in Kosovo (2006) |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl] The report adds:

===Culture and media===

Although in Kosovo the music is diverse, authentic Albanian music (see World Music) and Serbian music do still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the çiftelia (an authentic Albanian instrument), mandolin, mandola and percussion. Classical music is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at several music schools and universities (at the University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts in Pristina and the University of Priština Faculty of Arts at Kosovska Mitrovica).

===Sports===

Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 "Law on Sport" passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national Olympic Committee, regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for sports clubs. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.

===Rule of law===

Following the Kosovo War, due to the many weapons in the hands of civilians, law enforcement inefficiencies, and widespread devastation, both revenge killings and ethnic violence surged tremendously. The number of reported murders rose 80% from 136 in 2000 to 245 in 2001. The number of reported arsons rose 140% from 218 to 523 over the same period. UNMIK pointed out that the rise in reported incidents might simply correspond to an increased confidence in the police force (i.e., more reports) rather than more actual crime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unmikonline.org/civpol/statistics.htm |title=UNMIK statistics |publisher=Unmikonline.org |accessdate=28 April 2010[/tpl] According to the UNODC, by 2008, murder rates in Kosovo had dropped by 75% in five years.Retrieved from Balkaninsight.comCrime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, March 2008.

Although the number of noted serious crimes increased between 1999 and 2000, since then it has been "starting to resemble the same patterns of other European cities".Kosovo Crime Wave, 17 January 2001 According to Amnesty International, the aftermath of the war resulted in an increase in the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm |title=Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade' |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2004 |accessdate=6 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071213220014/http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |archivedate=13 December 2007 |title=Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Ian Traynor in Zagreb |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html |title=Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade' |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 May 2004|accessdate=6 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl] According to the IOM data, in 2000–2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of human trafficking victims, after Albania, Moldova, Romania and sometimes Bulgaria.Second Annual Report on Victims of Trafficking in South-Eastern Europe.

Kosovo is extremely vulnerable to organised crime and thus to money laundering.

P. 14. However, according to a 2008 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, overall, ethnic Albanians, not only from Kosovo, supply 10 to 20% of the heroin in Western Europe, and the traffic has been declining.Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries, UNODC report, March 2008.

In 2010, a report by Swiss MP Dick Marty claimed to have evidence that a criminal network tied to the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Prime Minister, Hashim Thaci, executed prisoners and harvested their kidneys for organ transplantation. The Kosovo government rejected the allegation.[tpl]cite news|last=BBC|title=Kosovo rejects Hashim Thaci organ-trafficking claims|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11996255|date=15 December 2010|work=BBC News [/tpl] On 25 January 2011, the Council of Europe endorsed the report and called for a full and serious investigation into its contents.'Kosovo physicians accused of illegal organs removal racket' The Guardian, 14 December 2010.

===Wines===

Wine has historically been produced in Kosovo; both red and white. Currently the wine industry is successful and growing after the war in the 1990s. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in Orahovac where millions of litres of wine is produced. The main wines produced in Kosovo include Pinot noir, Merlot and Chardonnay. Kosovo has recently been exporting wines to Germany and the United States.[tpl]cite news|title=Kosovo's wines flowing again|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15401459|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2011[/tpl]
