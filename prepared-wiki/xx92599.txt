Queen Kapiʻolani (1834–1899) (formerly Esther Kapiʻolani or Esther Kapiʻolani Napelakapuokakaʻe), was married to King David Kalākaua and reigned as Queen Consort of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

==Life==

Kapiʻolani was born December 31, 1834 in Hilo on Hawaiʻi Island to High Chief Kuhio Kalanianaʻole of Hilo and Princess Kinoiki Kekaulike of Kauaʻi, the Nīʻaupiʻo daughter of King Kaumuali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, last King of an independent Kauaʻi before its amicable cession to Kamehameha the Great.  She was also the step-granddaughter of Queen Regent Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu by virtue of Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu's marriage to Kaumuali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. 
She was named Esther Kapiʻolani, after her great-aunt High Chiefess Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani, who defied the goddess Pele in the name of Christianity, and the Biblical queen Esther. Some called her incorrectly as Julia. "Julia" was derived from Kapiʻolani's personal motto, "Kulia I Ka Nuʻu"; "Strive for the Highest". Because of this many books show that her first name to be Julia.
Her name, Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani, meaning Rainbow or Arch of Heaven.Finding Fine Heart
Kapiolani's first marriage was to High Chief Benjamin Nāmākēhāokalani or sometimes called Bennet Namakeha. He was 35 years older than Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani. He was uncle of Queen Emma on her father George Naʻea's side. This made her the aunt of Queen Emma, who she served as her highest lady-in-waiting. Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani was the caretaker of Haku O Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Prince Albert Kamehameha. Queen Emma blamed Kapiolani for the child's death as he was under Kapiolani's care at the time. 
Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani married Kalākaua in a quiet ceremony because their wedding fell during the time of mourning for King Kamehameha IV. She and Kalākaua were childless so she and her sister Po[tpl]okina[/tpl]omaikelani hānai  (adopted) their sister Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike's three sons. Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani took David and Jonah and Po[tpl]okina[/tpl]omaikelani took Edward. David established the House of Kawānanakoa which would eventually succeed the House of Kalākaua.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
In 1887, Queen Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani traveled to London to attend Queen Victoria's 50th Jubilee celebration. Princess Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, King Kalākaua's sister, traveled with Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani as her interpreter since though Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani was brought up understanding English, she refused to speak anything but Hawaiian. The Hawaiian Royal family were treated as dignitaries, and were seated with the British Royal family in the front of Westminster Abbey.
Queen Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani established the Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Maternity Home, where Hawaiian mothers could receive care, as well as their newborn babies. It survives today as the Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Medical Center. Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Park in Waikīkī was named after the Queen by her husband Kalākaua. One of her noted compositions to Hawaiian music was a love song she wrote for her husband, Ka Ipo Lei Manu. Kalākaua died in San Francisco before he could hear the musical composition from his Queen.

==Death==

After  the overthrow and her eviction from ʻIolani Palace, Queen Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani retired to her home called Pualeilani in Waikīkī, dying there June 24, 1899 at age 64.
