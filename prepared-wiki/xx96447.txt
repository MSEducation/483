iconv is a computer program and a standardized application programming interface (API) used to convert between different character encodings.

==History==

The iconv API is the standard programming interface for converting character strings from one character encoding to another in Unix-like operating systems.
Initially appearing on the HP-UX operating system, it was standardized within XPG4 and is part of the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
All recent Linux distributions contain a free implementation of iconv() as part of the GNU C Library which is the C library for current Linux systems.  To use it, the GNU glibc locales need to be installed, which are provided as a separate package (usually named glibc-locale) normally installed by default.

==Usage==

stdin can be converted from ISO-8859-1 to current locale and output to stdout using:
An input file infile can be converted from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 and output to output file outfile using:

==Ports==

Under Microsoft Windows, the iconv binary (and thus, likely also the API) is provided by the Cygwin and GnuWin32 environments or native Win32 port win_iconv.exe.
iconv is also available for many programming languages. For example, one of the libraries supported by PHPhttp://www.php.net/iconv (also under Windows using a DLL file), so it is possible to use iconv() from a PHP program easily.
