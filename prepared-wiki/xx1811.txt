[[Center (group theory)]]

CATEGORIES: Group theory, Functional subgroups

In abstract algebra, the center of a group G, denoted Z(G),The notation Z is from German Zentrum, meaning "center". is the set of elements that commute with every element of G.  In set-builder notation,
The center is a subgroup of G, which by definition is abelian (that is commutative).  As a subgroup, it is always normal, and indeed characteristic, but it need not be fully characteristic.  The quotient group G / Z(G) is isomorphic to the group of inner automorphisms of G.
A group G is abelian if and only if Z(G) = G.  At the other extreme, a group is said to be centerless if Z(G) is trivial, i.e. consists only of the identity element.
The elements of the center are sometimes called central.

==As a subgroup==

The center of G is always a subgroup of G.  In particular:
Furthermore the center of G is always a normal subgroup of G, as it is closed under conjugation.

==Conjugacy classes and centralisers==

By definition, the center is the set of elements for which the conjugacy class of each element is the element itself, i.e. ccl(g) = {g}.
The center is also the intersection of all the centralizers of each element of G. As centralizers are subgroups, this again shows that the center is a subgroup.

==Conjugation==

Consider the map f: G → Aut(G) from G to the automorphism group of G defined by f(g) = ϕg, where ϕg is the automorphism of G defined by 
The function f is a group homomorphism, and its kernel is precisely the center of G, and its image is called the inner automorphism group of G, denoted Inn(G). By the first isomorphism theorem we get

==Higher centers==

Quotienting out by the center of a group yields a sequence of groups called the upper central series:
The ascending chain of subgroups
