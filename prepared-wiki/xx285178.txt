Hinson has been performing country music since his teenage years in the late 1960s and began going by the name Jimbeau Hinson in the mid 1970s, to avoid any confusion with Muppets creator Jim Henson. Hinson signed a writing contract with The Wilburn Brothers publishing company at age seventeen and later recorded several singles for Chart Records. During the late 1970s, Hinson began an long-running relationship with The Oak Ridge Boys as a songwriter and assisted with the operations of their publishing company.  In the late 1980s he was a contestant on Star Search.
