[[Suzy Bogguss discography]]

CATEGORIES: Country music discographies, Discographies of American artists

Suzy Bogguss is an American country music singer-songwriter. Her discography consists of twelve studio albums, two compilation albums, two live albums, two holiday albums, and a collaborative album with Chet Atkins. Bogguss has released thirty-six singles, with six of those reaching the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. An additional six singles reached the Top 40 of the same chart.
Bogguss' breakthrough album, Aces, was released in 1991. It reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and featured four Top 15 singles on the country singles chart. The album was subsequently certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, without having charted a number one single. Her next two releases, Voices in the Wind (1992) and Something Up My Sleeve (1993), were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. 
Although recording and releasing material throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bogguss has failed to match the success of her earlier albums. In the late-1990s, only one single cracked the Top 40 of the country charts, and the subsequent singles failed to reach the Top 60, or even chart at all. Her latest release, Lucky, was released in February 2014.
