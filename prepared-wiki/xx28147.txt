[[Sycamine]]

CATEGORIES: New Testament words and phrases, Trees

The Sycamine tree is mentioned only in Luke 17:6. It is rendered by Luther "mulberry tree", which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found in two species, the black mulberry (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry (Morus alba), which are common in Palestine.  It is in the same family as the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the sycamore fig of Luke 19:4.
