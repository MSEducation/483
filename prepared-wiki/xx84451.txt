Boraas (1983) reported a mutation in a population of Chlorella pyrenoidosa kept in his lab as a food stock for a population of flagellates. Due to a malfunction of his equipment some of the flagellates got in the Chlorella's tank. This caused a mutation from unicellular to multicellular.
This algae was used in a 1961 study by Boeing to see about feasibility for the use of algae providing oxygen on space missions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://contrails.iit.edu/DigitalCollection/1962/AMRLTDR62-116article03.pdf | last1=Bovee | first1=H H | last2=Pilgrim | first2=A J | last3=Sun | first3=L S | last4=Schubert | first4=J E | last5=Eng | first5=T L | last6=Benishek | first6=B J | title=Large Algal Systems | publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology | work=Contrails | format = PDF | pages=12 [/tpl]
