James E. Davis (April 3, 1962 – July 23, 2003) was a New York City police officer, corrections officer and council member. He was killed by a fellow politician in New York City Hall, in a bizarre instance of a political rivalry that turned violent.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Davis was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of a corrections officer and a registered nurse. He spent his early childhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant before his family moved to Crown Heights.
He earned a bachelor's degree at Pace University in social science and youth agency administration. He became a corrections officer at Rikers Island after being beaten by two white police officers, and then became a police officer himself in 1991. In 1990, Davis had started an organization called "Love Yourself Stop the Violence" dedicated to stopping violence in urban America. The NYPD soon assigned Davis to the Police academy as an instructor, and he became a frequent guest on local radio and television programs.

===Political career===

He eventually qualified as a minister and became a District Leader and then a council member for Brooklyn's 35th Council district in November 2001.
The template for his successful City Council bid had been established by previous races against Assemblyman and Democratic Kings County Chairman Clarence Norman Jr., who narrowly defeated him in 1998. The campaign against the politically powerful Norman — and Davis' high profile generally — ruffled feathers within the NYPD, and Davis was fired for violating a rule that prohibits paid city employees from engaging in electoral politics. In that November's election his name was on the ballot on the old Liberal Party of New York line, for which Davis was fired from the NYPD.  After pursuing litigation against the police department, Davis' claim that he never formally accepted the Liberal Party nomination was upheld and he was allowed to reclaim his job. He was not, however, permitted to return to his former detail at the police academy, instead being banished to the night shift at a Brooklyn precinct.
His next campaign was successful but would later be a factor in Davis's murder. Othniel Askew had raised funds to run against him, but had failed to file the proper papers on time, which led to accusations of political chicanery and caused Askew to harbor a grudge against Davis.[tpl]fact|date=December 2010[/tpl]

===Death===

On July 23, 2003, Davis brought Askew to attend a Council meeting at New York City's City Hall, with the intention of honoring him by introducing him from the balcony. The councilman and Askew were able to bypass the metal detectors, a courtesy offered to elected officials and their guests. Once in the balcony, at 2:08 p.m., Askew fired a silver .40 caliber weapon at Davis, striking him several times in the torso.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/24/nyregion/shooting-at-city-hall-overview-councilman-is-fatally-shot-in-city-hall.html |title=SHOOTING AT CITY HALL: OVERVIEW; Councilman Is Fatally Shot in City Hall |publisher=New York Times |date=July 24, 2003 | first=Michael | last=Cooper | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl] Davis, a retired police officer, was carrying a weapon but it remained holstered. A plainclothes policeman, Richard Burt, on duty as bodyguard to Gifford Miller, Speaker of the City Council, then fired up at Askew from the floor of the chamber, striking him five times. Paramedics arrived quickly, and attempted to revive both Davis and Askew before taking them to Beekman Downtown Hospital.  Both men died. 
Askew had a history of violence. It was discovered after the murder that Askew had asked Davis to sign papers naming him as Davis's replacement in case anything happened to Davis.
Davis's brother Geoffrey Davis announced that he would run for the seat formerly held by his brother. He was defeated by fellow Democrat Letitia James, running on the Working Families Party line.
Davis was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, but upon learning his killer's ashes were also in Green-Wood his family had his body exhumed and reinterred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/nyregion/grief-then-scrutiny-for-slain-councilman-s-family.html |title=Grief, Then Scrutiny for Slain Councilman's Family |publisher=New York Times |date=August 1, 2003 | first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Hicks | first2=William K. | last2=Rashbaum | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Slain New York City Councilman Reburied; Reinterment occurred after family learned his killer's ashes were in the same cemetery.|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/378886871.html?dids=378886871:378886871&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+03%2C+2003&author=Thomas+S.+Mulligan&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=The+Nation%3B+Slain+New+York+City+Councilman+Reburied%3B+Reinterment+occurred+after+family+learned+his+killer%27s+ashes+were+in+the+same+cemetery.&pqatl=google |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=August 3, 2003 |accessdate=2009-07-19 | first=Thomas S. | last=Mulligan[/tpl]
The incident would be used as the basis for "City Hall", an episode of Law & Order which aired on February 11, 2004 - though in that story, the dead councilman was an innocent bystander, with the second victim, a low-level bureaucrat who survived with a shoulder wound, as the true target.
