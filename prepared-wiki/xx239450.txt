Discoveries is a compilation album by jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley released on the Savoy label featuring alternate takes of tracks from Adderley's recording debut originally released as Kenny Clarke's Bohemia After Dark (1955) and his first album Presenting Cannonball Adderley (1955) performed by a quintet with Nat Adderley, Hank Jones, Paul Chambers, and Kenny Clarke and a septet with Donald Byrd and Jerome Richardson added and Horace Silver replacing Jones.Cannonball Adderley discography accessed 19 October 2009 The Allmusic review by Rick Anderson states "Adderley plays beautifully throughout... Unfortunately, the sound quality of this disc varies (sometimes within a single track) more than it should for a recording of this vintage, and the disc's 35-minute length is another annoyance. But the weight of great performances by Adderley, Silver and the infallible Clarke/Chambers axis, combined with the disc's attractive price, make it a solid value. Highly recommended".Anderson, R. Allmusic Review accessed 13 October 2009 Several of these tracks were also included on the CD rerelease of Presenting Cannonball Adderley.
