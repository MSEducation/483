She studied ceramics at the University of Hawaii, where she received an MFA in 1966.  She has taught at the Hawaii Pottersâ€™ Guild, the University of Hawaii Lab School, the Hickam Airforce Base Craft Center and the Honolulu Museum of Art.  She is known for her massive hand-built stoneware sculptures that resemble pots, but are nonfunctional, such as End Without End in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. Since the 1990s, she has turned her attention to figurative ceramic sculpture, especially rhinoceroses.Cyclopaedia.net  It is her avowed intent that these sculptures will help call attention to the mistreatment and extinction of animals.
The Hawaii State Art Museum and the Honolulu Museum of Art are among the public collections holding work by Sally Fletcher-Murchison.Yoshihara, Lisa A., Collective Visions, 1967-1997, Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts, Honolulu, Hawaii, 1997, 105
