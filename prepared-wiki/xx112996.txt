[[Gimme (One song)]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 singles, Eurovision songs of Cyprus, Eurovision songs of 2002, One (band) songs

"Gimme" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 by the boy band One, performed in English and is the first occasion that the Cypriot entry did not featured Greek lyrics. The song is a boyband number, with a girl being asked to give a sign that she loves the singers.
The song was performed first on the night, followed by the United Kingdom's Jessica Garlick with "Come Back". At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 6th in a field of 24.
A few seconds after the lead singer Constantinos Christoforou began singing, a technical hitch led to a caption bearing the words 'Ugly Duckling' on the background video screen. Fortunately the picture of the stage was quickly brought back.
One member of the band (Constantinos Christoforou) had already participated for Cyprus at the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 with the song Mono Yia Mas. He would later make a further solo appearance at the 2005 Contest with "Ela Ela (Come Baby)" after the band formally disbanded. Therefore the song represents the middle leg in a rare sequence of a Eurovision contestant performing solo, then as a member of a vocal group, before a second solo performance.
