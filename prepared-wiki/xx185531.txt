===Presidency of WIPR===

====WIPR's 50th anniversary====

In July 2008, Montilla celebrated TUTV's (formerly WIPR-TV) 50th Anniversary.  The celebration was commemorated by the production of the documentary WIPR-50 Años.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.tutv.puertorico.pr/tutv/50_aniversario.htm | title=TUTV Official Website | language=Spanish| accessdate=2008-07-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080710094336/http://www.tutv.puertorico.pr/tutv/50_aniversario.htm  |archivedate = 2008-07-10[/tpl] The anniversary also marked the beginning of the digital era in the island as WIPR-TV, the island's first public television station,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.hispanicad.com/cgi-bin/news/newsarticle.cgi?article_id=24801| title=Puerto Rico’s first Public TV Station celebrates 50 Years! | publisher=Hispanic Ad| date=2008-07-11| accessdate=2008-07-11[/tpl] became the first station in the island to produce and broadcast in high definition format. At a cost of US$28 million, the new facilities—which include an electronic room, master controls, three studios, studio controls, antennas, and cameras in Hato Rey and Mayagüez—set a new technological standard for production and broadcasting in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.
On July 7, 2008, Montilla held a press conference at the station, where he inaugurated WIPR-TV's high definition facilities. At the inaugural ceremony, which also launched the beginning of Television Week, an annual celebration of television media in the island, Montilla, accompanied by President of the Board of Directors Carlos Ríos, pressed the symbolic button that launched TUTV into the digital era.

===Taking Puerto Rican television beyond the shores===

====Road to the Emmy's====

In 1998, while he was working as a producer with Paquito Cordero, Montilla set out on a quest to take Puerto Rican television to a new level and allow excellence to be recognized. It was then that he came across National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences’ homepage only to find out that only four of the Academy’s chapters evaluated Spanish-speaking entries, which was source of great concern.  But even more so, Puerto Rico did not belong to any chapter and so could not compete amongst other productions in the US and was not eligible for the coveted Emmy Award.San Juan City Magazine, People to Watch in the Arts: Victor Montilla Dec/Jan 2004
Montilla then contacted the Academy’s Suncoast Chapter.  The process of lobbying for Puerto Rico’s acceptance was an uphill battle, which included a formal petition to the Academy.San Juan City Magazine Boricua Emmys, 2001 Montilla spearheaded the proposal and rallied among the Puerto Rican television community; television executives from local stations and independent producers who, on October 1, 1999 signed a petition asking the Academy's Suncoast Chapter to allow the island’s television shows to participate in its regional annual competition.
In 2000, Bob Behrens, chairman of the board, formally announced that Puerto Rico had been granted a one-year trial.  Great press coverage followed this announcement encouraging Puerto Rican producers to submit, for the first time ever, their productions for consideration.The San Juan Star, Puerto Rican’s Pitch for Emmy’s, June 29, 2001 In doing so, he made it possible for Puerto Rico to compete for the Emmy Award. This feat led to Montilla being unanimously elected as vice-president of the Chapter and re-elected in 2005.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]  At the 2001 Suncoast Regional Emmy Award Ceremony, Puerto Rico earned 5 nominations and 4 Emmy’s."2001 Suncoast Regional Emmy Award Winners  Since its inclusion in the Suncoast Chapter, Puerto Rico has earned over 40 nominations and 30 Emmy Awards.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]

====Historical alliance====

As part of his goal to expand the reach of Puerto Rican programming beyond the island's shores, Montilla announced in 2006 an alliance with Televicentro-WAPAmerica to broadcast TUTV’s shows in key Hispanic markets to reach Puerto Rican residents of the United Status through WAPA América, the channel of Televicentro’s local productions."WAPA & Puerto Rican Public TV reach deal for U.S. Market." Apr-25-2006. Through this agreement, TUTV, agreed to provide 16 hours of local programming weekly, that were added to the 78 hours that Televicentro de Puerto Rico had been transmitting through WAPA América, a major economic move towards exporting productions and generating additional income to TUTV.
At the press conference, where Montilla was accompanied by Juan José Valentín, VP Marketing TUTV, Margarita Millán VP of Programming of Televicentro and Joe Ramos President of Televicentro, Montilla spoke as to the importance of exporting Puerto Rico's programming in this global era: “It’s an excellent opportunity that allows us to export our varied programming, as well as our local talent. Our programming will be the door through which our Hispanic friends, especially the Puerto Ricans living abroad, can enjoy the best of our Caribbean culture. This alliance sets the precedent that public television programming can result attractive and marketable to commercial stations.""HISTORICAL TELEVISION ALLIANCE TUTV AND TELEVICENTRO Transmit through WAPA AMERICA" Apr-18-2006.

==Awards==
