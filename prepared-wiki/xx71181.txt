The White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) is a medium-sized sparrow native to North America.

==Description==

Adults are [tpl]convert|18|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long and have black and white stripes on their head, a grey face, brown streaked upper parts and a long tail. The wings are brown with bars and the underparts are grey. Their bill is pink or yellow. They are similar in appearance to the White-throated Sparrow but do not have the white throat markings.

==Subspecies==

There are five currently recognized subspecies of White-crowned Sparrow (pugetensis, gambelii, nuttalli, oriantha, and leucophrys), varying in breeding distribution migratory route. Birds of the subspecies nutalli are permanent residents in California, while birds of the subspecies gambelli may migrate as far as the Arctic Circle during the summer breeding season. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States.

==Distribution==

Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across northern Canada and the western United States.
White-crowned Sparrow is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.[tpl]cite journal|last=Broad|first=R. A.|last2=Hawley|first2=R.

==Behavior==

These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, but sometimes make short flights to catch flying insects. They mainly eat seeds, other plant parts and insects. In winter, they often forage in flocks.
White-crowned Sparrows nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs and lay 3–5 brown-marked grey or greenish-blue eggs.
The White-crowned Sparrow is known for its natural alertness mechanism, which allows it to stay awake for up to two weeks during migration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/sleep.html|title=It's Wake-Up Time|accessdate=28 July 2010|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Wired Website[/tpl] This effect has been studied for possible human applications, such as shift-work drowsiness or truck driving.[tpl]cite journal|pmc=449897|title=Migratory Sleeplessness in the White-Crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii)|date=13 July 2004|journal=PLoS Biology[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.farnorthscience.com/2007/11/06/news-from-alaska/alaska-sparrow-migration-mystery/|title=Alaska sparrow migration mystery|accessdate=28 July 2010|date=6 November 2007|publisher=Far North Science Website[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/23/1/59.abstract|title=Circadian and Masking Control of Migratory Restlessness in Gambel's White-Crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii)|accessdate=28 July 2010|date=1 February 2008|publisher=Journal of Biological Rhythms[/tpl]
