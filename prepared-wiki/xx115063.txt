The genus name is probably derived from the Spanish city of Marchena, Seville.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] As witnessed by other generic names, the describers had a habit of naming taxa after places unrelated to the species' distribution. The species name is Latin for "small, minute".
