CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Lazio

Sonnino is a town and comune in the province of Latina, in the Lazio region of central Italy. 
It is the birthplace of Italian national team footballer Alessandro Altobelli, and Roman Catholic archbishop Velasio de Paolis.

==History==

Originating in the late Middle Ages (the name deriving perhaps from the Latin sommum, meaning "top"), Sonnino is mentioned for the firs time in a Papal bulla from 999. It was held first by the De Sompnino, and  was acquired by Onorato I Caetani in 1369. The castle was inhabited by the Caetani d'Aragona  until they sold it in 1469 to the Colonna, who were later followed by the Antonelli and the Talani families.
In July 1819 Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, Secretary of State at the Vatican, ordered Sonnino to be razed to the ground as it had become a notorious haunt of the banditi  in the Campagna di Roma.
