The west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.[tpl]cite web|last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-13745285.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 June 2004 |accessdate=2010-03-27[/tpl]
With thousands of lakes, over [tpl]convert|14000|km|mi|-2[/tpl] of fish bearing rivers and over [tpl]convert|3700|km|mi|-1[/tpl] of coastline, Ireland is a popular angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,[tpl]cite web|title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url=http://www.fishinginireland.info |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl] and the range of sea angling species is around 80.[tpl]cite web|title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url=http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl]

===Food and drink===

Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.[tpl]Cite book|first1=Alan|last1=Davidson|first2=Tom|last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2006 |pages=407–408 |isbn=0-19-280681-5[/tpl] Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.
For this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (or rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages. The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the Maasai) was common[tpl]Cite journal|title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato|first1=Redcliffe Nathan|last1=Salaman|first2=William Glynn|last2=Burton|first3=John Gregory|last3=Hawkes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1985|pages=218–219[/tpl] and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the "breakfast roll".
The introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Garrow |first=John |title =Feast and Famine: a History of Food and Nutrition in Ireland 1500–1920 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95|issue=3 |pages=160–161 |date = March 2002|issn=1758-1095 |pmc=1279494|doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.3.160|pmid=[/tpl] A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat [tpl]convert|18|st|kg[/tpl] of potatoes a week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.
Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a "New Irish Cuisine" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences[tpl]Cite book|title=Ireland for Dummies |first=Elizabeth |last=Albertson |publisher=Wiley Publishing |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2009 |isbn=0-470-10572-0|page=34[/tpl] has emerged.[tpl]Cite book|title=Ireland|first=Fionn|last=Davenport|publisher=Lonely Planet |place=London|year=2008 |isbn=1-74104-696-3|page=65[/tpl] This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe. An example of this new cuisine is "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.[tpl]Cite book|title=Dublin|first1=Fionn|last1=Davenport|last2=Hughes|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=London |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-710-2 |page=15|first2=Martin[/tpl] Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.
Ireland once dominated the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands)[tpl]Cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture|first=W. J. |last1=McCormack |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2001 |isbn=0-631-16525-8|page=170[/tpl] and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s,[tpl]Cite journal|first1=Brian |last1=Leavy |first2=David |last2=Wilson |title=Strategy and Leadership|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1994|page=63[/tpl] sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century.[tpl]Cite news|first1=Conor |last1=O'Clery|title=Whiskey Resists the Downturn|publisher=GlobalPost|date=25 February |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/ireland/090225/whiskey-resists-the-downturn |accessdate=2010-04-05[/tpl] In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.[tpl]Cite book|first1=Jack |last1=Blocker |first2=David |last2=Fahey |first3=Ian|last3=Tyrrell|title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|year=2003 |isbn=1-57607-833-7|page=653[/tpl]
Irish whiskey, as researched in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades.[tpl]Cite news|title=Irish Whiskey's Growth Not Just About Luck| date=19 March 2009 |first=Christina|last=Berk |url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/29636538/Irish_Whiskey_s_Growth_Not_Just_About_Luck |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=2010-04-04[/tpl] Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the "Irish coffee" (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.
Stout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.[tpl]Cite book|last=Davenport |first=Fionn |title=Discover Ireland |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2010 |location=London |page=348 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hhP4ieoRiuIC&pg=PA348 |isbn=1-74179-998-8[/tpl]
