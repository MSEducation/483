[[Idastrandia]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Idastrandia is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Its only described species, I. orientalis, is endemic to Singapore.
Kálmán Szombathy described a single male in 1915, which is about five millimeters long. There are drawings in the original description, and the male pedipalp and unusual serrate cheliceral tooth has been drawn by Proszynski in 1983. It has still not been attached to any of the current salticid groups.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 271
