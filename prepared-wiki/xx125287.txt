CATEGORIES: Catholic titular sees in Africa

Assuras, which was sometimes spelled as Assurae and even shortened Assur (not to be confused with the Assyrian capital Ashur), is a Roman Catholic titular see in the former Roman province of Proconsular Africa.
Its episcopal list (251-484) is given in Gams (p. 464).
Ruins of its temples and theatres and other public buildings are still visible at Henchir-Zenfour.
