HIV enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the adsorption of glycoproteins on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chan D, Kim P |title=HIV entry and its inhibition |journal=Cell |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=681–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9630213 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81430-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Wyatt R, Sodroski J |title=The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5371 |pages=1884–8 |year=1998 | doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1884 |pmid=9632381|bibcode = 1998Sci...280.1884W |last2=Sodroski [/tpl]
Entry to the cell begins through interaction of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) and both CD4 and a chemokine receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the cell surface. gp120 binds to integrin α4β7 activating LFA-1 the central integrin involved in the establishment of virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1.[tpl]cite journal |author=Arthos J, Cicala C, Martinelli E, Macleod K, Van Ryk D, Wei D, Xiao Z, Veenstra TD, Conrad TP, Lempicki RA, McLaughlin S, Pascuccio M, Gopaul R, McNally J, Cruz CC, Censoplano N, Chung E, Reitano KN, Kottilil S, Goode DJ, Fauci AS |title=HIV-1 envelope protein binds to and signals through integrin alpha(4)beta(7), the gut mucosal homing receptor for peripheral T cells |journal=Nature Immunology |volume=In Press |issue= 3|year=2008|pmid=18264102 |doi=10.1038/ni1566 |pages=301–9[/tpl] The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.
The first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.
After HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell.[tpl]Failed verification|date=April 2014[/tpl] During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.
HIV can infect dendritic cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, but another route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN can also be used.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pope M, Haase A |title=Transmission, acute HIV-1 infection and the quest for strategies to prevent infection |journal=Nat Med |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=847–52 |year=2003 |pmid=12835704 |doi=10.1038/nm0703-847[/tpl] DCs are one of the first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important role by transmitting HIV to T-cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0900502106|noedit[/tpl]

====Replication and transcription====

Shortly after the viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule.[tpl]cite journal | author=Zheng YH, Lovsin N, Peterlin BM | title=Newly identified host factors modulate HIV replication | journal=Immunol. Lett. | year=2005 | pages=225–34 | volume=97 | issue=2 | pmid=15752562 | doi=10.1016/j.imlet.2004.11.026 [/tpl] The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://student.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit3/viruses/hivlc.html |work=Doc Kaiser's Microbiology Home Page |title=IV. VIRUSES > F. ANIMAL VIRUS LIFE CYCLES > 3. The Life Cycle of HIV |publisher=Community College of Baltimore County |date=January 2008 [/tpl] Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.
This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors need to be present, the most important of which is NF-κB (NF kappa B), which is upregulated when T-cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.
During viral replication, the integrated DNA provirus is transcribed into mRNA, which is then spliced into smaller pieces. These small pieces are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to viral mRNAs and allows unspliced RNAs to leave the nucleus, where they are otherwise retained until spliced.[tpl]cite journal | author=Pollard VW, Malim MH | title=The HIV-1 Rev protein | journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | year=1998 | pages=491–532 | volume=52 | issue= | pmid=9891806 | doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.491 [/tpl] At this stage, the structural proteins Gag and Env are produced from the full-length mRNA. The full-length RNA is actually the virus genome; it binds to the Gag protein and is packaged into new virus particles.
HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently; HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA, whereas HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA that was used to create the Gag protein itself. This may mean that HIV-1 is better able to mutate (HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS faster than HIV-2 infection and is responsible for the majority of global infections).

====Recombination====

Two RNA genomes are encapsidated in each HIV-1 particle (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon infection and replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination between the two genomes can occur.Hu WS, Temin HM. (1990). Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription. Science 250(4985):1227–1233. PMID 1700865Charpentier C, Nora T, Tenaillon O, Clavel F, Hance AJ. (2006). Extensive recombination among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 quasispecies makes an important contribution to viral diversity in individual patients. J Virol 80(5):2472–2482. PMID 16474154 Free PMC Article Recombination occurs as the single-strand (+)RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome.  From 2 to 20 events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.
Viral recombination produces genetic variation that likely contributes to the evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy.Nora T, Charpentier C, Tenaillon O, Hoede C, Clavel F, Hance AJ. (2007).  Contribution of recombination to the evolution of human immunodeficiency viruses expressing resistance to antiretroviral treatment. J Virol 81(14):7620–7628. PMID 17494080 Free PMC Article Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.Chen J, Powell D, Hu WS. (2006). High frequency of genetic recombination is a common feature of primate lentivirus replication. J Virol 80(19):9651–9658. PMID 16973569  Free PMC Article
Bonhoeffer et al.Bonhoeffer S, Chappey C, Parkin NT, Whitcomb JM, Petropoulos CJ. (2004). Evidence for positive epistasis in HIV-1. Science 2004 306(5701):1547–1550. Erratum in: Science. 2008 May 9;320(5877):746. [tpl]DOI|10.1126/science.1101786[/tpl] PMID 15567861 Free Article suggested that template switching by the reverse transcriptase acts as a repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin suggested that recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized whether or not the two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.
HIV-1 infection causes chronic ongoing inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species.Israël N, Gougerot-Pocidalo MA. (1997). Oxidative stress in human immunodeficiency virus infection.  Cell Mol Life Sci 53(11–12):864–870.  PMID 9447238 Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, as well as for viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al.Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM (2008). Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens. Infect Genet Evol 8(3):267–285. PMID 18295550 http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.

====Assembly and release====

The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hallenberger S, Bosch V, Angliker H, Shaw E, Klenk HD, Garten W |title=Inhibition of furin-mediated cleavage activation of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160 |journal=Nature|date=November 26, 1992 |volume=360|issue=6402 |pages=358–61 |pmid=1360148 |bibcode = 1992Natur.360..358H |doi = 10.1038/360358a0 |last2=Bosch |last3=Angliker |last4=Shaw |last5=Klenk |last6=Garten [/tpl]  These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the also packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.[tpl]cite book | author= Gelderblom HR | year = 1997 | title = HIV sequence compendium | chapter = Fine structure of HIV and SIV |chapterurl=http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/COMPENDIUM/1997/partIII/Gelderblom.pdf  | editor = Los Alamos National Laboratory | edition = | pages = 31–44 | publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory [/tpl] Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.

===Genetic variability===

HIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high genetic variability. This diversity is a result of its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.[tpl]cite journal | author=Robertson DL, Hahn BH, Sharp PM. | title=Recombination in AIDS viruses | journal=J Mol Evol. | year=1995 | pages=249–59 | volume=40 | issue=3 | pmid=7723052 | doi=10.1007/BF00163230[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title=The causes and consequences of HIV evolution | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=5 |date=January 2004 | doi=10.1038/nrg1246 | pmid=14708016 | url=http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/downloadPaper.php?id=242 | issue=52–61 | last1=Rambaut |first1=A | last2=Posada | first2=D | last3=Crandall | first3=KA | last4=Holmes | first4=EC | pages=52–61[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Perelson AS, Ribeiro RM |title=Estimating drug efficacy and viral dynamic parameters: HIV and HCV |journal=Stat Med |volume=27 |issue=23 |pages=4647–57 |date=October 2008 |pmid=17960579 |doi=10.1002/sim.3116 |url=[/tpl]
This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.
The closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus,[tpl]Cite pmid|19661993[/tpl] which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response,[tpl]cite journal |author=Holzammer S, Holznagel E, Kaul A, Kurth R, Norley S |title=High virus loads in naturally and experimentally SIVagm-infected African green monkeys |journal=Virology |volume=283 |issue=2 |pages=324–31 |year=2001 |pmid=11336557 |doi=10.1006/viro.2001.0870[/tpl] does not cause the development of simian AIDS,[tpl]Cite journal | author = Kurth, R. and Norley, S. | year = 1996 | title = Why don't the natural hosts of SIV develop simian AIDS? | url =  | journal = J. NIH Res. | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 33–37 [/tpl] and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baier M, Dittmar MT, Cichutek K, Kurth R |title=Development of vivo of genetic variability of simian immunodeficiency virus |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=88 |issue=18 |pages=8126–30 |year=1991 |pmid=1896460 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.18.8126 |pmc=52459|bibcode = 1991PNAS...88.8126B |last2=Dittmar |last3=Cichutek |last4=Kurth [/tpl]
In contrast, when these strains infect species that have not adapted to SIV ("heterologous" hosts such as rhesus or cynomologus macaques), the animals develop AIDS and the virus generates genetic diversity similar to what is seen in human HIV infection.[tpl]cite journal |author=Daniel MD, King NW, Letvin NL, Hunt RD, Sehgal PK, Desrosiers RC |title=A new type D retrovirus isolated from macaques with an immunodeficiency syndrome |journal=Science |volume=223 |issue=4636 |pages=602–5 |year=1984 |pmid=6695172 |doi=10.1126/science.6695172|bibcode = 1984Sci...223..602D |last2=King |last3=Letvin |last4=Hunt |last5=Sehgal |last6=Desrosiers [/tpl] Chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz), the closest genetic relative of HIV-1, is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like symptoms in its natural host.[tpl]Cite pmid|19626114[/tpl] SIVcpz appears to have been transmitted relatively recently to chimpanzee and human populations, so their hosts have not yet adapted to the virus. This virus has also lost a function of the Nef gene that is present in most SIVs; without this function, T cell depletion is more likely, leading to immunodeficiency.
Three groups of HIV-1 have been identified on the basis of differences in the envelope (env) region: M, N, and O.[tpl]cite journal | author=Thomson MM, Perez-Alvarez L, Najera R | title=Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 genetic forms and its significance for vaccine development and therapy | journal=Lancet Infectious Diseases | year=2002 | pages=461–471 | volume=2 | issue=8 | pmid=12150845 | doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00343-2 [/tpl] Group M is the most prevalent and is subdivided into eight subtypes (or clades), based on the whole genome, which are geographically distinct. The most prevalent are subtypes B (found mainly in North America and Europe), A and D (found mainly in Africa), and C (found mainly in Africa and Asia); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1. Coinfection with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs.[tpl]cite journal | author=Osmanov S, Pattou C, Walker N, Schwardlander B, Esparza J; WHO-UNAIDS Network for HIV Isolation and Characterization | title=Estimated global distribution and regional spread of HIV-1 genetic subtypes in the year 2000 | journal=Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome | year=2002 | pages=184–190 | volume=29 | issue=2 | pmid=11832690 [/tpl] Most HIV-1 research is focused on subtype B; few laboratories focus on the other subtypes.[tpl]cite journal | author=Perrin L, Kaiser L, Yerly S. | title=Travel and the spread of HIV-1 genetic variants | journal=Lancet Infect Dis. | year=2003 | pages=22–27 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pmid=12505029 | doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00484-5 [/tpl] The existence of a fourth group, "P", has been hypothesised based on a virus isolated in 2009. The strain is apparently derived from gorilla SIV (SIVgor), first isolated from western lowland gorillas in 2006.
The genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsmm.

==Diagnosis==

Many HIV-positive people are unaware that they are infected with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.
HIV-1 testing is initially by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate.[tpl]cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title=Revised guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral | journal=MMWR Recomm Rep | year=2001 | pages=1–57 | volume=50 | issue=RR–19 | pmid=11718472 [/tpl] If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., Western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by Western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate Western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.[tpl]cite journal| author=Celum CL, Coombs RW, Lafferty W, Inui TS, Louie PH, Gates CA, McCreedy BJ, Egan R, Grove T, Alexander S, et al. | title=Indeterminate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 western blots: seroconversion risk, specificity of supplemental tests, and an algorithm for evaluation | journal=J Infect Dis | year=1991 | pages=656–664 | volume=164 | issue=4 | pmid=1894929| doi=10.1093/infdis/164.4.656 [/tpl]
Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate Western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.
Modern HIV testing is extremely accurate. A single screening test is correct more than 99% of the time.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chou R, Huffman LH, Fu R, Smits AK, Korthuis PT |title=Screening for HIV: a review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=55–73 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15998755 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=143&page=55 [/tpl][tpl]update inline|PMID 23256218|date=January 2013[/tpl] The chance of a false-positive result in standard two-step testing protocol is estimated to be about 1 in 250,000 in a low risk population. Testing post exposure is recommended initially and at six weeks, three months, and six months.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tolle MA, Schwarzwald HL |title=Postexposure prophylaxis against human immunodeficiency virus |journal=American Family Physician |date=July 15, 2010 |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=161–6 |pmid=20642270[/tpl]

==Research==

HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
Currently, no cure for HIV/AIDS exists. The most universally recommended method for the prevention of HIV/AIDS is to avoid blood-to-blood contact between people and to practice safe sex. The most recommended method for treating HIV is to receive attention from a doctor in charge of coordinating the patient's management of HIV/AIDS.
Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV.

In the beginning, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it, for example, lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus.[tpl]Cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | title=Persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy among homosexual males|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001096.htm | journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |year=1982 | pages=249–251 | volume=31| issue=19 | pmid=6808340 | accessdate =August 31, 2011[/tpl] They also used Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981.[tpl]Cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | title=Opportunistic infections and Kaposi's sarcoma among Haitians in the United States |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001123.htm | journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |year=1982 | pages=353–354; 360–361 | volume=31 | issue=26 | pmid=6811853 | accessdate =August 31, 2011[/tpl] In the general press, the term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had been coined. The CDC, in search of a name, and looking at the infected communities coined "the 4H disease," as it seemed to single out Haitians, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and heroin users. However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community, it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982.[ref]

In 1983, two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier independently declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science.[tpl]cite journal |author=RC Gallo, PS Sarin, EP Gelmann, M Robert-Guroff, E Richardson, VS Kalyanaraman, D Mann, GD Sidhu, RE Stahl, S Zolla-Pazner, J Leibowitch, and M Popovic | journal=Science |title=Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | year=1983 | pages=865–867 | volume=220 |doi=10.1126/science.6601823 | pmid=6601823 | issue=4599|bibcode = 1983Sci...220..865G [/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.6189183|noedit[/tpl] Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from an AIDS patient was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III.  At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two classic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I.  Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.[tpl]cite book|last=Aldrich|first=ed. by Robert|title=Who's who in gay and lesbian history.|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415229746|pages=154|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9KA7_1s6w-QC&pg=PA154|coauthors=Wotherspoon, Garry[/tpl]

===Origins===

Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa and to have transferred to humans (a process known as zoonosis) in the early 20th century.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sharp|first=PM|coauthors=Hahn, BH|title=Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=September 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=a006841|pmid=22229120|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006841|pmc=3234451[/tpl] HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes).[tpl]cite journal |author=Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, et al. |title=Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718|pages=436–41|date=February 1999 |pmid=9989410 |doi=10.1038/17130 |url=|bibcode = 1999Natur.397..436G[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Keele BF, van Heuverswyn F, Li YY, Bailes E, Takehisa J, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Chen Y, Wain LV, Liegois F, Loul S, Mpoudi Ngole E, Bienvenue Y, Delaporte E, Brookfield JFY, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Peeters M, Hahn BH | title=Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 | journal=Science |date=July 28, 2006| volume=313 | issue=5786 | pages=523–6 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126531 | pmc=2442710 |pmid=16728595 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313..523K [/tpl] The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an old world monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire).[tpl]cite journal | author=Reeves JD, Doms RW | title=Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal=J.

HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sharp |first1=PM |last2=Bailes |first2=E |last3=Chaudhuri |first3=RR |last4=Rodenburg |first4=CM |last5=Santiago|first5=MO |last6=Hahn |first6=BH |title=The origins of acquired immune deficiency syndrome viruses: where and when? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|volume=356 |pages=867–76 |year=2001 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.0863 |pmid=11405934|pmc=1088480|url=http://www.aidsorigins.com/pdfs/rs/sharp.pdf |issue=1410[/tpl]
There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kalish ML, Wolfe ND, Ndongmo CD, McNicholl J, Robbins KE, et al. |title=Central African hunters exposed to simian immunodeficiency virus |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=1928–30 |year=2005|pmid=16485481 |doi=10.3201/eid1112.050394 |pmc=3367631[/tpl] However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[tpl]cite journal |author=Marx PA, Alcabes PG, Drucker E |title=Serial human passage of simian immunodeficiency virus by unsterile injections and the emergence of epidemic human immunodeficiency virus in Africa |volume=356 |issue=1410 |pages=911–20 |year=2001 |pmid=11405938 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |pmc=1088484 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.0867|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1410/911.full.pdf[/tpl] Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more of high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.
Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Worobey |first1=M |last2=Gemmel |first2=M|last3=Teuwen |first3=DE |last4=Haselkorn |first4=T |last5=Kunstman |first5=K |last6=Bunce|first6=M |last7=Muyembe |first7=JJ |last8=Kabongo |first8=JMM |last9=Kalengayi |first9=RM |title=Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7213 |pages=661–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18833279 |doi=10.1038/nature07390 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7213/full/nature07390.html |bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W |pmc=3682493[/tpl] Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sousa |first1=João Dinis de |last2=Müller |first2=Viktor|last3=Lemey |first3=Philippe |last4=Vandamme |first4=Anne-Mieke |last5=Vandamme |first5=Anne-Mieke |title=High GUD incidence in the early 20th century created a particularly permissive time window for the origin and initial spread of epidemic HIV strains |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e9936|year=2010 |pmid=20376191 |pmc=2848574|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009936|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009936|editor1-last=Martin |editor1-first=Darren P[/tpl] While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.
An alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Chitnis |first1=A |last2=Rawls|first2=D |last3=Moore |first3=J |title=Origin of HIV type 1 in colonial French equatorial Africa? |journal=AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10628811|doi=10.1089/088922200309548 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Donald G McNeil, Jr|coauthors= |title=Precursor to H.I.V. was in monkeys for millennia |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/health/17aids.html?_r=1&src=me&ref=general |quote=Dr. Marx believes that the crucial event was the introduction into Africa of millions of inexpensive, mass-produced syringes in the 1950s. ... suspect that the growth of colonial cities is to blame.
