Donald SmithCampus Times, March 10, 2000 (born September 13, 1974), better known by his stage name Lil' ½ Dead, is an American hip hop recording artist from Long Beach, California. Smith's moniker is based on the character Half Dead, in the 1979 film Penitentiary. He is the cousin of fellow hip hop artists Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy, and Snoop Dogg.
The song "Lil Ghetto Boy" (from Dr. Dre's The Chronic) has a brief reference to Smith, as do "Fuck You" and "Housewife", both from Dr. Dre's 2001, as well as "Hennesey N Buddah" from Snoop Dogg's Tha Last Meal.
