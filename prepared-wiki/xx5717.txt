[[Kashrut]]

CATEGORIES: Kashrut, Hebrew words and phrases, Jewish cuisine

Kashrut (also kashruth or kashrus, [tpl]Hebrew|כַּשְׁרוּת[/tpl]) is the set of Jewish religious dietary laws. Food that may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kashér ([tpl]Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר[/tpl]), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption).
Among the numerous laws that form part of kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of unclean animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea) and most insects, with the exception of certain species of kosher locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a process known as shechita. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact on the suitability of food for consumption.
Most of the basic laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and practical application, however, are set down in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. While the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, many reasons have been suggested, including philosophical, practical and hygienic.
Over the past century, there have developed numerous rabbinical organizations that certify products, manufacturers, and restaurants as kosher, usually using a symbol (called a hechsher) to indicate their support. Presently, about a sixth of American Jews or .3% of the American population fully keep kosher, and many more abstain from some non-kosher foods, especially pork.

==Explanations==

===Philosophical explanations===

Jewish philosophy divides the 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws that do not have a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why.William H. Shea, Clean and Unclean Meats, Biblical Research Institute, December 1998 (archived from the original on February 12, 2008) However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.Mishneh Torah Korbanot, Temurah 4:13 (in eds. Frankel; "Rambam L'Am")
Some theologians have said that the laws of kashrut are symbolic in character: Kosher animals represent virtues, while non-kosher animals represent vices. The 1st century BCE Letter of Aristeas argues that the laws "have been given ... to awake pious thoughts and to form the character".Letter of Aristeas, 145–154 This view reappears in the work of the 19th century Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|year =1971|title=Dietary Laws|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Judaica|publisher=Keter Publishing House|location=Jerusalem[/tpl]
The Torah prohibits "seething the kid (goat, sheep, calf) in its mother's milk". While the Bible does not provide a reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive.[tpl]cite book| last = Gottlieb| first = Roger S.| title = The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology| url = http://books.google.com/?id=_LldeLvqQNsC&pg=PA45| accessdate = October 18, 2012| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford Handbooks Online| isbn = 0-19-517872-6| page = 45 [/tpl] quoting Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:1[tpl]cite book| last = Chill| first = Abraham| authorlink = Abraham Chill| title = The mitzvot: the commandments and their rationale| year = 1974| publisher = Bloch Publishing Company| isbn = 0-8197-0376-1| page = 114 [/tpl]
Hasidism believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with Divinity, the activation of which it sees as helping the Divine Presence to be drawn into the physical world;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73827/jewish/The-Chassidic-Masters-on-Food.htm |title=The Chassidic Masters on Food and Eating |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Schneersohn |first=Yosef Yitzchak |authorlink=Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn |publisher=Chabad.org[/tpl] Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed sparks of holiness, interact with various animals. These sparks of Holiness are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a holy reason (which includes eating);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73850/jewish/Meat.htm |title=Meat |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Tauber |first=Yanki |publisher=Chabad.org[/tpl] however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their sparks of holiness.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7887/jewish/Chapter-8.htm |title=The Tanya Chapter 8 |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Borukhovich |first=Shneur Zalman |publisher=Chabad.org[/tpl] The Hasidic argument is that  animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually clean and ritually unclean.Re'eh, rabbifriedman.org (archived from the original on August 29, 2007).
According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, the purpose of kashrut was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted.Gordon J. Wenham, The Theology of Unclean Food, The Evangelical Quarterly 53, January March 1981, pp.6–15 Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.

===Health explanations===

There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose, one of the earliest being from Maimonides in his Guide for the Perplexed.  In 1953, David Macht, an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of biblical scientific foresight, conducted toxicity experiments on many kinds of animals and fish.[tpl]Cite journal| title= An Experimental Pharmalogical Appreciation of Leviticus XI and Deuteronomy XIV | url=http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/Macht1953.pdf | author = Macht, Dr. David I. |date=September–October 1953 | publisher=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=XXXVII |issue=5 |pages=444–450|format=pdf| ref= harv| postscript= .[/tpl] His experiment involved lupin seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually unclean meat inhibited the seedling's growth more than that from ritually clean meats.[tpl]Harvnb|Macht|1953[/tpl] op. cit. At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar Lester L. Grabbe, writing in the Oxford Bible Commentary on Leviticus, states that "an explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section [tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|11-15|JPR[/tpl] have hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the 'unclean' animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is sometimes asserted."The Oxford Bible Commentary, eds. J. Barton and J. Muddiman. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001: 99.

==Prohibited foods==

The laws of kashrut can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition (Biblical or rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.[tpl]cite book| last = Forst| first = Binyomin| title = The laws of kashrus: a comprehensive exposition of their underlying concepts and applications| year = 1994| publisher = Mesorah Publications| location = Brooklyn, N.Y| isbn = 0-89906-103-6| pages = 32–49 [/tpl]
Biblically prohibited foods include:
Biblically prohibited mixtures include:
Rabbinically prohibited foods include:

===Permitted and forbidden animals===

Only meat from particular species is permissible.  Mammals that both chew their cud (ruminate) and have cloven hooves can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other (the camel, the hyrax, and the hare because they have no cloven hooves, and the pig because it does not ruminate) are specifically excluded ([tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:3–8|JPR[/tpl]).Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 79For a comprehensive review of the issue involving the difficulty that neither the hyrax nor the hare are ruminants, see  [tpl]cite book| last = Slifkin| first = Rabbi Nosson | authorlink=Natan Slifkin| title = The Camel, the Hare & the Hyrax: A Study of the Laws of Animals with One Kosher Sign in Light of Modern Zoology| url = http://books.google.com/?id=cHsRAQAAIAAJ| edition = illustrated| year = 2004| publisher = Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim| isbn = 978-1-56871-312-0 [/tpl]. In 2008, a rabbinical ruling determined that giraffes and their milk are eligible to be considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud, characteristics of animals considered kosher.  Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards.  Although kosher, the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/2084281/Giraffe-is-kosher-Israeli-vets-have-ruled.html |title=Giraffe is kosher, rabbis rule in Israel |last=Butcher |first=Tim |date=June 6, 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=April 10, 2013[/tpl]Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 82:1–5[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com-archive.info/articles/giraffe/ |title=What's the Truth About Giraffe Meat! |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]
Non-kosher birds are listed outright ([tpl]Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:12–18|JPR[/tpl]) but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned).  The MishnahBavli Chullin 3:22–23 refers to four signs provided by the sages.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part2/ |title=Is Turkey Kosher?, part 2 |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]  First, a dores (predatory bird) is not kosher.  Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics:  an extra toe in the back (which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg), a zefek (crop), and a korkoban (gizzard) with a peelable lumen.  However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition (masorah) is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is turkey.  There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the signs (simanim in Hebrew).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part3/ |title=Is Turkey Kosher?, part 3 |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]
Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher ([tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9–12|JPR[/tpl]). Shellfish and other non-fish water fauna are not kosher.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 83 and 84 Here is a list of kosher species of fish. Insects are not kosher except for certain species of kosher locust.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 85  Generally any animal that eats other animals, whether they kill their food or eat carrion ([tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13–31|JPR[/tpl]), is not kosher, as well as any animal that was partially eaten by other animals ([tpl]Bibleverse||Exodus|22:30-31|JPR[/tpl]).

===Separation of meat and milk===

Meat and milk (or derivatives) cannot be mixed ([tpl]Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21|JPR[/tpl]) in the sense that meat and dairy products are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together. Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 87 et seq The milchig and fleishig utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to Yiddish delineations between dairy and meat (lit. milky and meaty) utensils and dishes respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/kashrut.html |title=Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]

===Kosher slaughter===

Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual (a shochet) using a special method of slaughter, shechita ([tpl]Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|12:21|JPR[/tpl]). Among other features, shechita slaughter severs the jugular vein, carotid artery, esophagus, and trachea in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp knife. Failure of any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 1–65 These conditions (treifot) include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats (chelev) and the sciatic nerves from the legs.  As much blood as possible must be removed ([tpl]Bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10|JPR[/tpl]) through the kashering process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the liver, as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an open flame.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 66–78 Fish (and kosher locusts, for those follow the traditions permitting them) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.[tpl]cite web|title=ABCs of Kosher|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/m/mm/48958906.html|publisher=Aish HaTorah|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Locusts Go Biblical — But Are They Kosher?|url=http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/172409/locusts-go-biblical-but-are-they-kosher/|publisher=The Forward|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]

===Kosher utensils===

Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, depending on the material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch. Food prepared in a manner that violates the Shabbat (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 318:1

===Passover laws===

Passover has special dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating leavened bread or derivatives of this, which are known as chametz. This prohibition is derived from [tpl]Bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|JPR[/tpl]. Utensils used in preparing and serving chametz are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed (kashered).Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 431–452 Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of kashrut, such as not eating gebrochts[tpl]cite web |url=http://oukosher.org/blog/industrial-kosher/keeping-up-with-passover-trenditions/ |title=Keeping Up with Passover Trenditions |last=Brenner |first=Bayla Sheva |website=OUKosher.org |publisher=Orthodox Union |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl] or garlic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/493085/jewish/Which-vegetables-may-be-eaten-on-Passover.htm |title=Which vegetables may be eaten on Passover? |last=Davidson |first=Baruch S. |website=Chabad.org |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]

===Produce of the Land of Israel===

Biblical rules also control the use of agriculture produce.  For produce grown in the Land of Israel a modified version of the  biblical tithes must be applied, including Terumat HaMaaser, Maaser Rishon, Maaser Sheni, and Maaser Ani (untithed produce is called tevel); the fruit of the first three years of a tree's growth or replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as orlah;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-medi-terumos.htm|title=Terumos and Ma’asros |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Heinemann |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Heinemann |publisher=Star-K[/tpl] produce grown in the Land of Israel on the seventh year obtains k'dushat shvi'it, and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of the Shmita (Sabbatical Year). Some rules of kashrut are subject to different rabbinical opinions. For example, many hold that the rule against eating chadash (new grain) before the 16th of the month Nisan does not apply outside the Land of Israel.[tpl]cite web|title=What is "Yashan"?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/584873/jewish/What-is-Yashan.htm|last=Posner|first=Menachem|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]

===Vegetables===

Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael.[tpl]cite web|title=Are vegan restaurants automatically kosher?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/547235/jewish/Are-vegan-restaurants-kosher.htm|last=Posner|first=Eliezer|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.[tpl]cite web|title=Why Check for Insects?|url=http://star-k.org/cons-insectintro.php|publisher=Star-K|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]

===Pareve foods===

Some processes convert a meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese,The rennet must be kosher, either microbial or from special productions of animal rennet using kosher calf stomachs.Oukosher.org, Retrieved August 10, 2005. but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.[tpl]cite web|title=Meat, Dairy and Pareve|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=63|publisher=OK Kosher Certification|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]
Kashrut has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for those with allergies, vegetarians, or adherents to other religious statutes. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue, and that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry "milk" warnings.[tpl]cite web|title=Kosher Consumer Misconsumptions|url=http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-KosherConsumerMisconsumptions.htm|publisher=Star-K|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]

==Supervision and marketing==

===Hashgacha===

Certain foods must be prepared in whole or in part by Jews. This includes grape wine,Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 114 certain cooked foods (bishul akum),Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 113 cheese (g'vinat akum), and according to some also butter (chem'at akum);Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 115 dairy products (Hebrew: חלב ישראל chalav Yisrael "milk of Israel");Many rely on lenient rulings by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in Teshuvot Igrot Moshe, Yoreh De'ah 1:47 and other 20th century rabbinic authorities who rule that strict government supervision prevents the admixture of non-kosher milk, making supervision unnecessary.

===Product labeling standards===

Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients.  Such "hidden" ingredients may include lubricants and flavorings, among other additives; in some cases, for instance, the use of natural flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-kosher substances.[tpl]cite web|title=What foods are kosher?|url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/307920/jewish/Kosher-Foods.htm|publisher=Oxford Chabad Society|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high rate of mislabeling, which may result in a non-kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html |title=Tests Reveal Mislabeling of Fish |last=Rosenthal |first=Elizabeth |date=May 26, 2011 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl]
Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as kosher: this involves a visit to the manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization, who will inspect the production methods and contents, and if everything is sufficiently kosher a certificate would be issued.[tpl]cite web|title=How to choose a kosher certification|url=http://www.kashrut.com/trade/trade_links/hechsher/|publisher=Kashrut.com|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]
Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as hechsherim.[tpl]cite web|title=About this web-site|url=http://www.hechshers.info/about.htm|publisher=Hechshers.info|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] Due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations, the hechsheirim of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities.[tpl]cite web|title=Kosher Certification|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113474/jewish/Kosher-Certification.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl] The certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, who use a U inside a circle, symbolising the initials of Orthodox Union. A single K is sometimes used as a symbol for kosher, but since many countries do not allow letters to be trademarked (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.[tpl]cite web|title=Glossary of Kosher Terms|url=http://www.kosherfest.com/about-kosher/glossary-of-kosher-terms|publisher=Kosherfest|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]
Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law; the categorisation may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as dairy, but legal classification does not.
In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.[tpl]cite web|title=Kosher Supervision|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=116|publisher=OK Kosher Certification|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]
Products labeled kosher-style are non-kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef hot dogs,[tpl]Cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Know your wiener! | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc. | date = July 8, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/08/know-your-wiener/ | accessdate = July 31, 2010[/tpl] or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with Ashkenazi practices, like dill pickles.[tpl]Cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Origins of neon relish and other Chicago hot dog conundrums  | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc.  | date = July 20, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/20/chicago-hot-dog-yellow-mustard-neon-green-relish#pickle | accessdate = July 31, 2010[/tpl] The designation usually refers to delicatessen items.

===History of kosher marketing===

In 1911 Procter & Gamble became the first company to advertise one of their products, Crisco, as kosher. Over the next two decades, companies such as Lender's Bagels, Maxwell House, Manischewitz, and Empire evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf-space. In the 1960s, Hebrew National hotdogs launched a "we answer to a higher authority" campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, "kosher" became a symbol for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it more opportunities for kosher products. Menachem Lubinsky, founder of the Kosherfest trade fair, estimates as many as [tpl]Nowrap|14 million[/tpl] kosher consumers and [tpl]Nowrap|$40 billion[/tpl] in sales of kosher products in the USA.[ref]

===Legal usage===

Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling, unless it can be shown that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws are often defined differently in different jurisdictions. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.[tpl]cite web|last=Popovsky|first=Mark|title=The Constitutional Complexity of Kosher Food Laws|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jlsp/pdf/Fall%202010/Popovsky.JLSP.44.1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=March 15, 2013[/tpl]

==Society and culture==

===Adherence===

About one-sixth of American Jews maintain the kosher diet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kosher-carbon-footprint |title=Is Keeping Kosher Good for the Environment? |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |last=Gertz |first=Emily |work=Scientific American[/tpl] Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or not drinking milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one analysis of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ats-sea.agr.gc.ca/info/6116-eng.htm|title=The Specialty Food Market in North America|date=March 2012|publisher=Agri-Food Trade Service, Canada|work=Market Information[/tpl] A sizable non-Jewish segment of the population views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods, often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kosher-directory.com/whoeats.htm |title=Who Eats Kosher?

===Linguistics===

Kosher ([tpl]lang-he|כשר[/tpl]) in Ancient Hebrew means be advantageous, proper, suitable, or succeed [tpl]cite web |url=http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/BDB.pdf |title=A Hebrew and English lexicon of the Old Testament |publisher=Palmer Theological Seminary[/tpl] according to the Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon.  In Modern Hebrew, it generally refers to kashrut but can also sometimes mean "proper". For example, the Babylonian Talmud uses kosher in the sense of virtuous, when referring to Darius I as a "kosher king"; Darius, a Persian King, assisted in building the Second Temple.Tractate Rosh Hashanah 3b, Schottenstein Edition, Mesorah Publications Ltd. In English, kosher often means legitimate, acceptable, permissible, genuine, or authentic.[tpl]cite book| author = Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor| title = The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: Volume 2, J-Z| url = http://books.google.com/?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&pg=PA388| year = 2006| publisher = Taylor & Francis| isbn = 0-415-25938-X| page = 388 [/tpl][tpl]cite book| author = B.A. Phythian| title = A concise dictionary of English slang and colloquialisms| year = 1976| publisher = The Writer, Inc| isbn = 0-87116-099-4| page = 110| quote = Kosher Genuine.

The word kosher is also part of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an abbreviation of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_pkwhat.htm |title=FROM PICKLE DAY EXHIBITS: What is a Pickle? |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |last1=Bowen |first1=Dana |last2=Ralph |first2=Nancy |publisher=New York Food Museum[/tpl] and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.
