==History==

When it was implemented on December 1, 1993, 810 was Michigan's first new area code since 1961 and received much fanfare. It originally served all suburbs of Detroit north of Wayne County and communities farther north that were formerly served by 313.
Only four years later, Oakland County was split off as area code 248.  This led to a situation in which residents of southwest Macomb County could leave their area code area by traveling one or two miles westwards, but reenter it by continuing west for another 30 miles.
In the early 21st century, when area code 586, including most of Macomb County, was split off from 810, only the northern communities of Macomb and Oakland counties remained served by 810.

==In popular culture==

Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith (Eminem) refers to area code 810 while freestyling as he fixes his car in the movie 8 Mile to insult "posers" who live in upperclass southern Oakland County suburbs (which was part of the area code in 1995 when the movie was set) instead of the lower income area code 313, which serves Detroit and Wayne County.

==Prior usage for TWX==

The 810 area code (along with area codes 510, 710, and 910) was used prior to 1981 by AT&T for their TWX, or TeletypeWriter eXchange network. (Canada's TWX was area code 610.) These US area codes were decommissioned for TWX usage in 1981 when Western Union, who had acquired the TWX network in 1969 from AT&T and renamed it Telex II, upgraded the network to "4-row" ASCII operation (it previously used both "3-row" Baudot and ASCII transmission).
