Canora is a commuter rail station on the AMT's Deux-Montagnes Line in the west end of the Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, just east of Mount Royal. It is just outside the west portal of the Mount Royal Tunnel. Canora is also one of the three existing stations to be part of the new Mascouche Line, which is due to enter service in 2014.

==History==

The station is located at 7300, Canora Road, immediately northwest of Jean Talon Street.
The station takes its name from Canora Road, which in turn takes its name from the first operator of this line, the CAnadian NOrthern RAilway, which built the line and operated it for a short time before it was merged into Canadian National Railway.
From the opening of the Deux-Montagnes Line in 1918 until the modernization of the line, which took place between 1993 and 1995, the station was called Portal Heights because of its location at the northwest end of the Mount Royal Tunnel.
