CATEGORIES: Rivers of New Hampshire

The Winnicut River is a 9.1 mile long (14.6 km)New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system river in the Seacoast region of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is the major southeastern tributary of Great Bay, an estuary connected by way of the tidal Piscataqua River to the Atlantic Ocean.
The Winnicut River rises at the northern outlet of Line Swamp in the town of North Hampton, New Hampshire, just west of Interstate 95.  The river flows north through gently rolling fields and large-lot suburban development, eventually entering the town of Greenland.  It crosses New Hampshire Route 33 and becomes a tidal river for its remaining mile to Great Bay.
