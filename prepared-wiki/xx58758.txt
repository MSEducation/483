Peter Geoffrey Brock, AM (26 February 1945 – 8 September 2006) otherwise known as "Peter Perfect", "The King of the Mountain" or simply as "Brocky" was one of Australia's best-known and most successful motor racing drivers. Brock was most often associated with Holden for almost 40 years, although he raced vehicles of other manufacturers including BMW, Ford, Volvo, Porsche and Peugeot.[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=20&docid=28504 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011103303/http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=20&docid=28504 |title=STATEMENT - Peter Brock |publisher=GM Media |date=2006-09-08 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |archivedate=2007-10-11[/tpl] He won the Bathurst 1000 endurance race nine times, the Sandown 500 touring car race nine times, the Australian Touring Car Championship three times, the Bathurst 24 Hour once and was inducted into the V8 Supercar Hall of Fame in 2001. Brock's business activities included the Holden Dealer Team (HDT) that produced Brock's racing machines as well as a number of modified high-performance road versions of his racing cars.

==Early years==

Brock was born at the Epworth Hospital, Richmond, Victoria, the son of Geoff and Ruth Brock (née Laidlay).[tpl]cite news |newspaper = The Argus |location= Melbourne |date= March 1945-03-07 |page= 2 |title= Births |via = Historic Australian Newspapers, National Library of Australia |url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1098208[/tpl] The family lived in the country town of Hurstbridge (now an outer suburb of Melbourne) and Brock continued to live there throughout his life.[tpl]cite episode |title= Peter Brock  |date= 2006-09-11 |series= Talking Heads |network= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |transcript= transcript |transcripturl = http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1735343.htm |quote= Well, I grew up with three brothers in a town called Hurstbridge, outer suburban area from Melbourne.

==Racing career==

===Bathurst===

thumb|left|Brock's Bathurst winning ToranaIn 1969 he raced in the Bathurst 500, as it was then known, Australia's most prestigious endurance road race and won it for the first time in 1972 (the last year the race was run over 500 miles and the last year in which driving solo was permitted). Brock would win the event a total of nine times between 1972 and 1987, a feat that has not been equalled. His 1979 win was remarkable in that he claimed the flag by six laps, a record that (due to changes in race regulations introduced in the mid-late 1980s, most notably the introduction of the Safety Car in 1987) may never be broken, and broke the circuit lap record for touring cars on the 163rd and final lap of the race. Brock had tried to set the lap record on the final lap of the 1978 race, but he was inadvertently balked by the Alfa Romeo of Ray Gulson through The Dipper. In 32 starts at Bathurst he claimed pole position a record six times (1974, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1983 and 1989), with all bar his 1989 pole in a Ford Sierra RS500 being for Holden. Brock also sat on pole for the 1997 V8 Supercars race but the time was set by his co-driver Mark Skaife. His record at this race earned him the titles King of the Mountain and the Bradman of Bathurst after Australia's record breaking cricketer of the 1930s and 1940s Don Bradman, although Brock himself cared little for the latter title.

===Sandown===

Along with his record at the Bathurst race, Brock also claimed victory in the traditional lead up race to Bathurst, the Sandown 500, nine times, including a string of seven consecutive wins from 1975 until 1981. He won a total of 37 races during his career in the Australian Touring Car/V8 Supercar championships, a record only eventually equalled by Mark Skaife in 2006 and beaten in 2007.[tpl]cite news |author = Ray Kershler |title = Nine Wins Made Brock the Bradman of Bathurst and a household name |work = The Saturday Daily Telegraph |publisher = News Ltd |page = 46 |date = 9 September 2006 |accessdate = 2006-09-08 [/tpl]

===Standing in community===

As the lead driver for the Holden Dealer Team in a succession of both 6 and 8 cylinder Holden Toranas and later, V8 Commodores the smooth-talking clean-cut Brock became a household name that transcended motor racing as he emerged to be one of the best-known modern Australia and New Zealand racing drivers, spoken of with the same reverence as Formula One World Champions Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and Denny Hulme.
Brock and the Holden Dealer Team worked in partnership, with full factory approval and assistance, to produce a number of high-performance modifications to the Commodores under existing CAMS Group C regulations from 1980 to 1987. Some of these were HDT "homologation specials", one step away from race cars. It was around this time that Brock began his run of six Bathurst 1000 wins in seven years with a pair of hat trick wins from 1978-80 (with Jim Richards) and 1982-84 (with Larry Perkins and John Harvey), including his record breaking six-lap victory with in the 1979 event.
In 1986, Brock was crowned King of Moomba by the Melbourne-based festival committee.[tpl]cite web |author=Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen |date=17 February 2006 |title=Moomba: A festival for the people.: |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060825203938/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf |publisher=City of Melbourne |pages=17–22 |archivedate=25 August 2006[/tpl]

===International Racing===

Peter Brock's first international race came in 1971 when Harry Firth made a late decision to enter the HDT in the touring car race at the Macau Grand Prix. Driving one of the team's old Series Production LC Torana GTR XU-1's, Brock finished second behind 1971 European Touring Car Champion Dieter Glemser, who according to Brock in his regular "Auto Action" column, drove a full works Ford Capri 2600. Ford rival Allan Moffat also raced in his GTHO Falcon, but struggled throughout the meeting with tyre troubles and wasn't a factor in the race being some 20 seconds per lap slower than the Torana. Brock claimed that scrutineering was almost non-existent at Macau, while Firth would describe Glemser's Capri and the Alfa Romeo GTA of third placed Hong Kong driver Albert Poon as "pretty damned rude" for not being strictly production cars as they were supposed to be. 
Unlike several other Australian drivers including Alan Jones and Larry Perkins, Brock did not seek a full-time racing career outside Australia. He did attempt the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times in privateer vehicles, firstly in 1976 in the Team Brock BMW 3.0CSL which was bought in South Africa in late 1975 and shipped to Melbourne where it was completely stripped and rebuilt. His co-driver was former Aussie and UK resident Brian Muir with the BMW lasting 17 hours before a head gasket blew. He then returned for the 1981 race teamed with former HDT team mate Colin Bond and Bathurst co-driver Jim Richards in the Porsche Cars Australia #74 Porsche 924 Carrera GTR but while the team practiced, they were only named as a reserve, not participating in the race itself.
While at the 1983 Australian Grand Prix meeting at Calder Park, sports car racer and 1976 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 winner John Fitzpatrick challenged Brock, that having won everything there was to win in Australia he should try his hand overseas with the 'big boys', meaning Le Mans. After millionaire businessman and racer Bob Jane got involved with sponsorship through his Bob Jane T-Marts, a deal was completed to race a Porsche 956B rented from John Fitzpatrick Racing in 1984. With regular HDT co-driver Larry Perkins, Brock finished 21st at the 1000 km of Silverstone after spending time in the pits fixing a broken rear suspension. The pair then drove in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Perkins qualified the car 15th with a time of 3:35.340 which was 18.29 seconds slower than the pole winning works Lancia LC2 of Bob Wollek (Brock was 2 seconds slower than Perkins, though his times were set on race tyres while Perkins was given a set of qualifiers). After a good start by Perkins in the hot conditions, Team Australia were running as high as 5th at one stage of the race before retiring after Perkins crashed in the Esses on lap 145 while trying to make up for lost time, which included a lost wheel while Brock was in the car, and a broken rear bolt which caused Perkins to almost spin the Porsche at close to [tpl]Convert|350|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl] while racing flat out through the kink on the famous Mulsanne Straight.[ref]
