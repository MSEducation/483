Yorkshire Bridge is a landmark former packhorse bridge in the English county of Derbyshire.
Yorkshire Bridge crosses the River Derwent to the south of the dam of the Ladybower Reservoir from which the river has emerged and is north of the village of Thornhill. It gives its name to a public house on the nearby A6013 road that is popular with walkers. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way has its northern terminus in the woods overlooking the reservoir.
Yorkshire Bridge is also the name of a small hamlet at [tpl]gbmapping|SK200850[/tpl] near the Ladybower Reservoir dam. Administratively the area forms part of the civil parish of Aston and the district of High Peak. The people who built the Dam wall lived in the houses at Yorkshire Bridge.
