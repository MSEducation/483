Santa and the Three Bears is a 1970 animated featurette, which aired on television regularly during the holiday season. It was later released on video in 1992 by Kids Klassics and distributed by GoodTimes Home Video in the VHS format.
Originally this 46 minute feature contained live-action sequences that ran for 2 minutes at the beginning of the film, and 2 minutes at the end. These live-action sequences featured the park ranger and his two young grandchildren sitting by the fireplace and Christmas tree, and a short montage of mechanical toys, Christmas decorations, and a pet kitten during the opening and closing credits. Since 1992 VHS and DVD releases of this feature have edited out all of the live-action footage, and the opening credit sequence has been re-edited over animation.
The film was originally pitched to TV networks, who rejected it as it lacked a villain, but was then shown in theatres instead.

==Plot summary==

Two young bears, Nikomi and Chinook, know nothing of Christmas until the local park ranger tells them about the legend, and they become curious to meet Santa Claus. Their mother, Nana, is preparing for Winter hibernation and cynically tells her children that there is no Santa, but they are determined to believe. Mother finds it impossible to begin their sleep, since the young cubs wish to stay awake until Santa arrives.
