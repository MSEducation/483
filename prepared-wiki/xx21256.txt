The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) is a non-profit organization founded in 1996 by magician and skeptic James Randi. The JREF's mission includes educating the public and the media on the dangers of accepting unproven claims, and to support research into paranormal claims in controlled scientific experimental conditions.
The organization administers the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offers a prize of one million U.S. dollars which it will pay out to anyone who can demonstrate a supernatural or paranormal ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria. The JREF also maintains a legal defense fund to assist persons who are attacked as a result of their investigations and criticism of people who make paranormal claims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4372 |title=Prove Your Supernatural Power and Get Rich |publisher=Skeptoid.com |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]
The organization is funded through member contributions, grants, and conferences. The JREF website publishes a (nominally daily) blog at randi.org, Swift, which includes the latest JREF news and information, as well as exposés of paranormal claimants.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog.html |title = JREF Swift Blog |accessdate = 2014-01-04[/tpl] JREF Swift Blog

==History==

The JREF officially came into existence on February 29, 1996, when it was registered as a nonprofit corporation in the State of Delaware in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url = https://delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/controller?JSPName=GINAMESEARCH&action=Get+Entity+Details&frmFileNumber=2597632|title = Department of State: Division of Corporations - Entity Details - The James Randi Educational Foundation|accessdate = 2012-03-03[/tpl] Delaware Dept. of State, Division of Corporations official website, Corporation Name Search: "The James Randi Educational Foundation.

The officers of the JREF are:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&inq_doc_number=F97000005907&inq_came_from=NAMFWD&cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&names_name_ind=&names_cor_number=&names_name_seq=&names_name_ind=&names_comp_name=JAMESRANDIEDUCATIONALFOUNDATIO&names_filing_type=|title = filing with Florida State Department|publisher=Florida Department of State Division of Corporations|accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl]
In 2008 the astronomer Philip Plait became the new president of the JREF and Randi its board chairman. In December 2009 Plait left the JREF due to involvement in a television project, and  D.J. Grothe assumed the position of president on January 1, 2010.[ref]

The San Francisco newspaper SF Weekly reported on August 24, 2009 that Randi's annual salary is about $200,000, a figure that has not changed much since the foundation's inception.[tpl]cite web| title = The Demystifying Adventures of the Amazing Randi| url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-08-26/news/the-demystifying-adventures-of-the-amazing-randi/1| accessdate = September 5, 2009[/tpl]SF Weekly, August 24, 2009, online version, page 2: "One of his friends, Internet pioneer Rick Adams, put up $1 million in 1996."

==The One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==

In 1964, Randi began offering a  prize of $US1000 to anyone who could demonstrate a paranormal ability under agreed-upon testing conditions.  This prize has since been increased to $US1 million in bonds and is now administered by the JREF as the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.  Since its inception, more than 1000 people have applied to be tested.  To date no one has either been able to demonstrate their claimed abilities under the testing conditions or have not fulfilled the foundation conditions for taking the test; the prize money still remains to be claimed.
== The Amaz!ng Meeting ==  
Since 2003, the JREF has annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists,  skeptics, and atheists. Perennial speakers include Richard Dawkins, Penn & Teller, Phil Plait, Michael Shermer and Adam Savage.

==Podcasts and videos==

The foundation produces two audio podcasts, For Good Reason[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forgoodreason.org/ |title=For Good Reason podcast |publisher=Forgoodreason.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl] and Consequence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://consequencepodcast.com/ |title=Consequence Podcast |publisher="Consequence Podcast" |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl] For Good Reason is an interview program hosted by D.J.

The JREF also produces a regular video cast and YouTube show, The Randi Show, in which JREF outreach coordinator Brian Thompson interviews Randi on a variety of skeptical topics, often with lighthearted or comedic commentary.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22the+randi+show%22%2C+playlist&lclk=playlist/a |title=The Randi Show |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl]
