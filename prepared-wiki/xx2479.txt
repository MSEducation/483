==Early life==

Koontz was born on July 9, 1945, in Everett, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence (née Logue) and Raymond Koontz.Dean Koontz biography accessed May 3, 2010.http://books.google.ca/books?id=CVGmM1RuwB4C&pg=PA10&dq=florence+ray+koontz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z9yCUdmfIIW_qgHljoDQDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw He was regularly beaten and abused by his alcoholic father, which influenced his later writing, as also did the courage of his physically diminutive mother in standing up to her husband.[tpl]cite news |first=Jerry |last=Carroll |title=Dean Koontz Fears Nothing |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 23, 1998 |page=E-1 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/02/23/DD78392.DTL&ao=all |accessdate=June 10, 2012[/tpl]  "In his senior year at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, he won a fiction competition sponsored by Atlantic Monthly magazine.Piazza, Judyth: "Judyth Piazza chats with Dean Koontz and Mark Constant, The Market on Granada" St. Augustine News, July 27, 2009 After graduation in 1967, he went to work as an English teacher at Mechanicsburg High School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, Koontz worked for the Appalachian Poverty Program, a federally funded initiative designed to help poor children.Dean Koontz – Friend of Liberty, Advocates for Self-Government In a 1996 interview with Reason Magazine, he said that while the program sounded "very noble and wonderful, . . . in reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children . . . and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'" This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, The Dean Koontz Companion, he recalled that he:
 
 realized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters."

==Career==

In his spare time, he wrote his first novel, Star Quest, which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen science fiction novels. Seeing the Catholic faith as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its "intellectual rigor" and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.[tpl]cite news |accessdate=2009-11-28 |last=Drake |first=Tim |title= Chatting With Koontz About Faith |work=National Catholic Register |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |date=March 6, 2007[/tpl]Rossi, Tony, Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009 He says he sees the Church as English writer and Catholic convert G.K. Chesterton did.[tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] Koontz says that spirituality has always been part of his books, as are grace and our struggle as fallen souls, but he "never gets on a soapbox".
In the 1970s, Koontz began writing suspense and horror fiction, both under his own name and several pseudonyms, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several editors convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different genres invariably fell victim to "negative crossover" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey he wrote the "Mike Tucker" trilogy Risk, Surrounded, Wall of Masks in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of Richard Stark (Donald E. Westlake).  Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name.  Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for re-publication, but only 3 have appeared - Demon Seed and Invasion were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and Prison of Ice'' had certain sections bowdlerised.
After writing full-time for more than ten years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was Whispers, published in 1980. The two books before that, The Key to Midnight and The Funhouse, also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. Thus although Whispers is Koontz's third paperback bestseller, it was the second credited to Koontz.[tpl]cite web|author=deankoontz.com|title=shadowfires from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/shadowfires-from-the-author/|accessdate=2010-06-27[/tpl] His very first bestseller was Demon Seed, the sales of which picked up after the release of the film of the same name in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.[tpl]cite web|author=deankoontz.com|title=demon seed from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/demon-seed-from-the-author/|accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl] From 1979 on, Koontz's books regularly became paperback bestsellers. His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range was his book Strangers.[tpl]cite web|author=deankoontz.com|title=strangers from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/strangers-from-the-author/|accessdate=2010-06-27[/tpl]
Since then, 12 hardcovers and 13 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List.
Bestselling science fiction writer Brian Herbert has stated that "I even went though a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense."[tpl]cite web|publisher=www.frankherbert.net|title=Interview with Brian Herbert|url=http://www.frankherbert.net/news/BrianHerbertInterview.pdf/|accessdate=2011-05-03[/tpl]
In 1997 psychologist Katherine Ramsland published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with him and his family. This "psychobiography" (as Ramsland called it) often showed the conception of Koontz's characters and plots from events in his own life.
Early author photos on the back of many of his novels show a balding Koontz with a mustache. After Koontz underwent hair transplantation surgery in the late 1990s, his subsequent books have featured a new clean-shaven appearance with a fuller head of hair.[tpl]cite web|author=deankoontz.com|title=photo gallery|url=http://deankoontz.com/about-dean/photo-gallery.php|accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629153158/http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/photo-gallery.php  |archivedate = 2007-06-29[/tpl] Koontz explained the change by claiming that he was tired of looking like G. Gordon Liddy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Many of his novels are set in and around Orange County, California. As of 2006 he lives there with his wife, Gerda (Cerra). In 2008 he was the world's sixth most highly paid author, tied with John Grisham, at $25 million annually.[ref]

==Other Inspiration==

One of Dean Koontz's pen names was inspired by his dog, Trixie Koontz, a golden retriever, shown in many of his book-jacket photos. Trixie originally was a service dog with Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), a charitable organization that provides service dogs for people with disabilities.[tpl]cite web|author=deankoontz.com|title=Trixie Koontz|url=http://deankoontz.com/trixie/monthly-columns.php|accessdate=2007-08-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710211834/http://www.deankoontz.com/trixie/monthly-columns.php  |archivedate = 2007-07-10[/tpl] Trixie was a gift from CCI in gratitude of Koontz's substantial donations, totalling $2,500,000 between 1991 and 2004.[tpl]cite news|author=Ben Fox|title=Associated Press|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20041226/ai_n11495304|accessdate=2007-08-01 | work=Deseret News | date=2004-12-26[/tpl] Koontz was taken with the charity while he was researching his novel Midnight, a book which included a CCI-trained dog, a black Labrador retriever, named Moose. 
In 2004 Koontz wrote and edited Life Is Good: Lessons in Joyful Living in her name, and in 2005 Koontz wrote a second book credited to Trixie, Christmas Is Good. Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The royalties of the books were donated to CCI. In 2007 Trixie contracted terminal cancer that created a tumor in her heart. The Koontzes had her put to sleep outside of their family home on June 30. After Trixie's death Koontz has continued writing on his website under Trixie's names in "TOTOS", standing for Trixie on the Other Side.
It is widely thought that Trixie was his inspiration for his November 2007 book, The Darkest Evening of the Year, about a woman who runs a golden retriever rescue home, and who rescues a 'special' dog, named Nickie, who eventually saves her life. In August 2009 Koontz published "A Big Little Life," a memoir of his life with Trixie.
In October 2008 Koontz revealed that he had adopted a new dog, Anna. It eventually was learned that Anna was the grandniece of Trixie.[tpl]cite web | last = Koontz | first = Dean | title = The Write Stuff: All About Anna | url = http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/the-write-stuff/ | accessdate = 2008-10-30[/tpl]

==Disputed authorship==

There are a number of letters, articles and novels ostensibly written by Koontz during the 1960s and 1970s that he has stated he did not write. These include 30 erotic novels, allegedly written together by Koontz and his wife Gerda, including books such as Thirteen and Ready!, Swappers Convention and Hung, the last one published under the name "Leonard Chris". They also include contributions to the fanzines Energumen and BeABohema in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including articles that mention the erotic novels,"Dean's Drive", Energumen 8; June 1971, page 9BeABohehma #8, 1970, ed. Frank Lunney; page 5 such as a movie column called "Way Station"[tpl]cite web| title=Live Journal | url=http://sjhtn2007.livejournal.com/3810.html | accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl] in BeABohema.
Koontz has stated on his website [tpl]cite web| title=Facts for Collectors | url=http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/collectors/ |work=deankoontz.com |accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl] that he used only the 9 known pen names and "there are no secret pen names used by Dean"; he adds that his own identity was stolen by "a person he had previously worked with professionally", who submitted letters and some articles to fanzines under Koontz's name between 1969 and at least the early 1970s. Koontz has stated that he was only made aware of these bogus letters and articles in 1991 in a written admission from the identity thief. He has stated that he will reveal this person's name in his memoirs.
