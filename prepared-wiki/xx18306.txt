It is Wales' second largest city and the UK's twenty-sixth largest city.[tpl]cite web|title=UK: 1000 Largest Cities by population|url=http://thegeographist.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/largest-cities-uk-population|publisher=The Geographist|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl] Swansea lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan. Situated on the sandy South West Wales coast, the county area includes the Gower Peninsula and the Lliw uplands.

During its 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was a key centre of the copper industry,Swansea (Wales, United Kingdom) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia earning the nickname 'Copperopolis'.Hughes, S.

==History==

Archaeological finds are mostly confined to the Gower Peninsula, and include items from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Romans reached the area, as did the Vikings.
Swansea is thought to have developed as a Viking trading post. Its name may be derived from Sveinn's island (Old Norse: Sveinsey) – the reference to an island may refer to a bank at the mouth of the river Tawe, or an area of raised ground in marshes.Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R. (2008) Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales. Llandysul: Gomer. An alternative explanation is that the name derives from the Norse name 'Sweyn' and 'ey', which can mean inlet.[tpl]cite book|last=Alban|first=JR|title=Swansea 1184–1984|year=1984|publisher=Swansea City Council[/tpl] The name is pronounced Swans-y [tpl]IPA|/ˈswɒnzi/[/tpl]), not Swan-sea.[tpl]cite book|editor=Glanmor Williams |title=Swansea, An Illustrated History |publisher=Christopher Davies |date=2007-07-26|isbn=0-7154-0714-7[/tpl] The Welsh name first appears in Welsh poems at the beginning of the 13th century, as "Aber Tawy".
The earliest known form of the modern name is Sweynesse, which was used in the first charter granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd Earl of Warwick.  The charter gave Swansea the status of a borough, granting the townsmen, called burgesses certain rights to develop the area.  A second charter was granted in 1215 by King John. In this charter, the name appears as Sweyneshe. The town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as Sweyse.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Swansea | title= Swansea | publisher=Classic Encyclopedia |year=2007| accessdate=2007-07-29 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Swansea/Timeline.html | title=Swansea Timeline | publisher=Genuki |year=2007| accessdate=2007-07-29 [/tpl]
Following the Norman Conquest, a marcher lordship was created under the title of  Gower. It included land around Swansea Bay as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a borough charter some time between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.

===Industrial Revolution===

The port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal. As the Industrial Revolution reached Wales, the combination of port, local coal, and trading links with the West Country, Cornwall and Devon, meant that Swansea was the logical place to site copper smelting works. Smelters were operating by 1720 and proliferated. Following this, more coal mines (everywhere from north-east Gower to Clyne and Llangyfelach) were opened and smelters (mostly along the Tawe valley) were opened and flourished. Over the next century and a half, works were established to process arsenic, zinc and tin and to create tinplate and pottery. The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed "Copperopolis".
From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500% — the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than Glamorgan's county town, Cardiff, and was the second most populous town in Wales behind Merthyr Tydfil (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr. Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales — in 1881, more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Rosser, C. and Harris, C.C. (1998) The Family and Social Change: A Study of Family and Kinship in a South Wales Town. Routledge

===20th century===

Through the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the Lower Swansea Valley filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present Enterprise Zone was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now Parc Tawe and South Dock became the Marina.
Little city-centre evidence, beyond parts of the road layout, remains from medieval Swansea; its industrial importance made it the target of bombing, known as the Blitz in World War II, and the centre was flattened completely. The city has three Grade One listed buildings, these being the Guildhall, Swansea Castle and the Morriston Tabernacle.City and County of Swansea – Listed building index
Whilst the city itself has a long history, many of the city centre buildings are post-war as much of the original centre was destroyed by World War II bombing on the 19th, 20th and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz'). Within the city centre are the ruins of the castle, the Marina, the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea Museum, the Dylan Thomas Centre, the Environment Centre, and the Market, which is the largest covered market in Wales.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3148686.stm | title=Tourism joins shopping at market | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2007-07-27 | date=2003-09-29[/tpl] It backs onto the Quadrant Shopping Centre which opened in 1978 and the adjoining St David's Centre opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings are the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. Swansea Leisure Centre opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.

==Governance==

===Local government===

In 1887, Swansea was a township at the mouth of the river Tawe, covering [tpl]convert|4562|acre[/tpl] in the county of Glamorgan.Swansea Glamorgan through time | Local history overview for the place There were three major extensions to the boundaries of the borough, first in 1835, when Morriston, St Thomas, Landore, St John-juxta-Swansea, and part of Llansamlet parish were added, and again in 1889 when areas around Cwmbwrla and Trewyddfa were included, and in 1918 when the borough was enlarged to include the whole of the ancient parish of Swansea, the southern part of Llangyfelach parish, all of Llansamlet parish, Oystermouth Urban District and Brynau parish.West Glamorgan Archive Service Borough/County Borough/City of Swansea recordsSwansea CB Glamorgan through time | Boundaries of Local Government District
In 1889, Swansea attained county borough status,The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 and it was granted city status in 1969, which was inherited by the Swansea district when it was formed by the merger of the borough and Gower Rural District in 1974.City and County of Swansea – History of the Mayoralty In 1996, Swansea became one of 22 unitary authorities with the addition of part of the former Lliw Valley Borough. The new authority received the name 'City and County of Swansea' ([tpl]lang-cy|Dinas a Sir Abertawe[/tpl]).see Swansea City and County and National Council on Archives: Rules for the construction of place names
Swansea was once a staunch stronghold of the Labour Party which, until 2004, had overall control of the council for 24 years.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3806811.stm | title=Council leader resigns after defeat | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2007-07-29 | date=2004-06-15[/tpl]  The Liberal Democrats were the largest group in the administration that took control of Swansea Council in the 2004 local elections until the 2012 council elections saw the council return to Labour control.  For 2009/2010, the Lord Mayor of Swansea was Councillor Alan Lloyd, and in 2010/2011 Richard Lewis was the Lord Mayor.  The Lord Mayor changes in May each year.

==Geography==

===Boundaries===

The "City and County of Swansea" local authority area is bordered by unitary authorities of Carmarthenshire to the north, and Neath Port Talbot to the east. Swansea is bounded by Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel to the south.

===Physical description===

The local government area is [tpl]convert|378|km²|sqmi|0[/tpl] in size, about 2% of the area of Wales.  It includes a large amount of open countryside and a central urban and suburban belt.
Swansea can be roughly divided into four physical areas. To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the Black Mountain.  To the west is the Gower Peninsula with its rural landscape dotted with small villages.  To the east is the coastal strip around Swansea Bay.  Cutting though the middle from the south-east to the north-west is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the Swansea city centre to the towns of Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.
The most populated areas of Swansea are Morriston, Sketty and the city centre.  The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to Mumbles; up the Swansea Valley past Landore and Morriston to Clydach; over Townhill to Cwmbwrla, Penlan, Treboeth and Fforestfach; through Uplands, Sketty, Killay to Dunvant; and east of the river from St. Thomas to Bonymaen, Llansamlet and Birchgrove.  A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by Gowerton, Gorseinon and Loughor along with the satellite communities of Penllergaer and Pontarddulais.
About three quarters of Swansea is bordered by the sea—the Loughor Estuary, Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel.  The two largest rivers in the region are the Tawe which passes the city centre and the Loughor which flows on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.
In the local authority area, the geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Excluding the urbanised area in the south-eastern corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is part of an AONB.  Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands.  The region has featured regularly in the Wales in Bloom awards.
The geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from Carboniferous Limestone cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to Worm's Head and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the Loughor estuary to the north.  The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs.  The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston.  The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by sandstone heath ridges including the prominent Cefn Bryn.  The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows.  Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich deciduous woodland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.visitswanseabay.com/media/pdf/o/j/student_info_geography_1.pdf |format=PDF| title=Student information – Swansea geography | publisher=City and County of Swansea | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-07-26 [/tpl]
Much of the local authority's area is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of Mawr.  Areas of high land up to [tpl]convert|185|m|ft|0[/tpl] range across the central section and form the hills of Kilvey, Townhill and Llwynmawr, separating the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs.  Cefn Bryn, a ridge of high land, forms the backbone of the Gower Peninsula.  Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and Llanmadoc Hill form land features up to [tpl]convert|193|m|ft|0[/tpl] high.  The highest point is located at Penlle'r Castell at [tpl]convert|374|m|ft|0[/tpl] on the northern border with Carmarthenshire.

===Climate===

Typical of the west of Britain, Swansea has a temperate oceanic climate.  As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder climate than the mountains and valleys inland. This same location, though, leaves Swansea exposed to rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic: figures from the Met Office make Swansea the wettest city in Britain.[tpl]cite web | url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid=14140027&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=soggiest-city-in-britain-pays-high-price-for-rain-name_page.html  | title=Soggiest city in Britain pays high price for rain | publisher=icWales | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-07-26 [/tpl] In midsummer, Swansea's temperatures can reach into the high twenties Celsius.http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USSC0335?par=usatoday&site=www.usatoday.com&promo=0&cm_ven=USAToday&cm_cat=www.usatoday.com&cm_pla=WxPage&cm_ite=CityPage weather.com

==Demography==

The population of the Swansea built-up area within the unitary authority boundaries in 2011 was about 179,485, and the council population was 238,700.  The other built-up areas within the unitary authority are centred on Gorseinon and Pontarddulais.  In 2011, the Gorseinon built-up area had a population of 20,581 and the Pontarddulais built-up area had a population of 9,073.Nomis:Census 2011  However, the wider urban area including most of Swansea Bay has a total population of 300,352 (making it the 24th largest urban area in England and Wales).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks101ew | title=Census 2011 Usual Resident Population | publisher=National Statistics Office |year=2013| accessdate=2013-07-27 [/tpl] Over 218,000 individuals are white; 1,106 are of mixed race; 2,215 are  Asian – mainly Bangladeshi (1,015); 300 are black; and 1,195 belong to other ethnic groups.Population and Migration – Ethnic groups (Swansea) Office for National Statistics.

From 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth.  The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline.  In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s.  The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s.  In the 2000s, so far, Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007.Wales’s Population A Demographic Overview 2009

==Culture==

The Royal Institution of South Wales was founded in 1835 as the Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society.

===Performing arts===

The Grand Theatre in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer Adelina Patti and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.
Fluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The Taliesin building on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near Gorseinon. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at Oystermouth Castle, and Singleton Park is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor Proms. Outside the city, Pontardawe hosts an annual folk festival. Another folk festival is held on Gower.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/festivals_000.htm | title= The Living Tradition Festival Listing, 2007 | publisher=The Living Tradition | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-07-26 [/tpl] Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the Patti Pavilion; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The Brangwyn Hall is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for Swansea University. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/brangwyn.shtml | title=Brangwyn Hall & The Empire Panels | publisher=BBC | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-07-27 [/tpl]

===Festivals===

Swansea hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former Felindre tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. The international BeyondTv film festival has been hosted in Swansea since 2000 by Swansea based media charity Undercurrents. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales only week long St David's Week festival in venues throughout the city.

===Welsh language===

There are many Welsh-language chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking parents, leading to claims in the local press in autumn 2004 that, to accommodate demand, the council planned to close an English-medium school in favour of opening a new Welsh-medium school.South Wales Evening Post, 8 September 2004, and subsequent issues. The Welsh-medium school is named Bryn Tawe, and is located in the buildings of the former Penlan boys' school, which itself was merged with the girls' school at Mynyddbach on that site to become Daniel James Community School. This arrangement was a subject of considerable controversy in the period leading up to Bryn Tawe's inauguration.
45% of the rural council ward Mawr speak Welsh, as do 38% of the ward of Pontarddulais. Clydach, Kingsbridge and Upper Loughor all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban St. Thomas has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than Penderry and Townhill wards.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php?id=2082.6 | title=Results of the 2001 Census of Population on the Language in Electoral Wards | publisher=Welsh Language Board |year=2007| accessdate=2007-07-26 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as The Kardomah Gang, as they frequently met in the Kardomah Café in Swansea city centre.Dylan Thomas and the Kardomah Set – Features, Books – The Independent 11 February 2006

==Sport==

Strong local rivalries exist between Swansea City A.F.C. and Cardiff City F.C. in football, Swansea RFC and Llanelli and the Ospreys and Scarlets in Rugby Union.
Swansea City A.F.C. moved from the Vetch Field to the new Liberty Stadium at the start of the 2005–2006 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the Premier League, after being promoted during the 2010/11 season. The Football Association of Wales has decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium,
Swansea has three clubs that play in the Welsh Football League: Garden Village, South Gower and West End.
In 2003, Swansea RFC merged with Neath RFC to form the Neath-Swansea Ospreys rugby club. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005–2006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the Celtic League in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.
St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground is the home of Swansea RFC and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have previously played matches there.[ref]
