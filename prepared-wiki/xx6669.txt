Liverpool Football Club [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|v|ər|p|uː|l[/tpl] is an English Premier League football club based in Liverpool. Liverpool F.C. is one of the most successful clubs in England and has won more European trophies than any other English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups and three UEFA Super Cups. The club has also won eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups and a record eight League Cups.
Liverpool was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. The club has played at Anfield since its formation. The most successful period in Liverpool's history was the 1970s and '80s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to eleven league titles and seven European trophies.
The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, in which charging Liverpool fans caused a wall to collapse, killing 39 Juventus supporters and resulting in English clubs being banned from European competitions for five years. In the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing.
Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with neighbours Everton and with Manchester United. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".

==History==

Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed | publisher=Liverpool F.C | accessdate=11 August 2010 [/tpl] Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[tpl]cite book |last=Graham| title=Liverpool |page=14 |year=1985 [/tpl] The team won the Lancashire League in its début season, and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the First Division, which it won in 1901 and again in 1906.[tpl]cite book|last=Graham| title=Liverpool |pages=16–18 |year=1985 [/tpl]
Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex West Ham Utd centre half George Kay.[tpl]cite book|last=Graham| title=Liverpool |year=1985 |page=20 [/tpl] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[tpl]cite book|last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History|page=14 |year=1991 [/tpl] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |year=1988 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |pages=50–51 [/tpl] Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other "Boot Room" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[tpl]cite book |last=Kelly |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |page=57 |year=1988 [/tpl]
The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners' Cup final.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1965/intro.html |title=1965/66: Stan the man for Dortmund |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)[/tpl] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |title=The Boot Room Boys: Inside the Anfield Boot Room |page=86 |year=1999 [/tpl] In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[tpl]cite book|last=Pead|title=Liverpool A Complete Record|page=414 |year=1986 [/tpl] During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |year=1988 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |page=157 [/tpl]
Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |year=1988 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |page=158 [/tpl] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[tpl]cite book |last=Cox|title=Encyclopedia of British football |page=90 |year=2002 [/tpl] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_2733000/2733979.stm | title=On This Day – 29 May 1985: Fans die in Heysel rioting |publisher=BBC  | accessdate=12 September 2006 | date=29 May 1985[/tpl]
Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |page=172 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |year=1988 [/tpl] During his tenure, the club won another three League Championships and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup "Double" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm | title=On This Day – 15 April 1989: Soccer fans crushed at Hillsborough |publisher=BBC  | accessdate=12 September 2006 | date=15 April 1989[/tpl] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hillsborough-victim-died-accidentally-coroner-says-withdrawal-of-treatment-not-to-blame-1469037.html |title=Hillsborough victim died 'accidentally': Coroner says withdrawal of treatment not to blame |work=The Independent |date=22 December 1993 |accessdate=28 August 2010 |first=Malcolm |last=Pithers[/tpl] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/318497.stm | title=A hard lesson to learn |publisher=BBC  |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2006 [/tpl]
Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/mar/29/arsenal-liverpool-1989-football |title=The night Football was reborn |work=The Observer |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |first=Jason |last=Cowley [/tpl]
Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[tpl]cite book|last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |year=1991 |pages=104–105 [/tpl] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[tpl]cite book |last=Kelly |title=The Boot Room Boys: Inside the Anfield Boot Room |page=227 |year=1999 [/tpl] In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a "Treble": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335026.stm |title=Houllier acclaims Euro triumph |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2007 [/tpl] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1600193.stm |title=Houllier 'satisfactory' after surgery |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=15 October 2001 |accessdate=13 March 2007 [/tpl] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.
Houllier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C.

==Colours and badge==

For much of Liverpool's history its home colours have been all red, but when the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894, when the club adopted the city's colour of red. The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club's badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964, when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip. Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St. John recalled in his autobiography:
The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season,  when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. The current kits are designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lfc-and-warrior-announcement  |title=LFC and Warrior announcement |accessdate=18 January 2012[/tpl] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for ten years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[tpl]cite book |last=Crilly|title=Tops of the Kops: The Complete Guide to Liverpool's Kits |page=28 |year=2007 [/tpl]
Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/jul/06/theknowledge.sport |first=James |last=Dart |coauthor=Mark Tinklin |title=Has a streaker ever scored? |work=The Guardian |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2007[/tpl] Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered Bank. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/05/carlsberg-liverpool-sponsorship-markets-equities-beer.html |title=Carlsberg and Liverpool might part ways |work=Forbes |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |first=Javier |last=Espinoza[/tpl] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.[tpl]cite news|title= Liverpool and Standard Chartered announce sponsorship deal |url=http://www.standardchartered.com/media-centre/press-releases/2009/documents/20090914/index.html |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=Standard Chartered Bank |accessdate=12 August 2010[/tpl]
The Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side are symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/hillsborough |title=Hillsborough |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=12 August 2010 [/tpl] In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for number who died at Hillsborough.[tpl]cite web|title=Liverpool kit launch sparks anger among Hillsborough families|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18033752|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=11 May 2012[/tpl]

==Stadiums [tpl]anchor|Stadia[/tpl]==

Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[tpl]cite book|last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |page=112 |year=1991 [/tpl] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |page=187 |year=1988 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone [/tpl]
In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[tpl]cite book|last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |page=113 |year=1991 [/tpl] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly |year=1988 |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |page=188 [/tpl] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[tpl]cite news|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0100news/tm_objectid=17610578&method=full&siteid=50061&headline=how-kop-tuned-in-to-glory-days-name_page.html#story_continue |first=James |last=Pearce |title=How Kop tuned into glory days |work=Liverpool Echo |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=6 December 2008 [/tpl]
Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak, and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4f/53/0,,12306~152399,00.pdf |title=Premier League Handbook Season 2010/11 |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=Premier League |page=35 |chapter=Club Directory |accessdate=17 August 2010 [/tpl] The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and is now known as the Centenary Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/stadium/anfield |title=Anfield |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=15 August 2010[/tpl]

The song "You'll Never Walk Alone", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry & The Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1896769/index.html |title=Liverpool |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) |accessdate=23 July 2011 [/tpl] The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The "You'll Never Walk Alone" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's crest.
The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,,1496054,00.html |first=David |last=McKie |title=Thatcher set to demand FA ban on games in Europe |work=The Guardian |date=31 May 1985 |accessdate=7 December 2008[/tpl] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years.

The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days The Sun newspaper published an article entitled "The Truth", in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed and urinated on the dead and had attacked the police.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/jul/11/pressandpublishing.football |first=David |last=Smith |title=The city that eclipsed the Sun |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2008[/tpl] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy The Sun more than 20 years later.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/an-own-goal-rooney-caught-in-crossfire-between-the-sun-and-an-unforgiving-city-552460.html|title=An own goal?

===Rivalries===

Liverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Merseyside team Everton, against whom the club contest the Merseyside derby. Their rivalry stems from Liverpool's formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield. Unlike other rivalries, there is no political, geographical or religious split between Liverpool and Everton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicderby/news/newsid=106031.html |title=Classic: Everton-Liverpool |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=20 December 2008 [/tpl] The Merseyside derby is usually sold out. It is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence was known as the "friendly derby".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/4333250/Liverpool-and-Everton-no-longer-play-the-friendly-derby-as-fans-become-more-vitriolic-Football.html |title=Liverpool and Everton no longer play the 'friendly derby' as fans become more vitriolic |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 January 2009 |first=Rory |last=Smith |accessdate=26 August 2010[/tpl] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as "the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/7173697/Liverpool-1-Everton-0-match-report.html |last=Smith |first=Rory |date=7 February 2010 |title=Liverpool 1 Everton 0: match report |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=20 July 2011 [/tpl]
Liverpool's rivalry with Manchester United is viewed as a manifestation of the cities' competition during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6956608.stm | title=Scouse v Manc | date=21 August 2007 |publisher=BBC  | last=Rohrer |first= Finlo | accessdate=3 April 2008 [/tpl] The rivalry between the clubs intensified during the 1960s, after Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, an achievement surpassed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories in the 1970s and 1980s. Manchester United started to dominate English football during the 1990s, making the rivalry all the more intense.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/liverpool/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8677000/8677547.stm |title=Rivals: Liverpool v Manchester |publisher=BBC  |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010 [/tpl] The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/may/10/newsstory.sport8 |first=Sean |last=Ingle |coauthor=Scott Murray|title=Knowledge Unlimited|work=The Guardian |date=10 May 2000|accessdate=26 February 2008[/tpl]

==Ownership and finances==

As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.[tpl]cite book |last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |page=108 |year=1991 [/tpl] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[tpl]cite book |last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |page=109 |year=1991 [/tpl] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.[tpl]cite book |last=Liversedge|title=Liverpool:The Official Centenary History |page=110 |year=1991 [/tpl] His successor was Noel White who became Chairman in 1990 [tpl]cite book |last=Reade|first=Brian|title=44 Years With The Same Bird |page= 206|isbn=9780330474252 [/tpl] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became Chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/03/05/dubai-liverpool-bids-idUKB81717020080305 |title=Factbox Soccer who owns Liverpool Football Club |agency=Reuters |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |first=Nagesh |last=Narayana [/tpl]
Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6244441.stm |first=Bill |last=Wilson |title=US business duo at Liverpool helm |publisher=BBC  |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2 December 2008 [/tpl] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7197675.stm |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Liverpool braced for takeover bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2008 [/tpl] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/16/martin-broughton-liverpool-chairman-sale|title=Liverpool appoint Martin Broughton as chairman to oversee sale of club|last= Bandini|first=Paolo|date=16 April 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 April 2010[/tpl] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/07/liverpool-record-losses|title=Auditors cast doubt on future of Liverpool after losses|date=7 May 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2010 | first=David | last=Conn[/tpl] The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=831953&sec=england&cc=4716 |title=Liverpool takeover to go ahead as owners lose case |publisher=ESPN  |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2011[/tpl] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/9094283.stm |title=Liverpool takeover completed by US company NESV |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2011[/tpl]

==Liverpool in popular culture==

Because of its successful history, Liverpool is often featured when football is depicted in British culture and has appeared in a number of media firsts. The club appeared in the first edition of the BBC's Match of the Day, which screened highlights of its match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly|title=You'll Never Walk Alone|page=192 |year=1988[/tpl] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song "Fearless", in which they sang excerpts from "You'll Never Walk Alone".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A330652 |title=The Hillsborough Tragedy |publisher=BBC  |date=16 June 2000 |accessdate=23 December 2008 [/tpl] To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released a song known as the "Anfield Rap", featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4770012.stm |title=Footballer Barnes for rap return |publisher=BBC  |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2008 [/tpl]
A documentary drama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, whose story is the focus of the script. Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/04/99/hillsborough/313635.stm |title=Hillsborough's Sad Legacy |publisher=BBC  |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=23 December 2008 [/tpl] Liverpool featured in the film The 51st State (also known as Formula 51), in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180304 |title=Formula 51 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=18 October 2002 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |first=Roger |last=Ebert [/tpl] The club was featured in a children's television show called Scully; the plot revolved around a young boy, Francis Scully, who tried to gain a trial match with Liverpool.

Liverpool's first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the club's first season.[tpl]cite book |last= Kelly |title=You'll Never Walk Alone |page=15 |year=1988 [/tpl] In 1901, the club won its first League title, while its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965.

Liverpool has won the English League Championship eighteen times, the FA Cup seven times and the League Cup a record eight times. The club achieved a League and FA Cup "double" in 1986 and won the League and European Cup double both in 1977 and in 1984. Liverpool also won the League Cup in 1984 to complete a treble, a feat repeated (albeit with different trophies) in 2001, when the club won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/honours |title=Honours |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=27 February 2008 [/tpl]
