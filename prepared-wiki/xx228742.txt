==Criticism==

Lipgloss closely resembled the hit American TV Show Gossip Girl, prompting people to label it as a rip-off of the iconic series. Also, many had said that even the show's plot imitated that of Gossip Girl – whereas 'Gossip Girl' spreads the gossip about the main characters, the website administrator does the same in Lipgloss.

==Trivia==

In the middle of 2nd season, Sam Concepcion and Cheska Ortega left the show. Matt Evans and Carlo Guevara were then added to the cast.
Lovi Poe's contract with her home network, GMA Network, initially did not allow her to become part of Lipgloss. An exception was eventually made and she appeared in the show's final season . Aside from Lipgloss, TV5 had also offered Poe to star in the remake of Cofradia. This project did not push through.
Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus housemates Robi Domingo, Ejay Falcon, and Josef Elizalde were all considered to join in Season 4 of Lipgloss. However, because of Domingo's schedule with MYX and his other commitments with ABS-CBN, only Falcon and Elizalde made it to the show.
This is Czarina Suzara's first TV appearance. The other one being  the 2012 version of Valiente
