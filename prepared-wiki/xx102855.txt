[[Bogoliubov transformation]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum field theory, Canonical unitary transformation

In theoretical physics, the Bogoliubov transformation, named after Nikolay Bogolyubov,  is a unitary transformation [tpl]Dubious|date=July 2009[/tpl] from a unitary representation of some canonical commutation relation algebra or canonical anticommutation relation algebra into another unitary representation, induced by an isomorphism of the commutation relation algebra.  The Bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize Hamiltonians, which yields the steady-state solutions of the corresponding Schr√∂dinger equation.  The solutions of BCS theory in a homogeneous system, for example, are found using a Bogoliubov transformation. The Bogoliubov transformation is also important for understanding the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation and many other topics.

==Single bosonic mode example==

Consider the canonical commutation relation for bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the harmonic basis
Define a new pair of operators
where the latter is the hermitian conjugate of the first. The Bogoliubov transformation is a canonical transformation of these operators. To find the conditions on the constants u and v such that the transformation remains canonical, the commutator is expanded, viz.

===Applications===

The most prominent application is by Nikolai Bogoliubov himself in the context of superfluidity.Nikolai Bogoliubov: On the theory of superfluidity, J. Phys. (USSR), 11, p. 23 (1947) Other applications comprise  Hamiltonians and excitations in the theory of antiferromagnetism.See e.g. the textbook by Charles Kittel: Quantum theory of solids, New York, Wiley 1987. When calculating quantum field theory in curved space-times the definition of the vacuum changes and a Bogoliubov transformation between these different vacua is possible, this is used in the derivation of Hawking radiation.

==Fermionic mode==

For the anticommutation relation
the same transformation with u and v becomes
To make the transformation canonical, u and v can be parameterized as  

===Applications===

==Multimode example==

The Hilbert space under consideration is equipped with these operators, and henceforth describes a higher-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (usually an infinite-dimensional one).
The ground state of the corresponding Hamiltonian is annihilated by all the annihilation operators:
All excited states are obtained as linear combinations of the ground state excited by some creation operators:
One may redefine the creation and the annihilation operators by a linear redefinition:
for bosons and anticommutators for fermions.
The equation above defines the Bogoliubov transformation of the operators.
