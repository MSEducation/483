Dangriga, formerly known as Stann Creek Town, is a town in southern Belize, located on the Caribbean coast at the mouth of the North Stann Creek River. It is the capital of Belize's Stann Creek District and also the largest town in southern Belize. It is served by the Dangriga Airport.

==History==

Dangriga was settled before 1832 by Garinagu (Black Caribs, as they were known to the British) from Honduras. For years it was the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City, but in recent years has been surpassed by Orange Walk Town. Since the early 1980s Garífuna culture has undergone a revival, as part of which the town was renamed Dangriga, a Garífuna word meaning "standing waters".http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-780130-dangriga_dangriga-i

==Demographics==

The population is mostly a mixture of Garinagu, Kriols and Mestizos. According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census, Dangriga's population is 9,096 residents, 4,410 males and 4,686 females. The total number of households is 2,562 and the average household size is 3.6.

==Culture==

Dangriga is home to the Garifuna, a cultural and ethnic group, descendants of shipwrecked slaves and native Caribs. The Garifuna have adopted the Carib language but kept their African musical and religious traditions. Dangriga is also where the Caribbean music, Punta Rock, originated and where some of Belize's folk bands can be found.
In November each year there is a week long festivity leading up to Garifuna Settlement Day, attended by Garifuna people from around the region. It includes a torchlit parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the monument of the patriot and social activist Thomas Vincent Ramos, selection of Miss Garifuna, parades and special church services, and The T.V. Ramos Classic Bike Race.
The 19th of November is Garifuna Settlement Day.[tpl]cite book |title=Explore Belize |author=Harry S. Pariser |publisher=Harry S.
