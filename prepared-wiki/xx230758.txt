Kenneth Roth is an American attorney and has been the executive director of Human Rights Watch since 1993.

==Early life==

Kenneth Roth, a graduate of Yale Law School and Brown University, was drawn to human rights causes through his Jewish father's experience of fleeing Nazi Germany in 1938. His father would keep his three young sons quiet as he cut their hair by telling tales of their grandfather's butcher shop in Frankfurt, Germany. As they grew older, he told them about living under the Nazis as a young boy and fleeing Germany in July 1938.[tpl]fact|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Career==

Jimmy Carter’s introduction of human rights as an element of US foreign policy in the late 1970s further inspired Roth to take on human rights as a vocation.[tpl]cite web|author=Kenneth Roth |url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/4081 |title=Re: Who are you? | Kenneth Roth |publisher=Big Think |date=2007-12-31 |accessdate=2011-02-07[/tpl]

Under Roth’s leadership, Human Rights Watch has grown eight-fold in size and vastly expanded its reach. It now operates in more than 80 countries, among them some of the most dangerous and oppressed places on Earth.http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/09/thunder-on-the-rights-by-brad-pitt.html)

==Criticism==

Under Roth's leadership, Human Rights Watch has been criticized for perceived biases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/what-they-say-about-us |title=Human Rights Watch | Defending Human Rights Worldwide |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-07[/tpl]
Venezuela  
On December 17, 2009 118 scholars from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, México, the UK, the US, Venezuela and other countries publicly criticized HRW  in an open letter to the HRW Board of Directors in response to an HRW report, A Decade Under Chávez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela.Human Rights Watch, 22 September 2008, A Decade Under Chávez The report was criticized for bias against the government of Venezuela and its President, Hugo Chavez, stating that it "does not meet even the most minimal standards of scholarship, impartiality, accuracy, or credibility."Mark Weisbrot, guardian.co.uk, 11 March 2009, Who is America to judge? One of the letter's authors, Hugh O'Shaughnessy, accused HRW of using false and misleading information, and said the HRW report was "put together with the sort of know-nothing Washington bias..."Hugh O'Shaughnessy, New Statesman, 26 September 2008, HRW v Chavez Kenneth Roth responded, stating that the letter misrepresented "both the substance and the source material of the report."[tpl]cite web|url=https://nacla.org/node/5369 |title=Human Rights Watch Responds to Criticism of Venezuela Report | North American Congress on Latin America |publisher=Nacla.org |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-28[/tpl]
In late 2012 Roth was criticized for stating that Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador, all members of South America's Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), were the "most abusive" states in South America, despite the dire situation in Colombia, where over 250,000 people have been killed by right wing death squads.'The Latest Howlers From Human Rights Watch on Venezuela' by Joe Emersberger, August 3, 2012, venezuelanalysis.com
Rwanda  
Fred Oluoch-Ojiwah, of Rwanda’s New Times newspaper, questions Roth’s impartiality and equates his criticism of Rwanda’s human rights record to a “love affair” with the “genocidaires” that carried out the Rwandan Genocide of 1994.“Rwanda: Is Kenneth Roth in Love With Genocidaires?” by Fred Oluoch-Ojiwah, 26 April 2010, AllAfrica.com
“As a western human rights personality Roth…will always fail to understand the intricacies and complexities surrounding the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi. Wrapping it up simplistically the way he has done will only serve to undo the gains already registered in driving the very delicate process of bringing forth a new dispensation in Rwanda and by extension the African Great Lakes region,” Oluoch-Ojiwah wrote.“2nd Open Letter to Kenneth Roth: Rwanda will not be a political play field”, by Fred Oluoch-Ojiwah, New Times.
Israel and Palestine
Kenneth Roth has been criticized by the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor for allegedly being biased against Israel. Gerald M. Steinberg has been a long-time critic of Roth's role as head of Human Rights Watch from 1993. Writing in a 2004 Jerusalem Post article"Israelis Have No 'Human Rights'" by Gerald M. Steinberg, March 08, 2004, The Jerusalem Post in response to Roth's op-ed in which Roth accused NGO Monitor of disregarding basic facts, "fictitious allegations of bias" and a "fantasy-based discourse" which "does a deep disservice to Israel","The truth hurts" By Kenneth Roth, Apr. 1, 2004, The Jerusalem Post
In August 2006, during the war between Hezbollah and Israel, Roth rejected criticism of HRW’s allegations against Israel, writing in a letter to the editor of the The New York Sun: "An eye for an eye — or, more accurately in this case, twenty eyes for an eye — may have been the morality of some more primitive moment. But it is not the morality of international humanitarian law which Mr. Bell pretends to apply." 'Getting It Straight' The New York Sun, July 31, 2006  In response, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) referred to Roth’s rhetoric as a reflection of "classic anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews".[ref]

In reaction to Richard Goldstone's recantation of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict report, HRW Founder Robert Bernstein said to the Jerusalem Post in April 2011, referring to Roth, that it "is time for him to follow Judge Goldstone’s example and issue his own mea culpa.”At 88, a man of morals starts over
Ethiopia 
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has taken issue with the credibility of Roth’s accusations that Ethiopia’s government is corrupt and uses international aid funding for “repressive purposes.” “Letter to Kenichi Ohashi, Ethiopia Country Director for the World Bank” by Kenneth Roth, 17 December 2010
The EHRC accused Roth of impartiality caused by a desire to “appease…wealthy financiers.” It cited his evaluation of the Democratic Institution Program (DIP) as “superficial” and claimed that his allegations of corruption were based on “poor methodology.” EHRC also called Roth’s recommendations a “contradiction” that called “for the promotion of human rights at the expense of human rights programs and their implementers.”
