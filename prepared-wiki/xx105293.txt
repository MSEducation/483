It leads from Hyde Park Corner to the Serpentine Road. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Rotten Row was a fashionable place for upper-class Londoners to be seen.[ref]

Rotten Row was established by William III at the end of the 17th century. Having moved court to Kensington Palace, William wanted a safer way to travel to the previous St. James's Palace. He created the broad avenue through Hyde Park, lit with 300 oil lamps in 1690â€“ the first artificially lit highway in Britain. The lighting was a precaution against highwaymen, who were comparatively common in Hyde Park at the time.[tpl]cite book | title=The London Encyclopaedia | publisher=Pan Macmillan |author1=Hibbert, Cristopher |author2=Weinreb, Ben |author3=Keay, John |author4=Keay, Julia | year=2011 | pages=424| isbn=0230738788[/tpl]  The track was called Route du Roi, French for King's Road, which was eventually corrupted into "Rotten Row".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde_park/history.cfm | title = Hyde Park: History and Architecture | publisher = The Royal Parks | date = 2003-12-15 | accessdate = 2009-01-14[/tpl] 
In the 18th century, Rotten Row became a popular meeting place for upper-class Londoners. Particularly on weekend evenings and at midday, people would dress in their finest clothes in order to ride along the row and be seen. The adjacent South Carriage Drive was used by society people in carriages for the same purpose. In 1876, it was reconstructed as a horse-ride, with a brick base covered by sand.
The sand-covered avenue of Rotten Row is still maintained as a bridleway and forms part of Hyde Park's South Ride. It is particularly convenient for the Household Cavalry, stabled nearby at Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, who exercise their horses there. Members of the public also ride there, although few people have stables close enough to make use of it. However, there are commercial stables nearby, Hyde Park Stables and 'Ross Nye Stables, that offer horse hire and riding lessons to the public.
Michael Crichton's 1979 feature film, The First Great Train Robbery, is set in 1855, and includes a scene in which the character Edward Pierce (portrayed by Sean Connery) escorts Emily Trent (Pamela Salem) on a supposedly romantic ride along Rotten Row.The First Great Train Robbery. Dir. Michael Crichton. United Artists, 1979.
A Royal plaque commemorating 300 years of Rotten Row was erected in 1990.

"Rotten Row" is used in at least 15 places in England and Scotland, such as in Lewes, East Sussex and Elie, Fife. It describes a place where there was once a row of tumbledown cottages infested with rats (raton) and goes back to the 14th century or earlier, predating the London derivation.[tpl]cite book |last=Cameron |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Place-Names of Derbyshire |year=1959 |publisher=English Place-Name Society |location=Nottingham |isbn= |pages= 435, 449[/tpl] Other historians have speculated the name might be a corruption of rotteran (to muster),[tpl] cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45205 |title='Hyde Park', Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 375-405 |author=Edward Walford |accessdate=29 January 2009[/tpl] Ratten Row (roundabout way), or rotten (the soft material with which the road is covered).[tpl] cite book |url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/14534.html |title='Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |author=E Cobham Brewer |authorlink=Ebenezer Cobham Brewer |publisher=Henry Altemus, 1898; Bartleby.com, 2000 |accessdate=29 January 2009[/tpl]
