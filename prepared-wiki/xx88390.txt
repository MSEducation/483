[[Antonomasia]]

CATEGORIES: Rhetorical techniques

In rhetoric, antonomasia is a substitution of any epithet or phrase for a proper name, such as  "the little corporal" for Napoleon I. The reverse process is also sometimes called antonomasia. The word derives from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἀντονομασία[/tpl], antonomasia, itself from the verb [tpl]lang|grc|ἀντονομάζειν[/tpl], antonomazein, meaning "to name differently".[tpl]LSJ|a)ntonomasi/a|ἀντονομασία[/tpl],[tpl]LSJ|a)ntonoma/zw|ἀντονομάζειν|ref[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=antonomasia|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antonomasia&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary[/tpl][tpl]1911[/tpl] Antonomasia is a particular form of metonymy.
The name used to substitute an abstract notion or personal trait is commonly called archetype or, more specifically, archetypal name.
A frequent instance of antonomasia in the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance was the use of the term "the Philosopher" to refer to Aristotle.  A more recent example of the other form of antonomasia (usage of archetypes) was the use of "Solons" for "the legislators" in 1930s journalism, after the semi-legendary Solon, lawgiver of Athens.

One common example in French is the word for fox: the Latin-derived [tpl]lang-fr|goupil[/tpl] was replaced by [tpl]lang-fr|renard[/tpl], from Renart, the fox hero of the Roman de Renart; originally German Reinhard.
