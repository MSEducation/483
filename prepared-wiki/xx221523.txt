Ffeil (File) is a Welsh-language television news programme for children and young people, produced by BBC Cymru Wales for S4C.

==Overview==

Originally aired three times a week for 15 minutes (except during school summer holidays), Ffeil was later broadcast live for four and a half minutes every weekday afternoon throughout the year at 4:50pm, from the BBC's Broadcasting House in Llandaff, Cardiff. The programme was transmitted from Studio C2, the second largest studio in Broadcasting House. Following a re-launch in Spring 2012, Ffeil is now broadcast from Monday to Thursday from a virtual reality studio at 6.00 and 6.20pm. 
Although the programme has been compared greatly to its English-language counterpart, CBBC's Newsround, Ffeil differs in that it's produced directly by BBC Cymru's news and current affairs department (whereas Newsround is produced by CBBC with facilities provided by BBC News). The programme also has an expanded brief to cover Welsh regional news and features, alongside national and international news. The reporters and presenters on Ffeil also regularly contribute to news coverage on BBC Radio Cymru and the nightly Newyddion programme on S4C.
