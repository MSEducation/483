[[Kent Applicative Operating System]]

CATEGORIES: Discontinued operating systems

The Kent Applicative Operating System is a functional operating system concept to use dynamic process creation and inter-process communication.
The system is based on earlier work by Will R. Stoye. The system allow dynamic creation of functional processes. Processes are stream processors, functions that transform an ingoing to an outgoing stream. Process scheduling is based on evaluation on demand. Inter-process communication is, by message passing, based on Stoye's sorting office concept.
