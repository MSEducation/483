He has been the country's leader since 1989, when he was named First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR, and was elected the nation's first president following its independence from the Soviet Union in December 1991. In April 2011, Nazarbayev was re-elected to another five-year term.

==Early life==

Nazarbayev was born in Chemolgan, a rural town near Almaty, when Kazakhstan was one of the republics of the Soviet Union.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=11[/tpl] His father was a poor labourer who worked for a wealthy local family until Soviet rule confiscated the family's farmland in the 1930s during Joseph Stalin's collectivization policy.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=16[/tpl] Following this, his father took the family to the mountains to live out a nomadic existence.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=20[/tpl]
His father avoided compulsory military service due to a withered arm he sustained when putting out a fire.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=21[/tpl] At the end of World War II the family returned to the village of Chemolgan, and Nazarbayev began to pick up the Russian language.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=22[/tpl] He performed well at school, and was sent to a boarding school in Kaskelen.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=23[/tpl]
After leaving school he took up a one year, government-funded scholarship at the Karaganda Steel Mill in Temirtau.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=24[/tpl] He also spent time training at a steel plant in Dniprodzerzhynsk, and therefore was away from Temirtau as riots over working conditions enveloped the town. 
By the age of 20, he was earning a relatively good wage doing "incredibly heavy and dangerous work" in the blast furnace.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=26[/tpl]
He joined the Communist Party in 1962, and quickly became a prominent member of the Young Communist League. He soon became a full-time worker for the party, and picked up a college education at the Karagandy Polytechnic Institute.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=27[/tpl] He was appointed secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Karaganda Metallurgical Kombinat in 1972, and four years later became Second Secretary of the Karaganda Regional Party Committee.
In his role as a bureaucrat, Nazarbayev spent his days dealing with legal papers, solving logistical problems and industrial disputes, as well as meeting workers to solve individual issues. He later wrote that "the central allocation of capital investment and the distribution of funds" meant that infrastructure was poor, workers were demoralized and overworked, and centrally set targets were unrealistic; he saw the steel plant's problems as a microcosm for the problems for the Soviet Union as a whole.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=28[/tpl]

===Rise to power===

In 1984, Nazarbayev became the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan (chairman of the Council of Ministers), working under Dinmukhamed Kunayev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan.[tpl]cite book|author=Sally N. Cummings|title=Power and change in Central Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TkTJTl_mKmYC&pg=RA1-PA60|accessdate=3 February 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-25585-1|pages=59–61[/tpl]  Nazarbayev criticized Askar Kunayev, head of the Academy of Sciences, at the 16th session of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in January 1986 for not reforming his department. Dinmukhamed Kunayev, Nazarbayev's boss and Askar's brother, felt deeply angered and betrayed. Kunayev went to Moscow and demanded Nazarbayev's dismissal while Nazarbayev's supporters campaigned for Kunayev's dismissal and Nazarbayev's promotion.
Kunayev was ousted in 1986 and replaced by a Russian, Gennady Kolbin, who despite his office had little authority in Kazakhstan.  Nazarbayev was named party leader on 22 June 1989-- only the second Kazakh (after Kunayev) to hold the post. He was Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (head of state) from 22 February to 24 April 1990.
Despite having just been named as leader of Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev was close enough to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he was Gorbachev's second choice to be Vice President of the Soviet Union in 1990.  However, Nazarbayev turned the offer down.Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at Encyclopedia Britannica On 24 April 1990, Nazarbayev was named the first President of Kazakhstan by the Supreme Soviet. He supported Russian President Boris Yeltsin against the attempted coup in August 1991 by Soviet hardliners.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=73[/tpl]
The Soviet Union disintegrated following the failed coup, though Nazarbayev was highly concerned with maintaining the close economic ties between Kazakhstan and Russia.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=81[/tpl]  In the country's first presidential election, held on 1 December, he appeared alone on the ballot and won 91.5% of the vote.[tpl]cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA136|accessdate=3 February 2011|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30610-5|pages=136–[/tpl] On 21 December, he signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, taking Kazakhstan into the Commonwealth of Independent States.[tpl]harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=82[/tpl]

Opposition political parties Ezat, Zheltoqsan and the Republican Party, held demonstrations in Almaty from 10–17 June calling for the formation of a coalition government and the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko and the Supreme Council. Kazakh security personnel forcibly put down the protest on 18 June 1992.

An April 1995 referendum extended his term until 2000. He was re-elected in January 1999 and again in December 2005. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized the last presidential election as falling short of international democratic standards.Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights – Elections. An election requires two or more candidates running in opposition. A single candidate is not an election but a referendum. On 18 May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved a constitutional amendment which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election as many times as he wishes.

President Nazarbayev announced in 2014 that Kazakhstan should change its name to Kazakh Yeli. The reason for this announcement is for Kazakhstan to attract better and more foreign investment since Kazakhstan by name is associated with other -stan countries. Also, he noted Mongolia is receiving more investment than Kazakhstan because its not a -stan country even though it is in the same neighborhood as Kazakhstan and not as stable as Kazakhstan. However, he is letting the people decide on whether the country should change its name.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/07/yes-kazakhstan-should-change-its-name-this-map-shows-why/ | work=The Washington Post | title=WorldViews[/tpl]
