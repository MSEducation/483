Jennifer Jones (March 2, 1919[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]December 17, 2009) was an American Oscar-winning actress during the Hollywood golden years. Jones, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Song of Bernadette (1943), was also  Academy Award-nominated for her performances in four other films. She married three times, most notably to film producer David O. Selznick.
Jones starred in more than twenty films over a thirty year career, going into semi-retirement following Selznick's death in 1965. In 1980, she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation For Mental Health And Education after her daughter's suicide. In later life, Jones withdrew from public life to live in quiet retirement with her son and his family in Malibu, California.

==Early life==

Jones was born Phylis Lee Isley in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the daughter of Flora Mae (née Suber) and Phillip Ross Isley.[tpl]Citation|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/jenjones.htm|title=Genealogy|contribution=Isley family|publisher=Roots web[/tpl]. An only child, she was raised Roman Catholic.[tpl]cite web|last=Luther|first= Claudia|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jennifer-jones18-2009dec18,0,1884574.story|title=Jennifer Jones dies at 90; Oscar-winning actress|work=Los Angeles Times|quote=Jones, who was Catholic and had gone to a convent school...|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=September 16, 2010[/tpl] Her parents toured the Midwest in a traveling tent show that they owned and operated. She attended Monte Cassino, a girls' school and junior college in Tulsa and then Northwestern University in Illinois, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, before transferring to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1938. It was there that she met and fell in love with fellow acting student Robert Walker. The couple married on January 2, 1939.
Isley and Walker returned to Tulsa for a 13-week radio program, arranged by her father, and then made their way to Hollywood. Isley landed two small roles, first in a 1939 John Wayne western titled New Frontier, followed by a serial entitled Dick Tracy's G-Men. In these two films, she was billed as "Phyllis Isley" (with two Ls in her first name), but she failed a screen test for Paramount Pictures and decided to return to New York City.

==Career==

While Walker found steady work in radio programs, Isley worked part-time modeling hats for the Powers Agency while looking for possible acting jobs. When she learned of auditions for the lead role in Claudia, Rose Franken's hit play, she presented herself to David O. Selznick's New York office but fled in tears after what she thought was a bad reading. Selznick, however, overheard her audition and was impressed enough to have his secretary call her back. Following an interview, she was signed to a seven-year contract.
She was carefully groomed for stardom and given a new name: Jennifer Jones. Director Henry King was impressed by her screen test as Bernadette Soubirous for The Song of Bernadette (1943) and she won the coveted role over hundreds of applicants. In 1944, on her 25th birthday, Jones won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Bernadette Soubirous, beating out her friend, Ingrid Bergman, who was the Best Actress nominee for her work in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Jones apologized to Bergman, who replied, "No, Jennifer, your Bernadette was better than my Maria." Jones presented the Best Actress Oscar the following year to Bergman for Gaslight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theoscarsite.com/1943.htm|title=All the Oscars: 1943|publisher=The Oscar Site – A celebration of all things Oscar|first=Gary|last=Moody|accessdate=2006-12-10[/tpl]
Over the next two decades, Jones appeared in a wide range of roles selected by Selznick. Her dark beauty and sensitive nature appealed to audiences and she projected a variable range. Her initial saintly image — as shown in her first starring role — was a stark contrast three years later when she was cast as a provocative  bi-racial woman in Selznick’s controversial film Duel in the Sun (1946). Other notable films included Since You Went Away (1944), Love Letters (1945), Cluny Brown (1946), Portrait of Jennie (1948), Madame Bovary (1949), We Were Strangers (1949), Gone to Earth (1950), Carrie (1952), Ruby Gentry (also 1952), Terminal Station (1953; later released as Indiscretion of an American Wife), Beat the Devil (1953), Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), Good Morning, Miss Dove (also 1955), The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956) starring opposite Gregory Peck and A Farewell to Arms (1957). The portrait of Jones for the film Portrait of Jennie was painted by Robert Brackman. She inspired the character Dolores González in Raymond Chandler's novel The Little Sister (1949).[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Her last big-screen appearance came in the spectacular disaster film The Towering Inferno (1974), in which she danced with Fred Astaire before a fire threatened partygoers in a new San Francisco skyscraper who were celebrating its official opening as tallest building in the world. After helping to assist two children to escape the disaster, her character fell 110 stories to her death from a scenic elevator on the outside of the building which was derailed following an explosion. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Scenes from early on in the movie showed paintings lent to the production from the Norton Simon art gallery. Simon was her husband at the time the movie was produced. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

The Foundation pledged $400,000 to be used exclusively for the world renowned Mary Jennifer Selznick Workshop Program, named in honor of Jones's late daughter.
On May 29, 1971, Jones married multi-millionaire industrialist, art collector and philanthropist Norton Simon, whose son Robert had committed suicide in 1969. The marriage took place aboard a tug 5 miles off the English coast, and was conducted by Unitarian minister Eirion Phillips.[tpl]cite book|author=Paul Green|title=Jennifer Jones: The Life and Films|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VvdJdlLAXJIC&pg=PA198|accessdate=February 17, 2012|date=September 12, 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6041-0|pages=13ff., 198ff[/tpl] Years before, Simon had attempted to buy the portrait of her used in the film Portrait of Jennie.
