He was charged with explosives offenses jointly with Michael Sheehan and James Kelly (Woods). All three were tried as part of the same trial that convicted the Birmingham Six.The Birmingham Framework -Six Innocent Men Framed for the Birmingham Bombings; Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray (1976) Murray remained silent throughout the trial, refusing to plead or acknowledge the proceedings. He was sentenced to 12 years. The trial judge, The Hon. Mr Justice Bridge, described Murray as having all the demeanour of a soldier and commended him for his manner.
In prison he was active in the Blanket protest campaign. On release he was excluded from England and worked as a driver for An Phoblacht while resuming IRA activities. He stayed loyal to the Provisionals following the Real IRA secession, but remained a hardliner within the organisation, strongly opposing decommissioning.
Following his death in 1999, his body was buried in Clonmellon, County Westmeath.
