It was produced by Peter Dawkins.
"Oh No Not You Again" was released in November, 1981 and featured a double A-side with "Lakeside".  Despite the song's popularity, it was not featured on either of Australian Crawl's live albums. James Reyne however did record an acoustic version with a more forlorn tone for his 2004 album And the Horse You Rode in On. The single reached #58 on the Australian Singles Charts in October, 1981.[tpl]cite book|title=Australian Chart Book 1970-1992|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6[/tpl] Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.
