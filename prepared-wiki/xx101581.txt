The Lichfield Canal Aqueduct (or as known by some local residents 'The Climbing Lemming Bridge') is a navigable aqueduct built to carry the future Lichfield CanalLichfield Canal Restoration Trust over the M6 Toll Motorway, just to the west of Lichfield and north of Birmingham, England.
The Lichfield Canal (originally part of the Wyrley and Essington Canal) is currently being restored. Restoration was threatened by the construction of the M6 Toll motorway around the north of Birmingham, which cut across the canal's route. Funds were raised to build an aqueduct to carry the canal over the motorway (the aqueduct has been finished but the canal has yet to reach it, giving it an odd appearance).Lichfield Canal Overview
