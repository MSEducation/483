Stewart  It is a co-educational, non-denominational voluntary grammar school situated in north Belfast.

==History==

The Academy was founded in 1785 by Rev. Dr. James Crombie. Originally situated near St Anne's Parish Church in what is now Academy Street, it moved to its current location on the Cliftonville Road in 1880. For more than a century the school was named Belfast Academy. On 27 November 1887, Queen Victoria granted permission for the school to style itself Belfast Royal Academy, and its name was officially changed in January 1888[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl].

==The "barring out" incident==

Early in the morning of 12 April 1792 a group of schoolboys (eight boarders and two day boys) barricaded themselves in the mathematical classroom. In doing so they “declared war against the masters until their requests should be grantedEarly Education in Belfast”. As they expected to be holed up for some time, they had taken a quantity of provisions from the academy kitchens; further they managed to arm themselves with 5 pistols and a large quantity of gunpowder and shot. A letter, headed “Liberty Hall”, was sent by the students to their masters in which they stated they would not surrender until their demands had been met.
The academy authorities, in an attempt to break the siege, sent workmen to break down the door and pour water down the chimney, without success, as the boys opened fire on them.
Finally the Sovereign of Belfast, Rev. William Bristow, was summoned, he “read the Riot Act” to the boys but failed to end the barring out, and one of the boys opened fire on him.
Later that night the siege ended; the boys were later beaten and then expelled.Belfast Royal Academy: 1785-1935'', by Hugh Shearman
