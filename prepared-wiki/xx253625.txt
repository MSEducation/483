[[1875 Philadelphia White Stockings season]]

CATEGORIES: Philadelphia White Stockings seasons, 1875 in baseball

The Philadelphia White Stockings played in 1875 as a member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. The press of that time generally referred to them as the Philadelphia Whites, or the Philadelphia Club.  The team finished fifth in the league in 1875, with a record of 37-31. Among their players that season was Tim Murnane, spelled "Murnan" by many newspapers (for example, "...yesterday the Whites won the toss and placed their men in position, with the Philadelphias represented by Murnan at the bat."  "Sporting News," Chicago Inter Ocean, June 23, 1875, p. 5). The team and league folded at the conclusion of the season.
