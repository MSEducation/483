The federal government, which had bought the island in 1808, began expanding the island by landfill, to accommodate the immigration station opened in 1892. Landfilling continued in stages until 1934.State.ny.us
Nine-tenths of the current area is artificial island that did not exist at the time of the interstate compact. New Jersey contended that the new extensions were part of New Jersey, since they were not part of the original island. In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the U.S. immigration station, the then Mayor of Jersey City, Bernard J. Berry, commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.[tpl]Cite web   | last = Logan   | first = Andy | authorlink =  | coauthors = McCarten, John | title = Invasion from Jersey | work =  | publisher = The New Yorker | date = January 14, 1956   |url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1956/01/14/1956_01_14_019_TNY_CARDS_000252353 | format =  | doi = | accessdate = 2011-02-14[/tpl] In 1997, the state filed suit to establish its jurisdiction, leading New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to remark dramatically that his father, an Italian who immigrated through Ellis Island, never intended to go to New Jersey.Sheahan, Matthew.

The dispute eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in New Jersey v. New York  [tpl]scite|532|767|1998[/tpl], that New Jersey had jurisdiction over all portions of the island, all of them, created after the original compact was approved (effectively, more than 80% of the island's present land). This caused several immediate confusions: some buildings, for instance, fell into the territory of both states. New Jersey and New York soon agreed to share jurisdiction of the island. It remains wholly a Federal property, however, and these legal decisions do not result in either state taking any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties.National Park Service map showing portions of the island belonging to New York and New JerseyNEW JERSEY v.

For New York State tax purposes, it is assessed as Manhattan Block 1, Lot 201. Since 1998, it also has a tax number assigned by the state of New Jersey.

Originally much of the west shore of Upper New York Bay consisted of large tidal flats which hosted vast oyster banks, a major source of food for the Lenape population who lived in the area prior to the arrival of Dutch settlers. There were several islands which were not completely submerged at high tide, although most of them were submerged. Three of them (later to be known as Liberty, Black Tom and Ellis) were given the name Oyster Islands by the settlers of New Netherland, the first European colony in the Mid-Atlantic states. The oyster beds would remain a major source of food for nearly three centuries.[tpl]Citation   | title = Appendix to Journal of the Sixteenth Senate of the State of New Jersey   | place = Belvidere, New Jersey   | publisher = John Simeron   | year = 1860   | url = http://books.google.nl/books?id=wm1MAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false   | quote = [/tpl][ref]
