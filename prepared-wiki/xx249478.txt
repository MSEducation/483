The town was originally in Union County until 1901, when the boundaries were changed to eliminate the panhandle in which New Bridge was located. New Bridge was platted in 1908, "only after irreversible decline had set in".[tpl]cite book|last=Bailey|first=Barbara Ruth|title=Main Street: Northeastern Oregon|publisher=Oregon Historical Society|year=1982|isbn=0-87595-073-6|pages=53, 55[/tpl] New Bridge sold agricultural products from the Eagle Valley to miners near Sparta. It had a fruit and vegetable cannery, a box factory, and a packing shed for apples. The decline of New Bridge was due in part to nearby Richland being platted in 1897.
