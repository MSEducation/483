==Career at Occidental==

Irani was brought to Occidental in 1983 to help its struggling chemicals division, and soon was promoted to president, replacing a series of presidents fired by Hammer.John Evan Frook, New heir apparent at Occidental doesn't pacify unhappy shareholders, analysts say, Los Angeles Business Journal, February 4, 1990. By 1988, the media reported that Irani and his team were running the day-to-day operations of the company on behalf of the then 90-year-old Hammer.Anthony Ramirez, "Hammer Hits 90! Oxy Grows Up Too," Fortune, November 7, 1988, p. 59. In 2008 Irani was awarded options worth $392 million.[tpl]cn|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Irani made news in 2007, when it was revealed that his total compensation for the 2006 year topped $450 million. His base salary was $1.3 million.  Occidental justified the compensation by pointing to the stock price, which had risen from $9 a share when Irani succeeded Hammer to $48.60 at the end of 2006, and to the company's market capitalization, which grew from $32.1 billion at the end of 2005 to $42.5 billion at the end of 2006. His compensation in 2009 totaled $31.4 million, including $1,170,000 in salary and $24,758,827 in stock.  According to the Associated Press, within the last decade, Irani has received $857 million.
Irani put funds into an overseas tax shelter arranged by Deutsche Bank AG that the IRS later deemed an illegal tax avoidance scheme.  The Occidental Chairman opposed the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena of Deutsche Bank AG records as part of an investigation of myCFO Inc. His appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006.  Occidental’s Board of Directors took no action against Irani despite the IRS ruling. An Occidental spokesman said that Irani’s participation in the tax avoidance scheme was a personal matter and was not a violation of the company’s code of conduct policy.

Irani was awarded a $900,000 cash bonus by the Occidental board of directors for exceptional performance in implementing a cost-cutting initiative (including reduction in force job terminations) in anticipation of a “world-wide economic deterioration.”  This was awarded on a discretionary basis by the Occidental compensation committee and not by any company performance metrics.[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com|title=The Corporate Library[/tpl] Chazen collected $38,080,344 and Irani $76,107,010 in fiscal year 2010, nearly doubling his 2009 compensation despite shareholder outrage over the Occidental board of directors executive pay policies.[tpl]Citation| title = http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=22515| accessdate = 2011-09-11[/tpl]http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=293288&ticker= Executive Profile September 08, 2011  
Irani retired as CEO on May 10, 2011 after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental Investors, objected to the company's compensation policies and announced plans to replace long-term board members who were described as "ossified" in a letter written in protest of Irani's salary.  They also termed Irani's salary a "corporate giveaway program."
Irani's salary was considered excessive and not truly performance based for decades by a number of corporate governance authorities who noted that Irani's compensation had exceeded that of the head of energy giant ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, who leads a company that has a market cap that is five times larger than Occidental Petroleum.[tpl]Citation| title = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/03/business/la-fi-oxy-calstrs-20100803[/tpl]
Former CFO and current President Stephen Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace the 76 year-old Irani, who planned to stay on as executive Chairman until 2014.
Irani was removed from the board of directors of Occidental on May 3, 2013.[tpl]cite news| work=Los Angeles Times | first=Shan | last=Li | date=May 3, 2013[/tpl]

==KB Home backdating scandal==

Irani chaired the KB Home executive compensation committee during the time period when CEO Bruce Karatz lied about the company’s practice of backdating options.  Karatz was subsequently indicted and convicted April 21, 2010 on Federal charges stemming from his actions and sanctioned by the SEC in a separate civil action.  The KB Home shareholders expressed their lack of confidence in the board and the compensation committee by a 19% opposition vote against Irani, who resigned from the KB Home board of directors after 15 years of service.  Occidental offered no explanation for his resignation in their proxy statement.
