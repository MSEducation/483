Vagn Gylding Holmboe ([tpl]IPA-da|ʋɑʊ̯n ˈhʌlmb̥oːˀ[/tpl], 20 December 1909, Horsens, Jutland – 1 September 1996, Ramløse) was a Danish composer and teacher who wrote largely in a  neo-classical style (Rapoport 2001).

==Life==

At the age of 16, Holmboe began formal music training at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen on the recommendation of Carl Nielsen. He studied under Knud Jeppesen (theory) and Finn Høffding (composition). After finishing his studies in 1929 he moved to Berlin where, for a short period, Ernst Toch became his teacher (Rapoport 2001).
In 1933, he married the Romanian pianist Meta Graf. After moving back to Denmark in 1934, he taught at various institutions, including the Royal Conservatory in Copenhagen from 1950 to 1965.
His students included Per Nørgård, Ib Nørholm, Bent Lorentzen, Arne Nordheim, Egil Hovland and Alan Stout.

==Music==

Holmboe composed about 370 works, including 13 symphonies, three chamber symphonies, four symphonies for strings, 20 string quartets, numerous concertos, one opera, and the late series of preludes for chamber orchestra, as well as much choral and other music, in addition to some early works that never received opus numbers. His last work, the 21st string quartet, Quartetto sereno, was completed by his pupil Per Nørgård.
He is considered to be the most important Danish symphonist after Carl Nielsen.[tpl]Cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] His music is characteristically tonal,[tpl]Cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] and musical metamorphosis of thematic or motivic fragments characterize most of his works between the years 1950 and 1970 (similar to Jean Sibelius). His earlier works show the influence of East European composers such as Béla Bartók; his work also shows the influence of Igor Stravinsky, Carl Nielsen and Dmitri Shostakovich.

==Major works==

(M. — Meta number — for Metamorphosis. Might also be said to be named after his wife, Meta May Holmboe... numbering system assembled by Prof. Rapoport. This information from The Compositions of Vagn Holmboe.)
Commercial recordings of his symphonies by Owain Arwel Hughes are still available, as are recordings of his string quartets, chamber concertos, and some other works. His choral or brass music, or his wind Notturno from 1940 may be performed more often than his works for full or chamber orchestra.
Private tapes exist of performances conducted by Holmboe; these were made by Nikolai Malko and/or by Fritz Mahler, but are rare, and difficult to obtain.
