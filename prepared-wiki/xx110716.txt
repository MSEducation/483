==History==

Tatihou, like many of the islets of the Channel Islands contains the -hou suffix.
In 1692 the naval Battle of La Hougue took place between the English and the French close to the island of Tatihou. In 1756 the surroundings of La Hougue were defended by many batteries and forts, but the lack of regular maintenance ensured that these quickly fell into disrepair. In 1720 Tatihou was used for quarantining plague victims from Marseilles.
On 10 December 1803, the 36-gun frigate HMS Shannon grounded on Tatihou. All her crew survived to be captured by troops from a battery. The next day a party from HMS Merlin burned Shannon to prevent her arms and stores falling into French hands.

==Culture==

Tatihou has hosted a small folk festival since 1995, Les Travers√©es de Tatihou, every August 15. The hours are selected according to the tides to allow the festival goers home. The island also hosts music courses several times a year.
