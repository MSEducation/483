==Description==

The [tpl]convert|8500|ha|acre|0[/tpl] park contains sandplains and low lateritic breakaways over sandstones and shales of the Lower Jurassic Cockleshell Gully Formation.

Prominent eucalypt species in the area are Powder-barked Wandoo (Eucalyptus accedens) and Mallalie (E. eudesmoides), while the heaths are rich in species typical of the region and include rare species such as spiral bush (Spirogardnera rubescens). The northern variant of Banksia vestita is also common.[tpl]cite book|title=Conservation Reserves in Western Australia - Report 1974 (Green Book)|author=Conservation through Reserves Committee|publisher=Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia|date=31 January 1975|isbn=0-7244-5934-0 | pages = 5–21[/tpl]

==History==

Land for the national park was set aside by the Department of Lands and Surveys under Reserves ↑26800, ↑26803 and ↑26804 on 23 May 1969, and over 1970 and 1971, the land was classified as an "A" Class reserve, meaning its purpose could not be changed except by an Act of Parliament,[tpl]cite book|last=Jenkins|first=C.

The park was officially named on 8 October 1971.[tpl]Gazette WA | title = Reserves | page=1969:1529 | file = 1183/69, 1184/69, 1185/69 | date = 23 May 1969[/tpl] (Reserves 26800, 26803 and 26804) * [tpl]Gazette WA | title = Land Act 1933-1969 - Order in Council | page = 1970:2029 | file = 1183/69 | date = 10 July 1970[/tpl] See also 29 January 1971 p. 1971:278, 19 February 1971 p. 1971:452. * [tpl]Gazette WA | title = Naming of Alexander Morrison National Park | page = 1971:3952 | file = 2531/54 V2 | date = 8 October 1971[/tpl]
The Environmental Protection Authority recommended in 1974 that a one-kilometre-wide strip of vacant Crown land on the south side of Green Head-Coorow Road be added to the reserve – however, this was not actioned.
