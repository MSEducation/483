The Cape Teal (Anas capensis) is a 44–46 cm long dabbling duck of open wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa.
This species is essentially non-migratory, although it moves opportunistically with the rains. Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is very pale and mainly grey, with a browner back and pink on the bill (young birds lack the pink). The Cape Teal cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.
It is a thinly distributed but widespread duck, rarely seen in large groups except the moulting flocks, which may number up to 2 000.

This is a generally quiet species, except during mating displays. The breeding male has a clear whistle, whereas the female has a feeble "quack".
The Cape Teal is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.
