Alfred the Great is a 1969 epic film which portrayed Alfred the Great's struggle to rid Wessex of the invading Danes, in the 870s AD. It starred David Hemmings in the title role.

==Plot==

Alfred is preparing to join the priesthood, but, angered by the invasion of his country by the Danes, he puts aside his religious vows to lead the West Saxon English against the invaders. Alfred defeats the Danes and becomes an English hero. However, although Alfred still desires to join the priesthood, he is pulled between serving God and his lust for blood. After he marries the beautiful Aelhswith (Prunella Ransome), the Danes return and Alfred must muster the English forces once again for a final battle, but he also must battle the dark conflicts within his own soul.

==Production==

Producer Bernie Smith says he became interested in Alfred the Great after reading about him in Winston Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples. Smith said he "wanted a director who had never done a historical. That way I knew we could minimise cliches and the possibility of someone simply repeating, imitating what went before."[ref]Authenticity Goal of 'Alfred' Director: An Authentic 'Alfred'

Donner said he wanted to make the film "because of the inherent youth problem which is so close to our so-called youth revolt; turning the destructiveness of youth into constructiveness. Like so many students today, he Alfred advocated peace, but at the same time proclaimed violence in order to redo the world."
The film was partly shot in Castlehackett, Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland.[ref]Alfred the Great at Kilchreest

A vast amount of money was spent on the exact replication of every aspect of the ninth century it depicted, turning some corners of County Galway into Wessex, including etching a 200-foot-long white horse into the hill at Knockma.  Members of the Irish military served as extras during the battle scenes filmed in Counties Galway and Westmeath.
