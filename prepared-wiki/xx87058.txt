Bocconi lies in the very center of Milan and therefore its students have easy access to all the main landmarks and activities of the city.

===Traditions===

In the atrium of the oldest building of the university there are three sets of doors. The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate. This derives from the old adage "Chi passa tra i Leoni non si laurea alla Bocconi.".
The three main buildings of Bocconi, if seen from the top, seem to spell "30L" (30 cum Laude), the maximum achievable grade in any exam. The building in via Roentgen is the "3", the velodromo is the "0" and the main building is a cross of two "L"s. It is not clear whether it was planned to have such a shape or was just by chance, anyway it is considered a good omen to the students.
