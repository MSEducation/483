CATEGORIES: Tactical ballistic missiles of the United States

The MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATacMS) is a surface-to-surface missile (SSM) manufactured by Lockheed Martin.  It has a range of over [tpl]convert|100|mi|km|disp=flip[/tpl], with solid propellant, and is [tpl]convert|13|ft|disp=flip[/tpl] high and [tpl]convert|24|in|disp=flip[/tpl] in diameter.
The ATACMS can be fired from MLRS launchers, including the M270, M270 IPDS, M270A1, and HIMARS.  An ATACMS launch container has a lid patterned with six circles like a standard MLRS rocket lid.
The first use of the ATACMS in a combat capability was during Operation Desert Storm, where a total of 32 were fired from the M270 MLRS.DoD, ''Conduct of the Persian Gulf War", April 1992, p. 753.
During the Operation Iraqi Freedom more than 450 missiles were fired.[tpl]cite web|title=Lockheed Martin - Army Tactical Missile System|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/12818.pdf|publisher=Lockheed Martin|year=2006[/tpl]

===MGM-140B - Block IA===

Previously M39A1, missile uses GPS/INS guidance, carries 275 M74 submunitions and has a [tpl]convert|165|km|mi[/tpl] range.[tpl]cite web|title=Lockheed Martin (LTV) MGM-140 ATACMS|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-140.html|publisher=Designation-Systems.net|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl]

===MGM-164 ATacMS - Block II===

A Block II variant (initially designated MGM-140C or, previously, M39A3) was designed to carry a payload of 13 Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) munitions manufactured by Northrop Grumman. However, in late 2003 the U.S. Army terminated the funding for the BAT-equipped ATACMS and therefore the MGM-164A never became fully operational.[tpl]cite web|title=Lockheed Martin MGM-164 ATACMS II|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-164.html|publisher=Designation-Systems.net|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl]

===MGM-168 ATacMS - Block IVA===

Originally designated Block IA Unitary (MGM-140E), the new Block IVA variant was designed to carry a [tpl]convert|500|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl] unitary HE warhead instead of the M74 bomblets. It uses the same GPS/INS guidance as the MGM-140B. The development contract was placed in December 2000, and flight-testing began in April 2001. The first production contract was awarded in March 2002.[tpl]cite web|title=Lockheed Martin MGM-168 ATACMS IVA|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-168.html|publisher=Designation-Systems.net|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] The range has been increased to some [tpl]convert|300|km|mi[/tpl], limited more by the legal provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) than technical considerations.
