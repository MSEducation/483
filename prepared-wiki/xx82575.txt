==History==

===Early period===

Newtown was founded at the end of the 13th century when Edward I of England commissioned Roger de Montgomerie  to construct a centre for the hamlet of Llanfair-yng-Nghedewain.  It was situated near the ford on the River Severn, below the Long Bridge and around the church of St Mary in Bettws Cedewain.  This gave Newtown its original Welsh name.Jones, D "Old town, Newtown", in About Wales, November 2007. Civic Trust for Wales. The foundation is intimately connected to the fate of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, whose new administrative centre at Dolforwyn Castle near Abermule so alarmed Edward I that it was besieged.  He seized Llywelyn's lands and granted them to the Mortimers.  They transferred the administration of the cantref of Cedewain and the commote of Ceri from Dolforwyn Castle to the new settlement at Newtown.

===Later period===

The town grew in the 18th and 19th centuries around the textile and flannel industry, stimulated by the completion of the Montgomeryshire Canal. In 1838, the town saw Wales' first Chartist demonstration.
The town was designated as a "new town" in 1967.  It has seen a large population growth as companies and people have settled, changing the rural market town character. Newtown hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1965.
