GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first film in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A817823 | title =The James Bond Films – 1994–2002 | date=10 November 2002| accessdate =22 October 2007 |work=BBC News [/tpl] The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against London in order to cause a global financial meltdown.
GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.
The film accumulated a worldwide gross of US$350.7 million, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php | title =Box Office History for James Bond Movies | accessdate =18 October 2007 | work =The Numbers | publisher= Nash Information Service [/tpl] Some critics viewed the film as a modernisation of the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his predecessor.[tpl]cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Qnetwork | url=http://www.qnetwork.com/?page=review&id=348 | accessdate=27 April 2007 | author= James Kendrick[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=GoldenEye |work=Variety| author=Todd McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904690.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | date= 15 November 1995| accessdate=18 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Filmcritic.com | url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument | accessdate=27 April 2007 |author=Christopher Null|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013021650/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument |archivedate = 13 October 2007[/tpl] The film also received award nominations for "Best Achievement in Special Effects" and "Best Sound" from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995|title=Film Nominations 1995|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=5 April 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080228220536/http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995 |archivedate=28 February 2008[/tpl]
The name "GoldenEye" pays homage to James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. While working for British Naval Intelligence as a lieutenant commander, Ian Fleming liaised with the American OSS to monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in an operation codenamed Operation Goldeneye. Fleming used the name of his operation for his estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica.

==Plot==

In 1986 MI6 officers James Bond—agent 007—and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet chemical weapons facility at Arkhangelsk and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is apparently shot and killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond steals an aeroplane and flees from the facility as it explodes.
Nine years later, Bond arrives in Monte Carlo to follow Xenia Onatopp, a suspected member of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a suspicious relationship with a Royal Canadian Navy admiral. She murders the admiral to allow Janus to steal his identity. The next day they steal a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. They fly it to a bunker in Severnaya, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons. They program one of the GoldenEye satellites to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in St. Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus.
In London, M assigns Bond to investigate the attack. Bond flies to St. Petersburg to meet CIA officer Jack Wade. He suggests Bond meet Valentin Zukovsky, a Russian Mafia head and business rival of Janus. After Bond gives him a tip on a potential heist, Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Onatopp is sent to meet Bond at his hotel and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her and she takes him to Janus. Bond meets Janus who reveals himself as Alec Trevelyan, who had faked his death but was badly scarred from the explosion at Arkhangelsk. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in World War II, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against Britain for their involvement in his parents' deaths. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquiliser dart, knocking him out.
Bond awakens tied up with Simonova in the Tiger helicopter programmed to self-destruct, from which the two escape. They are immediately arrested by the Russian police and are brought to the military archives, where the Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. As Simonova reveals the existence of a second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the massacre at Severnaya, Ourumov bursts into the room and kills Mishkin. As Ourumov calls for his guards, Bond escapes into the archives with Simonova, where a firefight ensues. Simonova is captured and is dragged into a car by Ourumov. Bond steals a T-55 tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Janus' armoured train, where he kills Ourumov as Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Simonova. As the train's self-destruct countdown begins, Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch while Simonova locates Grishenko's satellite dish in Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.
Bond and Simonova, now lovers, meet Jack Wade and trade Bond's car for Wade's aeroplane. While flying over a Cuban jungle in search of the satellite dish controlling the satellite, Bond and Simonova are shot down. As they stumble out of the wreckage, Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a struggle, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death. Bond and Simonova then watch a lake being drained of water, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, where Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the remaining GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.
Meanwhile, Simonova programs the satellite to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Simonova and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Bond triggers an explosion with his pen grenade and escapes to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna by jamming the gears, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite, before turning and fighting Trevelyan. The two end up on the antenna platform, 500 feet above the dish. Bond kicks Trevelyan off the side of the platform, but reflexively grabs him by the foot. After a brief and personal exchange, Bond lets go of Trevelyan and he falls to the bottom of the pool. The cradle blows up and kills Trevelyan and Grishenko. Meanwhile, Simonova commandeers a helicopter and flees with Bond, and the couple is then rescued by Wade and a team of Marines.

===Prelude===

Licence to Kill had underperformed at the box office and was, in the American market, the lowest-grossing film of the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=jamesbond.htm|title=James Bond| work=Box Office Mojo| accessdate=16 November 2008[/tpl] Also, in 1989, MGM/UA was sold to the Australian broadcasting group Qintex, which wanted to merge the company with Pathé. Danjaq, the parent company of Eon Productions, sued MGM/UA because the Bond back catalogue was being licensed to Pathé, who intended to broadcast the Bond series on television in several countries across the world without the approval of Danjaq. These legal disputes delayed the film for several years.[tpl]cite web | title=GoldenEye – The Road To Production | publisher=Mi6-HQ.com | url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/ge_roadtoproduction.php3 | date=23 June 2003| accessdate=4 January 2007[/tpl]
While the legal disputes went on, Timothy Dalton was still expected to play Bond in the new film, as he had signed a three-film contract. Pre-production work began in May 1990 with a story draft written by Alfonso Ruggiero Jr. and Michael G. Wilson. Production was set to start in 1990 in Hong Kong for a release in late 1991, however the legal disputes caused these dates to pass without a film in production.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_17_intro.php3| title=Bond 17 – History | work=Mi6-HQ.com- The Home of James Bond | accessdate=28 January 2008 [/tpl] In an interview in 1993, Dalton said that Michael France was writing the screenplay, due to be completed in January or February 1994.[tpl]cite news |title = Interview with Dalton |work=Daily Mail | date = 6 August 1993[/tpl] Despite France's screenplay being completed by that January, in April 1994 Dalton officially resigned from the role.[tpl]cite video | people = Michael G.

Judi Dench was cast as M, making GoldenEye the first film of the series featuring a female M. The decision is widely believed to be inspired by Stella Rimington becoming head of MI5 in 1992.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bookpage.com/0502bp/stella_rimington.html |publisher=BookPage| title = Her majesty's not-so-secret service | accessdate =14 November 2006| author= Jay MacDonald | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060826194750/http://www.bookpage.com/0502bp/stella_rimington.html  | archivedate = 26 August 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020430/ai_n12622913 | title = Woman tipped to head MI5 in footsteps of Stella Rimington | work=Independent, The (London) | accessdate =14 November 2006 | author=Nigel Morris | date=30 April 2002|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013210329/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020430/ai_n12622913 |archivedate = 13 October 2007[/tpl]
GoldenEye was produced by Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions. With Albert Broccoli's health deteriorating (he died seven months after the film's release), his daughter Barbara Broccoli described him as taking "a bit of a back seat" in film's production.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hmss.com/films/mgw/mgw95.html | title =Richard Ashton Interview Michael G.

While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tenerifenews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8140:two-profiles-ian-fleming-a-boris-johnson&catid=64:features&Itemid=26|title=Two profiles: Ian Fleming & Boris Johnson|date=11 May 2008|publisher=Fortnightly Tenerife News|accessdate=16 December 2008[/tpl] Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate, including Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye[tpl]cite book | author = Pearson, John | year = 1966 | title = The Life of Ian Fleming |page=137 |publisher = Vintage/Ebury | isbn = 0-224-61136-4 | authorlink = John Pearson (author)[/tpl] and Operation Goldeneye, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during World War II in case of a Nazi invasion through Spain.[tpl]cite web | title= The Real James Bond | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/james_bond.html |publisher=Channel 4  | accessdate=19 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title= Adultery, Cambridge spies, a Jamaican idyll – Ian Fleming's biographer Andrew Lycett traces the origins of James Bond | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article621510.ece |work=The Times | author=Andrew Lycett | date=5 November 2006| accessdate=19 November 2006 | location=London[/tpl]
Since the release of Licence to Kill, the world had changed drastically. GoldenEye was the first James Bond film to be produced since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. This cast doubt over whether James Bond was still relevant in the modern world, as many of the previous films pitted him against Soviet villains trying to take advantage of the Cold War.[tpl]cite book |title=Ian Fleming and James Bond|author= Edward P.

One of GoldenEye's innovations was the casting of a female M. In the film, the new M quickly establishes her authority, remarking that Bond is a "sexist, misogynist dinosaur" and a "relic of the Cold War". This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton's Bond from 1989.[tpl]cite web | url = http://notcoming.com/reviews/goldeneye/ | title = GoldenEye | publisher = Notcoming.com | accessdate =28 April 2007[/tpl]

===Filming===

The bungee jump was filmed at the Contra Dam (also known as the Verzasca or Locarno Dam)[tpl]cite web|title=007's bungee jump tops best movie stunt poll|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2002/1117/entertainment/qlqlkfmhgb/|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=17 November 2002[/tpl] in Ticino, Switzerland. The film's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's demonstration were shot in Monte Carlo.

The French Navy provided full use of the frigate FS La Fayette and their newest helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger to the film's production team. The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for the film. However, the producers had a dispute with the French Ministry of Defence over Brosnan's opposition to French nuclear weapons testing and his involvement with Greenpeace; as a result, the French premiere of the film was cancelled.[tpl]cite news | title = Bond drops a bomb | work = The Sunday Times | date = 3 December 1995| author = Lang, Kirsty[/tpl]

===Effects===

GoldenEye was the last film of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings, to whom the film was dedicated. Meddings' major contribution was miniatures.[tpl]cite video|title=Making It Small in Pictures: Derek Meddings|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment[/tpl] It was also the first Bond film to use computer generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes into the tank, and the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in England.
Stunt car coordinator Rémy Julienne described the car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between "a perfectly shaped, old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar." The stunt had to be meticulously planned as the cars are vastly different. Nails had to be attached to the F355 tyres to make it skid, and during one take of the sliding vehicles, both cars collided.[tpl]cite video|title=Driven to Bond: Remy Julienne|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment[/tpl] The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase, which took around six weeks to film, partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly at Leavesden.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/interview_steve_street1.php3?t=&s=articles | title = Interview – Steve Street (Part 1) | publisher= MI6-HQ.com | accessdate =11 December 2006 | date = 26 August 2003[/tpl] A Russian T-54/55 tank, on loan from the East England Military Museum, was modified with the addition of fake explosive reactive armour panels. In order to avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-54/55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank. The T55 Tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airport where the East England Military Museum is based.Diss Express Article on the permanent display of the Goldeneye T55 Tank, 20th October 2013
For the confrontation between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell decided to take inspiration from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean did all the stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.
The opening [tpl]convert|220|m|abbr=on[/tpl] bungee jump at Archangel, shot at the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland and performed by Wayne Michaels, was voted the best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll, and set a record for the highest bungee jump off a fixed structure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2486000/2486357.stm|title=Amazing Bond stunt wins top award|publisher=CBBC Newsround|date=17 November 2002|accessdate=15 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = 007's bungee jump tops best movie stunt poll | publisher=Breaking News | date = 17 November 2002[/tpl] The ending of the pre-credits sequence with Bond jumping after the aeroplane features Jacques 'Zoo' Malnuit riding the motorcycle to the edge and jumping, and B.J.

The fall of communism in Russia is the main focus of the opening titles, designed by Daniel Kleinman (who took over from Maurice Binder after his death in 1991). They show the collapse and destruction of several structures associated with the Soviet Union, such as the red star, statues of Communist leaders and the hammer and sickle. In an interview, Kleinman said they were meant to be "a kind of story telling sequence" showing that "what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.jamesbond.com/bond20/newsflash/newsflash_27.php | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060204162919/http://www.jamesbond.com/bond20/newsflash/newsflash_27.php | archivedate = 4 February 2006| title = Opening Sequence W/ Daniel Kleinman |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.| accessdate =18 January 2007[/tpl] According to producer Michael G.

For the film, a convertible Z3 is equipped with the usual Q refinements, including a self-destruct feature and Stinger missiles behind the headlights. The Z3 does not have much screen time and none of the gadgets are used, which Martin Campbell attributed to the deal with BMW coming in the last stages of production. The Z3's appearance in GoldenEye is thought to be the most successful promotion through product placement in 1995.[tpl]Cite journal| author= Lance Kinney | coauthors = Barry Sapolsky | title = Product Placement | publisher = University of Alabama, Florida State University|year=1994| postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Ten years later, The Hollywood Reporter listed it as one of the most successful product placements in recent years. The article quoted Mary Lou Galician, head of media analysis and criticism at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, as saying that the news coverage of Bond's switch from Aston Martin to BMW "generated hundreds of millions of dollars of media exposure for the movie and all of its marketing partners."[tpl]cite news | title = A look at some of the biggest hits in film and TV product placement | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |work = The Hollywood Reporter | date = 28 April 2005| accessdate =12 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395  |archivedate = 11 October 2007[/tpl]
In addition, all computers in the film were provided by IBM, and in some scenes (such as the pen grenade scene towards the end), the OS/2 Warp splash screen can be seen on computer monitors.
A modified Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional watch features as a major plot device several times in the film. It is shown to contain a remote detonator and a laser. This was the first time James Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega, and the character has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production.Review of the “Bond” Omega Seamaster Professional Model 2531.80.00 | THE SEAMASTER REFERENCE PAGE"Ambassadors: James Bond", Omega SA, 29 March 2004 (Retrieved 21 February 2007).

GoldenEye was edited in order to be guaranteed a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head when he is shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.[tpl]cite video|date= 17 July 2006|title= GoldenEye: James Bond Ultimate Edition Region 2|format=PAL, Widescreen|medium= DVD|publisher=Mgm Home Ent|accessdate=25 September 2007|id= ASIN: B000FIF5KC[/tpl]

GoldenEye was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner.

Nintendo announced a remake of the original GoldenEye 007 game at their E3 press conference on 15 June 2010. The game is a modernised retelling of the original movie's story, with Daniel Craig playing the role of Bond. The theme song is a cover of the movie's theme performed by Nicole Scherzinger. The game was developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Wii and Nintendo DS and was released in November 2010. Both Wii and DS versions bear little to no resemblance to the locations and weapons of the original N64 release. In 2011 the game was ported to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the name GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.[tpl]cite news|title=E3 2010: GoldenEye first look|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jun/17/e3-2010-goldeneye|accessdate=24 June 2010|date=17 June 2010|author=Keith Stewart|work=The Guardian|location=London[/tpl]
