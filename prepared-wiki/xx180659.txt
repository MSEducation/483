==History==

In March 1992, the Northwest Communities Educational Center applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on October 15, 1992, with a scheduled expiration date of April 15, 1994. The new station was assigned call sign "KQVN" on December 3, 1992. The station was assigned new call sign "KRCW" on May 6, 1994.
In November 1997, the Northwest Communities Educational Center reached an agreement to transfer the permit for KRCW to Farmworker Educational Radio Network, Inc. The FCC approved the deal on December 17, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on March 30, 1998. After a series of delays and extensions, construction and testing were completed in September 1999, the station was granted its broadcast license on December 9, 1999.
