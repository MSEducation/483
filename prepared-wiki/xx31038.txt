On December 28, 1995, EchoStar successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I. With this and the completion of the construction of the satellite uplink center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, The Dish Network brand name was born to represent the home satellite TV service. In March 1996, the company made its first broadcast to customers.
In 1998, EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation's ASkyB and MCI Worldcom. With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° West orbital slot, more than doubling existing continental United States broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million. The acquisition inspired the company to introduce a multisatellite system called Dish 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one Dish. In the same year, Echostar, partnering with Bell Canada, launched Dish Network Canada.

===HD expansion===

In January 1999, the company released the industry's first High-definition television (HDTV) tuner. In August 2003, the company launched EchoStar IX, the first satellite equipped with commercial Ka band payload for broadband service over the United States. This led the company in 2004 to be the first satellite TV service to offer local channels to all 50 states. In that year, the company also introduced the nation's first interactive TV multiple picture-in picture application for the Olympic Games, offering coverage from multiple channels at once. This year the company also acquired its 10 millionth customer.
In January 2005, EchoStar bought the broadcasting assets of the troubled HDTV satellite provider Voom, including its Rainbow 1 satellite co-located with EchoStar 3 at 61.5° West. On April 29, EchoStar announced that it would expand its HDTV programming by adding the first 10 of 21 original Voom channels and mirror the channels on a CONUS slot. Dish Network added CNN HD in Spanish along with other packages in its Latino HD lineup.
On January 1, 2008, the company completed its spinoff of its technology and set-top box business into a separate publicly traded company, Echostar Corporation ("Echostar"), effectively splitting the original Echostar into two separate businesses.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?rpc=66&symbol=SATS.O |title=EchoStar Corp (SATS.O) Company Profile |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=June 18, 2008 [/tpl] Dish Network Corporation, the larger of the two resulting companies, focuses on programming, service and marketing of satellite television, while EchoStar Corporation runs a majority of the satellite fleet and other signal infrastructure. While neither company has any ownership in the other, the majority of the voting power of the shares in both companies is owned by Charlie Ergen.

===Acquisitions and diversification===

In 2011, Dish Network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy,[tpl]cite news |title=A Deeper Dish Network|first1=Alex|last1=Sherman|first2=Ronald|last2=Grover |date=October 13, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-deeper-dish-network-10132011.html |accessdate=October 14, 2011[/tpl] which Motley Fool's Anders Bylund described as "a veritable buying rampage in the bargain bin."[tpl]cite news |title=Is DISH Building the Perfect Beast? |author=Anders Bylund |work=Motley Fool |date=July 1, 2011 |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2011/07/01/is-dish-building-the-perfect-beast.aspx |accessdate=May 4, 2012[/tpl] This includes the April 6, 2011, purchase of Blockbuster Inc. in a bankruptcy auction in New York, agreeing to pay $322 million in cash and assume $87 million in liabilities and other obligations for the nationwide video-rental company.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/07/business/la-fi-ct-dish-blockbuster-20110407|title=Dish Network wins bidding for assets of bankrupt Blockbuster |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times|first=Ben|last=Fritz|date=April 7, 2011[/tpl] Dish Network also acquired the defunct companies DBSD and Terrestar.

CEO Charles Ergen plans on adding wireless internet and mobile video services that can compete with Netflix and cable companies. About the new markets, Ergen said, "Given the assets we've been accumulating, I don't think it's hard to see we're moving in a different direction from simply pay-TV, which is a market that's becoming increasingly saturated."
Dish Network put its Blockbuster acquisition to work by announcing Blockbuster movie pass, which allows on-demand movies, game and DVD rentals, and online streaming services for a flat monthly fee. Dish Network plans a similar service for non-Dish Network customers. As Blockbuster had agreements that allow it to receive DVDs 28 days earlier than Netflix, the new service could be major competition.
Dish Network also plans on offering high-speed internet. The company plans a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile broadband service. In 2011, it petitioned the FCC to combine the S-Band spectrum it acquired from DBSD and Terrestar, and combine this spectrum with LTE. Unlike LightSquared, Dish's spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting Global Positioning Systems.[tpl]cite news |title=Dish's wireless plan unveiled: satellite-terrestrial LTE-Advanced network |author=Phil Goldstein |date=August 23, 2011 |work=Fierce Wireless |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/dishs-wireless-plan-unveiled-satellite-terrestrial-lte-advanced-network/2011-08-23 |accessdate=October 14, 2011[/tpl]
At the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, Dish Network announced that they would be dropping the “Network” and going solely by Dish (along with a new logo) in their marketing.

After changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over Mexico to Brazil in 2011, Dish Network sought companies that could make a deal, among them Telefónica. However, nothing ever came of this, and Dish decided to enter the country itself. According to the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications (Anatel), they await the authorization of the application.[tpl]cite web|last=Wiziack|first=Julio|title=TV paga terá novo competidor estrangeiro|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/1249150-tv-paga-tera-novo-competidor-estrangeiro.shtml|work=Folha de S.

==Technical information==

===Satellite dishes===

Dish Network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet. Most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by Sanmina-SCI Corporation to EchoStar specifications. Prior to the December 2001 merger of SCI Systems and Sanmina, Dish Network receivers were produced at factories in Huntsville, Alabama and Fountain, Colorado. Currently,[tpl]When|date=November 2009[/tpl] receiver assembly takes place in Guadalajara, Mexico and India.

====Earlier satellite dishes====

Dish Network's first satellite antenna was simply called the "Dish Network" Dish. It was retroactively named the "Dish 300" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming Dish 500 systems. It uses one LNB to obtain signals from the 119°W orbital location,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.Dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |title=Dish 300 and 500 Pointing Guide |publisher=Dish Network |format=PDF |accessdate=December 19, 2008[/tpl] and was commonly used as a second Dish to receive additional high-definition or ethnic programming from either the 148°W or 61.5°W orbital locations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |title=Channels at 61.5°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |title=Channels at 148°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat[/tpl] The 119°W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110°W, that provide core services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |title=Channels at 110°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |title=Channels at 119°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat[/tpl]
After EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom, it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W orbital location it developed the Dish 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one Dish and an innovative dual-LNB assembly. Although the new 20-inch Dish 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch Dish 300 and DirecTV Dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The Dish 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to Dish 500, Dish Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the Dish 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are H2, Boomerang, Science, Planet Green, and Comedy Central.

====Higher capacity satellite dishes====

In spite of all this capacity, EchoStar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide high-definition television and conceived the Dish 1000 system to receive signals from 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations. Originally, Dish Network high-definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes. Currently, Dish Network subscribers can receive nationwide HDTV channels using the 129°W orbital location or 61.5°W orbital location. Because of issues with low signal strength, the older model Dish 1000 has been replaced with the Dish 1000.2. The 1000.2 has a 10% larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated LNB for easier installation. The Dish 1000.2 is [tpl]convert|23|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter. Even with the larger size, there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the 129°W orbital location. This has forced some customers to either use a 2nd separate Dish Network brand dish, or an aftermarket 30" dish, aimed specifically at the 129°W orbital location. On several satellite related web support forums, customers have critically suggested that the new Dish 1000.2 wasn't nearly large enough and should have been 20–30% larger to properly deal with rain fade.  Later Dish Network took the approach of splitting the US into two regions.  Subscribers west of Chicago use Dish 1000.2 antennas aimed at the 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations (referred to as the western arc).  Subscribers east of Chicago use Dish 1000.4 antennas aimed at the 61.5°W, 72°W and 77°W oribital locations (referred to as the eastern arc).
During Dish Network's quest for capacity, they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies, orbital locations, and surplus capacity using non-mainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes. To capitalize on these broadcasting assets, Dish Network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lower-powered satellites broadcasting in the non-DBS portion of the FSS band. Dish Network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
The SuperDish, Dish 500+, and Dish 1000+ systems receive DBS signals from both of the primary 110°W and 119°W locations (129°W for Dish 1000+) as well as lower-powered FSS signals from either 121°W, 105°W, or 118.75°W. The Dish 500+ and 1000+ systems receive circularly polarized signals in the non-DBS portion of the FSS band—the only American satellite television service to do so.

===Broadcast technology===

While for years Dish Network has used standard MPEG-2 for broadcasting, the addition of bandwidth-intensive HDTV in a limited-bandwidth world has called for a change to an H.264/MPEG-4 AVC system. Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. Dish Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, Dish Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as HD Lite and is practiced by other TV providers as well.
Both a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in digital video recorder (DVR) are available to subscribers. The Dish Network ViP722 HD DVR (Record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD), up to 55 hours of high-definition (HD)) replacement to the ViP622 has received generally positive reviews[tpl]cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-video-recorders-dvrs/Dish-network-vip622-hd/4505-6474_7-31778299.html |title=Dish Network ViP622 HD DVR Digital Video Recorder (DVR) reviews |publisher=CNET |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2006 |author=David Katzmaier |coauthors=John P. Falcone[/tpl] from CNET and others.
Both a standard receiver and a DVR (digital video recorder) are available to subscribers for an upgrade fee. Beginning in January 2010, Dish Network charges $6.00 as a DVR service fee, which covers cost of licensing EPG (electronic program guide) from TV Guide.

===Satellite fleet===

Most of the satellites used by Dish Network are owned and operated by EchoStar. Since EchoStar frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots this list may not be immediately accurate. Refer to Lyngsat and Dish Channel Chart for detailed satellite information.
