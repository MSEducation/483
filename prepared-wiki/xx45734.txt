==The Iguanodon mine==

In 1878, dozens of Iguanodon skeletons were discovered in a coal mine, 322 m (1,050 ft) below the ground. At the time, their proximity was considered proof that some dinosaurs were herd animals. They were mounted by Louis Dollo and set the standard that was followed for over a century. Nine of the twenty-nine skeletons are currently on display at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and one at the Bernissart Museum. The two museums even made an error they acknowledge with humour : they displayed the skeletons "standing", suggesting that the dinosaurs were bidepal, which is not the case.
