Working on the film as associate producer and writer, this was an early assignment for director Basil Dearden: "it was relatively easy to fit the Formby films into the new demands thrown up by the war: whereas George had typically had to overcome rogues and villains in his 1930s films, these were now simply replaced by spies and saboteurs."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CXDdTR62pd4C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=spare+a+copper+(1940)+reviews&source=bl&ots=RTeUgp1VD8&sig=WuC10EBWzc_SpuP0TORqoklk4wE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=N9cJU-y6IIjW7QbewoGgBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=spare%20a%20copper%20(1940)%20reviews&f=false |title=The Cinema of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph - Alan Burton, Tim O'Sullivan - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

Formby plays a slightly bumbling War Reservist police officer called George Carter who aspires to become a member of the flying squad. The film is set in Merseyside where the battleship HMS Hercules is being built.  A group of saboteurs are planning to destroy HMS Hercules by blowing it up. George manages to foil the saboteurs' attempts to destroy HMS Hercules, saving the battleship from being blown up by saboteurs. One of the saboteurs, called "Jake", is played by Bernard Lee.
