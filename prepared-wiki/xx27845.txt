</ref>  – and specifically considers market failures absent considerations of the "[[public interest]]", or [[Equity (economics)|equity]], citing definitional concerns.<ref name="mankiw"/> This form of analysis has also been adopted by the [[Keynesian]] or [[new Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] schools in modern [[macroeconomics]], applying it to [[Walras]]ian models of [[general equilibrium]] in order to deal with failures to attain [[full employment]], or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.
Many social democrats and "New Deal liberals", have adopted this analysis for public policy, so they view market failures as a very common problem of any unregulated market system and therefore argue for state intervention in the economy in order to ensure both efficiency and social justice (usually interpreted in terms of limiting avoidable inequalities in wealth and income). Both the democratic accountability of these regulations and the technocratic expertise of the economists play an important role here in shaping the kind and degree of intervention. Neoliberals follow a similar line, often focusing on "market-oriented solutions" to market failure: for example, they propose going beyond the common idea of having the government charge a fee for the right to pollute (internalizing the external cost, creating a disincentive to pollute) to allow polluters to sell the pollution permits.
Some remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures.  For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the patent system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.

==Objections==

===Public choice===

Economists such as Milton Friedman from the Chicago school and others from the Public Choice school, argue that market failure does not necessarily imply that government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of government failure might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (rent seekers) both in the private sector and in the government bureaucracy.  Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by coercive government intervention.  Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.

===Austrian===

Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, such as some economists of the Austrian School, argue that there is no such phenomenon as "market failures". Israel Kirzner states that: "Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals".[tpl]cite book|author=Israel Kirzner|title=Market Theory and the Price System|year=1963|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company|location=Princeton. N.J.|pages=35[/tpl] Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals.[tpl]cite journal|author=Roy E. Cordato|title=The Austrian Theory of Efficiency and the Role of Government|year=1980|journal=The Journal of Libertarian Studies |url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/4_4/4_4_6.pdf|volume=4|issue=4|pages=393–403 396[/tpl] This definition of efficiency differs from that of Pareto efficiency, and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the first welfare theorem are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of entrepreneurship driven by the profit motive; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting.[tpl]cite journal|author=Roy E. Cordato|title=The Austrian Theory of Efficiency and the Role of Government|year=1980|journal=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/4_4/4_4_6.pdf|volume=4|issue=4|pages=393–403[/tpl]

===Marxian===

Objections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as that of equity, or Marxian analysis.  Colloquial uses of the term "market failure" reflect the notion of a market "failing" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency – for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a "market failure", yet are not Pareto inefficient, and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream
economics. In addition, many Marxian economists would argue that the system of individual property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of "market failure" which focuses on specific situations – typically seen as "abnormal" – where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically-unwanted outcomes – viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy – and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.
