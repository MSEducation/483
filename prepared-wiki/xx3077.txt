CATEGORIES: Canonical epistles, New Testament books

The Epistle of James ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἰάκωβος|Iakōbos[/tpl]), usually referred to simply as James, is a letter (epistle) in the New Testament. The earliest extant manuscripts of James usually date to the mid-to-late third century.[tpl]cite book|last=McCartney|first=Dan G|title=Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: James|year=2009|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0801026768|editor=Robert W Yarbrough and Robert H Stein[/tpl]
The author identifies himself as "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ" and the epistle is traditionally attributed to James the Just.[tpl]cite book|last=Davids|first=Peter H|title=New International Greek Testament Commentary: The Epistle of James|year=1982|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0802823882|edition=Repr.|editor=I Howard Marshall and W Ward Gasque[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Evans|first=Craig A|title=Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John, Hebrews-Revelation|year=2005|publisher=Victor|location=Colorado Springs, Colo.|isbn=0781442281|editor=Craig A Evans[/tpl]
There are four views concerning the Epistle of James:

==Composition==

The epistle may not be a true piece of correspondence between specific parties, but rather an example of wisdom literature formulated as a letter for circulation. The work is considered New Testament wisdom literature because, "like Proverbs and Sirach, it consists largely of moral exhortations and precepts of a traditional and eclectic nature."[tpl]cite book|last=Laws|first=Sophie|title=The HarperCollins Study Bible|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|location=San Francisco|isbn=0060655267|pages=2052[/tpl]  Similarly, the Catholic Encyclopedia says, "the subjects treated of in the Epistle are many and various; moreover, St. James not infrequently, whilst elucidating a certain point, passes abruptly to another, and presently resumes once more his former argument."[tpl]cite web|last=Camerlynck|first=Achille|title=Epistle of St James|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08275b.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]

===Authorship===

The writer calls himself simply “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.”[tpl]bibleref2c|Jas|1:1[/tpl] Jesus had two apostles named James, but it is unlikely that either of these wrote the letter. One apostle, James, the son of Zebedee, was martyred about 44 AD.See [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|12:1–2[/tpl] This would be very early for him to have been the writer. The other apostle James, the son of Alphaeus, is not prominent in the Scriptural record, and very little is known about him.
Rather, evidence points to James the brother of Jesus, to whom Jesus evidently had made a special appearance after his resurrection described in the New Testament. This James was prominent among the disciples.See [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|13:55[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleref2|Acts|21:15–25[/tpl];[tpl]bibleref2|1Cor|15:7|esv|1 Corinthians 15:7[/tpl]; and [tpl]bibleref2|Galatians|1:19[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Galatians|2:9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Moo|first=Douglas J|title=The Letter of James|year=2000|publisher=Wm B Eerdmans Publishing co|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0802837301|editor=D A Carson[/tpl] The writer of the letter of James identifies himself as “a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,” in much the same way as did Jude, who introduced the letter of Jude by calling himself “a slave of Jesus Christ, but a brother of James.” (Jas 1:1; Jude 1) Furthermore, the salutation of James’ letter includes the term “Greetings!” in the same way as did the letter concerning circumcision that was sent to the congregations. In this latter instance it was apparently Jesus’ brother James who spoke prominently in the assembly of “the apostles and the older men” at Jerusalem.—Adam Clarke,1821, commentary on 5:13, 22, 23.
From the middle of the 3rd century, patristic authors cited the Epistle as written by James the Just, a relation of Jesus and first Bishop of Jerusalem. Not numbered among the Twelve Apostles, unless he is identified as James the Less,[tpl]cite web|last=Bechtel|first=Florentine|title=The Brethren of the Lord|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02767a.htm|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012|quote=His identity with James the Less (Mark 15:40) and the Apostle James, the son of Alpheus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18), although contested by many Protestant critics, may also be considered as certain.[/tpl] James was nonetheless a very important figure: Paul described him as "the brother of the Lord" in Galatians 1:19 and as one of the three "pillars of the Church" in 2:9. He is traditionally considered the first of the Seventy Disciples. John Calvin and others suggested that the author was the Apostle James, son of Alphaeus, who was often identified with James the Just. If written by James the Just, the place and time of the writing of the epistle would be Jerusalem, where James resided before his martyrdom in 62.
The Protestant reformer Martin Luther denied it was  the work of an apostle and termed it an "epistle of straw"[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch04.htm |title=History of the Christian Church, book 7, chapter 4[/tpl] as compared to some other books in the New Testament, not least because of the conflict he thought it raised with Paul on the doctrine of justification (see below).
Many scholars consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries. Among the reasons for this are:[tpl]cite web|title=Epistle of James|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html|work=Early Christian Writings|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]

==Content==

The United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament divides the letter into the following sections:
Framed within an overall theme of patient perseverance during trials and temptations, the text condemns various sins and calls on Christians to be patient while awaiting the Second Coming.
The epistle was addressed to "the twelve tribes scattered abroad" (James 1:1), which is generally taken to mean a Jewish Christian audience.
The object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. The vices against which he warns them are: formalism, which made the service of God consist in washings and outward ceremonies, whereas he reminds them (1:27) that it consists rather in active love and purity; fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces (1:20); fatalism, which threw its sins on God (1:13); meanness, which crouched before the rich (2:2); falsehoods, which had made words and oaths play-things (3:2–12); partisanship (3:14); evil speaking (4:11); boasting (4:16); oppression (5:4). The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good works (1:22–25), patience under provocation (3:17), patience under oppression (5:7), patience under persecution (5:10); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord drawing nigh, which is to right all wrong (5:8).

==Alternative view==

There are other approaches to understanding, and reading, the epistle of James. A historical approach begins on different assumptions, and is not content leaving the book as just "New Testament wisdom literature, like a small book of Proverbs", or like a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string.as numerous writers and commentators assume, e.g. William Barclay, The Daily Study Bible, rev. ed., 17 vols. (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1976), Vol 14, The Letters of James and Peter, p. 28. A 2013 journal articleJim Reiher, “Violent Language – a clue to the Historical Occasion of James.” Evangelical Quarterly. Vol. LXXXV No. 3. July 2013 explores a violent historical background behind the epistle and offers the suggestion that it was indeed written by James the brother of Jesus, and written before his murder in 62 AD.On the death of James see Josephus Antiquities, 20.9.1 and Eusebius II.23.1-18. The decade of the 50s saw the growth of turmoil and violence in Palestine as Jews became more and more frustrated with corruption, injustice and poverty. In continued into the 60s and four years after the murder of James, war broke out with Rome and would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people. The epistle of James is renowned for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways (1:26–27; 2:1-4; 2:14-19; 5:1-6), standing up for the oppressed (2:1-4; 5:1-6) and not being "like the world" in the way one responds to evil in the world (1:26-27; 2:11; 3:13-18; 4:1-10). Worldly wisdom is rejected and people are exhorted to embrace heavenly wisdom, which includes peacemaking and pursuing righteousness and justice (3:13-18). 
This approach sees the epistle as a real letter Numerous studies argue convincingly for a letter- structure to James. See, for example, Euan Fry, "Commentaries on James, I and 2 Peter, and Jude," The Bible Translator, 41 (July 1990): 330, and F.O. Francis, "The Form and Function of the Opening and Closing Paragraphs of James and I John," ZNW 61 (1970):110-126. with a real immediate purpose: to encourage Christian Jews not to revert to violence in their response to injustice and poverty, but rather to stay focused on doing good, staying holy, and embracing the wisdom of heaven not the wisdom of the world.

==Doctrine==

===Justification===

The letter contains the following famous passage concerning salvation and justification:

This passage has been cited in Christian theological debates, especially regarding the doctrine of justification. Gaius Marius Victorinus (4th century) associated James's teaching on works with the heretical Symmachian sect, followers of Symmachus the Ebionite, and openly questioned whether James's teachings were heretical. This passage has also been contrasted with the teachings of Paul the Apostle on justification; indeed, some scholars believe that this passage is a response to Paul.[tpl]cite book |first=Scot |last=McKnight |title=The Letter of James |publisher=William B. Erdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |series=The New International Commentary on the New Testament |isbn=978-0-8028-2627-5 |year=2011 |pages=259–263[/tpl] One issue in the debate is the meaning of the Greek word δικαιόω (dikaiόο) ‘render righteous or such as he ought to be’,[tpl]cite web|title=Dikaioo|url=http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=1344|work=Greek Lexicon|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl] with some among the participants taking the view that James is responding to a misunderstanding of Paul.Martin, D. 2009. New Testament History & Literature: 18. Arguing with Paul. Yale University.
Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy argue that this passage disproves the doctrine of justification by faith alone (or sola fide),[tpl]cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P66.HTM|chapter=The Theological Virtues: 1815|quote=The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But 'faith apart from works is dead':2:26 when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not make him a living member of his Body.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=Creeds of Christendom|year=1877|publisher=Harper & Brothers|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.v.vii.html|chapter=The Synod of Jerusalem and the Confession of Dositheus, A.D. 1672: Article XIII|quote=Man is justified, not by faith alone, but also by works.[/tpl] whereas the early and many modern Protestants continue to believe that Catholic and Orthodox interpretations do not fully understand the meaning of the term "justification"[tpl]cite book|last=Calvin|first=John|title=Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vi.iii.vii.html|chapter=James 2:20–26|quote=When, therefore, the Sophists set up James against Paul, they go astray through the ambiguous meaning of a term.[/tpl] and resolve James' and Paul's apparent conflict regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox:
The debate over justification remains unsettled. (See also Biblical law in Christianity and New Perspective on Paul.)

===Anointing of the Sick===

James's epistle is also the chief Biblical text for the Anointing of the Sick. James wrote:
[tpl]quote|14Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.[tpl]bibleref2|James|5:14–15[/tpl][/tpl]
G. A. Wells suggested this passage was evidence of late authorship of the epistle, on the grounds that the healing of the sick being done through an official body of presbyters (elders) indicated a considerable development of ecclesiastical organisation, "whereas in Paul's day to heal and work miracles pertained to believers indiscriminately (I Corinthians, XII:9)."[tpl]cite book|last=Wells|first=George Albert|title=The Jesus of Early Christians|year=1971|publisher=Pemberton|location=London|isbn=0301710147|page=152[/tpl]

==Canonicity==

The Epistle was first explicitly referred to and quoted by Origen of Alexandria, and possibly a bit earlier by Irenaeus of Lyons[tpl]cite web|last=Davis|first=Glenn|title=Irenaeus of Lyons|url=http://www.ntcanon.org/Irenaeus.shtml|work=The Development of the Canon of the New Testament|accessdate=16 May 2012|year=2010[/tpl] as well as Clement of Alexandria in a lost work according to Eusebius, although it was not mentioned by Tertullian, who was writing at the end of the second century. It is also absent from the Muratorian fragment, the earliest known list of New Testament books.
The Epistle of James was included among the 27 New Testament books first listed by Athanasius of Alexandria in his 39th Festal Epistle (AD 367)[tpl]cite book|last=Griggs|first=C Wilfred|title=Early Egyptian Christianity|year=1991|publisher=Brill Academic Publisher|location=Leiden|isbn=9004094075|edition=2nd|page=173[/tpl] and was confirmed as a canonical epistle of the New Testament by a series of councils in the 4th century. Today, virtually all denominations of Christianity consider this book to be a canonical epistle of the New Testament.
In the first centuries of the Church the authenticity of the Epistle was doubted by some, including Theodore, Bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia. Because of the silence of several of the western churches regarding it, Eusebius classes it among the Antilegomena or contested writings (Historia ecclesiae, 3.25; 2.23). St. Jerome gives a similar appraisal but adds that with time it had been universally admitted. Gaius Marius Victorinus, in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, openly questioned whether the teachings of James were heretical.
Its late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, may be explained by the fact that it was written for or by Jewish Christians, and therefore not widely circulated among the Gentile Churches. There is some indication that a few groups distrusted the book because of its doctrine. In Reformation times a few theologians, most notably Martin Luther in his early career,The Lutheran Study Bible, Concordia Publishing House, 2009, p2132 argued that this epistle should not be part of the canonical New Testament.[tpl]cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=History of the Reformation|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc7.ii.iv.iv.html|quote=The most important example of dogmatic influence in Luther’s version is the famous interpolation of the word alone in Rom. 3:28 (allein durch den Glauben), by which he intended to emphasize his solifidian doctrine of justification, on the plea that the German idiom required the insertion for the sake of clearness.464  But he thereby brought Paul into direct verbal conflict with James, who says (James 2:24), "by works a man is justified, and not only by faith" ("nicht durch den Glauben allein"). It is well known that Luther deemed it impossible to harmonize the two apostles in this article, and characterized the Epistle of James as an "epistle of straw," because it had no evangelical character ("keine evangelische Art").[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Stonehouse|first=Ned B|title=Paul Before the Areopagus|year=1957|pages=186–197[/tpl]
Martin Luther's description of the Epistle of James changes. In some case, Luther argues that it was not written by an apostle, but in other cases, he describes James as the work of an apostle.Die deutsche Bibel 41:578-90 He even cites it as authoritative teaching from GodLuther's Large Catechism, IV 122-24 and describes James as "a good book, because it sets up no doctrines of men but vigorously promulgates the law of God."Luther's Works (American Edition) 35:395 Lutherans hold that the Epistle is rightly part of the New Testament, citing its authority in the Book of Concord, however it remains part of the Lutheran antilegomena.Lutheran Cyclopedia: Antilegomena
