Huge trees are cut in a Shinto ceremony, then the logs are dragged from the mountains down to the shrines.

Shimosuwa is also the site of several onsen or natural hot spring spas. Shimosuwa is located on the Chūō Line of JR East, about three hours from Tokyo.
Shimosuwa maintains an exchange relationship with Kaifeng, Henan Province in the People's Republic of China.
