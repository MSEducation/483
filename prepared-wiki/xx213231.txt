==Early history==

Bogambara Stadium was not only used for sports, it was also used for folk sports like elle, bahu, thattu, gudu etc.
Bogambara Stadium was converted from a lake to a playing field in the year 1897. At one time it was the site for carnivals, games circuses and gymkhana activities and even an execution ground during the British occupation.

==Sports==

Bogambara Stadium serves as a venue for various sports ranging from Rugby, Football, Hockey, Athletics, Netball, Basketball, softball, and cricket.

==Stadium Development==

Bogambara Stadium was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Special Commissionership of late M.B. Samarakoon and E.W. Balasuriya the famous sports promoter for helping to do lot of good things with generous donations. In 1998, Anurudha Ratwatte, the former deputy defence minister was instrumental in converting the Bogambara stadium into an international standard stadium. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and presently the Sports Ministry owns the premises. The ground fees are on the higher side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to keep the game alive.
