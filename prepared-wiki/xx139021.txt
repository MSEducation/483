Strandebarm is a former municipality in Hordaland county, Norway.
It was created in 1837 as Strandebarm formannskapsdistrikt. In 1863 the rural district Jondal, located on the opposite shore of the Hardangerfjord, was separated from Strandebarm to constitute a municipality of its own. The same thing happened on 1 January 1902 when Varalds√∏y municipality was created, leaving Strandebarm with a population of 1,661.
On 1 January 1965 the district of Kysnesstranda with 100 inhabitants was incorporated into Jondal. The rest of Strandebarm, with 1,545 inhabitants, was incorporated into Kvam, its neighboring municipality to the north. The village's main industry is shipbuilding, at Fjellstrand.
The Norwegian writer Hans E. Kinck lived in Strandebarm for many years, and is said to have used the village as setting and inspiration for his novel Den nye kapellanen ("The New Vicar").
