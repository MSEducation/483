The first budget introduced by Martin in February 1994, who had become the Finance Minister in November 1993 was described as a "mild and tame" budget focused only on the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, and brought in modest cuts, mostly to defense spending.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 pages 85-86. Until the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Chrétien government tended to be hostile towards defense spending with the government's white paper "Defense 94" declaring that in a post-Cold War world there would be less and less need for armed forces, which accordingly meant reduced budgets for the military.Bland, Douglas Review of Who Killed the Canadian Military? by J. L. Granatstein pages 964-967 from International Journal, Volume 59, Issue #4, Autumn 2004 pages 966-967 The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein in his 2004 book Who Killed the Canadian Military? accused the Chrétien government of putting the military in the uncomfortable position in the 1990s of having to do more and more UN peacekeeping missions while cutting defense spending at the same time. Granatstein accused Chrétien of having "finished off the Canadian Forces" through a policy of heavy cuts inspired by a deep personal dislike of the military and of using the military as UN peacekeepers rather preparing to fight a war.Granatstein, Jack Who Killed the Canadian Military? Toronto: HarperCollins, 2004 page 163 Outside of defense spending, there were few cuts in the 1994 budget. In a radio interview with Ron Collister in March 1994, Chrétien stated "To go to our goal of 3 per cent of GNP all the cuts been announced in the budget. There will not be a new round." According to the diplomat James Bartleman, Chrétien told him in early 1994 that major cuts to government spending outside of defense were out of the question, and instead he hoped that economy would grow enough on its own that the deficit would disappear without any cuts.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010 page 246. Chrétien's plans in early 1994 for economic growth were to increase exports by embracing globalization and free trade with as many nations as possible, arguing that the export offensive would stimulate the economy out of the early 1990s recession. The 1994 budget was widely criticised by conservatives such as Andrew Coyne as useless in even achieving its target of reducing deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, let alone eliminating the deficit, and led to a celebrated clash between Coyne and Martin in the boardroom of the Globe and Mail newspaper.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, pages 264-265. Investor reaction to the 1994 budget was very negative with many concluding that the Liberals had no serious interest in dealing with the debt problem with one economist recalling that after the 1994 budget the consensus amongst economists was that "They don’t get it. They just don’t get it".[ref]
