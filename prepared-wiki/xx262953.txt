==Background==

===Brief history===

The College's origins can be traced to the year 1988 when the then Silliman University Computer Center (SUCC) was established to consolidate under one department all computer-related courses offered by the University."College Catalogue". Silliman University. Retrieved 2011-01-02.  Back then, the computer center acted as a delivery unit for courses offered by other colleges such as the Bachelor of Business degree Major in Business Computer Applications then offered by the College of Business Administration.
To centralize its course offerings in one institution and to comply with the Commission on Higher Educationâ€™s thrust to regulate the number of Information Technology Education degrees, a separate college named as the College of Information Technology and Computer Sciences was established by the University in 2001 which offered Bachelor of Science degrees in Information Technology and Computer Science. In 2002, a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Management was also added.  In 2006 the College was renamed as the College of Computer Studies.

===Facilities===

The College is housed in two buildings, the one-storey Uytengsu Foundation Computer Center, and the three-storey Uytengsu Foundation Computer Studies Hall, and  is part of Silliman University's Local Area Network that uses an extensive network of fiber-optic cables. Silliman is one of only two universities in the Philippines that has an extensive fiber-optic backbone and the only school in the country that owns its fiber-optic system. Costing US $2.5 million in 1997, this backbone connects all buildings in the campus. Silliman was also the first school in the country to use wireless Wi-Fi B2B LAN technology."Silliman University".

To reinforce the College's course offerings, Silliman University formed partnerships with Microsoft and IBM. The Microsoft Developer Network Academic Alliance has given the College a 3-year complimentary MSDNAA subscription which allows it to download available software in MSDNAA for free to all students and faculty for teaching and learning purposes, while  the College's partnership with IBM resulted in the introduction of the IBM Academic Exchange Offering. Electives under the program are developed for junior and graduating students majoring in Information Technology, Information Systems and Computer Science."SU Annual Report SY 2008-2009".
