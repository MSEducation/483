The One Who Really Loves You is the second album recorded by R&B singer and Motown recording artist Mary Wells, released in 1962 on the Motown label. Released after the runaway success of Wells' first top ten pop singles, the album became Motown's first top ten album peaking at number 8 on the pop album chart.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] The album featured the hits, "The One Who Really Loves You" and "You Beat Me to the Punch" and other singles such as the ballads "Strange Love" and "Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right".
THE ONE WHO REALLY LOVES YOU (Motown 605) has been mistakenly cited as Motown's first top ten album.  It did not chart.  It seems Wells' single "The One Who Really Loves You" which peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of June 9, 1962, has been confused with the namesake LP.  Motown's first top ten album (and first #1 album) was RECORDED LIVE LITTLE STEVIE WONDER THE 12 YEAR OLD GENIUS (Tamla 240) in 1963.  The first top ten album on the Motown label was the Supremes' WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO (Motown 621) which peaked at #2 in 1964.  Mary Wells' first charting Motown album was TWO LOVERS AND OTHER GREAT HITS (Motown 607) which reached #49 in 1963.  Wells' highest charting Motown album was MARY WELLS GREATEST HITS (Motown 616) which reached #18 in 1964.
