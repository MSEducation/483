Whereas in Euclidean geometry moving steadily in an orthogonal direction to a ray from the origin traces out a circle, in a [[pseudo-Euclidean space|
pseudo-Euclidean plane]] steadily moving orthogonal to a ray from the origin traces out a hyperbola. In Euclidean space, the   multiple of a given angle traces equal distances around a circle while it traces exponential distances upon the hyperbolic line.Hyperbolic Geometry pp 5-6, Fig 15.1

==History==

The quadrature of the hyperbola is the evaluation of the area swept out by a radial segment from the origin as the terminus moves along the hyperbola. It was first accomplished by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent in 1647 in his momentous Opus geometricum quadrature circuli et sectionum coni. As expressed by a historian,
The upshot [tpl]ambig|date=March 2014[/tpl] was the logarithm function, [tpl]elucidate|date=March 2014[/tpl] as now understood as the area under y = 1/x to the right of x = 1.  As an example of a transcendental function, the logarithm is more familiar than its motivator, the hyperbolic angle. Nevertheless, the hyperbolic angle plays a role when the theorem of Saint-Vincent is advanced with squeeze mapping.
Circular trigonometry was extended to the hyperbola by Augustus De Morgan in his textbook Trigonometry and Double Algebra.Augustus De Morgan (1849) Trigonometry and Double Algebra, Chapter VI: "On the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry" In 1878 W.K. Clifford used the hyperbolic angle to parametrize a unit hyperbola, describing it as "quasi-harmonic motion".
In 1894 Alexander Macfarlane circulated his essay "The Imaginary of Algebra", which used hyperbolic angles to generate hyperbolic versors, in his book Papers on Space Analysis.Alexander Macfarlane(1894) Papers on Space Analysis, B. Westerman, New York
When Ludwik Silberstein penned his popular 1914 textbook on the new theory of relativity, he used the rapidity concept based on hyperbolic angle a where tanh a = v/c, the ratio of velocity v to the speed of light. He wrote:
Silberstein also uses Lobachevsky's concept of angle of parallelism Π(a) to obtain cos Π(a) = v/c.Ludwik Silberstein (1914) Theory of Relativity, Cambridge University Press, pp. 180–1

==Imaginary circular angle==

The hyperbolic angle is often presented as if it were an imaginary number. In fact, if x is a real number and i2 = −1, then
