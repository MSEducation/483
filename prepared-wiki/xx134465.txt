==Club career==

Born in Barakaldo, Biscay, Lafuente was a graduate of Lezama, the famed Athletic Bilbao youth academy. He made his debuts with the first team in 1999–2000 after serving two loans at modest Basque neighbours, adding another with Elche CF three years later. He competed with Daniel Aranzubia for Athletic's first-choice status during several La Liga seasons, appearing in 36 games in 2000–01 and adding 30 the following campaign.
For the 2007–08 season Lafuente was loaned to RCD Espanyol, as Gorka Iraizoz was sold in the opposite direction.Soccer-Spain: New signings for 2007–08 At his new club he backed up Carlos Kameni and, when the Cameroonian left for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, he became the starter, but retired injured in just his second appearance.
In July 2008 Lafuente returned to Athletic Bilbao, where he was only third-choice.
