Shoumei ([tpl]Zh|t= 壽眉|s= 寿眉|p=shòuméi [/tpl]) is a white tea that is produced from naturally withered upper leaf and tips, with a stronger flavor reminiscent of lighter Oolong teas. It is mostly grown in the Fujian Province or Guangxi Province in China.[tpl]cite web|title=Shou Mei White Tea Cake|url=http://www.viconyteas.com/white-tea/shoumei-white-tea-cake.html|publisher=Vicony Teas Company|accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl]  Because it is plucked later than Bai Mudan, the tea may be darker in color, but it should still have a proportionate green color. Some lower grades of Shou Mei may be golden in color with a lot of black and red leaves, making a darker brew with more depth.
Technically this tea, being a fourth grade tea, is a by-product of Bai Hao Yinzhen tea production and uses Da Bai or Large White leaves.

==Tasting and brewing==

The tea can be brewed very differently and there are many combinations that yield interesting results, but it is important to use good mineral water to bring out the sweetness and aroma of the tea and not to over brew or make a bitter and very strong brew.
