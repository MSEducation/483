[[Parapsychological Association]]

CATEGORIES: Parapsychology

The Parapsychological Association (PA) was formed in 1957 as a professional society for parapsychologists following an initiative by Joseph B. Rhine. Its purpose has been "to advance parapsychology as a science, to disseminate knowledge of the field, and to integrate the findings with those of other branches of science." The work of the association is reported in the Journal of Parapsychology and the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parapsych.org/psi_journals.html |title=Psi Journals & Publications |publisher=Parasychological Association |accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] (primary source)
In 1969, the Parapsychological Association became affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and more than 20 Nobel prizewinners and many other well-known scientists have supported psi research or conducted it themselves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902298/ |title=A call for an open, informed study of all aspects of consciousness |author=Etzel Carde√±a |date=Online Jan 27, 2014 |work=Frontiers of Human Neuroscience ( 8:17) [/tpl] In 1979, physicist John A. Wheeler said that parapsychology is pseudoscientific, and that the affiliation of the PA to the AAAS needed to be reconsidered.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Wheeler | first=John Archibald | authorlink=John Archibald Wheeler | contribution=Drive the Pseudos Out of the Workshop of Science | date=January 8, 1979 | journal=New York Review of Books | publication-date=May 17, 1980[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| last = Wheeler | first = John Archibald | authorlink = John Archibald Wheeler | title = Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics | publisher = W.

==History==

The Association was created in Durham, North Carolina, on June 19, 1957. Its formation was proposed by Rhine, then Director of the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University, at a Workshop in Parapsychology held there. Using the occasion afforded by this wide representation of the field, Rhine proposed that the group form itself into the nucleus of an international professional society in parapsychology.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Its first president was R. A. McConnell, then of the Biophysics Department, University of Pittsburgh, and the first vice-president was Gertrude R. Schmeidler of the Department of Psychology, City College of New York. Rhea White was named Secretary Treasurer. Four others were elected to the Council, bringing the total to seven: Margaret Anderson, Remi J. Cadoret, Karlis Osis, and W. G. Roll. One of the co-founding supporters of PA was renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead.[tpl]Cite book|last=Melton |first=J. G. |authorlink= |title=Parapsychological Association.
