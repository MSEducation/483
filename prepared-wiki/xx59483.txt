[[Thales' theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Euclidean plane geometry, Articles containing proofs, Triangle geometry, Theorems in plane geometry

In geometry, Thales' theorem (named after Thales of Miletus) states that if A, B and C are points on a circle where the line [tpl]overline|AC[/tpl] is a diameter of the circle,  then the angle ∠ABC is a right angle.  Thales' theorem is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem, and is mentioned and proved on  the 33rd proposition, third book of Euclid's Elements. It is generally attributed to Thales, who is said to have offered an ox (probably to the god Apollo) as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the discovery, but sometimes it is attributed to Pythagoras.

==History==

There is nothing extant of the writing of Thales; work done in ancient Greece tended to be attributed to men of wisdom without respect to all the individuals involved in any particular intellectual constructions — this is true of Pythagoras especially. Attribution did tend to occur at a later time.G.Donald Allen - Texas University Department of Mathematics edu Retrieved 2012-02-12  Reference to Thales was made by Proclus, and by Diogenes Laertius documenting Pamphila statement that the ancient Prof.T.Patronis & D.Patsopoulos [tpl]cite book | url =http://journals.tc-library.org/index.php/hist_math_ed/article/viewFile/189/184 | title = The Theorem of Thales: A Study of the naming of theorems in school Geometry textbooks  | publisher = Patras University  | accessdate = 2012-02-12[/tpl][tpl]cquote| was the first to ascribe a right-angle triangle within a circle   (Thomas 2002) [/tpl]
Indian and Babylonian mathematicians knew this for special cases before Thales proved it.de Laet, Siegfried J. (1996). History of Humanity: Scientific and Cultural Development. UNESCO, Volume 3, p. 14. ISBN 92-3-102812-X It is believed that Thales learned that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle during his travels to Babylon.Boyer, Carl B. and Merzbach, Uta c. (2010). A History of Mathematics. John Wiley and Sons, Chapter IV. ISBN 0-470-63056-6 The theorem is named after Thales because he was said by ancient sources to have been the first to prove the theorem, using his own results that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that the sum of angles in a triangle is equal to 180°.

Dante's Paradiso (canto 13, lines 101–102) refers to Thales' theorem in the course of a speech.

==Proof==

===First proof===

We use the following facts:  the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180° and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.

Since [tpl]overline|OA[/tpl] = [tpl]overline|OB[/tpl] = [tpl]overline|OC[/tpl], ∆OBA and ∆OBC are isosceles triangles,  and by the equality of the base angles of an isosceles triangle, ∠OBC = ∠OCB and ∠BAO = ∠ABO.
Let α = ∠BAO and β = ∠OBC. The three internal angles of the ∆ABC triangle are α, (α + β), and β. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to 180°, we have

===Second proof===

and
Then we show that their product equals –1:

==Converse==

The converse of Thales' theorem is also valid; it states that a right triangle's hypotenuse is a diameter of its circumcircle.
Combining Thales' theorem with its converse we get that:

===Proof of the converse using geometry===

This proof consists of 'completing' the right triangle to form a rectangle and noticing that the center of that rectangle is equidistant from the vertices and so is the center of the circumscribing circle of the original triangle, it utilizes two facts:
Let there be a right angle ∠ABC, r a line parallel to [tpl]overline|BC[/tpl] passing by A and s a line parallel to [tpl]overline|AB[/tpl] passing by C. Let D be the point of intersection of lines r and s (Note that it has not been proven that D lies on the circle)
The quadrilateral ABCD forms a parallelogram by construction (as opposite sides are parallel). Since in a parallelogram adjacent angles are supplementary (add to 180°) and ∠ABC is a right angle (90°) then angles ∠BAD, ∠BCD, and ∠ADC are also right (90°); consequently ABCD is a rectangle.
Let O be the point of intersection of the diagonals [tpl]overline|AC[/tpl] and [tpl]overline|BD[/tpl]. Then the point O, by the second fact above, is equidistant from A,B, and C. And so O is center of the circumscribing circle, and the hypotenuse of the triangle ([tpl]overline|AC[/tpl]) is a diameter of the circle.

===Proof of the converse using linear algebra===

This proof utilizes two facts:
Let there be a right angle ∠ABC and circle M with [tpl]overline|AC|[/tpl] as a diameter.
Let M's center lie on the origin, for easier calculation.
Then we know
It follows
Hence:
This means that A and B are equidistant from the origin, i.e. from the center of M. Since A lies on M, so does B, and the circle M is therefore the triangle's circumcircle.
The above calculations in fact establish that both directions of Thales' theorem are valid in any inner product space.

==Generalizations and related results==

Thales' theorem is a special case of the following theorem:
See inscribed angle, the proof of this theorem is quite similar to the proof of Thales' theorem given above.
A related result to Thales' theorem is the following:

==Application==

Thales' theorem can be used to construct the tangent to a given circle that passes through a given point. (See figure.)
We can refer to the image beside, this is one of the cases where Thales' Theorem is used very frequently.
