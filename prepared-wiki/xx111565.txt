==Background and education==

Born in Stepney, Wood was the only son of Hugh Wood, a merchant and shipowner, by his second wife Jessie McKinnon, daughter of Reverend Thomas McKinnon.  His father had been born in Orkney, where his father was a farmer, but had later settled in London. Wood was educated at the Brewers' Company School, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, Mill Hill School, and University College, London. He graduated in 1875 honours in logic and moral philosophy.  After graduating, he worked briefly on the 9th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, before joining the family business in 1878, after his father lost his sight.

==Political career==

Wood was a member of the London County Council for Central Hackney from 1892 to 1909. From 1897 to 1908 he was leader of the Progressive Party and also served as Chairman of the council from 1898 to 1899. In 1907 he was appointed alderman, a post he held until 1909.  He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of London in 1899.
Wood stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for East Islington in 1895, Glasgow St. Rollox in 1900 and Orkney and Shetland in 1902. However, in 1906 he was elected for Glasgow St Rollox as a Liberal, a seat he held until 1918.leighrayment.com House of Commons: Saffron Walden to Salford West In April 1908 Wood was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education in the administration of H. H. Asquith, a post he held until October of the same year, when he became Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
In 1911 he was made Financial Secretary to the Treasury and admitted to the Privy Council.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=28511 |date=7 July 1911 |startpage=5025 [/tpl] The following year he was promoted to Secretary for Scotland[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=28586 |date=1 March 1912 |startpage=1547 [/tpl] with a seat in the cabinet. He continued in this post also when the war-time coalition was formed in May 1915. In July 1916 he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The latter post was considered very important in the war-time situation, and was not seen as a demotion.
However, when Lloyd George became Prime Minister in December 1916, Wood was not offered a post in the government. By the time the general election of December 1918 was held, Wood was a member of the anti-coalition Independent Liberals led by Asquith. In common with most of the Liberals who did not receive the  "Coalition Coupon" he lost his seat, which was gained by Gideon Oliphant-Murray of the Conservative Party. He made one attempt to re-enter the Commons when he stood unsuccessfully for Hackney Central in 1922.

==Family==

Wood married Isabella Sandison, daughter of Alexander Sandison, in 1883. They had eight children, six sons and two daughters. Two sons and one daughter predeceased him. Wood died in South Kensington two weeks after his wife in March 1927, aged 72. Following a funeral service at Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road, Wood was buried in Highgate Cemetery.  He left estate valued at £130,372.
