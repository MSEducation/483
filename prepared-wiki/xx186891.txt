VoxTalk was TVOntario's "Youth Issues Talk Show." Created and Produced by Maria Farano until her departure, and subsequently produced by Alison Bruce, VoxTalk aimed to tackle a different youth-relevant issue every week. The show took place in a typical panel show format: each week, host Max Valiquette would interview a small group of teens or young adults about the topic in question.
The show appeared in TVOntario on Sunday nights in 2005 and 2006.
