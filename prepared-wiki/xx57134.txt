James Matthew Dillon (26 September 1902 – 10 February 1986) was an Irish politician and leader of Fine Gael from 1959 to 1965.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=7&MemberID=318&ConstID=47|title=Mr. James Dillon|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] He was the son of John Dillon, the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party (1918), which had been swept away by Sinn Féin at the 1918 general election.

==Early life==

Dillon was born in Dublin. He was educated at Mount St Benedict's, in Gorey, County Wexford, University College Galway and King's Inns. He qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar in 1931. Dillon studied business methods at Selfridges in London. After some time at Marshall Field's in Chicago he returned to Ireland where he became manager of the family business known as Monica Duff's in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon.

==Political career==

Between 1932 and 1937 Dillon served as Teachta Dála (TD) for the Donegal West constituency for the National Centre Party and after its merger with Cumann na nGaedheal, for the new party of Fine Gael. Dillon played a key role in instigating the creation of Fine Gael and would become a key member of the party in later years. He remained as TD for Monaghan from 1937 to 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1757|title=James Dillon|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] Dillon became deputy leader of Fine Gael under W. T. Cosgrave. He resigned from Fine Gael in 1942 over its stance on Irish neutrality during World War II, when he urged the government to abandon neutrality and side with the Allies. He was the only TD to do so. In the first inter-party government (1948–1951) Dillon was appointed Minister for Agriculture as an Independent TD. As Minister, Dillon was responsible for huge improvements in Irish agriculture. Money was spent on land reclamation projects in the areas of less fertile land while the overall quality of Irish agricultural produce increased.
Dillon rejoined Fine Gael in 1953. He became Minister for Agriculture again in the second inter-party government (1954–1957). In 1959 Dillon became the leader of Fine Gael, the party he was expelled from in 1942. He became president of the party in 1960. In 1965 Fine Gael narrowly lost the general election to Seán Lemass and Fianna Fáil.
Dillon was a colourful contributor to Dáil proceedings and was noted for his high standard of oratory. He retired as party leader having narrowly failed to become Taoiseach in 1965. He remained a TD until 1969. He then retired from politics completely and died in Dublin at the age of 83.
