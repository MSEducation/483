Damon Albarn ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|m|ən|_|ˈ|æ|l|b|ɑr|n[/tpl]; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is best known for being the frontman of the Britpop/alternative rock band Blur as well as vocalist and principal songwriter of virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended Stanway Comprehensive School, where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur whose debut album, Leisure, was released in 1991 to mixed reviews. After spending long periods of time touring the United States, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received widespread critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a rivalry shared with Oasis. Subsequent albums contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.
In 1998, Albarn along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, formed the "virtual band" Gorillaz. Drawing influences from hip hop, electronica, dub and alternative rock, the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001 which was hugely successful worldwide. Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, the albums feature many collaborations from a wide range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "Most Successful Virtual Band".
Other projects include working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam, writing and performing lead vocals on The Good, the Bad & the Queen as part of an unnamed supergroup featuring Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong and composing film soundtracks. He has also ventured into the world of opera with Dr Dee and Monkey: Journey to the West. He is also a well-known Chelsea F.C. fan and frequently attends games involving the Blues at Stamford Bridge.
Albarn's debut solo album Everyday Robots was released in his native United Kingdom on 28 April 2014, co-produced by XL Recordings CEO Richard Russell and featured collaborations with Brian Eno and Natasha Khan.
Albarn was voted the fourth-greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 UK Poll for Q Music magazine.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7519708/Liam-Gallagher-crowned-best-frontman.html |title=Liam Gallagher crowned best frontman |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-03-26 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

==Early life==

Damon Albarn was born on 23 March 1968, the eldest child of Keith and Hazel Albarn. He was the couple's first child. Their daughter, Jessica, born in 1971, also went on to become an artist.Maconie, Stuart (1999). Blur: 3862 Days, The Official History. Virgin Books; ISBN 0-7535-0287-9 Hazel Albarn, originally from Lincolnshire, was a theatrical set designer for Joan Littlewood's theatre company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London and was working on the satirical play, Mrs Wilson's Diary, just before Damon was born. Keith Albarn, originally from Nottinghamshire, was briefly the manager of Soft Machine and a guest on BBC's Late Night Line-Up.Harris, John (2003) "Damon Albarn: From Cool Britannia to radical campaigner for peace", The Independent, 15 February 2003. [tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] He was head of The School of Art and Design at Colchester Institute.
Damon's paternal grandfather, Edward, had been a conscientious objector during the Second World War and was involved in a farming community in Lincolnshire, becoming a peace activist. In 2002, Edward Albarn died while on hunger strike.[tpl]cite web|title=LINCOLNSHIRE PEACE COMMUNITY|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series6/lincolnshire_peace_community_conscientious_objector.shtml|publisher=BBC Inside Out|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=6 September 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=Gary|title=Special relationships|journal=The Observer|date=21 September 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/sep/21/popandrock.blur|accessdate=18 September 2012[/tpl] In 1968, at the age of 6 months, Damon Albarn was a "testing expert" for designs for educational aids and toys for children including fiberglass furniture and play-structures fancifully called "The Kissmequiosk". "The Apollo Cumfycraft" and "The Tailendcharlie" produced by his father's company "Keith Albarn & Partners Ltd" under the trade-name of "Playlearn, Ltd."[tpl]cite web|author=Stephen K.

When Damon and Jessica were growing up, their family moved to Leytonstone, East London. The household was described as "bohemian"Ankeny, Jason "Damon Albarn Biography", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation and their upbringing as "liberal". Damon agreed with his parents' views, later claiming, "I always thought my parents were absolutely dead right. I went against the grain in a weird way – by continually following them." His parents primarily listened to blues, Indian ragas and African music. When Damon was 9 years old, his family moved to Turkey for three months [tpl]Why?|date=March 2014[/tpl] before settling in Aldham, Essex, an area described by Albarn as "one of those burgeoning Thatcher experiments where they were building loads of small estates".No Distance Left To Run. Pulse Films (2010) The population of the area was predominantly white as opposed to the ethnically mixed part of London to which he had become used to. He described himself as "not really fitting in with the politics of the place."
Albarn was interested in music from an early age, attending an Osmonds concert at the age of six.[tpl]cite web|title=sometime in 2001, ZOMBIE HIP-HOP|url=http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com/media_archive/smhinterview01.htm|publisher=smh.com|accessdate=2 October 2012|year=2001[/tpl] He started playing guitar, piano and violin in his youth and was interested in composing music, one of his compositions winning a heat in the nationwide Young Composer of the Year competition. Damon and Jessica both attended a primary school nearby which, according to Damon, was burnt down seven times in a time period of 18 months by one of the teachers. After both siblings failed their 11 plus exam, they started attending Stanway Comprehensive School, where Damon described himself as being "really unpopular" and "to a lot of people". However, he developed an interest in Drama and started acting in various school productions. It was at Stanway where he would meet future Blur guitarist, Graham Coxon, who recalls seeing him act and feeling that he was a "confident performer" as well as a "show off". Albarn's first words directed at Coxon were "Your brogues are crap, mate. Look, mine are the proper sort" as he was showing off his leather shoes, fashionable footwear at the time influenced by the Mod Revival. Nevertheless, the pair went onto become good friends, due to their shared passion for music, particularly bands such as The Jam, The Beatles, The Human League, XTC and Madness.
He studied acting at the East 15 Acting School in Debden, but left after the first year. On leaving drama school he worked as a tea boy at the Beat Factory studio. His first band was the synth pop group, Two's a Crowd. Before Blur, he played with The Aftermath and Real Lives.

==Music career==

===Blur===

====Formation and Leisure====

Albarn enrolled on a part-time music course at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988, claiming that his sole intention was to gain access to the union bar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkNvk2MgiCc |title=Nardwuar vs. Blur |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] Albarn was in a group named Circus alongside Coxon and drummer Dave Rowntree.Harris, pg. 45Thompson, pg. 209 Alex James, a fellow student at Goldsmiths, eventually joined as the group's bassist. They changed their name to Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J.D. Salinger's Seymour: An Introduction.Harris, pg. 46 Seymour attracted the interest of Food Records who's only concern was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the band decided on "Blur". Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990.Harris, pg. 49–50
In October 1990, Blur released their first single, "She's So High", which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart.Strong, pg. 635–636 The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, "There's No Other Way", became a hit, peaking at number eight.Harris, pg. 53–55 As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented The Syndrome club in London dubbed "The Scene That Celebrates Itself".Harris, pg. 56–57 NME magazine wrote in 1991 that "Blur are the acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam."Kelly, Danny, NME], "Sacre Blur!" (20 July 1991).
Andy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album Leisure (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews, and according to journalist John Harris, "could not shake off the odour of anti-climax".Harris, pg. 59 Albarn has since referred to Leisure as "awful".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a46469/damon-albarn-criticises-blur-albums.html?rss|title=Digital Spy - Albarn cusses own albums.|accessdate=2 December 2012[/tpl]

====Britpop era====

After discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses.Harris, pg. 66 During the two-month American tour, Albarn, along with the band, became increasingly unhappy and homesick. "I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere", Albarn revealed.Harris, John. "A shite sports car and a punk reincarnation". NME. 10 April 1993.
Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana.Harris, pg. 79 Although skeptical of Albarn's new manifesto for the band, Balfe gave his assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge of the band XTC to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.Harris, pg. 82
Their second album, titled Modern Life Is Rubbish, was eventually released in May 1993 and peaked at number 15 on the British charts,"Blur Single & Album Chart History". Official Charts Company; retrieved 21 August 2012. but failed to break into the US Billboard 200, selling only 19,000 copies there.Duffy, Tom. "SBK, Blur focus on U.S. market". Billboard. 28 May 1994."Blur - Awards". Allmusic; retrieved 21 August 2012. Despite the album's poor performance, Albarn was relatively happy with the band's new direction and started writing prolifically for Blur's next album. Parklife was released in 1994 and revived Blur's commercial fortunes, with the album's first single, the disco-influenced "Girls & Boys", receiving critical acclaim and chart success. Parklife entered the British charts at number one and stayed in the album charts for 90 weeks.Harris, pg. 142 Enthusiastically greeted by the music press, Parklife is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.Dee, John. "Blur – Parklife". NME. April 1994.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "Parklife review". Allmusic. Retrieved 16 June 2008. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for Parklife.Harris, pg. 192 Coxon later pointed to Parklife as the moment when "Blur went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation".Tuxen, Henrik; Dalley, Helen. "Graham Coxon interview". Total Guitar. May 1999. Albarn revealed that his fame made him uncomfortable however, and that he often suffered from panic attacks.
Blur began working on their fourth album The Great Escape at the start of 1995.Harris, pg. 222 Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, "It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up."Harris, pg. 223–24 The release of the album's lead single "Country House" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed "The Battle of Britpop". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the NME called "The British Heavyweight Championship". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the News at Ten.Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop. Passion Pictures, 2004. At the end of the week, "Country House" ultimately outsold Oasis' "Roll With It" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.Harris, pg. 235
The Great Escape was released in September 1995 to positive reviews, and entered the UK charts at number one. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the media quipped that "Blur wound up winning the battle but losing the war."Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "'Country House' song review". Allmusic.com; retrieved 16 June 2008. Blur became perceived by many as an "inauthentic middle class pop band" in comparison to the "working class heroes" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel "stupid and confused". Bassist Alex James later summarised, "After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly."Maconie, Stuart. "The Death of a Party". Select (August 1999).

====Post–Britpop and hiatus====

An early 1996 Q magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them "on the verge of a nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his band mates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement.Harris, pg. 259–60 Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day laughs, I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it."[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://damonalbarnunofficial.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/damon-albarn-gorillaz-heroin-and-the-last-days-of-blur-the-guardian-april-2012/ |title=Damon Albarn | ‘Gorillaz, heroin and the last days of Blur’ – The Guardian: April 2012 | damon albarn unofficial archive |publisher=Damonalbarnunofficial.wordpress.com |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene. The result was Blur, the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as "Look inside America/She's alright", and noting Albarn's "obligatory nod to Beck, promotion of the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.Collins, Andrew. "Blur: Keeping It Simple". Q. March 1997. Despite cries of "commercial suicide", the album and its first single, "Beetlebum", debuted at number one in the UK.Sutherland, Mark. "Altered States". Melody Maker. 21 June 1997. Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK, Blur became the band's most successful internationally, particularly in the US, helped by the successful single, "Song 2". After the success of Blur, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.
Blur hired William Orbit to produce their next album. Released in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album 13 saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years.Sullivan, Caroline. "Down and outstanding". The Guardian. 5 March 2008. Retrieved 1 October 2012. The album received generally favourable reviews from critics and debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks.
In October 2000, the group released the best-of album Blur: The Best of, which debuted at number three in the UK and a Platinum certification of 300,000 copies."U2 Leaves The Competition 'Behind'". Billboard. 6 November 2000. Retrieved 14 September 2012.

"A Hard Day's Night". Mojo. November 2000.
Recording for Blur's next album began in London in November 2001. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group.Greeves, David. "Recording Blur, Tom Rae & Elbow". Sound on Sound.

Think Tank, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Think Tank was another UK No. 1 and managed Blur's highest US position of No. 56. The album was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2004 |title=2004 |publisher=Brits.co.uk |date=2004-02-17 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

All the shows were well received; The Guardian[tpl]'[/tpl]s music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars, and wrote that "Blur's music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame".Petridis, Alexis.

The band released their second greatest hits album Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur in June 2009. After the completion of the reunion dates, Albarn told Q that the band had no intention of recording or touring live again. He said, "I just can't do it anymore", and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which succeeded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8168723.stm |title=Entertainment | Albarn rules out more Blur gigs |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-25 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

===Gorillaz===

Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett first met in 1990 when Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur.[tpl]cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Paul|title=FEATURE: Damon and Jamie Interview. HEY HEY WE'RE THE MONKEYS!|journal=Q magazine[tpl]![/tpl]Q|date=August 2001|accessdate=5 October 2012[/tpl] The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip, Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker" and despite becoming one of the band's acquaintances, he often didn't get on with its members, especially after he started going out with Coxon's ex-girlfriend, Jane Olliver. Nonetheless, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997.[tpl]cite journal|first=Chris|last=Heath|authorlink=Chris Heath|date=November 2007|title=The 21 People Who Changed Music: Damon Albarn|journal=Q|page=87|accessdate=30 September 2007[/tpl] Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was also at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.
The idea to create Gorillaz came about when the two were watching MTV: "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell—there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that," Hewlett has said.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gorillaz.html|title=Keeping It (Un)real|accessdate=5 October 2008|first=Neil|last=Gaiman|authorlink=Neil Gaiman|date=July 2005|work=Wired|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqk5bxXY|archivedate=17 January 2010[/tpl] The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor.

Gorillaz released their third studio album, Plastic Beach in early 2010, which was received with high praise. In December 2010, the group released an album called The Fall which was recorded over 32 days during their North American tour. The band also appeared on the Snoop Dogg track: "Sumthing' Like this Night" on his album Doggumentary. In November 2011, the band announced that, on 23 February 2012, Gorillaz would release a new line of Converse sneakers designed by Jamie Hewlett. The selection of footwear is carried at Journeys stores in the US and Schuh stores in the UK. Gorillaz will release a new one off single to accompany with the release of these shoes as a part of Converse's "Three Artists, One Song" campaign."Its Shoetime!"
On 9 February 2012, Gorillaz confirmed that the single will be called "DoYaThing", and that the two collaborators working on this single will be James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and Andre 3000 of Outkast. 2D will rap for the first two verses, Murphy will sing the chorus, and Andre 3000 then overtakes the rest of the track with another rap verse. The track is available for free download in Journeys stores by scanning the QR Code on display items. An explicit, 12 Minute long version of the single was made available for streaming in March. Hewlett directed a new Music Video for the single, featuring animated versions of the two collaborators on this track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com/news/|title=Gorillaz-Unofficial 100% unofficial. 100% Gorillaz|publisher=Gorillaz-unofficial.com|accessdate=22 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4118413/Gorillaz-guests-a-shoe-in.html|title=Gorillaz guests a shoe-in|work=The Sun|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=22 March 2012|location=London[/tpl] Murdoc also stated that the music video featured the Gorillaz' new HQ, for which they have abandoned Plastic Beach.

While promoting his debut album, Everyday Robots, in an interview with NME, Albarn said: "I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah. That will almost definitely happen. I could put a Gorillaz record out next week; I’ve got enough stuff that I haven’t finished. The only thing really that defines a Gorillaz record in my head is when I just play most of it on keyboards. I’ve just been in Paris with Jamie Hewlett. There are points in everyone’s relationship where they fall out with people that they’re close to and then they reconciles, hopefully, and actually, you know, the relationship’s probably in a healthier place as a result of that."[tpl]cite web|author=Giraffic Themes |url=http://damonalbarn.tumblr.com/tagged/we-were-right-and-also-the-world-needs-more-gorillaz-albums |title=Posts Tagged ‘we were right and also the world needs more gorillaz albums’ | Damon Albarn Unofficial |publisher=Damonalbarn.tumblr.com |date=2014-04-12 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

====The Good, the Bad & the Queen====

In May 2006, NME reported that Albarn was working with Danger Mouse on his first solo album, tentatively titled The Good, the Bad & the Queen. However, in July 2006, NME reported that those plans had been switched to the formation of a new band titled The Good, the Bad & the Queen. This proved to be inaccurate, as Albarn and other members of the group have indicated that The Good, the Bad & the Queen is the name of the album and not the band itself.[tpl]cite web|title=It's all a bit of a blur for Damon|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/therazz/daily/tm_method=full%26objectid=18569699%26siteid=66633-name_page.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Good, Bad and super|date=3 February 2007|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21126426-5003421,00.html|work=The Sunday Mail (Qld)|first=Lucy|last=Carne[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The band with no name|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TONYWebArticles1/591/music/the_band_with_no_name.xml[/tpl] The album was awarded Best Album at the 2007 MOJO Awards on 18 June.[tpl]cite news|title=Osbourne scoops 'icon' at Mojo Awards|date=18 June 2007|accessdate=20 June 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6763751.stm|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
The group's line-up is composed of Albarn, former Clash bassist Paul Simonon, The Verve/Gorillaz guitarist Simon Tong, and drummer Tony Allen of Fela Kuti's band, The Africa '70. Danger Mouse produced the album and decided on the final track listing. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The first single by the line-up, "Herculean", was released in late October 2006, and peaked at No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single, "Kingdom of Doom", and the band's debut album were then released in January 2007. That single fared slightly better than "Herculean", peaking at No. 20, while the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and went gold during its first week of release in the UK. "Green Fields" was released as the third single from the album in April 2007, just missing out on the Top 50. On 27 April 2008, The Good, the Bad & the Queen headlined the Love Music Hate Racism Carnival in Victoria Park where they introduced on stage several guests including ex-Specials keyboard player Jerry Dammers.

====Rocket Juice & the Moon====

Rocket Juice & the Moon is the title of Albarn's new side-project featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and afrobeat legend Tony Allen. Albarn has stated that he is not responsible for the name; someone in Lagos did the sleeve design and that's the name it was given. Albarn has claimed that he's content with the outcome, as trying to come up with band names is difficult for him. The band performed together for the first time on 28 October 2011 in Cork, Ireland, as part of the annual Cork Jazz Festival. They performed under the moniker Another Honest Jon's Chop Up!. A full tour is not expected any time soon due to conflicting schedules, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' tour continuing until 2013.

Albarn teamed up with Robert "3D" Del Naja of Massive Attack and worked with Stop the War Coalition, CND and the Muslim Association of Britain to organise campaigns to raise awareness of the potential dangers of the UK's involvement in the war. This included spending £15,000 on anti-war adverts which ran in the NME, featuring quotes from Tony Benn and the former US Attorney-General, Ranisey Lewis.
"Each individual has their own opinions about whether war is an answer to any problems." He explained to Sky News, "Personally I think it's a waste of time, but I think more importantly, that it's is an issue that we haven't had any say in. That's why I feel so strongly about it. I don't feel like we've really been given any choice in this matter. I think if you had a referendum tomorrow, Tony Blair would have no choice but to call off the war."
Albarn revealed that originally, many people whom he knew were against the war were reluctant to take a stand, stating "to be honest with you when Robert Del Naja and myself started really stepping up prior to the war it was very difficult to find anyone. And I don't want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us. A lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn't seem to be prepared to do it."
Albarn was due to speak in Hyde Park on the rally in February 2003 when a million people took to the streets of London in protest at the imminent war. In the event, he was too emotional to deliver his speech.[tpl]cite journal|title=Deconstructing Damon|journal=The Scotsman|date=16 November 2003[/tpl] Albarn later revealed that he had "this image of my grandad in his slippers reading the paper, knowing that his grandson had been involved in something which he'd put so much of his life into" and "got over-emotional". He also stated that "it obviously wasn't the best moment to get in that state, when you're at the head of the biggest peace march in the history of this country." Albarn also attended a protest in November where he commented on the diversity of people in attendance, saying that "It represents everybody. It's the voice in our democracy and thats why we should be listened to."[tpl]cite web|title=Damon Albarn @ Anti Bush Protest (2003)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGi2jF5T8Tg|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=17 November 2012|author=TracyJackAlbarn2|date=6 October 2012[/tpl] Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated "I think in this case the only reason we went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one."[tpl]cite web|last=Kennard|first=Matt|title=An interview: Damon Albarn on the Gorillaz, fatherhood, the war in Iraq, and going out|url=http://www.thecommentfactory.com/an-interview-damon-albarn-on-the-gorillaz-fatherhood-the-war-in-iraq-and-going-out-734/|publisher=The Comment Factory|accessdate=15 September 2012|date=24 November 2008[/tpl]
