==History==

Originally founded in 1874 as the South Australian Institution for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb (Incorporated), later changed to Townsend House, the charity opened its doors to five blind and two deaf students, beginning a commitment that continues today. William Townsend, the founder, was the chairman of its committee from 1875 until his death in 1882.Dean Jaensch, Townsend, William (1821 - 1882), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp 296-297.

Over the years the facilities and services have grown and adapted according to needs of the children and the technology available.
