Chaos-Tage was a West German punk scene phenomenon which began in the mid-1980s in Hanover and Wuppertal and consisted of meetings of punks from all over the country. The reason for these meetings were a plan of the Police to register and build up reference data of everyone who was deemed a 'Punk'. This included taking pictures of each individual.
The most well-known "chaos days" took place in Hanover in 1994 and 1995[tpl]cite news|title=Chaos Days|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19950805&id=wwASAAAAIBAJ&sjid=seoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1246,887696|accessdate=5 June 2010|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=5 August 1995[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and resulted in huge riots and the destruction of cars and buildings. A whole supermarket was damaged and alcoholic beverages were stolen by punks. These "chaos days" were the main topic of TV debates and newspapers for several weeks. Popular bands like WIZO spontaneously played a show there, and Terrorgruppe wrote a now-classic song about it ("Wochenendticket", named after a train ticket that most punks used in order to get to Hanover from all across the country).
Chaos Days USA
Chaos Days were organized in the United States in 1995 and 1996, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area during the same period of time as the German Chaos Days. Chaos Days USA were criticized for the same reasons as the German Chaos Days; critics[tpl]Who|date=February 2011[/tpl] claimed that Chaos Days had "No social value".
