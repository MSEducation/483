Chiang Mai International Airport ([tpl]lang-th|ท่าอากาศยานเชียงใหม่[/tpl]) [tpl]Airport codes|CNX|VTCC[/tpl] is an international airport serving Chiang Mai, the capital city of Chiang Mai Province in Thailand. It was established in 1921 as Suthep Airport.
It is the major gateway to the north of Thailand, and currently the fourth busiest airport in the country.  As of 2010, 17 airlines operate services and more than 3,000,000 passengers, 15,000 flights and 16,000 metric tons of cargo are handled.  It is open in the evening until midnight to cater for night departures and re-opens at 5am.
As a result of the temporary closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport in 2008 due to the protests, Chiang Mai became the alternative stop-over for China Airlines' Taipei-Europe flights and for Swiss International Airlines' Singapore-Zurich flights in the interim. On January 24, 2011, the airport became a secondary hub for Thai AirAsia.http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/AirAsiaopensnewhubinChiangMai/Article/
