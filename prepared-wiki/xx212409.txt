Cox left the game for a while, but returned to basketball a year after the birth of her daughter.>  Her daughter inspired her to do as she wanted, so her daughter would understand what was possible.  She said of this: "Just having her made me realise that I wanted her to have as much of an opportunity life as I did. Just getting back into basketball has helped her get on her way and, more or less, helped me with my life and our lives together."  She was also inspired to return by Kathy Freeman's performance at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She later took another year off from basketball in order to have another child.
