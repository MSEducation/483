The Machrihanish Golf Club is a classic Scottish links course situated in Machrihanish at the southern tip of the Mull of Kintyre. The main course, with views of the western seaboard including the Paps of Jura and Ireland, was ranked the No. 39 course outside of the United States by Golf Digest in 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/index.ssf?/courses/world/gd200505planetgolf.html#Anchor-49575|title=The 100 Best Courses Outside the U.S.|publisher=Golf Digest|date=May 2005|accessdate=13 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061112053715/http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/index.ssf?/courses/world/gd200505planetgolf.html#Anchor-49575  |archivedate = 12 November 2006[/tpl] In particular, the first hole is often rated as one of the best opening holes in the world.
The golf club was founded in 1876 as the Kintyre Golf Club.  The course had ten holes before the club officially existed, and was quickly expanded to 12.  In 1879, Old Tom Morris was brought in to redesign and expand the course to the full 18 holes, including today's first hole.  J.H. Taylor made some modifications in 1914, and in the 1940s Sir Guy Campbell brought the course to its current configuration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.machgolf.com/club-history.php|title=History of Machrihanish Golf Club|accessdate=13 March 2007[/tpl]
The club also has a shorter 9-hole golf course, and separate men's and women's clubhouses.  It has hosted the Scottish Ladies Championship on several occasions.
