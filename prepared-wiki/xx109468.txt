==History==

Xenophon (431–355 BC), and Cato (234–149 BC), were early edaphologists. Xenophon noted the beneficial effect of turning a cover crop into the earth. Cato wrote De Agri Cultura ("On Farming") which recommended tillage, crop rotation and the use of legumes in the rotation to build soil nitrogen. He also devised the first soil capability classification for specific crops.
Jan Baptist van Helmont (1577–1644) performed a famous experiment, growing a willow tree in a pot of soil and supplying only rainwater for five years. The weight gained by the tree was greater than the weight loss of the soil. He concluded that the willow was made of water. Although only partly correct, his experiment reignited interest in edaphology.Xenophon, Cato and Van Helmont: see page 9-12 in [tpl]Cite book | last = Miller | first = Raymond W. | last2 = Gardiner | first2 = Duane T. | title = Soils in Our Environment | place = Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458 | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1998 | edition = 8th | isbn = 0-13-610882-2[/tpl]

==Areas of study==

===Agricultural  soil science===

Agricultural soil science is the application of soil chemistry, physics, and biology dealing with the production of crops. In terms of soil chemistry, it places particular emphasis on plant nutrients of importance to farming and horticulture, especially with regard to soil fertility and fertilizer components. 
Physical edaphology is strongly associated with crop irrigation and drainage. 
Soil husbandry is a strong tradition within agricultural soil science.  Beyond preventing soil erosion and degradation in cropland, soil husbandry seeks to sustain the agricultural soil resource though the use of soil conditioners and cover crops.

===Environmental soil science===

Environmental soil science studies our interaction with the pedosphere on beyond crop production. Fundamental and applied aspects of the field address vadose zone functions, septic drain field site assessment and function, land treatment of wastewater, stormwater, erosion control, soil contamination with metals and pesticides, remediation of contaminated soils, restoration of wetlands, soil degradation, and environmental nutrient management.   It also studies soil in the context of land use planning, global warming, and acid rain.
