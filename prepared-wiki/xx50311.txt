The more punk-influenced style of ska punk often features faster tempos, guitar distortion, onbeat punk rock-style interludes (usually the chorus), and punk-style vocals. The more ska-influenced style features a more developed instrumentation and a cleaner vocal and musical sound. Common instruments include electric guitar, electric bass, drums, brass instruments, reed instruments and keyboards.

==History==

Ska and punk rock were first combined in the 2 Tone movement of late-1970s England,[tpl]cite web|title=Ska-Punk|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/ska-punk-d4420|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 14, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101209193207/http://allmusic.com/explore/style/ska-punk-d4420|archivedate=December 9, 2010[/tpl] which featured bands such as The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat and Madness. The fusion of the two music genres, however, became most prevalent in the 1980s, during the third wave of ska.
Fishbone, founded in 1979 in Los Angeles, is widely considered a pioneer of the genre, followed by The Toasters, founded in 1981 in New York City; Operation Ivy, founded in 1987 in Berkeley, California; and Voodoo Glow Skulls founded in 1988 in Riverside, California. One of the first appearances of the term ska-core was in the title of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 1993 album Ska-Core, the Devil, and More.
No Doubt gained mainstream popularity after the release of their 1995 album Tragic Kingdom, and Sublime did the same after the release of their 1996 self-titled album. Both albums went platinum multiple times, with No Doubt going on to diamond certification. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones appeared in the 1995 movie Clueless, and their 1997 album Let's Face It went platinum.Huey, Steve. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - Biography. Allmusic.
