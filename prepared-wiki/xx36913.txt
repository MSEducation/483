County Sligo ([tpl]lang-gle|Contae Shligigh[/tpl]) is a county in Ireland. It is located in the Border Region and is also part of the province of Connacht. It is named after the town of Sligo. Sligo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county is 65,393 according to the 2011 census. 

==History==

The county was theoretically formed in 1585, but was not made a reality until after the chaos of the Nine Years War had ended, in 1603. Its boundaries reflect the Ó Conchobhair Sligigh overlordship of Lower Connacht ([tpl]lang-ga|Íochtar Connacht[/tpl]) as it was at the time of the Elizabethan conquest. 
This overlordship consisted of the tuatha, or territories, of (Cairbre Drumcliabh), Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe , Tír Ollíol, Luíghne, Corann and Cúl ó bhFionn. Each of these was subsequently made into an English style barony, hence Carbury, Tireragh, Leyny, Tirerril. Corran and Coolavin. The capital of the newly shired county was placed at Sligo.

===Archaeology===

The megalithic cemetery of Carrowmore is located in County Sligo. It forms part of a huge complex of Stone Age remains connecting Carrowkeel in south Sligo to the Ox Mountains, to the Cuil Irra Peninsula, where  Queen Maeve's tomb, Miosgán Médhbh, dominates the western skyline from the crest of Knocknarea Mountain.
An archaeological recovery suggests the county may have been one of the earliest places of human settlement in Ireland.C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Celtic Sea. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC
