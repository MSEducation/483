The economy of Ireland is a modern knowledge economy,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] focusing on services and high-tech industries and dependent on trade, industry and investment.

==History==

===Since the Irish Free State===

From the 1920s Ireland had high trade barriers such as high tariffs, particularly during the Economic War with Britain in the 1930s, and a policy of import substitution. During the 1950s, 400,000 people emigrated from Ireland. It became increasingly clear that economic nationalism was unsustainable. While other European countries enjoyed fast growth, Ireland suffered economic stagnation. The policy changes were drawn together in Economic Development, an official paper published in 1958 that advocated free trade, foreign investment, and growth rather than fiscal restraint as the prime objective of economic management.
In the 1970s, the population increased by 15% and national income increased at an annual rate of about 4%. Employment increased by around 1% per year, but the state sector amounted to a large part of that. Public sector employment was a third of the total workforce by 1980. Budget deficits and public debt increased, leading to the crisis in the 1980s. During the 1980s, underlying economic problems became pronounced. Middle income workers were taxed 60% of their marginal income,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/TEP/1998/985.pdf|title=Taxations And savings in Ireland|last=O'Toole|first=Francis|coauthors=Warrington|work=Trinity Economic Papers Series|publisher=Trinity College, Dublin|page=page 19|accessdate=2008-06-17|format=PDF[/tpl] unemployment had risen to 20%, annual overseas emigration reached over 1% of population, and public deficits reached 15% of GDP.
In 1987 Fianna Fáil reduced public spending, cut taxes, and promoted competition. Ryanair used Ireland's deregulated aviation market and helped European regulators to see benefits of competition in transport markets. Intel invested in 1989 and was followed by a number of technology companies such as Microsoft and Google. A consensus exists among all government parties about the sustained economic growth."How Ireland became the Celtic Tiger", Sean Dorgan, the chief executive of IDA. 23 June 2006 The GDP per capita in the OECD prosperity ranking rose from 21st in 1993 to 4th in 2002.{{cite web|last=De Vlieghere |first=Martin |url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/510 |title=The Myth of the Scandinavian Model | The Brussels Journal |publisher=The Brussels JournalBetween 1985 and 2002, private sector jobs increased 59%. The economy shifted from an agriculture to a knowledge economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries. Economic growth averaged 10% from 1995 to 2000, and 7% from 2001 to 2004. Industry, which accounts for 46% of GDP and about 80% of exports, has replaced agriculture as the country's leading sector.

===Celtic Tiger (1995–2007)===

The economy benefited from a rise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. Since 1987, a key part of economic policy has been Social Partnership, which is a neo-corporatist set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trade unions. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth was called the "Celtic Tiger", a reference to the "tiger economies" of East Asia.
GDP growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001, over 4% in 2004, and 4.7% in 2005. With high growth came high inflation. Prices in Dublin were considerably higher than elsewhere in the country, especially in the property market.[tpl]PDFlink|Consumer Prices Bi-annual Average Price Analysis Dublin and Outside Dublin: 1 May 2006|170 KB[/tpl] – CSO However, property prices are falling following the recent economic recession. At the end of July 2008, the annual rate of inflation was at 4.4% (as measured by the CPI) or 3.6% (as measured by the HICP)[tpl]cite news | last =Guider | first =Ian | coauthors = | title =Inflation falls to 4.4pc | work =Irish Independent | pages = | publisher = | date =7 August 2008 | url = http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/inflation-falls-to-44pc-1448874.html | accessdate = 2008-08-08[/tpl][tpl]PDFlink|Consumer Price Index July 2008 (Dublin & Cork, 7 August 2008|142 KB[/tpl] – Central Statistics Office (Ireland). Retrieved on 2008-08-08. and inflation actually dropped slightly from the previous month.
In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland is ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the OECD and the EU-27, at 4th in the OECD-28 rankings. In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income, Ireland ranks below the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings. GDP is significantly greater than GNP (national income) due to the large amount of multinational firms based in Ireland. A 2005 study by The Economist found Ireland to have the best quality of life in the world.
The positive reports and economic statistics masked several underlying imbalances. The construction sector, which was inherently cyclical in nature, accounted for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.
Despite several successive years of economic growth and significant improvements since 2000, Ireland's population is marginally more at risk of poverty than the EU-15 average and 6.8% of the population suffer "consistent poverty".[tpl]PDFlink|EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)|161 KB[/tpl] CSO, 2004.
Ireland is currently ranked as the world's ninth most "economically free" economy in an index created by free-market economists from the Wall Street Journal and Heritage Foundation, the Index of Economic Freedom.

===Financial crisis (2008–)===

The global recession has significantly impacted the Irish economy. Economic growth was 4.7% in 2007, but −1.7% in 2008 and −7.1% in 2009. In mid-2010, Ireland looked like it was about to exit recession in 2010 following growth of 0.3% in Q4 of 2009 and 2.7% in Q1 of 2010. The government forecast a 0.3% expansion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ireland-out-of-recession-as-exports-jump-2015128.html |title=Ireland out of recession as exports jump |work=The Independent |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-04|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=113356 |title=Ireland out of recession but needs faster growth |work=BusinessDay |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-04[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11397875 | work=BBC News | title=Irish economy contracts by 1.2% | date=23 September 2010[/tpl] However the economy experienced Q2 negative growth of −1.2%, and in the fourth quarter, the GDP shrunk by 1.6%.

===Bank solvency===

The second problem, unacknowledged by management of Irish banks, the financial regulator and the Irish government,[tpl]cite news | author =Andras Gergely | title =Irish finmin sees bank liquidity, not solvency issue | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN0131770620081001 | date =1 October 2008 | publisher = Reuters[/tpl] is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic problems in the crashing Irish property market. Irish financial institutions have substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio.[tpl]cite web | last =Collins | first =Liam | title =Top developers see asset values dive two-thirds | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/top-developers-see-asset-values-dive-twothirds-1496605.html | date =12 October 2008 | publisher = Irish Independent[/tpl] These property developers are currently suffering from substantial over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The employment growth of the past that attracted many immigrants from Eastern Europe and propped up demand for property has been replaced by rapidly rising unemployment.[tpl]cite web | title =Unemployment rising at record rate | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1001/jobs.html | date = 1 October 2008 | publisher = RTÉ[/tpl]
Irish property developers speculated billions of Euros in overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites. They also speculated in agricultural land which, in 2007, had an average value of €23,600 per acre ($32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare)[tpl]cite web | title =Irish Agricultural Land Research | url=http://www.savills.ie/pdfs/articles/166.pdf |date=May 2008 | format =PDF | publisher =Savills Hamilton Osbourne King | accessdate =2008-10-08 [/tpl] which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] Lending to builders and developers has grown to such an extent that it equals 28% of all bank lending, or "the approximate value of all public deposits with retail banks. Effectively, the Irish banking system has taken all its shareholders' equity, with a substantial chunk of its depositors' cash on top, and handed it over to builders and property speculators.....By comparison, just before the Japanese bubble burst in late 1989, construction and property development had grown to a little over 25 per cent of bank lending."[tpl]cite web | title =Just How Sound is the Irish Banking System? | author =Morgan Kelly, Professor of Economics, University College Dublin | url=http://www.ucd.ie/economics/staff/mkelly/papers/solvency.pdf | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Irish banks correctly identify a systematic risk of triggering an even more severe financial crisis in Ireland if they were to call in the loans as they fall due. The loans are subject to terms and conditions, referred to as "covenants". These covenants are being waived[tpl]cite web | last =Oliver | first =Emmet | title =New waive of Irish banking | url=http://www.tribune.ie/business/news/article/2008/aug/31/new-waive-of-irish-banking/ | date =31 August 2008 | publisher =Sunday Tribune | accessdate =2008-10-01 [/tpl] in fear of provoking the (inevitable) bankruptcy of many property developers[tpl]cite web | title =Banks call in leading developers ahead of property write-downs | url=http://www.tribune.ie/business/news/article/2008/oct/12/banks-call-in-leading-developers-ahead-of-property/ | date =12 October 2008 | publisher = Sunday Tribune[/tpl] and banks are thought to be "lending some developers further cash to pay their interest bills, which means that they are not classified as 'bad debts' by the banks". Furthermore, the banks' "impairment" (bad debt) provisions are still at very low levels.[tpl]cite web | title =AIB Half-Yearly Financial Report 2008 | url = http://www.aibgroup.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=AIB_Investor_Relations/AIB_Press_Releas/aib_d_press_releases&cid=1216645875820&c=AIB_Press_Releas&channel=IRCA&position=first | date =30 July 2008 | publisher =Allied Irish Banks | accessdate =2008-09-18 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title =Reports and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2008 | url = http://online.hemscottir.com/ir/bir/ar_2008/ar.jsp?page=73&zoom=1.0&layout=single | date =10 June 2008 | page =73 | publisher =Bank of Ireland | accessdate =2008-10-11 [/tpl]
This does not appear to be consistent with the real negative changes taking place in property market fundamentals.
In contrast, on 7 October 2008, Danske Bank wrote off a substantial sum largely due to property-related losses incurred by its Irish subsidiary – National Irish Bank.[tpl]cite web | authors =Simon Carswell, Fiona Reddan | title =Another traumatic day for investors in Irish banks | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1008/1223335465924.html | date =7 October 2008 | publisher =Irish Times | accessdate =2008-10-07 [/tpl] The 3.18%[tpl]cite web | title =NIB figures hint at depth of bad debt problems | url=http://www.tribune.ie/business/article/2008/oct/12/nib-figures-hint-at-depth-of-bad-debt-problems/ | date =12 October 2008 | publisher =Sunday Tribune[/tpl] charge against the loan book of its Irish operations is the first significant write off to take place and is a modest indication of the extent of the more substantial future charges to be incurred by the over-exposed domestic banks. Asset write downs by the domestically-owned Irish banks are only now slowly beginning to take place

===Guarantee of banking system===

On 30 September 2008, the Irish Government declared a guarantee that intends to safeguard the Irish banking system. The Irish National guarantee, backed by taxpayer funds, covers "all deposits (retail, commercial, institutional and interbank), covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt".[tpl]cite web | title =Government Decision to Safeguard Irish Banking System | url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=586&docID=4026 | date =30 September 2008 | publisher =Government of Ireland, Department of the Taoiseach[/tpl] In exchange for the bailout, the government did not take preferred equity stakes in the banks (which dilute shareholder value) nor did they demand that top banking executives' salaries and bonuses be capped, or that board members be replaced.[tpl]cite web | title =Seven Deadly Sins...

===National Recovery Plan 2011–2014===

In November 2010 the Irish Government published the National Recovery plan, which aimed to restore order to the public finances and to bring its deficit in line with the EU target of 3% of economic output by 2015.Extra year for Ireland under €85 billion plan It involves a budget adjustment of €15 billion (€10 billion in public expenditure cuts and €5 billion in taxes) over a four-year period. This was front loaded in 2011 where measures totaling €6 billion took place. Subsequent budgetary adjustments of €3 billion per year were put in place up to 2015, in order to reduce the government deficit to less than 3% of GDP. VAT is to increase to 23% by 2014. A property tax was re-introduced in 2012. This was initially charged in 2012 as a flat rate on all properties and subsequently charged at a level of 0.18% of the estimated market value of a property from 2013. Domestic water charges are to be introduced in 2015.Four-year plan unveiledBudget adjustment for 2011 to total €6bn Expenditure cuts included reductions in public sector pay levels, reductions in the number of public sector employees through early retirement schemes, reduced social welfare payments and reduced health spending.
As a result of increased taxation and decreased government spending the Irish government deficit was reported by the Central Statistics Office (Ireland) to have decreased from 30.9% of GDP in 2010 to 7.6% of GDP in 2012. In addition Ireland's unemployment rate has slowly begun to fall from a peak of 15.1% in February 2012 to 12.6% in October 2013. The number of people in employment has increased by 58,000 (3.1% increase in employment rate) in the year to September 2013. On February 27 2014 the government launched its Action Plan for Jobs 2014 which followed similar plans initiated in 2013 and 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Kenny, Gilmore and Bruton on hand for job actions plan launch|url=http://www.irelandnews.net/index.php/sid/220259283/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Kenny-Gilmorre-and-Bruton-on-hand-for-job-actions-plan-launch|accessdate=2014-02-27|publisher=Ireland News.Net[/tpl]

==Sectors==

===Exports===

Exports play an important role in Ireland's economic growth. A series of significant discoveries of base metal deposits have been made, including the giant ore deposit at Tara Mine. Zinc-lead ores are also currently mined from two other underground operations in Lisheen and Galmoy. Ireland now ranks as the seventh largest producer of zinc concentrates in the world, and the twelfth largest producer of lead concentrates. The combined output from these mines make Ireland the largest zinc producer in Europe and the second largest producer of lead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://irishresources.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/irish-mines-now-operating-tara-galmoy-and-lisheen/ |title=Operational Irish Mines: Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen « Irish Natural Resources |publisher=Irish Natural Resources |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-09[/tpl]

===Primary sector===

The primary sector constitutes about 5% of Irish GDP, and 8% of Irish employment. Ireland's main economic resource is its large fertile pastures, particularly the midland and southern regions. In 2012 Ireland exported approximately €9 billion worth of agri-food and drink (about 8.4% of Ireland's exports), mainly as cattle, beef, and dairy products. Ireland's agri-food exports are expected to grow and are led by a number of large Irish companies including Kerry Group, Glanbia and Greencore.
In the late nineteenth century, the island was mostly deforested. In 2005, after years of national afforestation programmes, about 9% of Ireland has become forested.World Resources Institute (2006).

==Currency==

Before the introduction of the euro notes and coins in January 2002, Ireland used the Irish pound or punt. In January 1999 Ireland was one of eleven  European Union member states which launched the European Single Currency, the euro. Euro banknotes are issued in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 denominations and share the common design used across Europe, however like other countries in the eurozone, Ireland has its own unique design on one face of euro coins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myguideireland.com/euro-coins |title=Design for Irish coin denominations |publisher=Myguideireland.com |accessdate=2009-07-09[/tpl] The government decided on a single national design for all Irish coin denominations, which show a Celtic harp, a traditional symbol of Ireland, decorated with the year of issue and the word Éire.

==Recruitment==

The recruitment service industry in Ireland involves specialised recruitment agencies (sometimes known as employment agencies or simply recruiters) offering personnel consulting, specialist corporate recruiting, CV databasing, job-finding and headhunting, and temporary worker management services.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] These agencies usually work with larger business clients who are seeking qualified employees. Employment agencies in Ireland are licensed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Employment Agency Act 1971. The main thrust of the act is to outlaw exploitation of jobseekers. Under the act an agency is permitted to charge a maximum of £1 (now equivalent to €1.27). [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] From 2007, the slump in the Irish economy and the fee structure of recruitment agencies has meant that many agencies have closed. In reaction to this several companies are rebranding themselves as Flat Fee recruiters and offer reduced service at reduced fees.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
