==Overview==

===Background===

Coming at a time when Simon's musical career was at something of a low ebb following the disappointing public response to Hearts and Bones, the project was originally inspired, as Simon explained on the album notes of the first release of the record, when he listened to a cassette lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter who Simon was working with as a producer. The cassette,an instrumental called "Gumboots- Accordion Jive Hits Number 1", was from a South African band, The Boyoyo Boys. In an interview, Simon described the Boyoyo Boys track as "instrumental music with an accordion, electric guitar, bass, and drums." He said it reminded him of "a certain kind of fifties rock 'n' roll."[tpl]cite web|last=Silverman|first=Rena|title=Paul Simon Looks Back on the Anniversary of the Amazing Graceland|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/10/11/paul-simon-looks-back-on-the-anniversary-of-the-amazing-graceland/|work=National Geographic|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]  Simon later wrote lyrics to sing over a re-recording of the song, which became the fourth track on the album, beginning with the structure and then adding the melody.

===Music===

Graceland features an eclectic mixture of musical styles including pop, a cappella, isicathamiya, rock, and mbaqanga. The album was strongly influenced by the earlier work of South African musicians Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchunu, and the Zulu-Western pop cross-over music realized in their band Juluka.  Juluka was South Africa's first integrated pop band.  Simon includes thanks to Johnny Clegg, Juluka and Juluka's producer Hilton Rosenthal in the "Special Thanks" citation included in Graceland's liner notes.
Much of the album was recorded in South Africa, and it features many South African musicians and groups. Simon faced accusations by organisations such as Artists United Against Apartheid,[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/lucyjones/100063781/should-paul-simon-have-defied-a-un-boycott-to-make-graceland-in-south-africa-under-apartheid/ |title=Should Paul Simon have defied a UN boycott to make Graceland in South Africa under apartheid? |last1=Jones |first1=Lucy|date=31 May 2012 |website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] anti-apartheid musicians including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Jerry Dammers[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/16/paul-simon-graceland-london |title=Paul Simon brings Graceland back to London, 25 years after apartheid boycott row |last=Denselow |first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Denselow|date=16 March 2012 |website=theguardian.com|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] and the then Ghanaian Ambassador to the United Nations James Victor Gbeho[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/paul-simon-graceland-20110330 |title=100 Best Albums of the Eighties: Paul Simon "Graceland" |author= |website=rollingstone.com|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] that he had broken the cultural boycott imposed by the rest of the world against the apartheid regime in South Africa, which was in its final years at the time. Although supported by the United Nations Anti-Apartheid Committee, as the album showcased the talents of the black South African musicians while offering no support to the South African government, even the ANC protested the collaboration as a break in the cultural boycott. However Simon also received praise for encouraging South African music from Hugh Masekela, one of South Africa's most prominent musicians and an exiled opponent of apartheid, who subsequently toured alongside Simon and Miriam Makeba. The worldwide success of the album introduced some of the musicians, especially the vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, to global audiences of their own. The song Homeless was written jointly by Paul Simon and Joseph Tshabalala, the lead singer of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, to a melody from a traditional Zulu wedding song.Geoff Hill The Battle for Zimbabwe: The Final Countdown  2003 - Page 211 "The song was written jointly by Paul Simon and Joseph Tshabalala, the lead singer of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and the melody is from an old Zulu wedding song: We are homeless, we are homeless . . . Somebody cry, why, why, why?"
Simon included American 'roots' influences with tracks featuring Zydeco musicians such as Clifton Chenier and Tex-Mex musicians. The Everly Brothers sing harmony on the title track. Linda Ronstadt appears on the track "Under African Skies", the second verse of which Simon wrote based on her childhood experiences.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==Reception==

Graceland was Paul Simon's highest charting album in the U.S. in over a decade, reaching #3 in the national Billboard charts, receiving a certification of 5Ã— Platinum by the RIAA and eventually selling over 14 million copies, making it Simon's most commercially successful album. Critics welcomed its eclectic mix of sounds and broad, quirky subject matter and it regularly shows up in critic polls and "recommended" lists. The album also helped to draw worldwide attention to the music of South Africa.
The album drew accolades from the beginning.  Rolling Stone called it "lovely, daring and accomplished" and Robert Christgau enthused it was "so strange, so sweet, so willful, so radically incongruous and plainly beautiful."  It was so acclaimed by other critics that he later anticipated that it would top The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll for that year (1986).[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The Village Voice |date=March 3, 1987 |title=The 1986 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres86.php |accessdate=[tpl]date|2005-03-21[/tpl] |ref=PazzJop[/tpl]

In the Graceland Classic Albums video, Simon states that he considers the title track the best song he has ever written. A popular music video starring Simon and Chevy Chase was made for the hit song "You Can Call Me Al". Simon toured the album extensively, featuring many of the artists from the album in addition to exiled South Africans Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba. Two concerts in Harare, Zimbabwe, were filmed in 1987 for release as "The African Concert". The audience was a multi-racial mix with many travelling from South Africa.
The success of the album earned Paul Simon the Best International Solo Artist award at The Brit Awards in 1987.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1987 | title= The BRITs 1987[/tpl]
