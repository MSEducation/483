==Biography==

Born in Lyon, France of a Jewish[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] family, Trichet was educated at the École des Mines de Nancy, from which he graduated in 1964. He later trained at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (best known as Sciences Po), finishing in 1966, and the École nationale d'administration (ENA) from 1969–1971, two French higher education institutions in the field of political science and state administration.
In 1987 Trichet became a member of an influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty. Later, in 1993 he was appointed governor of Banque de France. On 1 November 2003 he took Wim Duisenberg's place as president of the European Central Bank. (Most European Union leaders present at a 1998 special summit believed that Wim Duisenberg had agreed to a compromise with the French representatives and would step down from his office halfway through his eight-year term.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl])
On 1/26/2012, the board of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company approved the nomination of JC Trichet to the Board (to be formally validated by the General Assembly of shareholders on 5/31/12), where he will represent (with Dominique d’Hinnin of the Lagardère Group) the Sogeade - the structure bearing the French shareholders' interests.http://bourse.lefigaro.fr/indices-actions/actu-conseils/jean-claude-trichet-devient-administrateur-d-eads-58750 lefigaro.fr 1/26/2012http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/business/global/trichet-likely-to-join-board-of-airbus-parent.html nytimes.com, 1/26/2012

==Banking scandal==

In January 2003, Trichet was put on trial with eight others charged with irregularities at Crédit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks. Trichet was in charge of the French treasury at that time. He was cleared in June 2003, which left the way clear for him to move to the ECB.[tpl]cite web |title=Top Euro banker cleared of scandal cover-up| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3000170.stm | accessdate=2007-08-15  | work=BBC News | date=18 June 2003[/tpl]

==2009 Banking Crisis==

Within the European Central Bank, Trichet strongly resisted any contemplation of Greece defaulting on its debt. It was only in October 2011, with the end of his term imminent,  that consensus was reached to allow a 50% cut in the value of Greek bonds.[tpl]cite news |title=The Denials That Trapped Greece |author=Landon Thomas Jr. |author2= Stephen Castle |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/business/global/europes-two-years-of-denials-trapped-greece.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Trichet has been criticised for the ECB's response to the Great Recession, which emphasised price stability over recovery and growth.[tpl]cite web |title=An Impeccable Disaster| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/opinion/an-impeccable-disaster.html | accessdate=2011-09-12  | work=New York Times | date=11 Sep 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/the-summer-of-confidence |title=The Summer of Confidence |author=Paul Krugman |date=1 December 2011 |work=The Conscience of a Liberal |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]
