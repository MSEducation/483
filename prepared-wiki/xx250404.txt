The Columbiettes are women auxiliaries of the Knights of Columbus Councils.

==History==

In 1939, Monsignor J. Francis McIntyre, Chaplain of the New York Chapter Knights of Columbus, later a cardinal, suggested formation of the group. He had seen great numbers of women coming out of a Communist rally at Madison Square Garden. He conceived the idea of a ladies organization to work with the Knights of Columbus (KofC). The New York Chapter KofC formulated a plan for such an organization. Their plan called for the establishment of Auxiliaries in each Council and to coordinate the efforts of all under the direction of one parent group. On March 2, 1939 the first Columbiettes was instituted in New York City.
Since then, other auxiliaries were formed. State Councils and a Supreme Council were established.[ref]
