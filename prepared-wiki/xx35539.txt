Fitzgerald River National Park is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), [tpl]convert|419|km[/tpl] southeast of Perth, in the Shire of Ravensthorpe and the Shire of Jerramungup.
The park includes the Barren Mountains and Eyre Range and the Fitzgerald River as well as incorporating the Fitzgerald Biosphere. There are 62 plant species which are unique to the [tpl]convert|329882|ha[/tpl] park and a further 48 are rarely found elsewhere.
Recording almost 40,000 visitors in 2008, the park received $20 million in funding from the federal government's economic stimulus plan with the state government contributing an additional $20 million. The investment is to be used to redevelop and seal [tpl]convert|80|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of roads within the park, construct a walk trail from Bremer Bay to Hopetoun and upgrade existing recreational facilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/aa/releases/2009/December/aa552_2009.htm|title=Media Release – $20 Million Investment in Fitzgerald River National Park |year=2009|accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl]
Point Ann is one of the two places (the other is Head of the Bight) along Australia's coast where Southern Right Whales come to calve during their winter migration.
Within the National Park is the Quaalup Homestead Wilderness Retreat (now run as a hotel) that was built in 1858 by the Wellstead Family. In 1890, the Hassell family took over the pastoral lease and the homestead.
The park can be accessed from the western side via Bremer Bay, or from the eastern side via Hopetoun. The central area of the park is only accessible with a four wheel drive vehicle or on foot.
Many of the peaks in the park are off limits to climbers to prevent the spread of dieback or root rot from Phytophthora cinnamomi.
