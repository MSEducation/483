A kebero is a double-headed, conical hand drum used in the traditional music of Eritrea and Ethiopia.  A piece of animal hide is stretched over each end, thus forming a membranophone. A large version of the instrument is also used in Orthodox Christian liturgical music, while smaller versions are used in secular celebrations.[tpl]NewGrove2001|Ethiopia|Shelemay, Kay Kaufman|viii|pp. 355-356[/tpl]
