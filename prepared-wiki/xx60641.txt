The oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a large pelagic shark inhabiting tropical and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.
This aggressive but slow-moving fish dominates feeding frenzies, and is a danger to shipwreck or air crash survivors.Bass, A.J., J.D. D'Aubrey & N. Kistnasamy (1973). "Sharks of the east coast of southern Africa. 1. The genus Carcharhinus (Carcharhinidae)." Invest. Rep. Oceanogr. Res. Inst., Durban, no. 33. Recent studies show steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued as the chief ingredient of shark fin soup and, as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.[tpl]IUCN2010 |assessors=Baum, J., Medina, E., Musick, J.

==Taxonomy==

The oceanic whitetip shark, or lesser white shark was first described by naturalist René-Primevère Lesson in his account of Louis Duperrey's 1822–1825 world-circling journey on the corvette La Coquille. Lesson described two specimens found in the Tuamotu Archipelago in French Polynesia, and named the shark Squalus maou after a Polynesian word for "shark". However, Lesson's description and name were forgotten.[tpl]ITIS |id=160330 |taxon=Carcharhinus longimanus (Poey, 1861) |accessdate=18 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]verification failed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
It was next described by Cuban Felipe Poey in 1861 as Squalus longimanus. The name Pterolamiops longimanus has also been used. The species epithet [tpl]lang|la|longimanus[/tpl] refers to the size of its pectoral fins ([tpl]lang|la|longimanus[/tpl] translates from Latin as "long hands").[tpl]cite web|author=Cathleen Bester |title=Oceanic Whitetip Shark|publisher=Florida Museum of Natural history|accessdate=22 July 2006|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/OceanicWT/OceanicWT.html[/tpl] The oceanic whitetip shark has many common names in English: Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, whitetip whaler, and whitetip shark.
The rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published description has priority; therefore the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten for so long that Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted.[tpl]cite book|author= Leonard J. V.

==Distribution and habitat==

The oceanic whitetip is found globally in deep, open water, with a temperature greater than [tpl]Convert|18|°C|°F|0[/tpl].[tpl]FishBase species | genus = Carcharhinus | species = longimanus | year = 2013 | month = February[/tpl] It prefers waters between [tpl]Convert|20|°C|°F|0[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|28|°C|°F|0[/tpl] and tends to withdraw from areas when temperatures fall outside of this. They were once extremely common and widely distributed, and still inhabit a wide band around the globe; however, recent studies suggest that their numbers have drastically declined. An analysis of the US pelagic longline logbook data between 1992–2000 (covering the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic) estimated a decline of 70% over that period.
They are found worldwide between 45° north and 43° south latitude. In 2004, an oceanic whitetip was discovered dead on the west coast of Sweden—far beyond what was once considered the northern boundary of its range.[tpl]cite web|author=Eli|title=Fishwatcher|publisher=Fishwatcher|accessdate=6 February 2006|url=http://64.95.130.5/FishWatcher/Record.cfm?autoctr=650[/tpl]
The shark spends most of its time in the upper layer of the ocean—to a depth of [tpl]convert|150|m|ft|-1[/tpl]—and prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to longline capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. Occasionally it is found close to land, in waters as shallow as [tpl]Convert|37|m|ft|-1[/tpl], mainly around mid-ocean islands such as Hawaii, or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and there is access to nearby deep water. It is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. Unlike many animals, it does not have a diurnal cycle, and is active both day and night. Its swimming style is slow, with widely spread pectoral fins. Despite their habitual isolation from members of their own species, pilot fish, dolphinfish, and remora may accompany them. In 1988, Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale.

==Anatomy and appearance==

C. longimanus' most distinguishing characteristics are its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger than most other shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes.
C. longimanus has a 'typical', although somewhat flattened requiem shark body, often with a mildly humpbacked aspect. It is bronze, brown, bluish or grey dorsally (the colour varies by region), and white ventrally (although it may occasionally have a yellow tint). The oceanic whitetip shark is a medium-sized requiem shark. The largest specimen ever caught measured [tpl]Convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of [tpl]Convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The maximum reported weight is [tpl]convert|170|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. The female is typically larger than the male by [tpl]Convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Males attain sexual maturity at [tpl]Convert|1.7|to|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and females about [tpl]Convert|1.8|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, the mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was [tpl]convert|86.4|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the 1990s, the sharks of the species from the same area averaged only [tpl]convert|56.1|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title = Consideration of Proposals for Amendment of Appendices I and II (CoP15 Prop. 16)|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/cop/15/prop/E-15-Prop-16.pdf |date=March 2010 |publisher=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)[/tpl]
Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and caudal) have white tips (juvenile specimens and some adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and in young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins. The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular (somewhat fang-like). There are between 13 and 15 teeth on either side of the symphysis. The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges—there are 14 or 15 along each side of the symphysis. The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges.

==Diet==

C. longimanus feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods and bony fish. However, its diet can be far more varied and less selective—it is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.[tpl]cite book|author=Benchley, Peter|title=Shark Trouble|publisher=Random House|year=2002|isbn=0812966333[/tpl]

==Behaviour==

The oceanic whitetip is usually solitary and slow-moving, and tends to cruise near the top of the water column, covering vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources. Until the 16th century,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=shark&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2006-08-08[/tpl] sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs"[tpl]cite book|title=The History of Underwater Exploration|author=Marx R.F.|year=1990|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oiWFhoRzPBQC&pg=PA3|isbn=0-486-26487-4[/tpl] and the oceanic whitetip, the most common ship-following shark, exhibits dog-like behaviour when its interest is piqued: when attracted to something that appears to be food, its movements become more avid and it will approach cautiously but stubbornly, retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off, but ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. Whitetips commonly compete for food with silky sharks, making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays.
Groups often form when individuals converge on a food source, whereupon a feeding frenzy may occur. This seems to be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities when it is not slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.
There does not seem to be segregation by sex and size. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of cetaceans such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.

==Reproduction==

Mating season is in early summer in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean, although females captured in the Pacific have been found with embryos year round, suggesting a longer mating season there. The shark is viviparous—embryos develop in utero and are fed by a placental sac. Its gestation period is one year. Litter sizes vary from one to 15 with the young born at a length of about [tpl]Convert|0.6|m|in|0[/tpl]. Sexual maturity is reached at close to [tpl]Convert|1.75|m|in|0[/tpl] for males and [tpl]Convert|2|m|in|-1[/tpl] for females.

==Relation to humans==

The oceanic whitetip is a commercially important species for its fins, its meat and oil. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried and salted and its hide is used for leather. It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole range—although it is more often taken as by-catch than by design, since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species.
Famed oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as "the most dangerous of all sharks".[tpl]cite book|author=Cousteau, Jacques-Yves & Cousteau, Philippe|title=The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea|publisher= Doubleday & Company, Inc|year=1970[/tpl] Despite the greater notoriety of the great white shark and other sharks habitually found nearer the shore, the oceanic whitetip is suspected to be responsible for many fatal attacks on humans, as a result of predation on survivors of shipwrecks or downed aircraft.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin, R. Aidan.|title=Elasmo Research|publisher=ReefQuest|accessdate=6 February 2006|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/carcharhinidae.htm[/tpl] Such incidents are not included in common shark-attack indices for the 20th and 21st centuries, and as a result of this, the oceanic whitetip does not have the highest number of recorded incidents; only 5 recorded attacks as of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/species2.htm |title=ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2010-07-05[/tpl]
[tpl]cite web|title=Oceanic Whitetip|publisher=howstuffworks.com|url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/fish/most-dangerous-shark2.htm[/tpl] In one incident, the torpedoing of USS Indianapolis on 30 July 1945, oceanic whitetips are believed to be responsible for many of the attacks on sailors who survived the initial sinking, though most reportedly died from exposure to the elements rather than from shark attacks.[tpl]cite book|last=Stanton|first=Doug|authorlink=Doug Stanton|title=In Harm's Way: The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors|year=2003|publisher=H. Holt|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-7366-9|edition=1st Owl Books[/tpl]
Also during World War II, the Nova Scotia, a steamship carrying approximately 1,000 people near South Africa, was sunk by a German submarine. With only 192 survivors, many deaths were attributed to the whitetip. 
One particularly infamous oceanic whitetip was implicated in several attacks on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in 2010, and was featured in a Shark Week episode called "Rogue Sharks". This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark taken out of its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it attacked the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions in the hope of obtaining a meal. These attacks were further worsened by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the attacks took place.Rogue Sharks
==Captivity==  
As the oceanic whitetip is an open water species, it fares poorly in captivity, like the mako and blue shark. Only one oceanic whitetip has been known to reside in captivity, housed in the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Outer-Bay exhibit in October of 2000, making the aquarium the only known institution to successfully keep one alive in captivity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/aa/timelineBrowser.asp?tf=80|title = Explore Our History, 2000–2001| publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] This same whitetip was featured briefly in the Shark Week special "Sharks Under Glass".Sharks Under Glass

==Conservation status==

In 1969, Lineaweaver and Backus wrote of the oceanic whitetip: "is extraordinarily abundant, perhaps the most abundant large animal, large being over 100 pounds 45 kg, on the face of the earth".[tpl]cite book|author=Thomas H. Lineaweaver III and Richard H. Backus|title=The Natural History of Sharks|year=1969|publisher=Lippincourt[/tpl] There was little further population study until 2003 when the numbers were estimated to have dropped by as much as 70% in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic between 1992 and 2000.
Another study focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late-1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates.[tpl]cite journal|author=Baum, J.K., Kehler, D. and Myers, R.A. |year=2005|title=Robust estimates of decline for pelagic shark populations in the northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico|journal=Fisheries |volume=30|pages= 27–30|url=http://www.globalshark.ca/ramweb/papers-total/Baumetal2005.pdf[/tpl]
As a result of these findings its status on the IUCN Red List was moved to "Vulnerable" globally (from "Lower Risk/Near Threatened") and "Critically Endangered" in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic areas.
Under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA), coastal and fishing states are specifically required to adopt measures to conserve listed species, but little progress is visible on the oceanic whitetip.
From early 2013 the shark will receive full protection in New Zealand territorial waters under the Wildlife Act 1953.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beehive.govt.nz/release/endangered-whitetip-sharks-be-protected|title=Endangered whitetip sharks to be protected|date=27 September 2012|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]Update after|2013[/tpl]
In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21741648 |title='Historic' day for shark protection |author=MCGrath, Matt |website=BBC News |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 [/tpl]
