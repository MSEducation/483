The first five weeks of the season were dominated by a quarterback controversy involving Kyle Orton and Tim Tebow, with fans voicing their displeasure with the play of Orton, which resulted in a 1–4 start, and the public outcry for Tebow to be moved to starter. On October 11, Tebow was named the starting quarterback beginning with the team's Week 7 game at the Miami Dolphins on October 23. Tebow compiled an 8–5 record (including the playoffs, with a six-game win streak from Weeks 9–14) since replacing Orton, including game-winning drives in the fourth quarter and/or overtime in six of those games, despite constant criticism of his unorthodox mechanics and abilities as a passer.[tpl]cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Tim Tebow named Broncos' starting quarterback |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_19087742 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2011[/tpl] Orton was later waived on November 22.[tpl]cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Denver Broncos cut QB Kyle Orton; Chicago Bears might be next |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_19391873 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=November 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 22, 2011[/tpl] Another notable roster change was the trade that sent wide receiver Brandon Lloyd to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for a conditional 2012 draft selection.[tpl]cite news |author=Klis, Mike |title=Denver Broncos trade Brandon Lloyd to St. Louis Rams |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_19131036 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=October 17, 2011[/tpl]
The Broncos doubled their win total from 2010, finishing in a three-way tie with the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers for the AFC West division title, with an 8–8 record. However, the Broncos won the AFC West based on tiebreakers,[tpl]cite news |author=Zaas, Stuart |title=How the West was Won |url=http://blog.denverbroncos.com/denverbroncos/how-the-west-was-won/ |work=Denver Broncos |date=January 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl] thus clinching their first playoff berth and division title since 2005.
