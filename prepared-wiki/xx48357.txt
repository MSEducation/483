Alice Springs is the third largest town in the Northern Territory, Australia. Popularly known as "the Alice" or simply "Alice", Alice Springs is situated in the geographic centre of Australia near the southern border of the Northern Territory.Geoscience Australia Centre of Australia, States and Territories updated July 2006 "Officially, there is no centre of Australia. This is because there are many complex but equally valid methods that can determine possible centres of a large, irregularly shaped area especially one that is curved by the earth's surface." See the Geoscience Australia page for further details. The site is known as Mparntwe to its original inhabitants, the Arrernte, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around what is now Alice Springs for thousands of years. "Alice" in the English language was named by surveyor W. W. Mills after Lady Alice Todd (née Alice Gillam Bell), wife of Sir Charles Todd. Alice Springs has a population of 28,605, which makes up 12.2 percent of the territory's population. Alice Springs is nearly equidistant from Adelaide, South Australia and Darwin.
The town straddles the usually dry Todd River on the northern side of the MacDonnell Ranges. The surrounding region is known as Central Australia, or the Red Centre, an arid environment consisting of several different deserts. In Alice Springs temperatures can vary dramatically with an average maximum temperature in summer of [tpl]convert|35.6|°C|°F[/tpl], and an average minimum temperature in winter of [tpl]convert|5.1|°C|°F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_015590.shtml|title=Climate statistics for Alice Springs Airport|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]

Three major groups: the Western, Eastern and Central Arrernte people live in Central Australia, their traditional land including the area of Alice Springs and MacDonnell Ranges. They have also been referred to as Aranda, Arrarnta, Arunta and other similar spellings. There are five dialects of the Arrernte language: South-eastern, Central, Northern, Eastern and North-eastern.[tpl]cite web|title=AUSTLANG (Arrente entry)|url=http://austlang.aiatsis.gov.au/main.php?code=C8|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=AITSIS[/tpl]
Arrernte country is rich with mountain ranges, waterholes and gorges, which create a variety of natural habitats. The Arrernte people have set aside conservation areas in which various animal and other species are protected.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] According to the Arrernte traditional stories, in the desert surrounding Alice Springs, the landscape was shaped by caterpillars, wild dogs, travelling boys, two sisters, euros and other ancestral figures.
The numerous sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs include Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat Hill), Ntaripe (Heavitree Gap), Atnelkentyarliweke (Anzac Hill) and Alhekulyele (Mt Gillen).

===Early settlement===

In 1861–62, John McDouall Stuart led an expedition through Central Australia, to the west of what later became Alice Springs, thereby establishing a route from the south of the continent to the north.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
A European settlement was started ten years later with the construction of a repeater station on the Overland Telegraph Line, which linked Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain. The OTL was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart's route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. The telegraph station was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry Todd River. The settlement was optimistically named Alice Springs after the wife of the former Postmaster General of South Australia, Sir Charles Todd. The Todd River was named after Sir Charles.
It was not until alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, [tpl]convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] east of the present Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant European settlement occurred.Kelham, Megg "Discovering Local History Through Museums in Central Australia" published by the National Pioneer Women's Hall of Fame as educational resources available on-line The town's first substantial building was the Stuart Town Gaol in Parson's Street which was built in 1909 when the town had a European population of fewer than 20 people. Many of the gaol's first prisoners were first contact aboriginal men incarcerated for killing cattle.Kelham, Megg 'A Very Short History of the Stuart Town Gaol' published by the Northern Territory Library on line at http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/handle/10070/233508 Central Australia's first hospital, Adelaide House, was built in 1926 when the European population of the town was about 40. It was not until 1929 when the train line to Alice was built, that the town's European population began to grow. Aboriginal centralians outnumbered European Centralians until the mid-1930s.Kelham, Megg 'Flynn's Alice' – a pictorial history of Alice Springs with documents available on line at http://www.flynntrail.org.au/discovery_resources/Reading/Flynn's_Alice.pdf Until 31 August 1933, the town was officially known as Stuart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/alice-springs/history |title=About Alice Springs – History |publisher=Alicesprings.nt.gov.au |date=31 August 1933 |accessdate=30 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110524153936/http://www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/alice-springs/history| archivedate= 24 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The original mode of British-Australian transportation in the outback were camel trains, operated by immigrants from Pathan tribes in the North-West Frontier of then British India (present-day Pakistan); known locally as Afghan camellers based at Hergott Springs, or Marree as it is now known. Many camelleers moved to Alice Springs in 1929 when the railway finally reached the town. They lived on the block where the town council now is transporting goods from the rail head to stations and settlements to the north. A gold rush in Tennant Creek in 1932 kept the wheels of the Alice Springs economy flourishing until the outbreak of World War II.
Alice Springs was connected to Darwin by rail on 4 February 2004, when the first passenger train arrived in Darwin from Adelaide.

===World War II===

World War II brought significant changes to Alice Springs. Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an extremely isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No. 9 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. The railway hub in Alice Springs was taken over by military operations and the number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs grew rapidly, as did the number of personnel passing through on their way to and from Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes—the Northern Territory capital's primary means of transportation and resupply—were cut off. The evacuation of Darwin first brought a large number of civilians including elected officials and many of the territory government's records. Alice Springs became the war-time civilian capital of the Northern Territory. When Darwin was bombed by Japanese air forces, a large number of military personnel and their heavy equipment were rapidly moved south to Alice Springs. The number of soldiers posted in Alice Springs peaked at around 8,000 and the number of personnel passing through totalled close to 200,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Central Australia the war year – 1939–1945|url=http://www.thewaryears.alicespringsrsl.com.au/townlife.shtml|work=RSL On-Line Museum|publisher=RSL Sub Branch Alice Springs|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl] Once the war ended, the military camps and the evacuees departed and Alice Springs' population declined rapidly. But Alice would be changed for ever. After being visited by nearly 200,000 people, including the American General Douglas MacArthur, Alice Springs gained considerable fame. The war years also left behind many beneficial material assets. The historically-listed Totem Theatre, created for the entertainment of this camp, still exists today. The Australian Army set up the 109th Australian General Hospital at Alice Springs. Seven mile aerodrome was constructed by the Royal Australian Air Force. War related operations necessitated the first sealing of the road between Alice Springs and Larrimah, expansion and improvement of Alice Springs' water supply, and improving the rail head. The war-related operations left behind thousands of pieces of excess military equipment and vehicles, and a marked increase in Alice Springs' population.[tpl]cite web|title=Alice Springs (Mparntwe) NT|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/alicesprings.htm|work=Flinders Range Research|publisher=Flinders Ranges Research,|accessdate=8 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716051742/http://southaustralianhistory.com.au/alicesprings.htm| archivedate= 16 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Post World War II===

During the 1960s Alice Springs became an important defence location with the development of the US/Australian Pine Gap joint defence satellite monitoring base, home to about 700 workers from both countries.
By far the major industry in recent times is tourism. Almost in the exact centre of the continent, Alice Springs is some [tpl]convert|1200|km|mi[/tpl] from the nearest ocean and [tpl]convert|1500|km|mi[/tpl] from the nearest major cities, Darwin and Adelaide. Alice Springs is at the midpoint of the Adelaide–Darwin Railway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelnt.com/en/experience/outback/the-ghan.htm |title=The Ghan – Outback experiences – Northern Territory Official Travel Site |publisher=Travelnt.com |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl]

===Modern town===

The modern town of Alice Springs has both European and Aboriginal influences. The town's focal point, the Todd Mall, hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs' desert lifestyle has inspired several unique events, such as the Camel Cup, the Henley-on-Todd Regatta and the Beanie Festival.

===Built environment===

Alice Springs has many historic buildings including the Overland Telegraph Station, the Old Courthouse and Residency and the Hartley Street School. Adelaide House,a beautiful stone building in the middle of the Mall, Central Australia's first hospital, was designed and built by the Rev John Flynn, founder of the world's first flying doctor service, in 1926. It was also the site of the world's first successful portable wireless radio experiment conducted by Alf Traeger. Today it is a museum, one of several significant tourist attractions which forms part of 'The Flynn Trail' a self-guided urban heritage trail.The Flynn Trail http://www.flynntrail.org.au/discovery.html
Today the town is an important tourist hub and service centre for the surrounding area. It is a well-appointed town for its size, with several large hotels, a world class convention centre and a good range of visitor attractions, restaurants and other services.

==Geography==

The region around Alice Springs is part of the Central Ranges xeric scrub area of dry scrubby grassland[tpl]NatGeo ecoregion|id=aa1302|name=Central Ranges xeric scrub|accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] and includes the MacDonnell Ranges which run east and west of the city and contain a number of hiking trails and swimming holes such as Ormiston Gorge, Ormiston Gorge Creek, Red Bank Gorge and Glen Helen Gorge. The [tpl]convert|223|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long Larapinta Trail follows the West MacDonnell Ranges and is considered among the world's great walking experiences.
The Simpson Desert, south-east of Alice Springs is one of Australia's great wilderness areas containing giant red sand dunes and interesting rock formations such as Chambers Pillar and Rainbow Valley.

===Climate===

The town of Alice Springs straddles the usually dry Todd River on the northern side of the MacDonnell Ranges. Alice Springs is located in Central Australia, also called the Red Centre, an arid environment consisting of several different deserts.
In Alice Springs, temperatures can vary by up to 28 °C (50 °F) and rainfall can vary quite dramatically from year to year. In summer, the average maximum temperature is in the mid-30s, whereas in winter the average minimum temperature can be [tpl]convert|5.5|°C|°F[/tpl], with an average of 12.4 nights below freezing every year. The elevation of the town is about 545 metres (1,791 feet), which contributes to the cold nights in winter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=62349&refer= |title=Weatherbase: Records and Averages for Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia |publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] The highest temperature on record is [tpl]convert|45.2|°C|°F[/tpl] on the 3 January 1960, while the record low is [tpl]convert|-7.5|°C|°F[/tpl], recorded on the 17 July 1976. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the Northern Territory.
Under the Köppen climate classification, Alice Springs has a desert climate (BWh).[tpl]cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300[/tpl]
The annual average rainfall is [tpl]convert|285.9|mm|in|1[/tpl] which would make it a semi-arid climate except that its high evapotranspiration, or its aridity, makes it a desert climate.McKnight & Hess, pp. 212–1, "Climate Zones and Types: Dry Climates (Zone B)" Annual precipitation is erratic, varying year to year in Alice Springs.

==Demographics==

In June 2006, approximately 27,481 people lived in Alice Springs with a total of 39,888 in the region.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

As Alice Springs is the regional hub of Central Australia, it attracts Aboriginal people from all over that region and well beyond. Many Aboriginal people visit regularly to use the town's services. Aboriginal residents usually live in the suburbs, on special purpose leases (or town camps), or further out at Amoonguna to the South and on the small family outstation communities on Aboriginal Lands in surrounding areas.
The traditional owners of the Alice Springs area are the Central Arrernte people.Alice Springs Community – Indigenous Services, Alice Springs Town Council As it is the largest town in central Australia, there are also speakers of Warlpiri, Warumungu, Kaytetye, Alyawarre, Luritja, Pintupi, Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara, Ngaanyatjarra, Pertame, Eastern, and Western Arrernte among others.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/about_alice/aboriginal.asp |title=Alice Springs – Aboriginal Culture |publisher=Alice Springs Town Council |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=25 November 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061218024623/http%3A//www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/about_alice/aboriginal.asp |archivedate = 18 December 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Foreign and itinerant populations===

====United States population====

United States citizens have lived in Alice Springs continuously since the establishment of the United States Air Force Detachment 421, in 1954. Currently located on Schwarz Crescent, it is part of a joint United States-Australian project called the Joint Geological and Geographical Research Station (JGGRS). The unit is locally known as "Det 421" or "The Det" and has sponsored as many as 25 American families to live as temporary residents of the Alice Springs district. To mark the longstanding friendship with the community, on 1 July 1995, the Alice Springs Town Council granted Detachment 421 freedom of entry to the Alice Springs.[tpl]cite web|title=Council History – The Seventh Council|url=http://www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/alice-springs-town-council/council-history-7|work=Council History – The Seventh Council|publisher=Alice Springs Town Council|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl] Since the early 1970s, the majority of the American population in Alice Springs has been associated with proximity to Pine Gap, a joint Australian-US satellite tracking station, located [tpl]convert|19|km|mi[/tpl] south-west of Alice Springs, that employs about 700 Americans and Australians.
Currently, 2,000 residents of the Alice Springs district hold United States citizenship. Many of these Americans, joined by some Australians, celebrate major US public festivals, including Independence Day and Thanksgiving. Americans in Alice Springs are also known to participate in a variety of associations and sporting teams, including baseball, basketball, and football (soccer) competitions.The American Connection [tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl]

====Other cultures====

Several small immigrant communities of other foreign cultures have found a home in Alice Springs, including Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, and Indian ethnic groups. The most obvious impact of their presence in such a small and isolated town has been the opening of various restaurants serving their traditional cuisines.

====Itinerant population====

Alice Springs has a large itinerant population. This population is generally composed of foreign and Australian tourists, Aboriginal Australians visiting from nearby Central Australian communities, and Australian or international workers on short-term contracts (colloquially referred to as "blow-ins"). The major sources of work that recruit workers into town are the stations and mines. Foreign tourists usually pass through on their way to Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, whilst Australian tourists usually come through as a part of an event such as the Masters Games and the Finke Desert Race. These events can cause the population of the town to fluctuate by several thousand within a matter of days.
