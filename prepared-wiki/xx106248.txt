==Plot==

The film tells the story of a human life and what it is to be human by using clips of archive footage taken from more than a hundred year of film history. The film opens with scenes of birth. Clips are shown of various babies in development and until they are birthed. Next, the film features clips of childhood, then dance and sex. Using footage of a nude woman eating a banana, the film then transitions into clips of food, then starvation, then riots, then death. By transitioning from death processions to ceremonies in general, the focus is again brought to dance. After showing some clips of art and massive groups, the film ends with a woman pregnant in a tub.

==DVD release==

The BFI released Bodysong on DVD in March 2010.
