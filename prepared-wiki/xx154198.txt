Elsinoë mangiferae, common name Mango Scab, is also known Denticularia mangiferae or Sphaceloma mangiferae (anamorph). It is an ascomycete plant pathogen native to tropical regions and specific for survival on only one host, the mango. Originally described in 1943 from Florida and Cuba specimens, this pathogen has since spread worldwide and is becoming a pathogen of great concern for the mango industries in Australia and India. E. mangiferae is an obligate parasite of mango, and therefore cannot be grown outside of living plant tissue. The species was first described formally in 1946.

==Symptoms==

Elsinoë mangiferae produces symptoms superficially similar to anthracnose infections, which are also common on mango. The disease initially presents as small dark brown or gray spots on the underside of leaves or fruit. These spots enlarge and darken over time, developing a velvety or cracked texture in the center of the lesion. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05200.pdfhttp://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05200.pdf The main lifestyle difference between these two is that anthracnose infections are caused by saprotrophic fungi, while E. mangiferae is exclusively a biotrophic pathogen. 
With severe infections, fruit drop and defoliation may occur, and surviving fruit and plants suffer scarring that reduce their commercial value.

==Infection and spread==

Germination of E. mangiferae spores requires a period of moist conditions and free water. The pathogen only infects young tissue, especially new set fruit. The spores are primarily spread by rain dispersal, over short distances, but heavy rains and irrigation, as well as moisture inductive microclimate (low ground, etc.) promote conidiation and spread over larger areas.

==Control==

Control is mainly attempted via regular protective application of copper fungicides, specifically copper hydroxide and copper oxychloride. Increased application schedules are recommended in moist climates and seasons.
Benomyl, the systemic benzimidazole fungicide, has also been used as a means to control mango scab infection, but has been out of production since 2001. 
Reduction of inoculum is also essential for control of this disease. Due to its saprotrophic lifestyle, inoculum can survive on fallen leaves and dead twigs long term, which necessitates the removal or destruction of dead plant material to prevent disease spread.
