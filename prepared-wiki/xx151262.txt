[[Chlorine bomb]]

CATEGORIES: Improvised explosive devices

A chlorine bomb is a small explosive device which uses the pressure of chemically produced chlorine gas or other chlorine-containing gases such as hydrogen chloride to produce an explosion. It is made with an airtight container part-filled with different types of chlorine tablet and other reagents. The reaction produces an expansive increase in pressure, eventually rupturing the container. Usually, such a device is not made on a large scale, often being manufactured from common house objects.
Such a device is a more toxic and acidic alternative to a dry ice bomb, but likewise typically made by young people for amusement and recreational use rather than with any intent to harm.Snopes report on an attempted assault with a similar device However, exposure to chlorinous gases and the reactive substances involved can cause respiratory problems from inhalation and also cause injury to other mucous membranes, similar to tear gas. Most injuries relating to these devices involve bruised hands, blinding and other eye injuries - generally to the bomb makers themselves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]. 
Pastor's Terrorism and Public Safety Policing outlines how Cprogram is emphasizing lessons learned in Iraq regarding chlorine bomb use on American soldiers.  This exposure has provided Western police departments like the NYPD with incentive to amend current policing models from Community Policing to a Public Safety Policing model that emphasizes risk aversion via public/private policing partnerships through metropolitan arenas.[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Moreover, the chlorine bomb and other weapons systems in its class achieve this because they are easy to manufacture and thus represent a more fluid weapons delivery model for domestic and international terrorists.Pastor, James F.
