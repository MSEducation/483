Utricularia scandens is a small, probably annual carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It has a wide native distribution that includes Africa (Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) and Asia (Bangladesh, Burma, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam). U. scandens grows as a terrestrial plant in wet grasslands and bogs at lower altitudes around sea level up to [tpl]convert|2300|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. It was originally described by Ludwig Benjamin in 1847. There is a significant amount of synonymy established for this species, in part because of its large distribution and variable morphology.Taylor, Peter. (1989).
