[[Ghazni Province]]

CATEGORIES: Ghazni Province, Provinces of Afghanistan

Ghazni ([tpl]lang-ps|غزني[/tpl])([tpl]lang-fa|غزنی[/tpl]) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. The province contains 19 districts, encompassing over 1,000s villages and roughly 1.1 million people. The city of Ghazni serves as the provincial capital. It lies on the important Kabul–Kandahar Highway, and has historically functioned as an important trade center. The Ghazni Airport is located next to the city of Ghazni and provides limited domestic flights to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.

==Etymology==

The ancient name for Ghazni was ‘Ghzank’ from the Persian and Sanskrit word meaning ‘treasure’.

==History==

Ghazni was a thriving Buddhist center before and during the 7th century AD. Excavations have revealed religious artifacts of both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
[tpl]quote|"The two other great Buddhist centers, Fondukistan and Tepe-e-sardar (Ghazni) in its later phase are a very different matter and display another phase of influences coming from India from the seventh to eighth century. The representations show themes from Mahayana iconography and even in the case of the latter site assume Tantric aspects which had already established themselves in the large Indian monasteries like Nalanda."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9gc4AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=%22Gaulier%22+%22Buddhism+in+Afghanistan+and+Central+Asia%22+&ots=tMzLMM0g0d&sig=uDB4fR2yeLXEGpZ4ZQ7cnMREykE#PPA2,M1|title= Buddhism in Afghanistan and Central Asia |author=Simone Gaulier, Robert Jera-Bezard, Monique |page=2|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl][/tpl]

In 644 AD, the Chinese pilgrim Hsüan-tsang visited Jaguda, Ghazni, while travelling from the country of Varnu, crossing the land of O-po-kien (Afghans i.e. Pashtuns).BA Litvinsky, Zhang Guand-Da, R. Shabani Samghabadi, History of civilizations of Central Asia, pg. 385Hui-li, 1959, p. 188

===Islamization===

In 683 AD, Arab armies brought Islam to the area and attempted to conquer the capital of Ghazni but the local tribes fiercely resisted. Its resistance was so famed that Yaqub Saffari (840-879) from Zaranj made an example of Ghazni when he ranged the vast region conquering in the name of Islam. The city was completely destroyed by the Saffarids in 869.Nancy Hatch Dupree - Chapter 9 (Ghazni), An Historical Guide to Afghanistan A substantial portion of the local population including Hindus and Buddhists were converted to Islam by Mahmud of GhazniThe Wonder that was India II by S A Rizvi; published by Picador India; page 16
After the rebuilding of the city by Yaqub's brother, it became the dazzling capital of the Ghaznavids from 994 to 1160, encompassing much of North India, Persia and Central Asia. Many iconoclastic campaigns were launched from Ghazni into India. The Ghaznavids took Islam to India and returned with fabulous riches taken from both prince and temple god. Contemporary visitors and residents at Ghazni write with wonder of the ornateness of the buildings, the great libraries, the sumptuousness of the court ceremonies and of the wealth of precious objects owned by Ghazni's citizens.
Ferishta records attacks by Muhammad of Ghor: "at the same time most of the infidels who inhabited the mountains between Ghazni and the Indus were also converted, some by force and others by persuasion."Ferishta translated by John Briggs; p. 104. Ghazni's eponymous capital was razed in 1151 by the Ghorid Alauddin. It again flourished but only to be permanently devastated, this time in 1221 by Genghis Khan and his Mongol armies after 6 years of Khwarezmid rule. Ghazni's strategic position, both economically and militarily, assured its revival, albeit without its dazzling former grandeur.
Ghazni is famous for its minarets built on a stellar plan. They date from the middle of the twelfth century and are the surviving element of the mosque of Bahramshah. Their sides are decorated with geometric patterns. Upper sections of the minarets have been damaged or destroyed. The most important mausoleum located in Ghazni is that of Sultan Mahmud's. Others include the tombs of poets and scientists, for example Al-Biruni and Sanai. The only ruins in Old Ghazni retaining a semblance of architectural form are two towers, about 43 m (140 ft) high and some 365 m (1,200 ft) apart. According to inscriptions, the towers were constructed by Mahmud of Ghazni and his son.
Babur records in his memoirs that Ghazni was part of Zabulistan.Babur-Nama Translated from the original Turki Text of Zahirud'd-din Muhammad BABUR padshah Ghazi by Annette Susannah Beveridge Vol1 and 11 Published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, p. 217. The area was controlled by the Mughals until Nader Shah and his Persian forces invaded it in 1738. Ahmad Shah Durrani conquered Ghazni in 1747 and made it part of the Durrani Empire. During the First Anglo-Afghan War, the capital of Ghazni province was destroyed by the British-led Indian forces in the Battle of Ghazni.
In the 1960s a 15-meter female Buddha was discovered lying on its back and surrounded by empty pillars that once held rows of smaller male Buddhas. Parts of the female Buddha have been stolen. In the 1980s a mud brick shelter was created to protect the sculpture, but the wood supports were stolen for firewood and the shelter partially collapsed.

===Recent history===

Since the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, there has been a Provincial reconstruction base and a NATO forces base. These western forces (mostly Polish Armed Forces) are hunting Taliban and al-Qaida militants, who are still active in the area.
Like many southern Afghan provinces, Ghazni has a precarious security situation. The Taliban insurgents are found in the rural areas outside of the capital, and are involved in attacks on provincial schools and government infrastructure. The province has avoided the outright warfare seen in other provinces of Afghanistan such as Helmand and Kandahar, but that is due more to political expediency and the tactical plans of the NATO-led ISAF force than the existence of a stable security situation in the province. Ex-Governor Taj Mohammad was killed by insurgents in 2006 after being appointed police chief of the province with a mandate to quell the power of the Taliban. On the same day there was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the governor at the time, Sher Alam Ibrahimi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060316/afghanistan_governor_060318?s_name=&no_ads= |title=Afghanistan militants kill former governor|publisher=Ctv.ca|accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl] There is a Polish and American Provincial Reconstruction Team base located in Ghazni.

==Politics and governance==

The current governor of the province is Musa Khan Ahmadzai. His predecessor was Osman Osmani. The city of Ghazni is the capital of the province. All law enforcement activities throughout the province are controlled by the Afghan National Police (ANP) along with the Afghan Local Police (ALP). The provincial police chief represents the Ministry of the Interior in Kabul. The ANP is backed by other Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the NATO-led forces.

==Demographics==

The total population of the province is about 1,705,000, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a rural society.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/Ghazni(1).pdf |title=Settled Population of Ghazni province by Civil Division, Urban, Rural and Sex-2012-13 |publisher=Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Central Statistics Organization |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] According to the Naval Postgraduate School, the ethnic groups of the province are as follows: refer to the of districts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.edu/programs/ccs/Ghazni.html |title=Ghazni Province |work=Program for Culture & Conflict Studies|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary occupation of the citizens of Ghazni. Wheat, alfalfa, melons, and almonds are among the largest crops produced.

===Districts===

==Infrastructure==

Band E Sardeh Dam is located in Andar District near the border with Paktika Province. It creates a large water reservoir that is critical to the irrigation of the Kahnjoor farming zone. The dam itself and the canal system it feeds both need repairs and maintenance.
Governor Musa Khan Akbarzada stated that key development projects would be launched in southern Ghazni in 2012 ahead of the Asian capital of the Islamic civilization for 2013. The projects include the construction of a proposed Islamic cultural centre, a mosque, a covered bazaar, a gymnasium, a guesthouse, an airport, a five-star hotel and two 27 storey-buildings and others. More than 2,000 people would find work opportunities on the $30 million projects; $10 million would be provided by the central government, $7 million by the Polish provincial reconstruction team (PRT) and $3 million by the US. A 40-kilometre road would be asphalted by the end of the 2012.
Ghazni province is to be connected to the national electrical distribution system via North-east Power System (NEPS). The construction of transmission line would begin from east Chimtala to Ghazni using high voltage transmission network (2 x 220kV transmission lines and power substations). The project is to be implemented by USFOR-A and USAID costing $101 mlllion. However the Asian Development Bank agreed to complete the transmission line from Chimtala to Dast-i-Barchi; hence reducing Project scope to begin from Dast-i-Barchi instead of Chimtala. The implemention of this project was delayed due to  USACE being unable to award a contract because bids received for the project were more than double estimated costs, due largely to security concerns resulting from therisks associated with implementing firm-fixed-price contracts in a kinetic environment, poor cost estimates, and unrealistic periods of performance. USACE is re-procuring both projects and plans toaward contracts in June or July 2012, which will delay the project's execution schedules between 6 to 15 months. Furthermore the delays in transferring funds contributed to delays in project execution. This line is a key part of a planned NEPS to SEPS connection to transport power to Kandaharto replace the expensive diesel-fueled power plants

===Ghazni Airport===

Work on the Ghazni Airport began in April 2012. The work on the airport's boundary wall would take four months to complete at a cost of $750,000, provided by the Transport and Aviation Ministry. Work on the runway has also been started being four kilometers length and one and a half kilometer width, the airport is being constructed in the Unit area of Deh Yak district. The overall project would be complete in 2013, when the provincial capital serves as the centre of Islamic civilization. Residents in neighbouring provinces, such as Logar, Paktika, Maidan Shahr and Zabul, would also benefit from the airport.

==Natural resources==

Recent geologic surveys have indicated Ghazni may have one of the world's richest deposits of lithium. Gold and copper were also found in the Zarkashan Mine of Ghazni province with an estimated value of $30 billion. Whilst Lithium deposits are valued at around $60 billion, were discovered in four eastern and western provinces of Afghanistan, Together with other newly (2010) discovered mineral deposits, the total value of US $3 trillion the estimate is based on a survey of 30 percent of the country's land mass.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-29/u-s-afghan-study-finds-mineral-deposits-worth-3-trillion.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Eltaf | last=Najafizada | title=U.S., Afghan Study Finds Mineral Deposits Worth $3 Trillion | date=January 29, 2011[/tpl]
