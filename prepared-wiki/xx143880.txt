The Anniston Amtrak Station, located in Anniston, Alabama, is served by the [tpl]Amtrak lines|Crescent[/tpl] passenger train, which runs once daily between New York City and New Orleans. The street address is 126 West 4th Street, just to the south of downtown Anniston. The station was originally operated by the Southern Railway, and was one of the last railroad-operated active passenger stations in the country, as the Southern Crescent (predecessor to the current Amtrak train) was still operated by the Southern well into the Amtrak era.
In 2008, the city completed a full rehabilitation of the classical revival depot, primarily using funds obtained through the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s Transportation Enhancements (TE) program.http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/ATN/Station_view
