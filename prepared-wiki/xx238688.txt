James E. Allen is an American professional wrestler and promoter, best known by his ringname "Big" Paulie Gilmore or Gilmorea, who wrestled on the New England independent circuit for the Century Wrestling Alliance, the National Wrestling Alliance, the Millennium Wrestling Federation and the World Wrestling Alliance during the 1990s and early 2000s. He is also the owner of New World Wrestling, a small promotion based in southeastern Massachusetts, which was formerly associated with NWA New England from 2004 to 2005.
He is best remembered as Trooper Gilmore, a popular super heavyweight "fan favorite", in both the original Century Wrestling Alliance and NWA New England where he was a main rival of "heel" wrestler Tony Rumble. He also won the NWA New England Tag Team Championship with The Outpatient as Criminally Insane and Corporal Robinson as 5-0. He was an ally of MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas during their feud with Ox Baker's MWF stable Ox's Army and, in NWW, twice won the promotion's tag team titles with Jimmy "Jact" Cash and Brutus "the Barber" Beefcake. He has also been a frequent opponent of King Kong Bundy and Abdullah the Butcher when touring the Northeastern United States.

==Career==

===Century Wrestling Alliance (1996-1998)===

James E. Allen made his debut in 1994 and spent a brief time on the local independent circuit prior to joining the Century Wrestling Alliance in 1996.

===NWA New England (1998-2001)===

Allen remained with the promotion as it joined the National Wrestling Alliance as NWA New England in 1998. He would, however, make appearances for the Universal Wrestling Alliance and Unified Championship Wrestling during the late-1990s. On June 7, 1998, he and Joel Davis lost to "Big" Val Puccio in a handicap match at the Devine Ice Arena in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

His match against Rumble at Southbridge High School on March 13 was included when the promotion was featured on ESPN's Outside the Lines.

In early-2001, Allen was awarded NWA New England Television Championship by his then manager and former champion Bull Montana on NWA New England Spotlight. He lost the title to Beau Douglas who beat him in a televised match in May 2001. Allen then formed a tag team with former rival The Outpatient, calling themselves Criminally Insane, and defeated Zak Mason & Chris Charisma for the vacant NWA New England Tag Team Championship at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Wakefield, Massachusetts on July 21, 2001. This was during the promotion's Summer Sizzler Tour. He also appeared at a weekend event at Killer Kowalski's Institute of Professional Wrestling on August 10. Among those present included Frankie Kazarian, Jason Rumble, Vinnie Capelli, John Rodeo and The Ark Angels (Damon D'Arcangelo and Phoenix King).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.johnrodeo.com/archives/archive.html |title=Sunday, September 23, 2001 |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=Rodeo, John |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2001-09-23 |work=The Hollywood Grapevine Archive |publisher=JohnRodeo.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] He and The Outpatient would hold the titles for over three months before dropping the belts to Trailer Park Trash ("Dirty" Deuce Malone and "The Scrub" Steve Sabo) in Woburn, Massachusetts on October 27, 2001.

===Independent circuit and New World Wrestling (2002-2004)===

Allen branched out to other parts of the country during the first half of 2002, mostly in other National Wrestling Alliance-affiliated promotions in the Eastern United States and in Florida. In February 2002, he entered the Best of the Best Tournament, co-promoted by NWA East and NWA Tri-State, but was eliminated by Nikita Allanov in the opening rounds in Titusville, Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/14314/411-Monday-Indy-Update:-Zbyszko,-Big-Vito,-Chetti.htm |title=411 Monday Indy Update: Zbyszko, Big Vito, Chetti |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=Nason, Josh |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2002-02-04 |work= |publisher=411mania.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] He also made two appearances at the City Park Pavilion in Parkersburg, West Virginia wrestling NWA Tri-State's Dash Bennett on February 2 and Mr. Attitude on April 6, the latter match resulting in a double-countout.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nwawvohio.tripod.com/results2002.htm |title=2002 Results |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=NWA Ohio |authorlink=NWA Ohio |coauthors= |date= April 2002 |work=NWA Tri-State Results 2002 |publisher=NWAwvohio.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/wv2/newnwatristate/4602results.html |title=NWA Tri-State: 4/6/02 Results |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=NWA Tri-State |authorlink=NWA Tri-State |coauthors= |date= April 2002 |work=Welcome To The Official Site Of NWA Tri-State |publisher=NWATriState.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] He also made a one-time appearance for Jason Knight's Assault Championship Wrestling facing Jason Rage on September 17 edition of Assault TV: The Dot Com Edition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tctapes.net/asstv02.htm |title=09/17/2002 Assault TV: The Dot Com Edition |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |work=Assault Championship Wrestling Television 2002 |publisher=TCTapes.net |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
In the spring of 2003, he made several appearances for Ultimate Championship Wrestling. On March 2, he was pinned by UCW Television Champion "Nature Boy" Gary Gold in a triple threat match with "Iceberg" Sonny D. at Club Escapades in Raynham, Massachusetts. Three weeks later at a local high school in Canton, Massachusetts, Allen joined La Familia members Tony Cianci and Vinny Giuliani in a 6-man tag team match against Paco Rivera, D.C. Dillon and "Diehard" Eddie Edwards which ended in a double-disqualification. One of his last appearance was at the Family Center in Braintree, Massachusetts in which he and Apocalypse lost to UCW Tag Team Champions Beau Douglas & Todd Hansen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metrocast.net/~jjakan/results-march03.html |title=Results: March, 2003 |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= March 2003 |work=The New England Independent |publisher=Metrocast.net |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Before leaving the promotion, he lost to UCW Heavyweight Champion Don Vega in a triple threat match with the Outpatient on April 23.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ucwentertainment.tripod.com/id5.html |title=U.C.W.

In late-2003, Allen formed his own promotion, New World Wrestling,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/25480 |title=Indy Contact Sheet |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=Morgan, Adam |authorlink= |coauthors=Stein, Nate |date=2005-10-13 |format= |work= |publisher=411mania.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] and appeared at its first show held on December 6, 2003. Shortly afterwards, Allen dropped his former in-ring persona of Trooper Gilmore to return "to his Italian roots" and began wrestling under the name "Big" Paulie Gilmore (or Gilmorea). He soon formed a tag team with Jimmy "Jact" Cash known as Men of Business and, on July 25, 2004, lost to The Millennium Killaz (Gino Martino and Ali Mohammed) in a match to crown the first NWW Tag Team Champions. The titles were vacated later that year when Ali Mohammed suffered a near-career ending injury, a cracked tibiae and torn ligaments, during a match with Allen for Ultimate Championship Wrestling in Attleboro, Massachusetts.
Returning to NWA New England for the 2004 Tony Rumble Memorial Show in Sanford, Maine, he and Mark Moment lost to The Rough Ryders (Nixx and Raines) in a triple threat match with The Elite (Sonny Roselli and Larry Huntley) for the NWA New England Tag Team titles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://larryhuntley.tripod.com/results.html |title=Results |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=Huntley, Larry |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=LarryHuntley.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] The following night in Bellingham, Massachusetts, Allen won the vacant NWW Tag Team Championship in a match against The Widowmaker & “Dangerous” Donny Rotten. Anthony "Spaz" Parziale, an on-air radio personality for WAAF, was the cornerman for Men of Business. They lost the titles to Southern Extreme (Widowmaker and The Texas Outlaw) in Attleboro on August 20, 2005. That same night, Allen became the first NWW SuperCrush Battle Royal Champion and held the title until it was won by Pierre Vachon almost two years later.

===Millennium Wrestling Federation and NWA New England (2005-2006)===

In 2005, Allen debuted in the Millennium Wrestling Federation with manager Bull Montana and allied himself with MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in their feud with Ox Baker's stable Ox Baker's Army (The Outpatient, Pierre "The Beast" Vachon & The Islanders). He also soon found himself subject to a kayfabe vendetta by MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson who would force him to wrestle increasing difficult opponents and stipulations. At the Road to the Gold supercard, Allen lost to The Outpatient and, the following month at Halloween Horror, had to wrestle The Islanders in handicap match.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mwfprowrestling.com/mwfnewsline20051013-1022preview.html |title=MWF Halloween Horror - October 22 Preview |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author=Millennium Wrestling Federation |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-10-13 |work=MWF Newsline |publisher=MWFProWrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Allen joined Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in an 8-man tag team match with The Sandman to defeat Ox Baker's Army at the Soul Survivor III supercard in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 5, 2005.

===New World Wrestling (2007-)===

After nearly two years, the NWW SuperCrush Battle Royal Championship was won by Pierre Vachon in Sandwich, Massachusetts on March 31, 2007. On March 11, 2008, he was interviewed on the internet radio show In Your Head in which he discussed his career and promoted New World Wrestling's upcoming tour of Cape Cod. On March 29, Allen defeated Brickhouse Baker at the Plymouth Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/newswire/1512-new-world-wrestling-results-from-329-in-plymouth-ma.pdf |title=New World Wrestling results from 3/29 in Plymouth, MA |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |format= |work=Newswire |publisher=IndyWrestlingNews.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] On April 5, in East Sandwich, Massachusetts, Allen and New World Wrestling participated in a benefit show for the Sandwich High School wrestling team The Blue Knights. During the event, Allen accepted an open challenge put out by then NWW Tag Team Champions Moondog Maximus & Professor Sushi. Sushi had substituted for regular tag team partner Tony Kahuko. He later revealed his partner as former World Wrestling Federation superstar Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake and together went on to win the tag team titles that night.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/results/22-2008/1639-new-world-wrestling-april-5-2008-east-sandwich-ma.pdf |title=New World Wrestling - April 5, 2008 - East Sandwich, MA |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |format= |work=Newswire |publisher=IndyWrestlingNews.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/newswire/1638-new-world-wrestling-results-from-45-in-east-sandwich-ma-with-brutus-beefcake-and-johny-fabulous.html |title=New World Wrestling results from 4/5 in East Sandwich, MA with Brutus Beefcake and Johny Fabulous |accessdate=16 October 2009 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-04-06 |work=Newswire |publisher=IndyWrestlingNews.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Allen and Beefcake were stripped of the titles following the event.
