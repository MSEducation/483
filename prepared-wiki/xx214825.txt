He led numerous actions against publicly traded companies for false financial reporting and disclosure known as "cooking the books."  Most notable of these was the action against California's Financial Corp. of America.  After an investigation by Perry and the SEC, the company was forced to re-report second-quarter profits in 1984 to show a $107.5 million loss instead of a $31.1 million profit.  This case is credited with being the first indication of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.Time Magazine, September 23, 1984
He became a recognized expert in policing false financial disclosure and articles written by him such as "Policing Financial Disclosure Fraud: The SEC's Top Priority" are still referenced and used in college accounting text books such as "Accounting Theory" (ISBN 0471189081   LCC: HF5625) edited by Richard G. Schroeder and Myrtle W. Clark and published by John Wiley & Sons.ISBNdb.com, Accounting Theory
