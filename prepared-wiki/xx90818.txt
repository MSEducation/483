Richard Courant (January 8, 1888 – January 27, 1972) was a German mathematician. He is best known by the general public for the book What is Mathematics?, co-written with Herbert Robbins, which was praised by Albert Einstein:
 "A lucid representation of the fundamental concepts and methods of the whole field of mathematics...Easily understandable." 

==Career==

Courant was born in Lublinitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia. During his youth his parents moved often, including to Glatz, then to Breslau and in 1905 to Berlin. He stayed in Breslau and entered the university there, then continued his studies at the University of Zürich and the University of Göttingen. He became David Hilbert's assistant in Göttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in World War I but was wounded shortly after enlisting and dismissed from the military. He continued his research in Göttingen and then engaged a two-year period at the University of Münster as professor of mathematics. There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933.
Courant left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish émigrés. While he was classified by the Nazis as a Jew, his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him from losing his position for this particular reason at the time; however his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~schappa/GoeNS.pdf
In 1936, after one year at Cambridge Courant accepted a professorship at New York University in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in applied mathematics. The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.
Courant and David Hilbert authored the influential textbook Methods of Mathematical Physics which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With Herbert Robbins he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled What is Mathematics?.
Courant's name is also attached to the finite element method,[tpl]cite web|title=The finite-element method, Part I: R. L. Courant: Historical Corner|author=Giuseppe Pelosi|year=2007|doi=10.1109/MAP.2007.376627[/tpl] with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943.
This method is now one of the ways to solve partial differential equations numerically. Courant is a namesake of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition and the Courant minimax principle.
Courant died in New Rochelle, New York.NY Times Obituary "Dr. Richard Courant Dies at 84; Influential Mathematics Scholar; Organizer and Ex. Direcgor of Institute at N.Y.U. Aided Research and Teaching"

==Perspective on mathematics==

Commenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant believed that the existence of a physical solution does not obviate the need for mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:

==Personal life==

In 1919 Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge, the daughter of the Göttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, Carl Runge.
Richard and Nerina had four children: Ernest, a particle physicist and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (*1922), a PhD biologist and wife of the mathematician Jürgen Moser (1928–1999); Hans, a physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project; and Leonore, a professional musician and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928–1998).[tpl]cite journal|date=November 2008| author=Edwin Rosenberg|url= http://www.maa.org/pubs/nov08web.pdf|publisher=MAA|pages=16–18| journal=MAA Focus[/tpl]
