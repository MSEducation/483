International Women's Day (IWD), also called International Working Women's Day, is celebrated on March 8 every year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day – History | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=2013-02-21[/tpl] In different regions the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women to a celebration for women's economic, political, and social achievements. Started as a Socialist political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries, primarily in Europe, including Russia. In some regions, the day lost its political flavor, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love for women in a way somewhat similar to a mixture of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. In other regions, however, the political and human rights theme designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. This is a day which some people celebrate by wearing purple ribbons. 

==History==

The earliest Women’s Day observances were held on many different dates: May 3, 1908, in Chicago; February 28th, 1909, in New York; and
February 27, 1910, in New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2008/history.shtml |title=United Nations page on the background of the IWD |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://takebackhalloween.org/today-is-international-womens-day/ |title=Today is International Women’s Day |publisher=Take Back Halloween! |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl]
In August 1910, an International Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist Luise Zietz proposed the establishment of an annual 'International Woman's Day' (singular) and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader Clara Zetkin, although no date was specified at that conference.Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)[tpl]cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= May 26, 2012[/tpl] Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including suffrage, for women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/about.asp |title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1918 |accessdate=2013-03-08[/tpl] The following year, on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations. In Vienna, women paraded on the Ringstrasse and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the Paris Commune. Women demanded that women be given the right to vote and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination. Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.
In 1913 Russian women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Sunday in February (by Julian calendar then used in Russia).
Although there were some women-led strikes, marches, and other protests in the years leading up to 1914, none of them happened on March 8. In 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March - International woman’s day: in search of the lost memory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archivedate=2011-03-13|deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-03-14[/tpl] The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl]
In 1917 demonstrations marking International Women's Day in Saint Petersburg on the last Sunday in February (which fell on March 8 on the Gregorian calendar) initiated the February Revolution. Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for “Bread and Peace" - demanding the end of World War I and an end to Russian food shortages. Leon Trotsky wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman’s Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this ‘Women’s Day’ would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets." 
Following the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai and Vladimir Lenin made it an official holiday in the Soviet Union, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965. On May 8th, 1965 by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."
From its official adoption in Russia following the Soviet Revolution in 1917 the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist and socialist countries. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922, and by Spanish communists from 1936.[tpl]cite web|last=Nelson|first=Jinty|title=International Women's Day: a centenary to celebrate|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/international-womens-day-a-centenary-to-celebrate/|publisher=History Workshop Online|accessdate=August 28, 2011[/tpl] After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the state council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.[tpl]cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|work=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=August 28, 2011[/tpl]
In the West, International Women's Day was first observed as a popular event after 1977 when the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the UN Day for women's rights and world peace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/ |title=WomenWatch: International Women's Day |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]
In the 1980s historian Renée Coté uncovered the origins of the March 8th date for International Women's Day. Her research was published in 1984 in Canada, as, La Journée internationale des femmes ou les vrais dates des mystérieuses origines du 8 de mars jusqu'ici embrouillés, truquées, oubliées : la clef des énigmes.

"The women - some in headscarves and flowing robes, others in jeans - had marched to Cairo's central Tahrir Square to celebrate International Women's Day.

On the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the ICRC called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.Helping women take matters into their own hands International Committee of the Red Cross
