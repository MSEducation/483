CATEGORIES: Former local government areas of Victoria (Australia)

The Shire of Dimboola was a local government area in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. The shire covered an area of [tpl]convert|4856|km2|sqmi|1[/tpl], and existed from 1885 until 1995.

==History==

Dimboola was originally part of the Shire of Wimmera which was first incorporated in 1862. It became part of Shire of Lowan when it separately incorporated on 31 December 1875, and on 2 April 1885 Dimboola was established as a shire in its own right.
Being in a fairly remote region, for its first 30 years, Dimboola's boundaries were fairly flexible and adjusted frequently. 
On 14 December 1932, Dimboola gained part of the West Riding of Karkarooc.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=654â€“656[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
