CATEGORIES: Antineoplastic drugs, Oncology, Cancer treatments, Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic anti-neoplastic drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with other cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy, surgery, and/or hyperthermia therapy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents also have a role in the treatment of other conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma.
Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. This means that chemotherapy also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract, and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells, hence also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss).
Some newer anticancer drugs (for example, various monoclonal antibodies) are not indiscriminately cytotoxic, but rather target proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells and that are essential for their growth. Such treatments are often referred to as targeted therapy (as distinct from classic chemotherapy) and are often used alongside traditional chemotherapeutic agents in antineoplastic treatment regimens.
Chemotherapy may use one drug at a time (single-agent chemotherapy) or several drugs at once (combination chemotherapy or polychemotherapy). The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy using drugs that convert to cytotoxic activity only upon light exposure is called photochemotherapy or photodynamic therapy.
An older and broader use of the word chemotherapy encompassed any chemical treatment of disease, inhibiting cells, whether they be cancerous self cells or foreign cells such as bacteria. This sense of the term was sometimes termed antimicrobial chemotherapy, including treatment of infections with antimicrobial agents. However, this use has become archaic.

==History==

The first use of drugs to treat cancer was in the early 20th century, although it was not originally intended for that purpose. Mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of hematopoiesis (blood production).[tpl]cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=Role of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning |journal=JAMA |volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 |doi=10.1001/jama.1919.26110010018009f [/tpl] A similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during World War II at Yale University.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gilman A |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard|journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=105 |pages=574–8 |date=May 1963 |pmid=13947966 |doi=10.1016/0002-9610(63)90232-0|issue=5 [/tpl] It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of certain white blood cells) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable.[tpl]cite journal | author =Goodman LS, Wintrobe MM, Dameshek W, Goodman MJ, Gilman A, McLennan MT. | title = Nitrogen mustard therapy | journal =  JAMA| volume = 132 | issue = 3 |pages = 126–132 | year = 1946 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1946.02870380008004 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author =Goodman LS, Wintrobe MM, Dameshek W, Goodman MJ, Gilman A, McLennan MT. | title = Landmark article Sept. 21, 1946: Nitrogen mustard therapy.

The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts.Faguet, p. 71 After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was mustine. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.[tpl]cite journal | author =Joensuu H. | title = Systemic chemotherapy for cancer: from weapon to treatment| journal =  Lancet Oncol.| volume = 9| issue = 3 | page = 304 | year = 2008| pmid=18308256 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70075-5[/tpl]

===The term chemotherapy===

Chemotherapy is described in one dictionary entry as "the treatment of disease by the use of chemical substances, especially the treatment of cancer by cytotoxic and other drugs." The word "chemotherapy" without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning is broader. The term was historically used for non-oncological references, such as the use of antibiotics (antibacterial chemotherapy). The first modern chemotherapeutic agent was arsphenamine, an arsenic compound discovered in 1909 and used to treat syphilis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nichols HJ, Walker JE|title=Experimental observations on the prophyaxis and treatment of syphilis |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=37 |issue=4|pages=525–42 |date=March 1923 |pmid=19868743 |pmc=2128372 |doi=10.1084/jem.37.4.525[/tpl] This was later followed by sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) and penicillin. Other uses that have been termed chemotherapy are the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ben-Ari ET |title=Dual purpose: some cancer therapies used to treat autoimmune diseases |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=96 |issue=8 |pages=577–9 |date=April 2004  |pmid=15100330 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/96.8.577|url=[/tpl]

==General mode of action in cancer==

Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells coupled with malignant behaviour: invasion and metastasis (among other features).[tpl]cite journal |author=Hanahan D, Weinberg RA |title=The hallmarks of cancer|journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647931 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9|url=[/tpl] It is caused by the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hodgson S |title=Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility |journal=J Zhejiang Univ Sci B |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–4|date=January 2008 |pmid=18196605 |pmc=2170461 |doi=10.1631/jzus.B073001 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Perera FP |title=Environment and cancer: who are susceptible? |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5340 |pages=1068–73 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9353182 |doi= 10.1126/science.278.5340.1068|url=|bibcode=1997Sci...278.1068P[/tpl] These factors lead to accumulations of genetic mutations in oncogenes (genes that promote cancer) and tumor supressor genes (genes that help to prevent cancer), which gives cancer cells their malignant characteristics, such as uncontrolled growth.Randall, pp, 93-94
In the broad sense, most chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing mitosis (cell division), effectively targeting fast-dividing cells. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed cytotoxic. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kehe K, Balszuweit F, Steinritz D, Thiermann H |title=Molecular toxicology of sulfur mustard-induced cutaneous inflammation and blistering |journal=Toxicology |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=12–9 |date=September 2009|pmid=19651324 |doi=10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.019 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Malhotra V, Perry MC |title=Classical chemotherapy: mechanisms, toxicities and the therapeutic window |journal=Cancer Biol. Ther. |volume=2 |issue=4 Suppl 1 |pages=S2–4|year=2003 |pmid=14508075 |doi= |url=[/tpl] One theory as to why these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as apoptosis.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Makin G |author2=Hickman JA |title=Apoptosis and cancer chemotherapy|journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=301 |issue=1 |pages=143–52 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10928287 |doi= 10.1007/s004419900160|url= |bibcode=1994RSPTB.345..319H[/tpl]
As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high growth rates (such as acute myelogenous leukemia and the aggressive lymphomas, including Hodgkin's disease) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing cell division at any time.  Malignancies with slower growth rates, such as indolent lymphomas, tend to respond to chemotherapy much more modestly.[tpl]cite journal|last=Corrie PG|title=Cytotoxic chemotherapy: clinical aspects|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=24–28|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.012|first1=Pippa G.[/tpl] Heterogeneic tumours may also display varying sensitivities to chemotherapy agents, depending on the subclonal populations within the tumor.

==Types==

===Alkylating agents===

Alkylating agents are the oldest group of chemotherapeutics in use today. Originally derived from mustard gas used in the war, there are now many types of alkylating agents in use. They are so named because of their ability to alkylate many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. This ability to bind covalently to DNA via their alkyl group is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lind M.J.|title=Principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.003|first1=M.J.[/tpl] DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during cell division, or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis.[tpl]cite book|last=Siddik ZH|title=Mechanisms of Action of Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents: DNA-Interactive Alkylating Agents and Antitumour Platinum-Based Drugs|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1002/0470025077.chap84b[/tpl] Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.
The subtypes of alkylating agents are the nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines,  aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Damia G, D'Incalci M |title=Mechanisms of resistance to alkylating agents |journal=Cytotechnology |volume=27 |issue=1–3 |pages=165–73 |date=September 1998 |pmid=19002790 |pmc=3449574 |doi=10.1023/A:1008060720608 |url=[/tpl] They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules.Takimoto CH, Calvo E."Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11 ed. 2008. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.

===Anti-metabolites===

Anti-metabolites are a group of molecules that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleobases are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups.[tpl]cite journal |author=Parker WB |title=Enzymology of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in the treatment of cancer |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=109 |issue=7 |pages=2880–93 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19476376 |pmc=2827868 |doi=10.1021/cr900028p |url=[/tpl] These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorperation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case S-phase (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines.
The anti-folates include methotrexate and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These are required for thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.Wood, p. 11 Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase.[tpl]cite journal |author=Adjei AA |title=Pemetrexed (ALIMTA), a novel multitargeted antineoplastic agent |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=10 |issue=12 Pt 2 |pages=4276s–4280s |date=June 2004 |pmid=15217974 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-040010 |url=[/tpl] The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wagstaff AJ, Ibbotson T, Goa KL |title=Capecitabine: a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the management of advanced breast cancer |journal=Drugs |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=217–36 |year=2003 |pmid=12515569 |doi= 10.2165/00003495-200363020-00009|url=[/tpl] The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, Vidaza, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.

===Anti-microtubule agents===

Anti-microtubule agents are plant-derived chemicals that block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules are an important cellular structure composed of two proteins; α-tubulin and β-tubulin. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rowinsky EK, Donehower RC |title=The clinical pharmacology and use of antimicrotubule agents in cancer chemotherapeutics |journal=Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=35–84 |date=October 1991 |pmid=1687171 |doi= 10.1016/0163-7258(91)90086-2|url=[/tpl] Microtubules are dynamic structures, which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. Vinca alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule disfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yue QX, Liu X, Guo DA |title=Microtubule-binding natural products for cancer therapy |journal=Planta Med. |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=1037–43 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20577942 |doi=10.1055/s-0030-1250073 |url=[/tpl]
Vinca alkaloids are derived from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are completely natural chemicals that include vincristine and vinblastine. Following the success of these drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: vinorelbine, vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in S-phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.
Taxanes are natural and semi-synthetic drugs. The first drug of their class, paclitaxel, was originally extracted from the Pacific Yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.  Now this drug and another in this class, docetaxel, are produced semi-synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another Yew tree; Taxus baccata. These drugs promote microtubule stability, preventing their disassembly. Paclitaxel prevents the cell cycle at the boundary of G2-M, whereas docetaxel exerts its effect during S-phase. Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water.
Podophyllotoxin is an anti-neoplastic lignan obtained primarily from the American Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum or Podophyllum emodi). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism is similar to that of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: etoposide and teniposide.[tpl]cite journal |author=Damayanthi Y, Lown JW |title=Podophyllotoxins: current status and recent developments |journal=Curr.

===Topoisomerase inhibitors===

Topoisomerase inhibitors are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or transcription, for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening the middle of a twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during replication or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.[tpl]cite book|last=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.|title=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, irinotecan and topotecan, are semi-synthetically derived from camptothecin, which is obtained from the Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II can be divided into two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nitiss JL |title=Targeting DNA topoisomerase II in cancer chemotherapy |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=338–50 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19377506 |pmc=2748742 |doi=10.1038/nrc2607 |url=[/tpl]

===Cytotoxic antibiotics===

The cytotoxic antibiotics are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action. The group includes the anthracyclines and other drugs including actinomycin, bleomycin, plicamycin, and mitomycin. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin were the first two anthracyclines, and were obtained from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. Derivatives of these compounds include epirubicin and idarubicin. Other clinically used drugs in the anthracyline group are pirarubicin, aclarubicin, and mitoxantrone. The mechanisms of anthracyclines include DNA intercalation (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive free radicals that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.[tpl]cite journal |author=Minotti G, Menna P, Salvatorelli E, Cairo G, Gianni L |title=Anthracyclines: molecular advances and pharmacologic developments in antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity |journal=Pharmacol.

==Treatment strategies==

There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms.
All chemotherapy regimens require that the patient be capable of undergoing the treatment. Performance status is often used as a measure to determine whether a patient can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment (fractional kill), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.[tpl]cite book |last1=Skeel |first1= R. T. |year=2003 |title= Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy (paperback) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |edition=6th |isbn=0-7817-3629-3[/tpl] Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient.[tpl]cite book |last1=Chabner|first1= B. |last2= Longo | first2=D. L.  |year=2005 | edition=4th |title= Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice|location= Philadelphia |publisher= Lippincott Willians & Wilkins |isbn= 0-7817-5628-6[/tpl]

==Dosage==

Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects) will be intolerable to the patient. The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram, using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans.[tpl]cite journal|author1=Du Bois D|author2=Du Bois EF|title=A formula to estimate the approximate surface area if height and weight be known. 1916.|publisher=Archives Internal Medicine|volume=5|issue=5|pages=303–11[/tpl] The study only included 9 human subjects.[tpl]cite journal|author1=Felici A.|author2=J.

Sparreboom|title=Dosing strategies for anticancer drugs: the good, the bad and body-surface area|publisher=Eur J Cancer|year=2002|volume=38|issue=13|pages=1677–84[/tpl] When chemotherapy was introduced in the 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing for lack of a better option.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kaestner SA, Sewell GJ |title=Chemotherapy dosing part I: scientific basis for current practice and use of body surface area |journal=Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=23–37 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17305252 |doi= 10.1016/j.clon.2006.10.010|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The Use of Body Surface Area as a Criterion of Drug Dosage in Cancer Chemotherapy|author=Donald Pinkel|publisher=Cancer Res|date=August 1958|volume=18|issue=7|pages=853–6[/tpl]
Recently, the validity of this method in calculating uniform doses has been questioned. The reason for this is that the formula only takes into account the individual's weight and height. Drug absorption and clearance are influenced by multiple factors, including age, gender, metabolism, disease state, organ function, drug-to-drug interactions, genetics, and obesity, which has a major impact on the actual concentration of the drug in the patient's bloodstream.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gurney H |title=How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy |journal=Br.

This variability is typical with many chemotherapy drugs dosed by BSA, and, as shown below, was demonstrated in a study of 14 common chemotherapy drugs.
The result of this pharmacokinetic variability among patients is that many patients do not receive the right dose to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness with minimized toxic side effects. Some patients are overdosed while others are underdosed.[tpl]cite journal|author1=Gamelin EC|author2=Delva R|author3=Jacob J|author4=Merrouche Y|author5=Raoul JL|author6=Pezet D|author7=Dorval E|author8=Piot G|author9=Morel A|author10=Boisdron-Celle M|title= Individual fluorouracil dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetic follow-up compared with conventional dosage: Results of a multicenter randomized trial of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer|publisher=J Clin Oncol|year=2008|volume=26|issue=13|pages=2099–2105[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author1=Saam J|author2=Critchfield GC|author3=Hamilton SA|author4=Roa BB|author5=Wenstrup RJ|author6=Kaldate RR|title=Body Surface Area-based Dosing of 5-Fluorouracil Results in Extensive Interindividual Variability in 5-Fluorouracil Exposure in Colorectal Cancer Patients on FOLFOX Regimens|publisher=Clin Colorectal Cancer|year=2011|volume=10|issue=3|pages=203–206[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author1=Capitain O|author2=Asevoaia A|author3=Boisdron-Celle M|author4=Poirier AL|author5=Morel A|author6=Gamelin E|title=Individual Fluorouracil Dose Adjustment in FOLFOX Based on Pharmacokinetic Follow-Up Compared With Conventional Body-Area-Surface Dosing: A Phase II, Proof-of-Concept Study|publisher=Clin Colorectal Cancer|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=263–267[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author1=Kaldate RR|author2=Haregewoin A|author3=Grier CE|author4=Hamilton SA|author5=McLeod HL|title=Modeling the 5-fluorouracil area under the curve versus dose relationship to develop a pharmacokinetic dosing algorithm for colorectal cancer patients receiving FOLFOX6|publisher=Oncologist, 2012|volume=17|issue=3|pages=296–302[/tpl] For example, in a randomized clinical trial, investigators found 85% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) did not receive the optimal therapeutic dose when dosed by the BSA standard—68% were underdosed and 17% were overdosed.
There has been recent controversy over the use of BSA to calculate chemotherapy doses for obese patients.[tpl]cite journal|author1=Hunter RJ|author2=Navo MA|author3=Thaker PH|author4=Bodurka DC|author5=Wolf JK|author6=Smith JA|title=Dosing chemotherapy in obese patients: actual versus assigned body surface area (BSA)|publisher=Cancer Treat Rev|year=February 2009|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–78|pmid=18922643[/tpl] Because of their higher BSA, clinicians often arbitrarily reduce the dose prescribed by the BSA formula for fear of overdosing. In many cases, this can result in sub-optimal treatment.
Several clinical studies have demonstrated that when chemotherapy dosing is individualized to achieve optimal systemic drug exposure, treatment outcomes are improved and toxic side effects are reduced. In the 5-FU clinical study cited above, patients whose dose was adjusted to achieve a pre-determined target exposure realized an 84% improvement in treatment response rate and a six month improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with those dosed by BSA.
In the same study, investigators compared the incidence of common 5-FU-associated grade 3/4 toxicities between the dose-adjusted patients and the BSA-dosed patients. The incidence of debilitating grades of diarrhea was reduced from 18% in the BSA-dosed group to 4% in the dose-adjusted group of patients and serious hematologic side effects were eliminated.  Because of the reduced toxicity, dose-adjusted patients were able to be treated for longer periods of time. BSA-dosed patients were treated for a total of 680 months while dose-adjusted patients were treated for a total of 791 months. Completing the course of treatment is an important factor in achieving better treatment outcomes.  
Similar results were found in a study involving colorectal cancer patients treated with the popular FOLFOX regimen. The incidence of serious diarrhea was reduced from 12% in the BSA-dosed group of patients to 1.7% in the dose-adjusted group, and the incidence of severe mucositis was reduced from 15% to 0.8%.
The FOLFOX study also demonstrated an improvement in treatment outcomes. Positive response increased from 46% in the BSA-dosed patients to 70% in the dose-adjusted group.  Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) both improved by six months in the dose adjusted group.
One approach that can help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing is to measure the drug levels in blood plasma over time and adjust dose according to a formula or algorithm to achieve optimal exposure. With an established target exposure for optimized treatment effectiveness with minimized toxicities, dosing can be personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results for each patient.  Such an algorithm was used in the clinical trials cited above and resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes.
Oncologists are already individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure.

==Delivery==

Most chemotherapy is delivered intravenously, although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., melphalan, busulfan, capecitabine).
There are many intravenous methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the winged infusion device, peripheral cannula, midline catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), central venous catheter and implantable port. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent.[tpl]cite book |author=Wood, Miriam; David Brighton|title=The Royal Marsden Hospital handbook of cancer chemotherapy: a guide for the multidisciplinary team |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005|pages=93–94 |isbn=0-443-07101-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
Depending on the patient, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access.Wood, pp. 113-118 Commonly used systems are the Hickman line, the Port-a-Cath, and the PICC line. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to phlebitis or extravasation, and eliminate the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

Topical chemotherapies, such as 5-fluorouracil, are used to treat some cases of non-melanoma skin cancer.[tpl]cite journal |last=Chitwood |first=K |coauthors=Etzkorn, J; Cohen, G |title=Topical and intralesional treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer: efficacy and cost comparisons |journal=Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery al.|date=September 2013 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1306–16 |pmid=23915332 |doi=10.1111/dsu.12300[/tpl]
If the cancer has central nervous system involvement, or with meningeal disease, intrathecal chemotherapy may be administered.

==Adverse effects==

Chemotherapeutic techniques have a range of side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the fast-dividing cells of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Chemotherapy related toxicities can occur acutely after administration, within hours or days, or chronically, from weeks to years.Airley, p. 265

===Immunosuppression and myelosuppression===

Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the immune system, often by paralysing the bone marrow and leading to a decrease of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
Anemia and thrombocytopenia, when they occur, are improved with blood transfusion. Neutropenia (a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0.5 x 109/litre) can be improved with synthetic G-CSF (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., filgrastim, lenograstim).
In very severe myelosuppression, which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning allogenic or autologous bone marrow cell transplants are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in allogenic BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.
Although patients are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own gastrointestinal tract (including oral cavity) and skin.Huang, p. 130 This may manifest as systemic infections, such as sepsis, or as localized outbreaks, such as Herpes simplex, shingles, or other members of the Herpesviridea.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Elad S |author2=Zadik Y |author3=Hewson I |author4=Hovan A |author5=Correa ME |author6=Logan R |author7=Elting LS |author8=Spijkervet FK |author9=Brennan MT |author10=Viral Infections Section |author11=Oral Care Study Group |author12=Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)/International Society of Oral Oncology (ISOO) |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3[/tpl] Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.
In Japan, the government has approved the use of some medicinal mushrooms like Trametes versicolor, to counteract depression of the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Coriolous_Versicolor.asp |title=Coriolus Versicolor |publisher=Cancer.org|date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=7 August 2012[/tpl]

===Typhlitis===

Due to immune system suppression, typhlitis is a "life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy."PMID 16319675 Typhlitis is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a distended abdomen, fever, chills, or abdominal pain and tenderness.
Typhlitis is a medical emergency. It has a very poor prognosis and is often fatal unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated.[tpl]cite journal|last=Keidan|first=RD|coauthors=Fanning, Gatenby, Weese|title=Recurrent typhlitis. A disease resulting from aggressive chemotherapy|journal=Dis Colon Rectum|date=Mar 1989|volume=32|pages=206–9|pmid=2920627|doi=10.1007/BF02554529|issue=3[/tpl] Successful treatment hinges on early diagnosis provided by a high index of suspicion and the use of CT scanning, nonoperative treatment for uncomplicated cases, and sometimes elective right hemicolectomy to prevent recurrence.

===Gastrointestinal distress===

Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and constipation are common side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gibson RJ, Keefe DM |title=Cancer chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and constipation: mechanisms of damage and prevention strategies |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=890–900 |date=September 2006 |pmid= 16604351|doi=10.1007/s00520-006-0040-y |url=[/tpl] Malnutrition and dehydration can result when the patient does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.

===Anemia===

Anemia in cancer patients can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and possible cancer-related causes such as bleeding, blood cell destruction (hemolysis), hereditary disease, kidney disfunction, nutritional 
deficiencies and/or anemia of chronic disease. Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production (erythropoietin), iron supplements, and blood transfusions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Groopman JE, Itri LM |title=Chemotherapy-induced anemia in adults: incidence and treatment |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=91 |issue=19|pages=1616–34 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10511589 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/91.19.1616|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Henry DH|title=The role of intravenous iron in cancer-related anemia |journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.) |volume=20 |issue=8 Suppl 6|pages=21–4 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16925107 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rodgers GM, Becker PS, Bennett CL, et al. |title=Cancer- and chemotherapy-induced anemia |journal=J Natl Compr Canc Netw |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=536–64 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18597709 |doi= |url=[/tpl] Myelosuppressive therapy can cause a tendency to bleed easily, leading to anemia. Medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells can reduce the number of platelets in the blood, which can result in bruises and bleeding. Extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through platelet transfusions and new drugs to increase platelet counts during chemotherapy are being developed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vadhan-Raj S |title=Management of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia: current status of thrombopoietic agents |journal=Semin.

===Fatigue===

Fatigue may be a consequence of the cancer or its treatment, and can last for months to years after treatment. One physiological cause of fatigue is anemia, which can be caused by chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, primary and metastatic disease and/or nutritional depletion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Berger AM, Abernethy AP, Atkinson A, et al. |title=Cancer-related fatigue |journal=J Natl Compr Canc Netw |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=904–31 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20870636 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Franklin DJ, Packel L |title=Cancer-related fatigue |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=87 |issue=3 Suppl 1 |pages=S91–3; quiz S94–5 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16500197 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2005.12.015 |url=[/tpl] Anaerobic exercise has been found to be beneficial in reducing fatigue in people with solid tumours.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cramp F, Byron-Daniel J |title=Exercise for the management of cancer-related fatigue in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=11 |issue= |pages=CD006145 |year=2012 |pmid=23152233 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006145.pub3 |url= |editor1-last=Cramp |editor1-first=Fiona[/tpl]

===Nausea and vomiting===

Nausea and vomiting are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side-effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments.[ref]
