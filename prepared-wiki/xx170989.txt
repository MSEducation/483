[[RNase R]]

CATEGORIES: Ribonucleases

RNase R is an 3'-5' exoribonuclease closely related to RNase II, which has been shown to be involved in mRNA degradation in bacteria.  RNase R has homologues in many other organisms. When a part of another larger protein has a domain that is very similar to RNase R, this is called an RNase R domain.
