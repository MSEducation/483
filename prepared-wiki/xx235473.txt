Isabel is a 1968 Canadian film written, directed and produced by Paul Almond.

==Synopsis==

Learning of her mother's serious illness, Isabel (Geneviève Bujold) returns to her family's farm on the Gaspé Peninsula. Her mother dies before she can get there, and when her aged uncle Matthew (Gerard Parkes) asks her to stay on and help him with the farm, she reluctantly agrees. She finds herself haunted by memories of early years (domestic violence, incest and the mysterious deaths of her grandfather, who died in a freak accident, and her father and brother, who both drowned at sea) in a house full of eerie sights and sounds.

==Comment==

Isabel is the first film of Paul Almond's trilogy made with his then-wife Geneviève Bujold, it won four Canadian Film Awards, and was one of the first Canadian films to be picked up for distribution by a major Hollywood studio (Paramount Pictures).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=19&navid=46|title=Isabel|publisher=Film Library Reference|year=2003|accessdate=2009-10-21[/tpl]
