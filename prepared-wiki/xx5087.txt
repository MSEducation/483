Jennifer Lynn Muñiz (née Lopez; born July 24, 1969) is an American actress, dancer, producer, and singer-songwriter. She became interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry following a minor role in the 1986 film My Little Girl, to the dismay of her Puerto Rican parents, who believed that it was an unrealistic career route for a Hispanic. Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color in 1991, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. She received her first leading role in the Selena biopic of the same name in 1997. Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn over $1 million for a role the following year, with the film Out of Sight. She ventured into the music industry in 1999 with her debut studio album, On the 6, joining a select few in successfully converting from a film to a music career.
With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her film The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first person to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, while her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a Spanish album in the United States. With records sales of 80 million and a cumulative film gross of over $2 billion, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, as well as its highest paid Latin entertainer. As of May 2012, she has an estimated net worth of $250 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/famous/galleries/photo/-/13818378/how-they-make-millions/13818390 |title=How They Make Millions – Page 11 – Galleries – Famous Magazine |publisher=Yahoo!

Lopez has used her position as a global icon of pop culture to begin her own empire, consisting of various clothing lines, accessories, fragrances, a production company, television shows and a charitable foundation among other activities. She has established herself as a prominent figure in both the film and music industry, in a career spanning four decades. Lopez's public image and personal relationships have attracted worldwide media attention. Lopez's first high profile relationship was with media mogul Sean Combs, who accompanied her to the 2000 Grammy Awards where she wore the infamous Green Versace dress. She became romantically involved with actor Ben Affleck, while still married to her second husband Cris Judd. Lopez wed long-time friend Marc Anthony in 2004; the couple separated in 2011, after seven years of marriage. Lopez gave birth to their twins, Emme and Maximilian, in February 2008.

==Early life==

Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in the Castle Hill neighborhood of The Bronx, New York City, New York[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209202541/http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archivedate=February 9, 2008|title=Duty Captain's Report|accessdate=October 29, 2006|work=Court TV|publisher=Time Warner|date=January 17, 2001[/tpl] to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez. Her younger sister Lynda is a journalist. She and Lynda have an elder sister named Leslie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terra.com/musica/fotos/mamas_y_mamacitas/64457 |title=Mamás y Mamacitas – Música |publisher=Terra Networks |accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=May 11, 2007[/tpl] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company, before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[tpl]harvnb|Gallick|2003[/tpl] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home; singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay "out of trouble".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/619/The-Triple-Threat-Jennifer-Lopez-is-Born.html |title=The Triple Threat: Jennifer Lopez is Born |publisher=Evan Carmichael |accessdate=March 23, 2012[/tpl] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2004 In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level and was a member of the school's softball team.[tpl]cite book|last=Parish|first=James-Robert|title=Jennifer Lopez: Actor and Singer|page=14|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lh1Y2OK-VdsC&pg=PA129&dq=J-Lo:+The+Secret+Behind+Jennifer+Lopez's+Clib+to+the+Top#v=onepage&q=J-Lo%3A%20The%20Secret%20Behind%20Jennifer%20Lopez's%20Clib%20to%20the%20Top&f=false|isbn=978-0-8160-5832-7|date=November 30, 2005[/tpl] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships. In 1984, at the age of fifteen, she began dating David Cruz, her first boyfriend.
While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[tpl]cite web|first=Eleanor |last=Mannikka |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/my-little-girl-v34075|title=My Little Girl – Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |work=AllRovi |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=October 30, 2011[/tpl] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a "famous movie star". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a "really stupid" idea and that "no Latinos did that". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals: Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus to not have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer.

==Career==

===1991–96: In Living Color and early film career===

Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of "Games" at the 8th Annual American Music Awards.[tpl]cite journal|last=Perricon|first=Kathleen|title=Jennifer Lopez dances with New Kids on the Block in 1991 video clip|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-10/entertainment/29547058_1_nkotb-music-video-new-kids|journal=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=June 22, 2012|date=May 10, 2011[/tpl] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unavailable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up, but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved with Cruz to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[tpl]cite news|last=Morales|first=Ed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/30/entertainment/ca-42339|title=It's Not La Vida Loca to Her|accessdate=January 30, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 30, 1999[/tpl] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993, but backed out as she wanted to do her "own thing."[tpl]cite journal|title=Living Single|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gCYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA100&dq=This+Is+Me...+Then+jennifer+lopez+million+copies&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s03xT_70N8z3rAG1hqG1Cg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=This%20Is%20Me...%20Then%20jennifer%20lopez%20million%20copies&f=false|journal=Vibe (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Vibe|publisher=InterMedia Partners|accessdate=July 6, 2012|page=100|date=May 2001[/tpl]

In a study of the successful Latina in relation to sex and dance, author Priscilla Peña Ovalle observed in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011), that Lopez utilized the mythology of dance which makes the Latina star a "paradoxical figure".

Andrew Barker of Variety observes that Lopez's image is constantly evolving, opining that she exhibits "a plethora of contradictions" as a pop star. Barker wrote, "Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles "I’m Real" and "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she’s not asking you to come hither."[tpl]cite news|last=Barker|first=Andrew|title=Jennifer Lopez Receives Star for Music on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://variety.com/2013/scene/features/jennifer-lopez-receives-star-for-music-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame-1200493728/|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Business Media|accessdate=June 25, 2013|date=June 20, 2013[/tpl] While a dominant cultural icon, Lopez is also noted by Lynette Holloway of The New York Times to be subject to overexposure.
