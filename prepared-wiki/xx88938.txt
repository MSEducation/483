CATEGORIES: Towns in Saskatchewan

 
Redvers is a town in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada.  It is the first town one passes through travelling west from Manitoba on the Red Coat Trail, once a thoroughfare of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and now modern Highway 13.  A statue of a Mountie on a horse can be seen just west of the intersection of Highway 13 and Highway 8.
The town has a public school, hospital, two banks, a weekly newspaper (The Optimist), and other businesses and services.  Redvers is home to the Redvers Rockets, a senior hockey team in the Big 6 Hockey League.  Like most towns in the area, its economy is based on farming, oil drilling, and various services.[tpl]cite web|title=Town Of Redvers|url=http://www.redvers.ca/business/economic_development.php[/tpl]   Grain elevators are active along a Canadian Pacific Railway line paralleling the Redcoat trail.
The town was named after General Sir Redvers Buller in 1897. Buller was then fighting in the Second Boer War, and had earlier in his career commanded a company to quell the Red River Rebellion.  The town was incorporated in 1904.  Its centennial was celebrated on 30 July, 2004.
