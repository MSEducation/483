==Fry's Marketplace==

Fry's Marketplace is a multi-department store that offers full-service grocery, pharmacy, Ticketmaster/Ticketron, one-hour photo lab, and general merchandise including outdoor living products, electronics, home goods and toys. Ranging in size from 80,000-105,000 square feet, the Marketplace stores are smaller than the Fred Meyer stores. Fry's Marketplace was derived from the Fred Meyer concept but on a smaller scale and has since expanded to Kroger's Columbus, Ohio Division and the Smith's Food & Drug Centers Division in Utah.
Fry's Marketplace started out as Smitty's, Arizona's first multi-department store.  Smitty's was similar to a Wal-Mart Supercenter and even had a food court with four branded fast food choices (such as Taco Bell). In 1996, Smitty's merged with Smith's Food and Drug Centers of Salt Lake City. In 1997, After the Fred Meyer-Smith's merger, Fred Meyer updated and revitalized the Smitty's concept and in January 1999, all Smitty's stores were renamed Fred Meyer.  During this time, management of the chain changed from Smith's Food and Drug to Fred Meyer. Construction also started on a full sized Fred Meyer store in Phoenix.
In June 2000, Kroger moved the management of Fred Meyer's Arizona stores to Fry's Food and Drug. The Fred Meyer stores were rebranded Fry's Marketplace. The Phoenix Fred Meyer store was completed but never opened and was later demolished as the store was too large for Fry's to use.
