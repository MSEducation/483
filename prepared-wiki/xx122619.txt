==Etymology==

The word Aithala derives from a prerequisite vedic ritual of securing and maintaining the three fires.  AhitAH analaH yasya saH, is an ahitanalaH, which essentially means one who has secured and has been maintaining the three fires required for an agnichayanam.  But the Apabhramsa form of this word became to be known as aithala.  As one of the members of a vedic group, Aithalas have co-existed with Vaishnavas for a long time. Aithal comes from the Sanskrit words "Ahita" which meens protectors or keepers and "Ahnala" means fire. The meaning is similar to the word "Agnihotra"
