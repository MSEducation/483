[[Operation Barbarossa]]

CATEGORIES: Code names, Operation Barbarossa

Operation Barbarossa (German: Fall Barbarossa, literally "Case Barbarossa"), beginning 22 June 1941, was the code name for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II.[tpl]Citation|title=Hitler and Russia|first=Trumbull|last=Higgins| publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1966|pages=11–59, 98–151[/tpl]Bryan I.

In addition to troops, Barbarossa used 600,000 motor vehicles and 750,000 horses.Yad vashem – Chronology of the Holocaust The ambitious operation was driven by Adolf Hitler's persistent desire to conquer the Soviet territories as embodied in Generalplan Ost. It marked the beginning of the pivotal phase in deciding the victors of the war. The German invasion of the Soviet Union caused a high rate of fatalities: 95% of all German Army casualties that occurred from 1941 to 1944, and 65% of all Allied military casualties from the entire war.
Operation Barbarossa was named after Frederick Barbarossa, the medieval Holy Roman Emperor. The invasion was authorized by Hitler on 18 December 1940 (Directive No. 21) for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this would not be met, and instead the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Tactically, the Germans won resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union, mainly in Ukraine.A. J. P. Taylor and Colonel D. M Proektor, p. 106 Despite these successes, the German offensive stalled on the outskirts of Moscow and was then pushed back by a Soviet counter offensive without having taken the city. The Germans could never again mount a simultaneous offensive along the entire strategic Soviet–German front.A. J. P. Taylor & Colonel D. M Proektor 1974, p. 107 The Red Army repelled the Wehrmacht[tpl]'[/tpl]s strongest blow, and forced an unprepared Germany into a war of attrition with the largest nation on Earth.
Operation Barbarossa[tpl]'[/tpl]s failure led to Hitler's demands for further operations inside the USSR, all of which eventually failed, such as continuing the Siege of Leningrad,[tpl]cite web|first= Konstantin|last=Simonov|title=Records of talks with Georgi Zhukov, 1965–1966|url= http://www.hrono.ru/dokum/197_dok/1979zhukov2.html|year=1979|publisher=Hrono[/tpl]Life and Death in Besieged Leningrad, 1941–44 ("Studies in Russian and Eastern European History"), edited by John Barber and Andrei Dzeniskevich.

Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in history in both manpower and casualties.Peter Antill, Peter Dennis. Stalingrad 1942. Osprey Publishing, 2007, ISBN 1-84603-028-5, ISBN 978-1-84603-028-4. p. 7. Its failure was a turning point in the Third Reich's fortunes. Most importantly, Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front, to which more forces were committed than in any other theater of war in world history. Regions covered by the operation became the site of some of the largest battles, deadliest atrocities, highest casualties, and most horrific conditions for Soviets and Germans alike—all of which influenced the course of both World War II and 20th-century history. The German forces captured over three million Soviet POWs in 1941, who were not granted the protection stipulated in the Geneva Conventions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/soviet-prisoners-of-war-forgotten-nazi-victims-of-world-war-ii.htm|title=Soviet Prisoners of War: Forgotten Nazi Victims of World War II|publisher=historynet.com|accessdate=22 June 2011|quote=Before Operation Barbarossa began in 1941, the Wehrmacht determined that Soviet prisoners taken during the upcoming campaign were to be withdrawn from the protection of international and customary law. Orders issued to subordinate commands suspended the German military penal code and the Hague Convention, the international agreement that governed the treatment of prisoners. Although the Soviets had not signed the Geneva Convention regarding POWs, the Germans had. Article 82 of the convention obliged signatories to treat all prisoners, from any state, according to the dictates of humanity.[/tpl] Most of them never returned alive.Daniel Goldhagen, Hitler's Willing Executioners (p. 290) – "2.8 million young, healthy Soviet POWs" killed by the Germans, "mainly by starvation...in less than eight months" of 1941–42, before "the decimation of Soviet POWs...was stopped" and the Germans "began to use them as laborers". Germany deliberately starved the prisoners to death as part of its "Hunger Plan", i.e., the program to reduce the Eastern European population.Timothy Snyder (2010). Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Basic Books. p.416. ISBN 0-465-00239-0 – "When the Soviet Union defended itself and no lightning victory could be won, Hitler and the German leadership adapted the three remaining plans to the new situation...The Hunger Plan was abandoned in its original conception, and applied only to areas under total German control. Germany purposefully starved a million people in besieged Leningrad and neglected and starved Soviet prisoners of war, of whom three million died. As the war continued, the Germans began to use prisoners as forced laborers, rather than allowing most of them to starve".

==German intentions==

===Nazi Germany policy towards the Soviet Union===

As early as 1925, Hitler suggested in Mein Kampf that he would invade the Soviet Union, asserting that the German people needed Lebensraum ("living space", i.e., land and raw materials) and that these should be sought in the East. Nazism viewed the Soviet Union (and all of Eastern Europe) as populated by "Untermensch" Slavs, ruled by "Jewish Bolshevik" masters.Bendersky, Joseph W., A History of Nazi Germany: 1919–1945, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, ISBN 0-8304-1567-X, page 177Müller, Rolf-Dieter, Gerd R. Ueberschär, Hitler's War in the East, 1941–1945: A Critical Assessment, Berghahn Books, 2002, ISBN 157181293, page 244 Mein Kampf said Germany's destiny was to turn "to the East" as it did "six hundred years ago" and "the end of the Jewish domination in Russia will also be the end of Russia as a State."[tpl]Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=716[/tpl] Thereafter, Hitler spoke of an inescapable battle against "pan-Slav ideals", in which victory would lead to "permanent mastery of the world", although he also said they would "walk part of the road with the Russians, if that will help us".Rauschning, Hermann, Hitler Speaks: A Series of Political Conversations With Adolf Hitler on His Real Aims, Kessinger Publishing, 2006, ISBN 142860034, pages 136–7 Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of Russian and other Slavic populations and repopulate the land with Germanic peoples (see Generalplan Ost).
Before World War II, observers believed that in a war with the Soviet Union, Germany would attack through the Baltic states while the Kriegsmarine would seize Leningrad from the sea. They assumed that possessing the entire Baltic basin would satisfy Hitler, who would not repeat Napoleon's mistake of attacking Moscow.[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NkEEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA26#v=onepage&f=true | title=Adolf Hitler's Navy | work=Life | date=7 December 1936 | accessdate=23 February 2013 | pages=26–27[/tpl]

===1939–1940 German-Soviet relationship===

The Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact in August 1939, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, shortly before the German invasion of Poland that triggered World War II, which was followed by the Soviet invasion of that country. A secret protocol to the pact outlined an agreement between the Third Reich and the Soviet Union on the division of the border states between their respective "spheres of influence". The Soviet Union and Germany would split Poland if an invasion were to occur, and Latvia, Estonia and Finland were defined as falling within the Soviet sphere of influence.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nMAl-RSvqPoC&pg=PA120|title=Finland in the Twentieth Century: A History and an Interpretation|last=Kirby|first=D.G.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1980|page=120|isbn=0-8166-5802-1[/tpl]"Modern History Sourcebook: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, 1939: Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact" The pact surprised the world[tpl]citation|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|page= 30[/tpl] because of the parties' mutual hostility and their conflicting ideologies. As a result of the pact, Germany and the Soviet Union had reasonably strong diplomatic relations and an important economic relationship. The countries entered a trade pact in 1940, in which the Soviets received German military and industrial equipment in exchange for raw materials, such as oil or wheat, to help Germany circumvent a British blockade.Shirer, William L., The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon and Schuster, 1990 ISBN 0-671-72868-7, page 668-9
Despite the parties' ongoing relations, each side was strongly suspicious of the other's intentions. After Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact.[tpl]citation|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|page=57[/tpl] After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12–14 November, Germany presented a proposed written agreement for a Soviet entry into the Axis. The Soviet Union offered a written counterproposal agreement on 25 November 1940, to which Germany did not respond.[tpl]citation|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953| publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|page=59[/tpl][tpl]citation|last1=Nekrich|first1=Aleksandr Moiseevich|last2=Ulam|first2=Adam Bruno|last3=Freeze|first3=Gregory L.|title=Pariahs, Partners, Predators: German-Soviet Relations, 1922–1941|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-231-10676-9|pages=202–205[/tpl] As both sides began colliding with each other in Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they signed a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941.

===Germany plans the invasion===

Joseph Stalin's own reputation as a brutal dictator contributed both to the Nazis' justification of their assault and their faith in success. In the late 1930s, many competent and experienced military officers were killed in the Great Purge, leaving the Red Army with a relatively inexperienced leadership to that of their German counterparts. The Nazis often emphasized the Soviet regime's brutality when targeting the Slavs with propaganda. German propaganda claimed the Red Army was preparing to attack them, and their own invasion was thus presented as a preemptive strike.[tpl]Citation|first=Christian |last=Hartmann |title=Warum 'Unternehmen Barbarossa'? |language=German |journal=Damals |volume=43 |issue=6 |year=2011 |pages=16–21|postscript=.[/tpl]
In the summer of 1940, when German raw materials crises and a potential collision with the Soviet Union over territory in the Balkans arose, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union looked increasingly like Hitler's only solution.Ericson, Feeding the German Eagle, p. 127 While no concrete plans were yet made, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in western Europe "finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism",Ericson, Feeding the German Eagle, p. 129–130 although German generals told Hitler that occupying Western Russia would create "more of a drain than a relief for Germany's economic situation."Ericson, Feeding the German Eagle, p. 138 The Führer anticipated additional benefits:[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
On 5 December 1940, Hitler received the final military plans for the invasion which were drawn since July 1940 already under the codename Operation Otto.Operation Barbarossa The Free Dictionary. Source: The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979). He approved them all, with the start scheduled for May 1941.[tpl]citation|last=Overy|first=R. J.|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2004|isbn= 0-393-02030-4|page=489[/tpl] On 18 December, Hitler signed War Directive No. 21 to the German High Command for an operation now codenamed "Operation Barbarossa" stating: "The German Wehrmacht must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign."[tpl]citation|last=Brackman|first=Roman|title=The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers|year=2001|isbn=0-7146-5050-1|page=344[/tpl] The operation was named after Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, a leader of the Third Crusade in the 12th century. The invasion was set for 15 May 1941. The plan for Barbarossa assumed that the Wehrmacht would emerge victorious if it could destroy the bulk of the Red Army west of the Western Dvina and Dnieper Rivers. This assumption would be proven fatally wrong less than a month into the invasion.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The Battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 19
In a 1978 essay "Das Russlandbild der führenden deutschen Militärs" ("The Picture of Russia held by the Leadership of the German Military"), the German historian Andreas Hillgruber examined the views about the Soviet Union held by the German military elite in the period June 1940 to June 1941. According to Hillgruber, the following were the case:Wette, Wolfram, The Wehrmacht, Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 21–22.
Hillgruber argued that these assumptions about the Soviet Union shared by the entire military elite allowed Hitler to push through a "war of annihilation" against the Soviet Union with the assistance of "several military leaders", even though it was quite clear to the military that such a war would violate all standards of civilized warfare and would be waged in the most inhumane fashion possible.
In the Soviet Union, speaking to his generals in December[tpl]year needed|date=March 2013[/tpl], Stalin mentioned Hitler's references to an attack on the Soviet Union in Mein Kampf, and said they must always be ready to repulse a German attack, and that Hitler thought the Red Army would need four years to ready itself. Hence, "we must be ready much earlier" and "we will try to delay the war for another two years".[tpl]citation|first1=Simon|last1=Berthon|first2=Joanna| last2=Potts|title=Warlords: An Extraordinary Re-creation of World War II Through the Eyes and Minds of Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007|isbn=0-306-81538-9[/tpl]
In autumn 1940, high-ranking German officials drafted a memorandum on the dangers of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany.[tpl]citation|last=Gorodetsky|first=Gabriel|title =Grand Delusion: Stalin and the German Invasion of Russia|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001 |isbn=978-0300084597|pages=69–70[/tpl] Another German official argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless, the occupation would not produce a gain for Germany and "why should it not stew next to us in its damp Bolshevism?"
Hitler ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now on he was not going to listen to any more of that kind of talk or he was going to stop up his ears in order to get his peace of mind.Ericson, Feeding the German Eagle, p. 162 This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of an invasion of the Soviet Union—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact.
Beginning in March 1941, Göring's Green Folder laid out details of the Soviet Union's proposed economic disposal after the invasion. The entire urban population of the invaded land was to be starved to death, thus creating an agricultural surplus to feed Germany and allowing the urban population's replacement by a German upper class. In the summer of 1941, German Nazi-ideologist Alfred Rosenberg suggested that conquered Soviet territory should be administered in the following Reichskommissariates:[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Nazi policy aimed to destroy the Soviet Union as a political entity in accordance with the geopolitical Lebensraum ideal ("Drang nach Osten") for the benefit of future generations of the "Nordic Aryan master race".
Operation Barbarossa was to combine a northern assault towards Leningrad, a symbolic capturing of Moscow, and an economic strategy of seizing oil fields in the south beyond Ukraine. Hitler and his generals disagreed on which of these aspects should take priority and where Germany should focus its energies; deciding on priorities required a compromise. While planning Barbarossa in 1940–1941, in many discussions with his generals, Hitler repeated his order: "Leningrad first, the Donetsk Basin second, Moscow third".[tpl]Citation|title=Hitler and Russia|first=Trumbull|last=Higgins|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1966|page=151[/tpl]Bryan I. Fugate, Operation Barbarossa: Strategy and Tactics on the Eastern Front, 1941. Novato: Presidio Press, 1984.
Hitler believed Moscow was of "no great importance" in the defeat of the Soviet Union, and instead believed victory would come with the destruction of the Red Army west of the capital.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The Battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 19,60Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 72Glantz, David, Before Stalingrad: Barbarossa – Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941, 2003, p. 13 This later led to conflict between Hitler and several German senior officers including Heinz Guderian, Gerhard Engel, Fedor von Bock and Franz Halder, who believed the decisive victory could only be delivered at Moscow.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 56-60 Hitler was impatient to get on with his long-desired invasion of the east. He was convinced Britain would sue for peace, once the Germans triumphed in the Soviet Union, the real area of Germany's interests. Halder noted in his diaries that, by destroying the Soviet Union, Germany would destroy Britain's hope of victory.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
Hitler had grown overconfident from his rapid success in Western Europe and the Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–1940. He expected victory within a few months and therefore did not prepare for a war lasting into the winter. This meant his troops lacked adequate warm clothing and preparations for a longer campaign when they began their attack. The assumption that the Soviet Union would quickly capitulate would prove to be his undoing.Albert Speer identifies these points in the The World at War series in the episode "Barbarossa".

==German preparations==

The Germans had begun massing troops near the Soviet border even before the campaign in the Balkans had finished. By the third week in February 1941, 680,000 German troops were stationed on the Romanian-Soviet border.Shirer, William L., The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon and Schuster, 1990 ISBN 0-671-72868-7, p. 822 In preparation for the attack, Hitler moved 3.2 million German and about 500,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border, launched many aerial surveillance missions over Soviet territory, and stockpiled materiel in the East. The Soviets were still taken by surprise, mostly due to Stalin's belief that the Third Reich was unlikely to attack only two years after signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Soviet leader also believed the Nazis would be likely to finish their war with Britain before opening a new front. He refused to believe repeated warnings from his intelligence services on the Nazi buildup, fearing the reports to be British misinformation designed to spark a war between Germany and the USSR.Whaley, Barton, Codeword BARBAROSSA, Cambridge, London 1973, ISBN 0-262-73038-3, pp.1–10.
Spy Dr. Richard Sorge gave Stalin the exact German launch date; Swedish cryptanalysts led by Arne Beurling also knew the date beforehand, but Sorge and other informers (e.g., from the Berlin Police department) had previously given different invasion dates which passed peacefully before the actual invasion. In addition, British intelligence gathering information through Ultra warned the Soviet Union of impending invasion several months prior to 22 June 1941.Waller 1996, p. 192.
The Germans set up deception operations, from April 1941, to add substance to their claims that Britain was the real target: Operations Haifisch and Harpune. These simulated preparations in Norway, the Channel coast and Britain. There were supporting activities such as ship concentrations, reconnaissance flights and training exercises. Some details of these bogus invasion plans were deliberately leaked.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
German military planners also researched Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia. In their calculations they concluded that there was little danger of a large-scale retreat of the Soviet army into the Russian interior, as it could not afford to give up the Baltic states, Ukraine, or the Moscow and Leningrad regions, all of which were vital to the Red Army for supply reasons and would thus have to be defended.Rich, Norman (1973). Hitler's War Aims: Ideology, the Nazi State, and the Course of Expansion, 212. W. W. Norton & Company Inc., New York/London.
The strategy Hitler and his generals agreed on involved three separate army groups assigned to capture specific regions and cities of the Soviet Union. The main German thrusts were conducted along historical invasion routes. Army Group North was to march through the Baltics into northern Russia, and either take or destroy the city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). Army Group Center would advance to Smolensk and then Moscow, marching through what is now Belarus and the west-central regions of Russia proper. Army Group South was to strike the heavily populated and agricultural heartland of Ukraine, taking Kiev before continuing eastward over the steppes of the southern USSR to the Volga with the aim of controlling the oil-rich Caucasus.
The postponement of Barbarossa from the initially planned date of 15 May to the actual invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred due to a combination of reasons; the Balkans Campaign required a divergence of troops and resources; insufficient logistics (preexisting and those incurred by the Balkans Campaign) hampered the preparations; and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it was unlikely to have happened before the end of the Balkans Campaign. The importance of the delay is still debated.Charlie Lewis (1958). Winston Churchill: A Biography, Hawthorn Books, New YorkBradley, John N.; Buell, Thomas B. (2002). "Why Was Barbarossa Delayed". The Second World War: Europe and the Mediterranean (The West Point Military History Series). Square One Publishers, Inc., New York
The Germans also decided to bring rear forces (mostly Waffen-SS units and Einsatzgruppen) into the conquered territories to counter any partisan activity in areas they controlled.

==Soviet preparations==

Despite the estimations held by Hitler and others in the German high command, the Soviet Union was by no means weak. Rapid industrialization in the 1930s had led to industrial output second only to that of the United States, and equal to Germany. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Production of military equipment grew steadily, and in the pre-war years the economy became progressively more oriented toward military production. Mikhail Tukhachevsky, one of the prominent military theorists in tank warfare in the interwar period, lobbied the Kremlin for colossal investment in the resources  required for the production of weapons in mass quantities. In 1930 he forwarded a memo to the Kremlin, pressing the case for "40,000 aircraft and 50,000 tanks".[ref]Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 56
[/ref] In the early 1930s, a very modern operational doctrine for the Red Army was developed and promulgated in the 1936 field regulations, in the form of the Deep Battle concept. Defense expenditure also grew rapidly: by 1933 it had reached 12% of gross national product, from 5.2%  in 1913; and by 1940 it stood at 18%.[ref]
Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 55[/ref]
On 5 May 1941, Stalin gave a speech to graduates of military academies in Moscow declaring:
"War with Germany is inevitable. If comrade Molotov can manage to postpone the war for two or three years that will be our good fortune, but you yourselves must go off and take measures to raise the combat readiness of our forces".N. Lyashchenko, 'O vystuplenii I. V. Stalina v Kremle, 5 maya 1941', Volkogonov Papers, reel no.8, p.1.

According to Taylor and Proektor (1974), the Soviet armed forces in the western districts were outnumbered, with 2.6 million Soviet soldiers versus 3.9 million for the Axis.A. J. P. Taylor and D. M. Proektor, p. 98 However, Glantz reports about 3.8 million as the total force of the Axis in June 1941, with 900,000 of them deployed in the West.Glantz, David, The Soviet‐German War 1941–45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay. p. 9 The overall size of the Soviet armed forces in early July 1941, amounted to a little more than five million men, 2.6 million in the west, 1.8 million in the Far East, with the rest being deployed or training elsewhere. These figures, however, can be misleading.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The figure for Soviet strength in the western districts of the Soviet Union counts only the First Strategic Echelon, which was stationed on and behind the Soviet western frontier to a depth of 400 kilometers; it also underestimates the size of the First Strategic Echelon, which was actually 2.9 million strong.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The figure does not include the smaller Second Strategic Echelon, which as of 22 June 1941 was in the process of moving toward the frontier; according to the Soviet strategic plan; it was scheduled to be in position reinforcing the First Strategic Echelon by early July. The total Axis strength is also exaggerated; 3.3 million German troops were earmarked for participation in Barbarossa, but that figure includes reserves which did not take part in the initial assault. A further 600,000 troops provided by Germany's allies also participated, but mostly after the initial offensive.
On 22 June, the German Wehrmacht achieved a local superiority in its initial assault (98 German divisions), including 29 armoured and motorized divisions, some 90% of its mobile forces, attacking on a front of [tpl]convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains, against NKVD border troops and the divisions of the Soviet First Operational Echelon (the part of the First Strategic Echelon stationed immediately behind the frontier in the three western Special Military Districts) because it had completed its deployment and was ready to attack about two weeks before the Red Army was scheduled to have finished its own deployment with the Second Strategic Echelon in place. At the time, 41% of stationary Soviet bases were located in the near-boundary districts, many of them in the [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] strip around the border; according to a Red Army directive, fuel, equipment, railroad cars, etc. were similarly concentrated there.Meltyukhov 2000:414
Moreover, on mobilization, as the war went on, the Red Army gained steadily in strength. While the strength of both sides varied, in general the 1941 belligerents fought with a slight Axis numerical superiority in manpower at the front.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] According to Mikhail Meltyukhov (2000:477), by the start of war, the Red Army numbered a total of 5,774,211 troops: 4,605,321 in ground forces, 475,656 in the air force, 353,752 in the navy, 167,582 as border guards and 171,900 in internal troops of the NKVD.
In some key weapons-systems, however, the Soviets had a considerable numerical advantage. In tanks, for example, the Red Army dominated overwhelmingly in numbers. They possessed 23,106,N.P.Zolotov and S.I. Isayev, "Boyegotovy byli...", ''Voenno-Istorichesskiy Zhurnal, N° 11: 1993, p. 77 of which about 12,782 were in the five Western Military Districts (three of which directly faced the German invasion front). Adolf Hitler later said "If I had known about the Russian tank's strength in 1941 I would not have attacked". However, maintenance and readiness standards were very poor; ammunition and radios were in short supply, and many units lacked the trucks needed to carry supplies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Also, from 1938, the Soviets had partly dispersed their tanks to infantry divisions for infantry support, but after their experiences in the Winter War and their observation of the German campaign against France, they had begun to emulate the Germans and organize most of their armored assets into large armored divisions and corps. This reorganization was only partially implemented at the dawn of Barbarossa,[ref]
The Russian Front by James F. Dunnigan, Arms & Armour Press 1978, p 82, 88 ISBN 0-85368-152-X[/ref] as not enough tanks were available to bring the mechanized corps up to organic strength.
The German Wehrmacht had about 5,200 tanks overall, of which 3,350 were committed to the invasion. This yields a balance of immediately available tanks of about 4:1 in the Red Army's favor. However,the most advanced Soviet tank models, the T-34 and KV-1, were not available in large numbers early in the war, and only accounted for 7.2% of the total Soviet tank-force.
The Soviet numerical advantage in heavy equipment was also more than offset by the greatly superior training and readiness of German forces. The Soviet officer corps and high command had been massacred in Stalin's Great Purge (1936–1938). Of 90 generals arrested, only six survived the purges, as did only 36 of 180 divisional commanders, and just seven out of 57 army corps commanders. In total, some 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed,Rayfield 2004, p. 315. while more were deported to Siberia and replaced with officers deemed more "politically reliable". Three of the five pre-war marshals and about two-thirds of the corps and division commanders were shot. This often left younger, less experienced officers in their places. For example, in 1941, 75% of Red Army officers had held their posts for less than one year. The average Soviet corps commander was 12 years younger than the average German division commander. These officers tended to be very reluctant to take the initiative and often lacked the training necessary for their jobs.
The number of aircraft was also heavily in the Soviets' favor. However, Soviet aircraft were largely obsolete, and Soviet artillery lacked modern fire-control techniques.[ref]Dunnigan, Russian Front, pp. 93–94
[/ref] Most Soviet units were on a peacetime footing, which might explain why aviation units had their aircraft parked in closely bunched neat rows, rather than dispersed, making easy targets for the Luftwaffe in the first days of the conflict. Prior to the invasion the VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily; Soviet Air Force) was forbidden to shoot down Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, despite hundreds of prewar incursions into Soviet airspace.
A shortage of modern aircraft severely hampered the Soviet war effort in the first phase of the Eastern-front war. The Soviet fighter force was equipped with large numbers of obsolete aircraft, such as the Polikarpov I-15 biplane and the Polikarpov I-16. In 1941 the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yak-1 had just started to roll off the production lines, but were far inferior in all-round performance to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 or later, to the Fw 190 when it entered operations in September 1941. Few aircraft had radios and those that were available were unencrypted and did not work reliably. The poor performance of the VVS during the Winter War with Finland had increased the Luftwaffe's confidence that the Soviets could be mastered. The standard of flight training had been accelerated in preparation for a German attack that was expected to come in 1942 or later. However Soviet pilot training was extremely poor. Order No 0362 of the People's Commissar of Defense, dated 22 December 1940, ordered flight training to be accelerated and shortened. Incredibly, while the Soviets had 201 MiG-3s and 37 MiG-1s combat-ready on 22 June 1941, only four pilots had been trained to handle these machines.Bergström, p11-12
The Red Army was dispersed and unprepared, and units were often separated and without transportation to concentrate prior to combat. Although it had numerous, well-designed artillery pieces, some of the guns had no ammunition. Artillery units often lacked transportation to move their guns. Tank units were rarely well-equipped, and also lacked training and logistical support. Maintenance standards were very poor. Units were sent into combat with no arrangements for refueling, ammunition resupply, or personnel replacement. Often, after a single engagement, units were destroyed or rendered ineffective. The army was in the midst of reorganizing their armor units into large tank corps, adding to the disorganization.
As a result, although on paper the Red Army in 1941 seemed at least the equal of the German army, the reality in the field was far different; incompetent officers, as well as partial lack of equipment, insufficient motorized logistical support, and poor training placed the Red Army at a severe disadvantage.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
In August 1940 British intelligence had received hints of German plans to attack the Soviets only a week after Hitler informally approved the plans for Barbarossa. Stalin's distrust of the British led to his ignoring their warnings, believing it to be a trick designed to bring the Soviet Union into the war.[ref]Glantz & House 1995, p. 42.
[/ref] In the spring of 1941, Stalin's own intelligence services and American intelligence gave regular and repeated warnings of an impending German attack.Waller 1996, pp. 196–8. However, Stalin chose to ignore them. Although acknowledging the possibility of an attack in general and making significant preparations, he decided not to run the risk of provoking Hitler.Waller 1996, p. 202. He also had an ill-founded confidence in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which The USSR and Germany had signed just two years before. He also suspected the British of trying to spread false rumours in order to trigger a war between Germany and the USSR.[ref]Roberts 1995, p. 1293.

[/ref] Consequently, the Soviet border troops were not put on full alert and were sometimes even forbidden to fire back without permission when attacked—though a partial alert was implemented on 10 April—they were simply not ready when the German attack came.
Enormous Soviet forces had massed on the western border of the Soviet Union in case the Germans did attack. However, these forces were very vulnerable due to changes in the tactical doctrine of the Red Army. In 1938, it had adopted, on the instigation of General Dmitry Pavlov, a standard linear-defense tactic in line with other nations. Infantry divisions, reinforced by an organic tank component, would dig in to form heavily fortified zones. Then came the shock of the Fall of France. The Wehrmacht defeated the French Army in a mere six weeks. Soviet analysis of events, based on incomplete information, concluded that French military collapsed due to a reliance on linear defence and a lack of armored reserves.
The Soviets decided not to repeat these mistakes. Instead of digging-in for linear defense, the infantry divisions would henceforth concentrate in large formations.Roberts 1995, p. 1297-1298 Most tanks would also be concentrated into 29 mechanized corps, each with over 1,031 of them.Glantz 1991, p. 96. Should the Germans attack, their armored spearheads would be cut off and wiped out by the mechanized corps.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] These would then cooperate with the infantry armies to drive back the German infantry, vulnerable in its approach march. The Soviet left wing, in Ukraine, was to be enormously reinforced to be able to execute a strategic envelopment: after destroying German Army Group South, it would swing north through Poland in the back of Army Groups Center and North. With the complete annihilation of the encircled German Army thus made inevitable, a Red Army offensive into the rest of Europe would follow.Roberts 1995, p. 1212-14.Roberts 1995, p. 1309-1310.

===The Soviet offensive plans theory===

Immediately after the German invasion of the USSR, Adolf Hitler put forward a thesis that the Red Army made extensive preparations for an offensive war in Europe, thus justifying the German invasion as a pre-emptive strike.[ref]
Teddy J. Uldricks. "The Icebreaker Controversy: Did Stalin Plan to Attack Hitler?" Slavic Review 58, No. 3 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 626–643[/ref] After the war some Wehrmacht leaders, like Wilhelm Keitel, promoted this view.[ref]

[/ref] Thus it has been found that Zhukov drew up a proposal (signed by Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin) suggesting secret mobilization and deploying Red Army troops on the western border, under the cover of training. This proposed operation aimed to cut Germany off from its allies, especially from Romania and its oilfields that Germany needed to conduct the war.[ref]
Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives, Anchor, (1997) ISBN 0-385-47954-9, pp. 454–459 "In view of the fact that Germany at present keeps its army fully mobilized with its rear services deployed, it has the capacity of deploying ahead of us and striking a sudden blow. To prevent this I consider it important not to leave the operational initiative to the German command in any circumstances, but to anticipate the enemy and attack the German army at the moment when it is in the process of deploying and before it has time to organize its front and the coordination of its various arms".
[/ref]
According to Viktor Suvorov, Stalin planned to use Germany as a proxy (the "icebreaker") against the West. Stalin aimed to fuel Hitler's aggressive plans against Europe, and only after the countries had fought each other—and exhausted themselves to some extent—would the USSR make their move. For this reason Stalin provided significant material and political support to Adolf Hitler, while at the same time preparing the Red Army to "liberate" the whole of Europe from Nazi occupation. Suvorov saw Barbarossa as a German pre-emptive strike that capitalized on the Soviet troop concentrations immediately on the 1941 borders. Some others who support the idea that Stalin prepared to attack, like Mikhail Meltyukhov, reject this part of Suvorov's theory, arguing that both sides prepared for an attack on their own, not in response to the other side's preparations.
Although this thesis has drawn the attention of the general public in some countries (Germany, Russia and Israel), and has been supported by some historians (examples include Vladimir Nevezhin, Boris Sokolov, Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, and Mark Solonin), the idea that Stalin was preparing an attack in 1941 has not been accepted by many western historians.R.

==Order of battle==

===Composition of the Axis forces===

Franz Halder as the Chief of General Staff OKH, concentrated the following Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe forces for the operation:
Army Group North (Heeresgruppe Nord) (Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb) staged in East Prussia with (29 divisions):
Army Group Center (Heeresgruppe Mitte) (Fedor von Bock) staged in Eastern Poland with (50 divisions):
Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) (Gerd von Rundstedt) was staged in Southern Poland and Romania with (57 divisions):
From Occupied Norway a smaller group of forces consisted of:
From Finland (engaged in its Continuation War) (16 divisions):
Numerous smaller units from all over Nazi-occupied Europe, like the "Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism" (Légion des Volontaires Français contre le Bolchévisme), supported the German war effort.
Russian archives have been and to an extent still are inaccessible, exact figures have been difficult to ascertain. 
 The official Soviet sources invariably overestimated German strength and downplayed Soviet strength, as emphasized by David Glantz (1998:292). Some of the earlier Soviet figures claimed that there had been only 1,540 Soviet aircraft to face Germany's 4,950; that there were a mere 1,800 Red Army tanks and assault guns facing 2,800 German units etc. 
 In 1991, Russian military historian Mikhail Meltyukhov published an article on this question (Мельтюхов М.И. 22 июня 1941 г.: цифры свидетельствуют // История СССР. 1991. № 3) with other figures that differed slightly from those of the table here, although they had similar ratios. Glantz (1998:293) was of the opinion that those figures "appeared to be most accurate regarding Soviet forces and those of Germany's allies," although other figures also occur in modern publications.[/ref]

===Composition of the Soviet Forces===

At the beginning of the German Reich’s invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 the Red Army areas of responsibility in the European USSR were divided into four active Fronts. More Fronts would be formed within the overall responsibility of the three Strategic Directions commands which corresponded approximately to a German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) Army Group (Heeresgruppen) in terms of geographic area of operations.
In accordance with peacetime directives the Northern Front was formed from the Leningrad Military District, the North-Western Front from the Baltic Special Military District, the Western Front was formed from the Western Special Military District, and the Soviet Southwestern Front was formed from the Kiev Special Military District. The Southern Front was created on 25 June 1941 from the Odessa Military District.
The first Directions were established on 10 July 1941, with Kliment Voroshilov commanding the North-Western Strategic Direction, Timoshenko commanding the Western Strategic Direction, and Budyonny commanding the South-Western Strategic Direction.Keith E. Bonn (ed.), Slaughterhouse: Handbook of the Eastern Front, Aberjona Press, Bedford, PA, 2005, p.299
The forces of the North-Western Direction were:John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, Cassel Military Paperbacks, 2003 edition, p. 172
The forces of the Western Direction were:
The forces of the South-Western Direction were:
Beside the Armies in the Fronts, there were a further six armies in the Western region of the USSR: the 16th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and the 24th Armies that formed, together with independent units, the Stavka Reserve Group of Armies, later renamed the Reserve Front – nominally under Stalin's direct command.

==The invasion==

===Phase 1: The Frontier Battles (22 June–3 July 1941)===

At 3:15 a.m. on Sunday, 22 June 1941, the Axis bombed major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland, two hours after the start codeword "Wotan" was issued. It is hard to pinpoint the opposing sides' strength in this initial phase, as most German figures include reserves allocated to the East but not yet committed, as well as several other comparability issues between the German and USSR's figures. Roughly three million Wehrmacht troops went into action on 22 June, and they faced slightly fewer Soviet troops in the border Military Districts. The contribution of the German allies would generally not make itself felt until later. The surprise was complete: though the Stavka, alarmed by reports that Wehrmacht units were approaching the border, had, at 00:30, ordered that the border troops be warned that war was imminent, only a small number of units were alerted in time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
At around noon 22 June 1941, the news of the invasion was broadcast to the population by Molotov, as follows:Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 70
 Citizens and Citizenesses of the Soviet Union! Today, at four o'clock in the morning, without addressing any grievances to the Soviet Union, without declaration of war, German forces fell on our country, attacked our frontiers in many places and bombed our cities...an act of treachery unprecedented in the history of civilized nations...The Red Army and the whole nation will wage a victorious Patriotic War for our beloved country, for honour, for liberty...Our cause is just. The enemy will be beaten. Victory will be ours. 
By calling upon the population's devotion to their nation rather than the Party, Molotov struck a patriotic chord while allowing a stunned people to absorb the shattering news. The invasion did not come as a surprise to Stalin but he was completely astounded. It was not until 3 July before Stalin addressed the nation for the first time since the start of the German invasion, and just like Molotov's announcement of the war on 22 June, he called for a "patriotic war...of the entire Soviet people".Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 97Transcript – Stalin's address to the people of the Soviet Union on 3 July 1941
In Germany, on the morning of 22 June, Joseph Goebbels announced the invasion to the waking nation in a radio broadcast:Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, p. 82
  At this moment a march is taking place that, for its extent, compares with the greatest the world has ever seen. I have decided today to place the fate and future of the Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers. May God aid us, especially in this fight. 
Later the same morning, Hitler proclaimed to colleagues, "before three months have passed, we shall witness a collapse of Russia, the like of which has never been seen in history".
Aside from the roughly 3.2 million German ground troops engaged in, or earmarked for, the Eastern Campaign, about 500,000 Romanian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Croatian, and Italian troops accompanied the German forces, while the Army of Finland made a major contribution in the north. The 250th Spanish "Blue" Infantry Division, was a formation of volunteered Spanish Falangists and Nazi sympathisers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Luftwaffe reconnaissance units worked frantically to plot troop concentration, supply dumps, and airfields, and mark them for destruction. The Luftwaffe[tpl]'[/tpl]s task was to neutralize the Soviet Air Force. This was not achieved in the first days of operations, despite the Soviets having concentrated aircraft in huge groups on the permanent airfields rather than dispersing them on field landing strips, making them ideal targets. The Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 1,489 aircraft on the first day of operations.Bergström 2007, p. 20 Hermann Göring—Chief of the Luftwaffe—distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. Picking through the wreckages of Soviet airfields, the Luftwaffe[tpl]'[/tpl]s figures proved conservative, as over 2,000 destroyed Soviet aircraft were found. The Luftwaffe lost 35 aircraft on the first day of combat. The Germans claimed to have destroyed only 3,100 Soviet aircraft in the first three days. In fact Soviet losses were far higher; according to Russian historian Viktor Kulikov, some 3,922 Soviet aircraft had been lost.Bergstrom 2007, p. 23. The Luftwaffe had achieved air superiority over all three sectors of the front, and would maintain it until the close of the year.Glantz & House 1995, p. 49. The Luftwaffe could now devote large numbers of its Geschwader (also see Luftwaffe Organization) to support the ground forces.

====Army Group North====

Opposite Army Group North were two Soviet armies. The Wehrmacht OKH thrust the 4th Panzer Group, with a strength of 600 tanks, at the junction of the two Soviet armies in that sector. The 4th Panzer Group's objective was to cross the Neman and Daugava Rivers which were the two largest obstacles in the advance to Leningrad. On the first day, tanks crossed the River Neman and penetrated [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. Near Raseiniai, the armoured units were counterattacked by 300 tanks of the 3rd and 12th Soviet Mechanized Corps. It took four days for the Germans to encircle and destroy the Soviet armour who lacked fuel, ammunition and coordination. By the end of the first week the Soviet Mechanized Corps had lost 90% of its strength.Glantz & House 1995, p. 51. The Panzer Groups then crossed the Daugava near Daugavpils. The Germans were now within striking distance of Leningrad. However, due to their deteriorated supply situation, Hitler ordered the Panzer Groups to hold their position until the infantry formations caught up. The orders to hold would last over a week, giving time for the Soviets to build up a defense around Leningrad and along the bank of the Luga River. Further complicating the Soviet position, on 22 June, the anti-Soviet June Uprising in Lithuania began, on the next day an independent Lithuania was proclaimed.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] Gediminas Zemlickas. Pasaulyje—kaip savo namuose, Mokslo Lietuva, 11 February 1998, No. 3 (161) An estimated 30,000 Lithuanian rebels engaged Soviet forces, joined by ethnic Lithuanians from the Red Army. As the Germans reached further north, armed resistance against the Soviets broke out in Estonia as well. The "Battle of Estonia" culminated as the 18th Army reached the Gulf of Finland coastBergstrom 2007, p. 36. which forced the Baltic Fleet to evacuate Tallinn, resulting in one of the greatest naval disasters in history.

====Army Group Center====

Army Group Center was composed of 4th Army, 9th Army, 2nd Panzer Group, 3rd Panzer Group; with 2nd army held in the strategic reserve.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 560 Opposite Army Group Center were four Soviet armies: the 3rd, 4th, 10th and 11th Armies.
The Soviet Armies occupied a salient that jutted into German occupied Polish territory with the Soviet salient's center at Białystok. Beyond Białystok was Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and a key railway junction. Army Group Center's two Panzer Groups' goal was to meet at Minsk, denying the Red Army an escape route from the salient. The 3rd Panzer Group broke through the junction of two Soviet Fronts in the north of the salient, and crossed the River Neman while the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Bug River river in the south. As the Panzer Groups attacked, the 4th and 9th Armies of Army Group Center struck at the salient, eventually encircling Soviet troops at Białystok.
Stavka at first failed to grasp the dimensions of the catastrophe that had befallen the Soviet Union. Marshal Semyon Timoshenko ordered all Soviet forces to launch a general counter-offensive, but with supply and ammunition dumps destroyed, and the complete collapse of communication, the uncoordinated attacks failed. Zhukov signed the infamous Directive of People's Commissariat of Defence No. 3, under pressure from Stalin – as he later claimed, which ordered the Red Army to start an offensive. He commanded the troops "to encircle and destroy the enemy grouping near Suwałki and to seize the Suwałki region by the evening of 26 June" and "to encircle and destroy the enemy grouping invading Vladimir-Volynia and Brody direction" and even "to seize the Lublin region by the evening of 24 June".as cited by Suvorov: http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov7/12.html This maneuver failed, and disorganized Red Army units were soon destroyed by the Wehrmacht.
On 27 June, 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups met up at Minsk, advancing [tpl]convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] into Soviet territory and a third of the way to Moscow. In the vast pocket between Minsk and the Polish border, the remnants of thirty-two Soviet Rifle divisions, eight Tank, Motorized, Cavalry and Artillery divisions were encircled.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] By 3 July, three encircled Soviet Armies (3rd, 4th and 10th) were destroyed in the vicinity of Minsk. Hitler had believed that the Red Army would collapse if the Wehrmacht could destroy the bulk of the their forces west of the Western Dvina and Dnieper Rivers. However after the victory at Minsk, as Army Group Center reached the two rivers, they encountered another five Soviet Armies (16th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd). Three of these Soviet Armies (16th, 19th, and 20th) were quickly encircled and eventually decimated in the vicinity of Smolensk, while the other two were severely weakened. However, these successes came at a very steep cost for the Wehrmacht.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, pages 19, 23 According to Franz Halder, the chief of the OKH General Staff, by 2 August Army Group Center had lost 74,500 men and received only 23,000 replacements since the start of the campaign. Later still, by 28 August, Halder recorded that the Panzer divisions of the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups were operating with an average tank strength of 45%, with the 7th Panzer Division the lowest at a strength of only 24%.Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 28

====Army Group South====

Opposite Army Group South were three Soviet armies, the 5th, 6th and 26th. Soviet commanders reacted quicker and the Germans faced determined resistance from the start. The German infantry armies struck at the junctions of these armies while the 1st Panzer Group drove its armored spearhead of 600 tanks right through the Soviet 6th Army, aiming to take Brody. On 26 June, five Soviet mechanized corps with over 4,000 tanks mounted a massive counterattack on the 1st Panzer Group. The battle was among the fiercest of the 1941 campaign and one of the largest tank battles in history, lasting over four days. In the end the poor Soviet logistics and coordination, combined with German tactical skill and air superiority enabled the Germans to prevail, although the Soviets inflicted heavy losses on the 1st Panzer Group.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
With the Soviet counteroffensives' failure, the last substantial Soviet tank forces in Western Ukraine had been decimated, and the Red Army assumed a defensive posture, focusing on strategic withdrawal under severe pressure. The Soviet air arm, the VVS, lost 1,561 aircraft over Ukraine, with one tenth of its entire strength destroyed on the ground in the first day of the war.Bergstrom 2007, p. 70. With their armored reserves all but destroyed, the Red Army in Ukraine could not conduct any mobile operations and were forced onto the defensive for the rest of the year.
However, Red Army commanders such as Mikhail Kirponos, Konstantin Rokossovsky and Andrey Vlasov were among some of the best generals in the Soviet Union (though Vlasov would eventually defect to Germany).  Their tactical skill, as well as quick reaction to the invasion meant that the Soviet forces in Ukraine avoided the rapid destruction that befell other army groups in Belarus and the Baltic States.  However without any armored support, and the Luftwaffe dominating the sky, all the Red Army could do was buy time.  Eventually, the German 6th Army broke through the Stalin Line and 1st Panzer Group finally reached open country.  von Kleist's Panzers linked up with von Reichenau's forces, trapping the remains of the Soviet 5th and 6th armies.  The door to Kiev was now open.

====Summary of the first phase====

By the end of the first week, all three German Army Groups had achieved major campaign objectives. However, in the vast pocket around Minsk and Białystok, the Soviets were still fighting; reducing the pocket was causing high German casualties and many Red Army troops were escaping. The estimated casualties of the Red Army amount to 600,000 killed, wounded, missing or captured.
Hitler summarized the achievements made in the opening phase of the operation in his diary as follow: "The objective to shatter the bulk of the Russian Army this western side of the Dvina and Dnieper has been accomplished... It is thus probably no overstatement to say that the Russian Campaign has been won in the space of two weeks."Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 92  However, cracks were already beginning to form in Hitler's plan.  It became apparent to everyone that the OKH had grossly underestimated the size of Soviet reserves.  Furthermore, the Wehrmacht's officer core consisted of the old German aristocracy, primarily Prussian Junkers.  These officers were schooled in the 19th century style of Clausetizian theory.
According to Clausewitz, wars were won by concentrating your armies at the enemies focal point, their tactical Schwerpunkt.  At the tactical level, this meant that your armies would win a battle by concentrating effort at unexpected locations, then having them converge upon the enemies focal point, leading to a Kesselschlacht, a cauldron battle.  Now surrounded, the enemy would be forced to fight a Vernichtungsschlacht, a battle of annihilation were they would be destroyed.  The Białystok–Minsk operation is a perfect example of this style of thinking.  At the strategic level, this meant that your armies after winning their decisive battle's would eventually converge on the enemies overall focal point.  In the case of Operation Barbarossa, this was Moscow.  Thus nearly every German commander treated Moscow as the ultimate prize.
However Hitler had a more modern, and according to David Glantz, correct view of modern warfare.  War's were not won by aristocrats drinking wine and smoking cigars over the negotiating table, dictating terms to their defeated gentleman rivals after winning some decisive engagement.  Wars were won by making resistance impossible by starving them of industrial production, and denying them the raw materials needed to fight.  In this thinking, Leningrad was of vital importance to keep the Baltic Fleet from interfering with deliveries of iron ore from Sweden.  Furthermore, Crimea must be captured to prevent air raids on Romanian oil fields.  Kharkov also must be captured to deny the enemy its deposits of coal and iron, as well as its heavy industry.  Finally, Rostov-on-Don must be captured in order to deny access to the Black Sea as well as using it as eventual launching pad for an invasion of the Caucasus, rich in oil and minerals.
To this end, Hitler ordered 3rd Panzer Group north in order to assist Army Group North in the capture of Leningrad.  The 11th Army was ordered south to capture Crimea.  The 6th Army was ordered to seize Kharkov and the 1st Panzer Group was ordered to seize Rostov-on-Don with the 17th Army acting as the link between the other two.  This meant that instead of the armies converging on some decisive objective, they were instead spreading themselves out leading to thinly defended sectors and dangerous gaps, areas ripe for counterattacks.  To the German officer core, Hitler's decisions were strategic madness.

===Phase 2: Battle for Smolensk (3 July – 5 August 1941)===

On 3 July, Hitler finally gave the go-ahead for the Panzers to resume their drive east after the infantry divisions had caught up. However, a rainstorm typical of Russian summers slowed their progress and Russian defenses stiffened. The delays gave the Soviets time to organize a massive counterattack against Army Group Center. Its ultimate objective was Smolensk, which commanded the road to Moscow. Facing the Germans was an old Soviet defensive line held by six armies. On 6 July, the Soviets attacked the 3rd Panzer Army with 700 tanks. The Germans defeated this counterattack with overwhelming air superiority. The 2nd Panzer Army crossed the River Dnieper and closed on Smolensk from the south while the 3rd Panzer Army, after defeating the Soviet counterattack, closed on Smolensk from the north. Trapped between their pincers were three Soviet armies. On 18 July, the Panzer Groups came to within sixteen kilometres of closing the gap but the trap would not snap shut until 26 July. When the Panzer Groups finally closed the gap, 300,000 Red Army soldiers were captured;According to http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter5_13_08.html based on German sources (see site reference page) but liquidating the pocket took another ten days in which time 100,000 Red Army soldiers escaped to stand between the Germans and Moscow.
Four weeks into the campaign, the Germans realized they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies without attaining the expected strategic freedom of movement. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler had lost faith in encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. Hitler now believed he could defeat the Soviets by economic damage, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donets Basin and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north. He also wanted to link up with the Finns to the north.
Fedor von Bock and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa, vehemently argued in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the enemy's capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production and the center of the Soviet communications and transportation system. More importantly, intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for an all-out defense of the capital. But Hitler was adamant, and issued a direct order to Heinz Guderian, bypassing his commanding officer von Bock, to send Army Group Centre's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow.

===Phase 3: Kiev and Leningrad (5 August – 2 October 1941)===

By mid-July, below the Pinsk Marshes, the Germans had come within a few kilometers of Kiev. The 1st Panzer Army then went south while the German 17th Army struck east and trapped three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Army, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the River Desna with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two Panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.
For its final attack on Leningrad, the 4th Panzer Army was reinforced by tanks from Army Group Center. On 8 August, the Panzers broke through the Soviet defenses; the German 16th Army attacked to the northeast, the 18th Army and the Estonian guerilla Forest Brothers cleared the country and advanced to Lake Peipus.Tartu in the 1941 Summer War.

The Finns had pushed southeast on both sides of Lake Ladoga, reaching the old Finnish-Soviet frontier.
At this stage, Hitler ordered the final destruction of Leningrad with no prisoners taken, and on 9 September, Army Group North began the final push which within ten days brought it within [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of the city. However, the advance over the last [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] proved very slow and casualties mounted. At this stage, Hitler lost patience and ordered that Leningrad should not be stormed but starved into submission. Deprived of its Panzer forces, Army Group Center had remained static and was subjected to numerous Soviet counterattacks in particular the Yelnya Offensive in which the Germans suffered their first major tactical defeat since their invasion began. These attacks drew Hitler's attention back to Army Group Center and its drive on Moscow. The Germans ordered the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies to break off their siege of Leningrad and support Army Group Center on its attack on Moscow.
Before it could begin, operations in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army Group Center had swung to the south in the back of the Kiev position, while Army Group South moved to the north from its Dniepr bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet Forces in Kiev was achieved on 16 September. A savage battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. After ten days of vicious fighting, the Germans claimed over 600,000 Soviet soldiers captured. Actual losses were 452,720 men, 3,867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 Divisions of the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Soviet Armies.Glantz & House 1995, p. 77.
