[[Brother Where You Bound (song)]]

CATEGORIES: Supertramp songs, 1985 songs, Songs written by Rick Davies

Brother Where You Bound is the epic length title track to Supertramp's 1985 album of the same name.  Written and sung by keyboardist Rick Davies, it is the longest song Supertramp ever recorded clocking in at 16 and a half minutes (surpassing "Try Again" from their 1970 self titled debut album by more than three minutes).
The introduction to the track featured readings from George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The lyrics spoke about the Cold War that was happening at the time of the recording 1984/85. It was also recorded as a music video, which was filmed in the derelict Pan-Pacific Auditorium. The video was directed by Rene Daalder and aroused controversy due to its graphic violence.[tpl]Cite book|last=Melhuish|first=Martin|title=The Supertramp Book|place=Toronto, Canada|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1986|isbn=0-9691272-2-7|page=192|ref=harv|postscript=[/tpl]
An excerpt from "The Internationale" can be heard from minute 1:10.
This track features drummer Bob Siebenberg's then brother-in-law Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy on rhythm guitar. The guitar solos throughout the track were performed by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour who used his own mixing system where he controlled every sound that went from his guitar onto the album.  
In a 2002 radio interview on Rockline, Davies explained how Gilmour got involved on the title cut: "I remember saying to the guys, 'We need to find somebody that can play a bit like Gilmour' for the guitar stuff, and I think it was someone at A&M - it might have been Jordan Harris or somebody, one of those guys - and he said, 'Well, I know David - maybe he would like to come over and do it,' and he sent him a demo and he decided he'd like to do it and he was very reasonable. Came over, brought all his gear and straight to the studio. It was a home studio, my studio, and we did it."
