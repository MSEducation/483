Stanisław Mlotkowski (April 19, 1829 - August 19, 1900) was a Polish military officer in the 1846 insurrection. The insurrection was unsuccessful, and he was forced into exile, escaping to Hungary, then Paris, then to the United States. He lived in Philadelphia as a painter until the Civil War broke out and he enrolled as a lieutenant on September 11, 1861. He was promoted to captain of the Pennsylvania Light Artillery at Fort Delaware. He gained a reputation for his kindness towards Confederate prisoners-of-war who were consigned to the fort. Confederate prisoners called him a "Black Republican", meaning he was pro-abolitionist at heart, and shared ideological sympathies with the Union cause. Prisoners observed that "his fairness, his respect for the rights of others and his determination to recognize the goodness of human beings was exemplary." Following the war, he joined a group of the Grand Army of Republican veterans and helped develop the Atlantic coast resort at Egg Harbor City, New Jersey.
