==Geography==

The union territory of Puducherry consists of four small unconnected districts: Pondicherry, Karaikal and Yanam on the Bay of Bengal and Mahé on the Arabian Sea. Pondicherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, both as part of Tamil Nadu. Yanam and Mahé are enclaves of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala respectively. The territory has an area of [tpl]convert|492|km2[/tpl]: Pondicherry 293 km², Karaikal 160 km², Mahé 9 km² and Yanam 30 km². Its 2011 population was 1,244,464.
Some of Puducherry's enclaves are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called pockets in India. The Pondicherry district is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. The Mahé district is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.

===Rivers===

All four districts of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in Pondicherry district, seven in Karaikal, two in Mahé and one in Yanam drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.

==History==

The earliest recorded history of Puducherry can be traced back to the 2nd century. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions a marketplace named Poduke (ch. 60), which G. W. B. Huntingford identified a site about 2 miles from the modern Pondicherry as possibly the location of Arikamedu (now part of Ariyankuppam). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937, and archaeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was "a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century AD".[tpl]cite book|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZwPQAACAAJ|date=July 2007|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-548-20943-1 |page=119[/tpl]

==French influence==

The city of Puducherry based on the French grid pattern and features perpendicular streets. The town is divided into two sections: the French Quarter (Ville Blanche or 'White town') and the Indian quarter (Ville Noire or 'Black Town'.) Many streets retain French names, and French-style villas are a common sight. In the French quarter, the buildings are typically colonial style with long compounds and stately walls. The Indian quarter consists of houses lined with verandas and with large doors and grills. These French and Indian style houses are preserved from destruction by an organisation named INTACH. The French language can still be seen and heard in Puducherry.
Puducherry has a large number of Indian and a small number of non-Indian descent residents with French passports. These are descendants of those who chose to remain French when the French establishment presented the residents with an option to either remain French or become Indians at the time of Puducherry's transfer to India in 1954.
Apart from the monuments pertaining to the French period, a French Consulate is in Puducherry along with several cultural organisations. Another important building is Le Foyer du Soldat legion hall for soldiers who served in French wars.
Among the French cultural organisations, the French Institute of Pondicherry, the Puducherry Centre of the École française d'Extrême-Orient and a branch of the Alliance Française are noteworthy. A French-medium school system, the Lycée Français de Pondichéry, continues to operate under the aegis of the French Minister of National Education.

==Official languages of government==

The official languages of Puducherry are Tamil (89%), Malayalam (4.8%), Telugu and (2.9% Yanam). The status of each language varies by district. When communicating between districts of different languages, generally English is used for convenience.
French remained the de jure official language of Puducherry U.T by the Article XXVIII of the Treaty of Cession, which states that:
 "The French language shall remain the official language of the Establishments so long as the elected representatives of the people shall not decide otherwise" versionLe français restera langue officielle des Établissements aussi longtemps que les représentants élus de la population n'auront pas pris une décision différente version)

==Government and administration==

Puducherry is a Union Territory of India rather a state, which implies that governance and administration falls directly under federal authority. However, along with Delhi, Puducherry is one of two union territories in India that is entitled by special constitutional amendments to have an elected legislative assembly and a cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood.
The Centre is represented by the lieutenant governor, who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory's financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer. Consequently, Puducherry has at various times, enjoyed lower taxes, especially in the indirect category.

===Special administration status===

According to the Treaty of Cession of 1956, the four territories of former French India territorial administration is permitted to make laws with respect to specific matters. In many cases, such legislation may require ratification from the federal government or the assent of the President of India.
Article II of the Treaty states:
 "The Establishments will keep the benefit of the special administrative status which was in force prior to 1 November 1954. Any constitutional changes in this status which may be made subsequently shall be made after ascertaining the wishes of the people."

"Prince Pondicherry" is an Indian character from Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. The prince orders Willy Wonka to build a palace of chocolate in India, which then melts in the hot sun.
It is the place where Sri Aurobindo and the Mother chose to stay. Their writings remain a tremendous source of spiritual awakening that emphasises the progress of humanity and its spiritual brotherhood. A unique experimental city, Auroville, the brainchild of the Mother, whose inhabitants are drawn from all parts of the world, is situated on the outskirts of the city. Puducherry, which still carries several marks of French culture and heritage, was also the place where the national poet Shri Subramania Bharathiar wrote several of his masterpieces that fanned the flames of freedom and also enriched modern Tamil literature.
