==United States Army Initial Military Training Center of Excellence==

The United States Army Initial Military Training (DCG, IMT) organization was created by an act of Congress on September 24, 2009; under the US Army Training and Doctrine Command located at Fort Eustis in Newport News, Virginia. The Initial Military Training Center of Excellence (IMT CoE) was created as a separate, stand-alone organization to maintain senior-level oversight of training related issues. The IMT CoE's intent is to motivate Soldiers to become dedicated, productive, and qualify in warrior tasks.  The knowledge and the training conducted during this period of time teaches Soldiers about the Army's place in a democratic society, inspires the warrior ethos and introduces the Army Values.[tpl]cite web|title=The Seven Army Values|url=http://www.history.army.mil/LC/The%20Mission/the_seven_army_values.htm|work=US Army Center of Military History website|publisher=US Army|accessdate=13 February 2013|date=27 June 2011[/tpl]
The IMT CoE is the official command component responsible Army's Initial Entry Training (IET); which is commonly referred to as "Basic Training" or BCT for enlisted soldiers. The term "Boot Camp" pertains to the United States Marine Corps. The IMT CoE develops policies to improve and standardize training for Basic Combat Training (BCT), Advanced Individual Training (AIT), One Station Unit Training (OSUT) and the second phase of the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC).[tpl]cite web|title=Basic Combat Training|url=http://www.goarmy.com/life/basic/index.jsp|work=Go Strong - US Army website|publisher=US Army|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Advanced Individual Training |url=http://www.goarmy.com/life/advanced_individual_training.jsp |work=Go Strong - US Army website |publisher=US Army |accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl]
