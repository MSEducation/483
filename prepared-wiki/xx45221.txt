The Račak massacre ([tpl]lang-al|Masakra e Reçakut[/tpl],  [tpl]lang-sr|Акција Рачак, Akcija Račak[/tpl], "Operation Račak") was the mass killing of 45 Kosovo Albanians in the village of Račak ([tpl]lang-al|Reçak[/tpl]) in central Kosovo. The killings were a deliberate massacre of civilians perpetrated by Serbian security forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-01.htm |title=Under Orders (Human Rights Watch) |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] The order for the massacre may have come from Slobodan Milošević's office.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bellamy|title=Reconsidering Rambouillet|journal=Contemporary Security Policy|date=April 2001|volume=22|issue=1|pages=31–56|doi=10.1080/13523260512331391056[/tpl] The Serb government refused to let a war crimes prosecutor visit the site,[tpl]cite web|title=A Kosovo Chronology|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl] and maintained that the casualties were all members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army killed in combat with state security forces.
The killings were a major factor in NATO deciding to use force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to end its campaign of violence against Kosovo Albanians. The incident was the subject of three forensic reports: One Yugoslaian, another Belarusian and the third Finnish. The first two, which were commissioned by the Yugoslav government, concluded that those killed were, in fact, not civilians.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/258529.stm | work=BBC News | title=Pathologist: 'No Kosovo massacre' | date=19 January 1999[/tpl]

==Background==

Račak is a small Albanian-inhabited village in the Štimlje municipality of southern Kosovo. By 1998 it had become the scene of activity by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA, or UÇK after its Albanian name). It had a population of around 2,000 people prior to the displacement of most of its inhabitants during Yugoslav military activity in the summer of 1998. By January 1999, around 350 people were reported by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to be living in the village. The KLA was highly active in the region and almost certainly had a presence in Račak itself, with a base near a local power plant.Kosovo/Kosova: As Seen, As Told, "Part V: The Municipalities - Stimlje/Shtime", OSCE, 1999
During the year, the KLA conducted a number of illegal actions in the area, including a number of kidnappings and arson attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/2002-05/25/326656.html |title=Žrtve albanskog terorizma na Kosovu i Metohiji (Ubijena, oteta i nestala lica, januar 1998 - novembar 2001) |publisher=Arhiva.srbija.gov.rs |date=2002-05-25 |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] On 8 and 10 January, the KLA mounted attacks on Serbian police posts in the neighboring municipalities of Suva Reka and Uroševac, killing four Serbian policemen. In response, Yugoslav security forces established a security cordon in the immediate area of the attacks and around Račak and its neighboring communities.
On 15 January, reports were received by the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), an unarmed observer force from the OSCE, of civilians being killed in Račak. KVM monitors attempted to gain access to the area but were refused permission by security forces despite strong protests. Instead, they watched the fighting from a nearby hill. They later gained access to the village, where they found one dead man and a number of injured people and received reports of other deaths and of people being taken away by the Serbian security forces. They were denied permission to interview the villagers or explore the area around the village.
The monitors finally gained access to the surrounding area on 16 January. Accompanied by a number of foreign journalists and members of the European Union's Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM), they found a total of 40 bodies in and around the village. Another five bodies had allegedly been removed by family members. In all, 45 were reported killed, including a 12-year-old boy and three women. All had been shot and the KVM team reported that it found several bodies decapitated. KVM head William Walker later described what he had seen:
Walker immediately condemned what he labelled "an unspeakable atrocity" which was "a crime very much against humanity"."Nato crisis talks on massacre", BBC News, January 17, 1999 He told the party of journalists accompanying him: "I do not hesitate to accuse the (Serb) government security forces. We want to know who gave the orders, and who carried them out. I will insist that justice will be done. They certainly didn't deserve to die in circumstances like this."
The journalists also provided first-hand accounts of the discovery of the bodies. One of them, the BBC's reporter Jacky Rowland, reported that the dead "were all ordinary men; farmers, labourers, villagers. They had all been shot in the head."Jacky Rowland. "Kosovo massacre: 'A twisted mass of bodies'" BBC News, 16 January 1999 The dead were aged from 14 to 99 years old."Kosovo: a divided land where hatred is passed down the generations". The Times, 8 December 2007 ITN's correspondent Bill Neely was also present and described how other KVM monitors reacted at the scene: "A Swedish monitor notes that the dead are all in civilian clothes and unarmed and that there are no signs of a battle... After working for two hours one monitor, a London police officer, tells me he believes many of the victims have been shot at close range."Bill Neely. "Serbs rewrite history of Račak massacre", The Independent, 23 January 1999
Two days later, on 18 January, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Louise Arbour, attempted to enter Kosovo to investigate the killings but was refused access by Serb authorities."Serbs snub massacre probe", BBC News, 19 January 1999 On the same day, heavily armed Serbian police entered Račak under fire from the KLA, and removed the bodies, taking them to a morgue in Pristina to await a forensic examination.Tom Walker. "Serbs take village massacre bodies", The Times, 19 January 1999
A joint Yugoslavian-Belarusian team of pathologists conducted post-mortems at the end of January. A Finnish forensic team working for the European Union subsequently conducted a second post-mortem, which was more detailed but less contemporaneous than the first. The bodies were finally released to the families and buried on 10 February."Kosovo bodies returned". Irish Times, 11 February 1999

==Investigations==

The killings at Račak became the focus of an investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In its indictment of Slobodan Milošević and four other senior Yugoslav and Serbian officials, the ICTY's Chief Prosecutor stated that:
Eyewitness reports from the surviving villagers unanimously supported the account of a massacre. The British journalist Julius Strauss, writing for the Daily Telegraph, described how he had "spent more than a week collecting evidence on the Račak massacre from Albanian witnesses, Western monitors and diplomats and a few Serb sources who spoke privately and at some risk."Julius Strauss. "Massacre that started long haul to justice". Daily Telegraph, 26 June 2001 According to the survivors that he interviewed, "a small group of men dressed all in black and wearing gloves and balaclavas ... co-ordinated the attack on the village and the subsequent executions." Men had been separated from women and children before being led away to be executed. One survivor told him that "some of the Serbs were in blue, some in black. The men in black appeared to be in control and wore balaclavas over their heads. Some had uniforms with insignia which included a Serbian flag; some had none. They carried automatic guns and, as we were led up the hill, both units started shooting us." Strauss speculated that the men had been from the Specijalna Antiterroristicka Jedinica, the Serbian Interior Ministry's elite anti-terrorist unit.Julius Strauss. "Military 'death squads' behind Kosovo massacre". Daily Telegraph, 27 January 1999 Some eyewitnesses told reporters that "Serb troops shot and mutilated their victims, and the six-hour orgy of violence ended with a nationalist song."Garentina Kraja. "Massacre village outraged by defence video". The Guardian, 15 February 2002
The Serb government rejected this version of events. On the day after the killings, the Serbian Interior Ministry issued a statement asserting that its police units had come under fire from "ethnic Albanian terrorist groups ... on routes leading to Račak village in the Stimlje municipality." In the subsequent counter-attack "several dozen terrorists were killed in the clashes with the police. Most of them were in uniforms bearing the insignia of the ethnic Albanian terrorist organization calling itself the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)." "Serbs say terrorists killed at Račak". Report by state news agency Tanjug, translated by BBC Monitoring. 16 January 1999
They received some support from the French newspapers Le Figaro and Le Monde, which suggested that the KLA could have fabricated evidence. A film crew working for the Associated Press accompanied the Serb forces in Račak for part of 15 January. Two French journalists from the Agence France Press and Le Figaro interviewed the cameramen and saw at least some of the footage, from which they concluded that it was possible that the KLA could have staged the massacre, and that "only a credible international inquiry would make it possible to resolve those doubts." According to the paper,
Another French journalist writing for Le Monde, Christophe Chatelot, gave an account from the perspective of the two AP journalists:
The Serbian President, Milan Milutinović, accused the KVM head William Walker of fabricating the killings "by securing the co-operation of his protegés in the Kosovo Liberation Army"."Serbs launch war of words against US". Financial Times, 18 January 1999 The Serbian media took a similar line, arguing that the Albanians had removed the KLA uniforms from the bodies and replaced them with civilian clothes. Unnamed French diplomats also criticised Walker for publicly blaming the Serbs for the killings, arguing that he should have waited for a more thorough investigation."Kosovo on the brink, again". The Economist, 23 January 1999. Walker was also attacked by the Serbian media for his role as a US diplomat in Central America in the 1980s, at a time when the involvement of the US in a number of civil and political conflicts in the region was a subject of major controversy.Daniel McLaughlin. "Albanians demand independence now in massacre village", Belfast Telegraph, 8 December 2007
At the end of January 1999, the United States was reported to have leaked telephone intercepts that were said to prove the role of the Serb government in the killings. According to the Washington Post, the intercepts showed that the Serb government had ordered security forces to "go in hard" to the Račak area. Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Šainović and Interior Ministry General Sreten Lukić reportedly expressed concern about reaction to the Račak assault and discussed how to make the killings at Račak appear to be the result of combat between government troops and KLA rebels. On the day of the attack on Račak, Sainović was aware that the assault was underway and asked how many people had been killed. Lukić replied that as of that moment the tally stood at 22. Following the international uproar about the killings, Sainović told Lukić to re-enter Račak and retrieve the bodies. He also told Lukić that the ICTY prosecutor Louise Arbour was not to be allowed into the country.R. Jeffrey Smith. "Serbs Tried To Cover Up Massacre; Kosovo Reprisal Plot Bared by Phone Taps".

===Forensic reports===

Three forensic examinations were carried out on the bodies, by separate teams from FR Yugoslavia, Belarus (at the time an ally of Serbia) and Finland (under the auspices of the European Union). The three reports did not differ significantly regarding any of the forensic facts.http://web.archive.org/web/19991116063236/http://www.usia.gov/regional/eur/balkans/kosovo/texts/racak.htm EU Forensic Expert Team report All three examinations took place in controversial circumstances; the Yugoslav and Belarussian forensic teams carried out their autopsies against the opposition of the KVM and ICTY, which had demanded that the outside experts from Finland should be the first to carry out post-mortems on the dead. The Yugoslav and Belarussian autopsies were conducted on 19 January under the auspices of the Pristina Forensic Medical Institute. Its director, Professor Saša Dobričanin, stated that "Not a single body bears any sign of execution. The bodies were not massacred." He told the media that he suspected that the bodies had been mutilated posthumously to fabricate the appearance of an execution."Pathologist: 'No Kosovo massacre'". BBC News, 19 January 1999
The European Union team, headed by Dr. Helena Ranta, began its own autopsy on 21 January."Račak killings: Who says what?" BBC News, 22 January 1999 The team released its initial findings on 17 March. However, the introduction of this report stresses that this is not the position of the team, but only of Dr. Helena Ranta. The report concluded that "there was no evidence that the victims had been anything other than unarmed civilians and that they had probably been killed where they were later found by the international monitors.""Račak killings 'crime against humanity'". BBC News, 17 March 1999 Addressing the claims that the dead had been killed wearing KLA uniforms which had then been replaced with civilian clothes, the report states that "...the clothing the dead bore no badges or insignia of any military unit. No indication of removal of badges of rank or insignia was evident. Based on autopsy findings (e.g. bullet holes, coagulated blood) and photographs of the scenes, it is highly unlikely that clothes could have been changed or removed." "Report of the EU Forensic Team on the Račak Incident", 17 March 1999. Quoted in Marc Weller, The Crisis in Kosovo 1989-1999, pp. 333-335. ISBN 1-903033-00-4 Dr. Ranta testified at the subsequent war crimes trial of Slobodan Milošević, stating that retrieved bullets, bullet casings and entry and exit wounds indicate that the victims were killed where their bodies were found and at approximately the same time. A later Finnish report showed that only one victim had provably been shot at close range.http://racak.about.vg/racakautopsies.htm Independent forensic autopsies in an armed conflict: investigation of the victims from Račak, KosovoJ. Rainio,  a, K. Lalua, b and A. Penttiläa
The report from the Finnish team, however, was kept confidential by the EU until long after the war, and the team leader, Helena Ranta, issued a press release at the time containing her "personal opinion" and indicating differing and opposite findings. Ranta stated that "...medicolegal investigations as scientific analysis of bodies cannot give a conclusive answer to the question whether there was fact a battle the police and insurgents...", but she leaned towards the victims being non-combatants in part because "...no ammunition was found in the pockets" of the bodies she investigated. The report was widely understood as saying that the Finnish team had disproved the finding released by the Yugoslav and Belarusian pathologists, whose tests had shown a positive for gunshot residue on the hands of 37 out of the 40 bodies, indicating that they had fired arms.
Criticism was levelled against the paraffin method used by the Yugoslav and Belarusians to test for powder residue on the victims' hands, since it regularly gives false positives because of many other substances, including fertilizers, tobacco, urine and cosmetics, and even provides false negatives on occasion.http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ptest.txt  The test is still used by the police of many countries who cannot afford more modern methods, but has been described since as early as 1967 as 'of no use scientifically.' Cowan, M. E., Purdon, P. L. A study of the "paraffin test." J. Forensic Sci. 12(1): 19-35, 1967.
The international reaction to the Yugoslav and Belarusian report on one hand, (which supported the view that those killed were KLA fighters, not civilians as claimed by the Kosovo-Albanians and NATO) and that of the EU expert team on the other, (which did not find any evidence to suggest that the dead were combatants)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20030313IE2 |title=HS Foreign 13.3.2003 - Helena Ranta testifies at Milosevic trial in The Hague |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] differed considerably, not least in the NATO-countries who were preparing to intervene to stop widespread human rights violations in Kosovo. The former was ignored or dismissed as propaganda, and the latter was accepted as truth; evidence of a massacre against civilians. Several pro-war activists and writers wrote of, and quoted, the Finnish team's press-release as if it were the actual report. Both reports were used as evidence by the prosecution and particularly by the defence of the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević in his trial at The Hague, until the Račak case was dropped out of the indictment because of lack of evidence.
The full report of the EU team was handed over to the ICTY at the end of June 2000. An executive summary was published in 2001, but the full report has never been released.Official Journal of the European Union, C 261 E, 18 September 2001 P. 0069 - 0070
In October 2008, Helena Ranta, the Finnish pathologist who had conducted the forensic examination on the Račak casualties, stated that she had been pressured to modify the contents of her report, both by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by William Walker, the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo Verification Mission, in order to make more explicit the role of Serb troops in the incident. She refused to do so.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135240292632 |title= Helena Ranta: Foreign Ministry tried to influence Kosovo reports |accessdate=23 April 2009 |date= 16 October 2008 |work= Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition |publisher= Helsingin Sanomat Oy [/tpl]

==Consequences==

Many western governments, human rights groups and international organisations insisted that the Račak incident was a deliberate massacre, conducted in defiance of earlier Serb agreements to end the violence in Kosovo. The OSCE, Council of Europe, European Union, NATO and the United Nations Security Council "Security Council Strongly Condemns Massacre Of Kosovo Albanians In Southern Kosovo", United Nations Security Council Press Release SC/6628, 19 January 1999 all issued strongly worded statements condemning the killings. On January 22, the Contact Group of countries with an interest in Yugoslavia (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States) issued a joint statement condemning "the massacre of Kosovo Albanians in Račak on 15 January. All members expressed their revulsion at this act of mass murder. No amount of provocation could justify it. The Contact Group condemns UCK provocations which can only contribute to rising tensions and further violence... The Contact Group also condemns the decisions by the FRY authorities to refuse entry into Kosovo by ICTY Chief Prosecutor Judge Arbour." The Contact Group also called for the Yugoslav authorities to "work with the International Tribunal to ensure that those responsible for Račak are brought to justice and suspend those VJ and MUP officers operating in Račak on 15 January pending the results of this investigation becoming available"."Contact Group, Chairman's Conclusions, London, 22 January 1999", in Heike Krieger, The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation 1974-1999, p. 197. Cambridge University Press, 2001
The United Nations also condemned the killings, with the Security Council and Secretary General describing them on January 31 as a massacre perpetrated by Yugoslav security forces.
The ICTY issued a sealed indictment on May 27, 1999 for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war against a number of senior Yugoslav officials. These were Slobodan Milošević (President of Yugoslavia), Milan Milutinović (President of Serbia), Nikola Šainović (Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister), Dragoljub Ojdanić (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army) and Vlajko Stojiljković (Serbian Interior Minister).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/7765 |title=TPIY : President Milosevic and Four other Senior Fry Officials Indicted for Murder, Persecution and Deportation in Kosovo |publisher=ICTY |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] The Račak massacre was added by the ICTY prosecutors in an amended indictment,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/ind/en/mil-2ai011029e.htm |title=Milosevic et al. "Kosovo" - Second Amended Indictment |publisher=Icty.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] but was subsequently dropped from the case, due to lack of evidence to support the accusation.
On June 18, 2001, a court in Pristina sentenced Zoran Stojanović, a 32-year-old police officer, to 15 years imprisonment for murder and attempted murder in Račak. Stojanović, a Kosovo Serb, was convicted by a joint UN-Kosovo Albanian panel of judges (two United Nations magistrates and one ethnic Albanian).[tpl]Cite news|title=Serb Guilty In Deaths Of 45|publisher=New York Times|date=2001-06-19[/tpl] Stojanović's trial was highly controversial. It was speedy, one of the first trials by a hastily organized new court. Stojanović was alleged to have killed one man and wounded two more by firing one single bullet. During the trial, both international judges and the Albanian judge had wanted to dismiss the case, but they changed their minds later, allegedly for political reasons and due to presence of intimidation. During the trial, all six witnesses of the prosecution were rebuffed, none of them telling the same story - four of them had repeatedly changed their testimonies during the trial, while the remaining two had presented testimonies that contradicted all known forensic evidence, suggesting that they had very little involvement with the case.
The reconstruction of events in Račak was prevented by two armed Albanians, one with a Kalashnikov and the another with a pistol, who chased off court officials, telling them, "we don't want any cockroachs (Serbs) in our village." The second reconstruction was prevented by an angry mob of Albanians. A subsequent reconstruction was held without the presence of both the defendant and his lawyer. The prosecutor, Tome Gashe, threatened the court during the trial that unless he is found guilty, innocent blood will be spent and the people will "take justice in their own hands". The sentencing of Stojanović was condemned and deemed unlawful by the United Nations and Amnesty International.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jun/20/warcrimes.balkans | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Amnesty and UN staff accuse Kosovo war crimes tribunal of ethnic bias | date=20 June 2001 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=Nicholas | last=Wood[/tpl] Despite announcements of a dismissal, Stojanović's sentence remained. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened the question as to whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/77430/Tadi%C4%87+pomilovao+Zorana+Stanojevi%C4%87a%2C+koji+je+u+Pri%C5%A1tini+osu%C4%91en+na+15+godina.html |title=Press Online :: Vesti dana - politika, skupstina, Srbija, Tadić, vlada, premijer :: Tadić pomilovao Zorana Stanojevića, koji je u Prištini osuđen na 15 godina |publisher=Pressonline.rs |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2013-02-05[/tpl] Stojanović's ethnic Albanian wife and their two children have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians consider her a traitor for marrying a Serb.
Due to lack of evidence, Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and released from custody. As of 2011, no one has been found guilty of participation in the Račak massacre and no known investigations are currently being held.
