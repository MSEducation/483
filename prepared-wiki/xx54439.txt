Marlborough was married twice. His first wife was the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, whom he married at Saint Thomas Church in New York City on 6 November 1895. They had two sons, John Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, eventually the 10th Duke of Marlborough, and Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill. Their mother famously referred to them as "the heir and the spare".
The Vanderbilt dowry was used to restore Blenheim Palace and replenish its furnishings and library, as many of the original contents had been sold over the course of the 19th century. Many of the jewels worn by subsequent Duchesses of Marlborough also date from this period. 
The 9th Duke employed the landscape gardener Achille Duchene to create the water garden on the terrace at Blenheim.[tpl]Cite book | author=Pevsner, Nikolaus| authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |author2=Sherwood, Jennifer| title=The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire | year=1974 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | isbn=0-14-071045-0 | pages=459–475[/tpl] The couple were divorced in 1921 and the marriage was annulled by the Vatican five years later.
