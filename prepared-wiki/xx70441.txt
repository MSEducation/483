The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR) is a divergent tectonic plate boundary located on the seafloor of the South Pacific Ocean, separating the Pacific Plate from the  Antarctic Plate.  It is regarded as the southern section of the East Pacific Rise in some usages, generally south of the Challenger Fracture Zone and stretching to the Macquarie Triple Junction south of New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|title=Pacific-Antarctic Ridge|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437577/Pacific-Antarctic-Ridge|publisher=www.britannica.com|accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]
