The first USS ''New Orleans'' was a ship-of-the-line intended for use by the United States Navy in the War of 1812. She was never finished.
New Orleans was laid down on 15 December 1814 by Henry Eckford and Adam and Noah Brown at Sackets Harbor, New York. She was intended for U.S. Navy use on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812 and was the largest of the ships Eckford built at Sackets Harbor. If completed, she would have been the first U.S. Navy ship named New Orleans, but her construction was halted in March 1815 after the conclusion of peace with the United Kingdom. She remained on the stocks, housed over, until sold on 24 September 1883 to H. Wilkinson, Jr., of Syracuse, New York.
