==Early life and education==

Peter Eric Kormos had Slovak origins from his father, Michael, and Belgian origins from mother, Simone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://niagaraatlarge.com/2010/11/30/niagara-ontario%E2%80%99s-peter-kormos-%E2%80%93-a-rebel-with-a-cause/ |last=Draper |first=Doug |title=Niagara, Ontario’s Peter Kormos – A Rebel With A Cause |date=2010-11-30 |publisher=Niagara At Large |accessdate=2013-03-01 [/tpl] Peter was the third of six children: Michael, Elaine, Peter, Nadine, Mark, and Sam.
Kormos first attained notoriety in the Welland area while still in high school, while president of his student council.[tpl]cite news|last=Kenna|first=Kathleen|title=Blushing maverick adds color to otherwise-staid Legislature|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474297481.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+7%2C+1988&author=Kathleen+Kenna+Toronto+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.20&desc=Blushing+maverick+adds+color+to+otherwise-staid+Legislature|accessdate=2011-06-04|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1988-11-07|location=Toronto|page=A20[/tpl] Kormos led a sit-in student strike against local administration practices and students' rights. The week-long strike attracted a small minority of students while classes continued and resulted in Kormos's temporary expulsion. He was later educated at Niagara College, York University and Osgoode Hall in Toronto. Called to the bar in 1980, Kormos then worked as a barrister in the Niagara Region.[tpl]cite news|last=Keena|first=Kathleen|title=Welland vote is as dirty as mudwrestling|accessdate=2011-06-04|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1988-11-02|location=Toronto|page=A24 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474283161.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+4%2C+1988&author=Kathleen+Kenna+Toronto+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.5&desc=Ontario+NDP+wins+Welland+seat+Welland+by-election [/tpl]

==Provincial politics==

Kormos was a practicing criminal lawyer, and a local Welland city councillor in 1988, when long-time Welland Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Mel Swart decided to retire due to health reasons. Swart was a populist ONDP MPP, in a heavily unionized constituency. The constituency had a long history of electing "populist" politicians, going back to 1951 to Swart's predecessor, Ellis Morningstar.  The by-election occurred in the middle of two other major elections at the time: the Canadian General election known as the "Free Trade" election, and the Welland city council election. Kormos continued the "populist" approach pioneered by Morningstar and Swart, and won a heated – and what the The Toronto Star called,  "  vote as  dirty as mudwrestling" – election on November 3, 1988.[tpl]cite news |last=Kenna |first=Kathleen|title=Ontario NDP wins Welland seat |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474283161.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+4%2C+1988&author=Kathleen+Kenna+Toronto+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.5&desc=Ontario+NDP+wins+Welland+seat+Welland+by-election|accessdate=2011-06-04|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1988-11-04 |location=Toronto |page=A5[/tpl]

===In government 1990–1995===

The NDP won government under Bob Rae in the general election of 1990, and Kormos was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations and Minister of Financial Institutions on October 1, 1990.[tpl]cite web|title=Peter Kormos, MPP (Welland)|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5zC0kkE9i|work=Current MPPs|publisher=Ontario Legislative Assembly|accessdate=2011-06-03|location=Queen's Park|year=2011[/tpl] Notably, he was expected to implement a public auto insurance system, one of the promises of the recent election campaign. Rae had mixed feelings about appointing Kormos to his cabinet. He said in his book, Protest to Power, "It was better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. The problem was that he ended up inside the tent pissing in."[tpl]Cite book |first=Bob |last=Rae |title=From Protest to Power: Personal Reflections on a Life in Politics |publisher=Penguin Books Canada |location=Toronto |year=1996 |page=134[/tpl] Once in cabinet Rae described him as "an impossible colleague and even more difficult minister. He missed meetings, threw tantrums, and belittled his colleagues in cabinet committee."[tpl]Cite book |first=Bob |last=Rae |title=From Protest to Power: Personal Reflections on a Life in Politics |publisher=Penguin Books Canada |location=Toronto |year=1996 |page=218[/tpl]
At the same time Kormos launched a campaign against beer company advertising which he called sexist and exploitative. Somewhat inconsistently, he elicited controversy by appearing, fully clothed, as a "Sunshine Boy" model in the Toronto Sun tabloid. This was anathema to some in the party, because of the Sun's politically conservative position and because of the Sunshine Boy's place as a parallel to the  "Sunshine Girl" franchise, pictures of scantily-clothed women given considerably more prominence than the Sunshine Boy.[tpl]cite news |last=Carey |first=Elaine |title='Why should I be miserable or unhappy?' unrepentant Kormos asks |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=March 23, 1991 |location=Toronto |pages=A1-A2[/tpl]  Due to the situation, Rae fired Kormos from cabinet on March 18, 1991, after he refused to resign.[tpl]cite book |title=Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs |year=1991 |editor=David Leyton-Brown |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1998 |page=142[/tpl]
Rae handed the auto insurance file to Brian Charlton but after considerable discussion, the party backed away from this goal, against considerable opposition from the outspoken Kormos and other party members, including Swart and Kormos' supporter and fellow MPP Mark Morrow.
For the remainder of Rae's term in office, Kormos acted as an unofficial "left opposition" within the NDP caucus, together with Morrow and, until his resignation, Anglican priest Dennis Drainville. In 1993, this group and former cabinet minister Karen Haslam were the only NDP MPPs to vote against the Rae government's Social Contract legislation.
The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, though Kormos's personal popularity was such that he was re-elected without difficulty.

===In opposition 1995–2011===

After Rae's retirement, Kormos sought the leadership of the Ontario NDP at the convention held on June 22, 1996.[tpl]cite news|last=Girard|first=Daniel|title=Battling out for top NDP job|accessdate=211-06-3|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1996-06-11|page=A19[/tpl] He placed third, behind Frances Lankin and Howard Hampton. He threw his support to Hampton, which played significantly in Hampton's victory.[tpl]cite news|last=Girard|first=Daniel|title=Hampton takes over as Ontario's NDP leader|accessdate=2011-06-03|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1996-06-23|pages=A1, A6[/tpl]
In 1996, Kormos was charged with assaulting a security guard at the Family Support Services office in Downsview, Ontario. Kormos challenged the charges on the basis that the prosecution amounted to an abuse of the court’s process by the Attorney General, but his challenge was dismissed by the court.[tpl]cite court |litigants = R. v.

He was widely expected to contest the leadership in 2009, following Hampton's retirement, but instead supported the successful candidacy of Andrea Horwath.[tpl]cite web|last=Haines|first=Mike|title=Kormos endorses Horwath for NDP leadership|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2009/06/c6326.html|work=NDP Caucus Services|publisher=Canadian News Wire|accessdate=2011-06-03|location=Queen's Park|date=2009-02-06[/tpl]
Kormos served as House Leader for the Ontario NDP Caucus from 2001 until his retirement in 2011 and also held numerous critic portfolios in Opposition, including Justice, Community Safety and Correctional Services, Consumer and Business Services, Labour, and Democratic Renewal. On June 3, 2011, Kormos announced that he was not running for office again, and would retire after 23 years at the Legislative Assembly.[tpl]cite news|last=Talaga|first=Tanya|title=NDP's Peter Kormos to retire|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1002223--ndp-mpp-peter-kormos-to-retire?bn=1|accessdate=2011-06-03|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=2011-06-03[/tpl]
In 2005, the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada honoured several Ontario MPPs whose support of mentoring programs in their ridings have made a great difference in the organization's ability to provide one-on-one mentoring to children and youth. Peter Kormos was one of them.[ref]

==Niagara Regional Council==

Kormos was elected to Niagara Regional Council in a municipal by-election on March 26, 2012, filling the seat vacated by Cindy Forster when she won election to succeed Kormos in the Legislative Assembly. He remained a member of the law firm Kormos and Evans.[tpl]cite web |title=Kormos and Evans |url=http://www.canadalawyerlist.com/firm/12980.html |publisher=Canada Lawyer List |accessdate=2013-04-01 [/tpl] Kormos was an active member of the council until his death, taking part in arrangements for a public meeting, to be held in March 2013 to discuss whether Niagara's municipal governments should be amalgamated into a regional government.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2013/01/16/kormos-fears-governance-bitch-session |title=Kormos fears governance ‘bitch session’ |last=Benner |first=Allan |publisher=Welland Tribune |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-04-01 [/tpl]

==Death==

Peter Kormos had some health problems in the years approaching his death. In 2011, he was absent from the legislature for several months just before the provincial election and he chose not to run again for MPP.
He collapsed in Toronto on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, and was taken to hospital. However, he checked himself out and returned to Welland.[ref]
