[[Aneuretinae]]

CATEGORIES: Aneuretinae, Subfamilies of the Formicidae

The Aneuretinae are a subfamily of ants consisting of a single extant species, Aneuretus simoni (Sri Lankan relict ant), and 9 fossil species. Earlier, the phylogenetic position of A. simoni was thought to be intermediate between primitive and advanced subfamilies of ants, but recent studies have shown it is the nearest living relative of subfamily Dolichoderinae.
