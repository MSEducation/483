[[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]]

CATEGORIES: Disaster preparedness in the United Kingdom, Cabinet Office (United Kingdom)

The Civil Contingencies Secretariat, created in July 2001, is the department of the British Cabinet Office responsible for emergency planning in the UK.  The role of the secretariat is to ensure the United Kingdomâ€™s resilience against disruptive challenge, and to do this by working with others to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover.  Until its creation in 2001, emergency planning in Britain was the responsibility of the Home Office.
Bruce Mann is the current head of the secretariat.  He reports directly to the Cabinet Office's Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, currently Sir Richard Mottram.
The Secretariat is organised into three divisions: Assessment; Operations; and Policy.
The Civil Contingencies Secretariat provides information to the public through its website, UK Resilience.

==Head of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat==

Until 2001 the Home Office carried out emergency preparedness planning through its Emergency Planning Division, which in turn replaced the Home Defence and Emergency Services Division. From 1935 to 1971 a separate department, called the Civil Defence Department (in the early years the Air Raids Precautions Department, Ministry of Home Security), existed.
