==Herod and the Great Revolt==

Herod died in 4 BCE without leaving a designated successor, which caused Judea, Jerusalem, Galilee and Transjordan to break out into rebellion and riots. Many rebellious leaders hoped to gain power. This outbreak of rebellion demonstrated the distress of the people that resulted from poverty within the nation.[tpl]cite book|last=Cohen|first=Shaye|title=Ancient Israel From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=273[/tpl] Herod's death left a nation in social distress leading to an outbreak of riots due to the lack of a leader. During the first century CE Roman administration utilized vassal kings. However, beginning in 6 CE the use of vassal kings ended and prefects, or procurators, became common. Procurators were Roman civil service men. There are accounts of brutal and corrupt Roman procurators, like Pontius Pilate, who strained the lives of the Jews. Procurators caused many issues like stealing from non-Romans and allowing chaos by releasing people from prison.[tpl]cite book|last=Cohen|first=Shaye|title=Ancient Israel From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple|publisher=Prentice Hall|pages=273–274[/tpl] The use of procurators became problematic due to the cultural barriers between the Jews and the Roman authorities. The procurators were Roman and did not understand many of the struggles of the Jewish people, for they did not live among the Jews. Therefore, procurators were not effective in maintaining a peaceful environment in the lands that they ruled shown by continued chaos. In about 66 CE the lack of leadership that caused chaos allowed talents to be stolen from the Temple in order to pay for unpaid taxes. This led to revolt and war among priestly revolutionaries and eventually violent revolutionaries.[tpl]cite book|last=Cohen|first=Shaye`|title=Ancient Israel From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple|publisher=Prentice Hall|pages=288–289[/tpl]
