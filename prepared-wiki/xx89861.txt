Thomas Ustick Walter (September 4, 1804 – October 30, 1887), born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was an American architect, the dean of American architecture between the 1820 death of Benjamin Latrobe and the emergence of H.H. Richardson in the 1870s. He was the fourth Architect of the Capitol, responsible for adding the north (Senate) and south (House) wings and the central dome that brought the U.S. Capitol building to essentially its modern appearance.  Walter was one of the founders and second president of the American Institute of Architects.

==Early life==

Born in 1804 in Philadelphia, Walter was the son of mason and bricklayer Joseph S. Walter and his wife Deborah.[tpl]cite book|last=Frary|first=Ihna Thayer|title=They Built the Capitol|year=1940|publisher=Ayer Publishing|pages=201[/tpl]

At 15, Walter entered the office of William Strickland, studying architecture and mechanical drawing, then established his own practice in 1830.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mason, Jr. |first=George C. |title=Memoir |journal=Proceedings of the ... annual convention of the American Institute of Architects |volume=21-22 |year=1888 |pages=101–108[/tpl]

==Works==

Walter's first major commission was Moyamensing Prison, the Philadelphia County Prison. Designed as a humane model in its time, the prison was built between 1832 and 1835.
He first came to national recognition for his design of Girard College for Orphans (1833–48) in Philadelphia, among the last and grandest expressions of the Greek Revival movement.
Walter also designed mansions, banks, churches, the hotel at Brandywine Springs, and courthouses.http://www.philaathenaeum.org/tuw/  In 1836, he designed the Bank of Chester County at West Chester, Pennsylvania;[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.arch.state.pa.us/| title = Bank of Chester County, 17 North High Street, West Chester, Chester County, PA| publisher = Library of Congress, Historic American Buildings Survey, Engineering Record, Landscapes Survey Collection| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2012-11-12[/tpl] a decade later, he designed the 1846 Chester County Courthouse in Greek Revival style.dsf.chesco.org - Chester county courthouse West Chester, Pennsylvania In Lexington, Virginia, he designed the Lexington Presbyterian Church in 1843.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Lexington/117-0012_Lexington_Presbyterian_Church_1979_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Lexington Presbyterian Church|author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff |date=March 1978|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl]  In Norfolk, Virginia, he designed the Norfolk Academy in 1840.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Norfolk/122-0018_Norfolk_Academy_1969_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Norfolk Academy|author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff|date=July 1969|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl] and Accompanying photo The Tabb Street Presbyterian Church was erected at Petersburg, Virginia in 1843.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Petersburg/123-0043_Tabb_Street_Presbyterian_Church_1979_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Tabb Street Presbyterian Church |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff |date=February 1978|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl]
It has also been suggested that Walter designed the Second Empire-styled Quarters B and Quarters D at Admiral's Row in Brooklyn, New York.
Among the notable residences designed by Walter were his own home, located at High and Morton Streets in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvaniahttp://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/pj_display.cfm/107232, the Nicholas Biddle estate Andalusia (estate), Inglewood Cottage, and St. George's Hall, residence of Matthew Newkirk, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (PW&B).[tpl]cite web |url=http://pacscl.exlibrisgroup.com:48992/F/?func=direct&doc_number=000222040 |title=St. George’s Hall. graphic |publisher=The Library Company of Philadelphia |accessdate=2011-06-18[/tpl]  Walter also designed the Garrett-Dunn House in Mt.

Among his smaller designs was the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument, commissioned by the PW&B to mark the completion of the first rail line south from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==The U.S. Capitol and its dome==

By far the most famous construction of Walter's is the dome of the U.S. Capitol. By 1850, the rapid expansion of the United States had caused a space shortage in the Capitol. Walter was selected to design extensions for the Capitol. His plan more than doubled the size of the existing building and added the familiar cast-iron dome.
There were at least six draftsmen in Walter's office, headed by Walter's chief assistant, August Schoenborn, a German immigrant who had learned his profession from the ground up. It appears that he was responsible for some of the fundamental ideas in the Capitol structure. These included the curved arch ribs and an ingenious arrangement used to cantilever the base of the columns. This made it appear that the diameter of the base exceeded the actual diameter of the foundation, thereby enlarging the proportions of the total structure.[tpl]ArchINFORM|arch|73523|August Schoenborn[/tpl]
Construction on the wings began in 1851 and proceeded rapidly; the House of Representatives met in its new quarters in December 1857 and the Senate occupied its new chamber by January 1859. Walter's fireproof cast iron dome was authorized by Congress on March 3, 1855, and was nearly completed by December 2, 1863, when the Statue of Freedom was placed on top. He also reconstructed the interior of the west center building for the Library of Congress after the fire of 1851. Walter continued as Capitol architect until 1865, when he resigned his position over a minor contract dispute. After 14 years in Washington, he retired to his native Philadelphia.
Then, when financial setbacks forced him to come out of retirement in the 1870s, he worked as second-in-command when his friend and younger colleague John McArthur, Jr. won the competition for Philadelphia City Hall. He continued on that vast project until his death in 1887.

==Other Honors==

For their architectural accomplishments, both Benjamin Latrobe and Thomas U. Walter are honored in a ceiling mosaic in the East Mosaic Corridor at the entrance to the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress.
Walter's grandson, Thomas Ustick Walter III, was also an architect, practicing in Birmingham, Alabama from the 1890s to the 1910s.Fazio, Michael W. (2010) Landscape of Transformations: Architecture and Birmingham, Alabama. Knoxville, Tennessee: University of Tennessee Press ISBN 978-1-57233-687-2
