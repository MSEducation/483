[[Predual]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Functional analysis

In mathematics, the predual of an object D is an object P whose dual space is D.
For example, the predual of the space of bounded operators is the space of trace class operators. The predual of the space of  differential forms is the space of chainlets. A predual is not always guaranteed to exist, however.
