Callicephalus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, containing the single species Callicephalus nitens. It is native to the middle and low mountains of the Caucasus,Hidalgo, O., et al. (2006).

Annals of Botany 97(5), 705-14. where it has been recorded in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and Turkey.Callicephalus nitens occurrence. Euro+Med PlantBase. 2006.
The genus is considered part of the Rhaponticum group in the Asteraceae tribe Cynareae, but according to molecular analyses it has no close relatives. Its isolation in the phylogeny of the tribe suggests it is a relict taxon, one of many relict plants that grow in the Caucasus.
