==Songs and music==

Featuring a slightly matured style with this LP, the group leaned more heavily towards its harmonic roots than its "thug" origins. The tracks "She Got Crazy", "So Sad", and "Call Me" center on the members' past and present issues with women; while "Don't Stop", "Do It Again", and "Thug Stories" serve as ex-post-facto anthems. "Fire" boasts of Bone's superior flowing skills while simultaneously showcasing them. Krayzie and Layzie bite into the microphone with their signature rapid-fire delivery on the track "What You See (Reload)" as the album transitions towards a glimpse of The Thugs' evolution. "Stand Not In Our Way" flouts the temptations of "Beelzebub" and touts faith in "Yahweh" in hypnotic fashion. Reggae overtones fuel the sequel "Still No Surrender", while a great disdain for law enforcement ignites the track. The ominous narrative "This Life" rounds out the album with tales of hopelessness and a flavor unique to Bone.
