The Augustan Society, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, Florida, was founded in 1957 (1) to preserve material related to heraldry, genealogy, nobility, and orders of chivalry, and (2) to further chivalric ideals in society. The Society moved to its current location from its long-time home in California in 2007. The Society's journal, The Augustan Omnibus, is published semi-annually.
Boasting one of North America's most complete libraries of some 20,000 volumes dedicated to nobility, chivalry, genealogy, and heraldry, the Society supports research in these fields. In addition to these main goals of fostering research and promoting chivalry, the Augustan Society has sub-groups of interest available to members.

The other sub-groups are dedicated to providing kinship among members of various lineages, interests, and backgrounds. They are as follows:
The Society also holds yearly Conventions to gather members and promote research in Society areas of specialty. The 2014 gathering will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
