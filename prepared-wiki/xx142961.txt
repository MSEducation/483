Bisoctrizole (INNhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/18_4_2004_INN92.pdfhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/INN_2005_list54.pdf/USAN,http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/bisoctrizol.doc marketed by BASF as Tinosorb M, INCI methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol) is a benzotriazole-based organic compound that is added to sunscreens to absorb UV rays.
Bisoctrizole is a broad-spectrum ultraviolet radiation absorber, absorbing UVB as well as UVA rays. It also reflects and scatters UV. Bisoctrizole is a hybrid UV absorber, the only organic UV filter produced and microfine organic particles (Bisoctrizole is added to the water phase of a sunscreen as a 50% suspension, whereas mineral micropigments are usually added to the oil phase. The bisoctrizole particles are stabilized by the surfactant decyl glucoside.
Bisoctrizole shows very little photodegradation and has a stabilizing effect on other UV absorbers, octyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate) in particular.
When formulated into a sunscreen, bisoctrizole has minimal skin penetration.[tpl]cite journal| title=In vitro percutaneous absorption and in vivo stratum corneum distribution of an organic and a mineral sunscreen| year=2007| pmid=17035717| author=Mavon A, Miquel C, Lejeune O, Payre B, Moretto P| journal=Skin Pharmacol Physiol| volume=20 | pages=10–20| doi=10.1159/000096167| issue=1[/tpl] Unlike some other organic sunscreen actives, it shows no estrogenic effects in vitro.[tpl]cite journal| title=Lack of binding to isolated estrogen or androgen receptors, and inactivity in the immature rat uterotrophic assay, of the ultraviolet sunscreen filters Tinosorb M-active and Tinosorb S|date=December 2001| pmid=11754532| author=Ashby J, Tinwell H, Plautz J, Twomey K, Lefevre PA| journal= Regul Toxicol Pharmacol| volume=34 | pages=287–91| doi=10.1006/rtph.2001.1511| issue=3[/tpl]
