==Background==

Dobson started writing at the age of 14, and caught the ear of Jive Records a year later. The label loved her voice and set her up with a number of producers, with an eye towards developing a pop star. But she refused the idea and left the label.[tpl]cite web|last=Plummer|first=Sean|title=FEFE DOBSON, CANADA’S LATEST TEEN MUSICAL IT GIRL, TAKES ON THE WORLD|work=accessmag.com|url=http://www.accessmag.com/Archives/68-Fefe.html|date=FEBRUARY – MARCH 2004|accessdate=2009-07-17[/tpl] After that experience, Dobson met Jay Levine and signed with Nelly Furtado’s manager Chris Smith. Smith arranged showcases with several labels. Universal Music Canada president Randy Lennox showed interest in her, and coaxed Island Def Jam CEO Lyor Cohen and his head of A&R, Jeff Fenster, to fly to Toronto for another showcase. Dobson played a showcase for Island/Def Jam; about 30 seconds into the first song —- a punk thrash track about longing, titled "Stupid Little Love Song"—-the executives were impressed and signed her.[tpl]cite web|title=Flash-forward: FeFe Dobson|work=The Observer-The Observer Music Monthly|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1150751,00.html|date=February 22, 2004|accessdate=2009-07-17[/tpl] When in the recording studio, she hung up inspirational pictures of Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, Jeff Buckley, and The Vines to help motivate her sound and to commemorate the artists who influenced her.
Dobson wrote most of the music on the album, along with producer Jay Levine. However, several other producers pitched in to help write for the album, including James Bryan McCollum. The album was written in approximately two years, mainly by Dobson herself.

==Composition==

The music heard on Fefe Dobson's debut album is generally pop-rock, as well as some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different than most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label.
The first track on the album is titled "Stupid Little Love Song". Lyrically, the song is an uptempo rock/punk song that lyrically speaks of Dobson's love for someone who is famous, stating lyrics such as "I came by taxi/you can by limousine". The second song on the album is the album's lead single, "Bye Bye Boyfriend". The song's verse is a moderately paced beat, fueled by guitar and drums. During the verse, Dobson states she's sorry for leaving her boyfriend. However, as the chorus arrives, the lyrical content and music change, becoming more uptempo and guitar driven. The lyrics also show a sudden change, as she talks of letting him go as though he was nothing special.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWlWgFkQEUY&ob=av2nm |title=Fefe Dobson - Bye Bye Boyfriend |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Take Me Away" is the third track on the album, as well as the second single (first international release). The single performed well on singles charts in the US and Canada, reaching the top 20 in Canada. It is a moderately paced pop-rock tune that lyrically speaks of running away with someone she loves.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeJ9Nvzp8VY&feature=channel |title=Fefe Dobson - Take Me Away |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Everything" is the fourth song on the album, and the third single as well. Lyrically the song revolves around Dobson asking her lover if he is ready to be committed to her and their relationship. It is her only song to chart in the UK to date, where it had minor success on their main singles chart.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7n-C5E3UxA&feature=channel |title=Fefe Dobson - Everything |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Rock It 'Til You Drop It" is the fifth song from Dobson's debut album. The single is an uptempo dance/rock track that features Tone Lōc on vocals. The song lyrically speaks of dancing on the dancefloor with a guy.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZGIff1vK48&feature=related |title=Fefe Dobson-Rock it til you drop it |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Revolution Song" is the sixth track on the album, and is one of the acoustic songs featured on the album. It has been stripped down to nothing other than Dobson's vocals and the acoustic guitar.
"Kiss Me Fool" is the seventh song placed on the album, and is yet another uptempo rock song. Lyrically the song talks of Dobson wanting her love interest to kiss her. She also questions what she must change about herself to please the man she has her eyes set on. "Unforgiven" is one of the more personal songs on the album, as well as one of the most rock driven and dark songs on the album. It talks about Dobson's father, and all of the mistakes that he made while trying to raise her. In the song, Dobson speaks of her independence, and how she never really did need him in her life. The end of the chorus shows Dobson yelling that he's "unforgiven".[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56_0VZB21hM&feature=related |title=Unforgiven - Fefe Dobson |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-11-23 |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "We Went For a Ride" is the ninth song to be placed on the album. The song is generally slower and more pop oriented than the rest of the album. The lyrics speak of riding away with her love interest, to never come back and drive away from all of their problems.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNYO2X47_jk&feature=related |title=FeFe Dobson-We Went For A Ride |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Give It Up" is the tenth track on the album. The verse of the song is generally slower and slower paced than most music on the album, however, the chorus quickly shifts to a rock driven beat filled with drums and bass. Lyrically Dobson is telling her ex that there's nothing he can do to win her back, and he should just "give it up".[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYwi7kyzY68&feature=related |title=Give It Up - Fefe Dobson |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "Julia" is another acoustic song on the album, and is reportedly about her friend who had an eating disorder.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXY5vXWoSvY&feature=related |title=Julia - Fefe Dobson |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-12-25 |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl] "8x10" is the final track listed on the album.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart. It debuted at number 111 on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually peaking at 67. Despite the minor success of the single, "Everything" in the UK, the album failed to chart there, as well as chart anywhere outside of the US and Canada.

===Critical reception===

The album was met with generally positive reviews from critics and fans. Music-Review.com stated that "Fefe doesn’t mess around. The very first song is the very best song; if “Stupid Little Love Song” was released as a single, it would blow this narrow little world wide open with its tight slashing crunching goodness. Not only is it fast and hard and funky like a Thierry Henry penalty kick, but it’s funny too: our protagonist is feeling a little outmatched by her boyfriend’s super-accomplished family, and doesn’t know how to deal: “You’re on the road to Harvard Law / I’m on the bus to Arkansas”. His mother’s a Senator, his dad’s got his own talk show, he’s a big jocky handsome guy, and all she has for him is…pause… “Just a stupid little love song!” and they all spazz out with the guitars again. I’m not saying it’s prime Clash or anything, but the way Dobson yells “Put ‘em up!” in the breaks is pretty inspiring."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.music-critic.com/rock/fefedobson_fefedobson.htm |title=Fefe Dobson - Fefe Dobson | Album Review @ Music-Critic.com : the source for music reviews, interviews, articles, and news on the internet |publisher=Music-critic.com |date=2004-06-01 |accessdate=2012-02-16[/tpl]
Johnny Loftus of allmusic.com stated in his review of the album that "...Dobson  created a rousing debut that, despite being a highly melodic and relentlessly effective pop album, is rescued from flavor-of-the-moment dissipation by a schizophrenic rock crunch and her own attractively bad attitude." He went on to say that " Fefe Dobson definitely has an opportunistic streak, and its stylistic cherry-picking can be trying. But production niceties and savvy marketing can't fake the talent Fefe has. It's her willingness to inject pop with pluck and rock as much as she flutters that makes Dobson's debut much more than just a popternative clone. Best of all, it still caters to those casual fans who won't know any better." The review ends with the album being awarded four out of five stars.

==Promotion==

During much of 2004, Dobson promoted her debut album, appearing for a live performance on TRL and numerous magazine covers and articles.
