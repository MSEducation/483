==Background==

Crawford in 1981 and 1982 coauthored a series of technical articles in BYTE on developing games for the Atari 8-bit computers. The articles were collected into De Re Atari.[tpl]cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-09/BYTE_Vol_06-09_1981-09_Artifical_Intelligence#page/n285/mode/2up | title=The Atari Tutorial / Part 1: The Display List | work=BYTE | date=September 1981 | author=Crawford, Chris | pages=284[/tpl] In December 1982 he published an article in BYTE on abstract aspects of game design, using Legionnaire as example.[tpl]cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982#page/n97/mode/2up | title=Design Techniques and Ideas for Computer Games | work=BYTE | date=December 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Crawford, Chris | pages=96[/tpl]

==Reception==

Calling the author "a master of computer game design", PC Magazine complimented Crawford using his own games as examples of success and failure, and recommended the book to both game designers and players.[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7jeH7OGPwUUC&lpg=PA66&pg=PA279#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=A Dynamic Duo | work=PC Magazine | date=1984-08-21 | accessdate=25 October 2013 | author=Wiswell, Phil; Earle, A. Scott | pages=279[/tpl] Orson Scott Card was less favorable, writing in Ahoy! that "when one of the best computer game designers in the business writes a book about computer game design, you expect it to be wonderful ... And when Art of Computer Game Design'' turned out to be merely fascinating but often shallow and sometimes just plain wrong-headed, I was disappointed".[tpl]cite news | title=How do Games Play? | work=Ahoy! | date=February 1985 | accessdate=15 October 2013 | author=Card, Orson Scott | pages=33[/tpl]
