Stewart became a free agent and signed with the Detroit Lions prior to the 2000 season. In his first year playing for the Lions, Stewart rushed for a career high 1,184 yards and 10 touchdowns. 2 years later, he had another 1,000-plus yard season (1,021). However, he was injured and did not play in 2003, and never played again due to injuries. According to Coy Wire, Stewart's injury occurred because of a bounty system established by then Buffalo Bills head coach Gregg Williams. Coy Wire stated "I shattered James Stewart's shoulder and he never played again. I was showered with praise for that. It's a shame that's how it was. Now I see how wrong that was." (Buffalo News (3/4/2012).
Stewart wore number 33 while playing at the University of Tennessee and while playing for the Jaguars. He wore number 34 while playing for the Lions.
