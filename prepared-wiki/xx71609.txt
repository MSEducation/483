[[Outline of discrete mathematics]]

CATEGORIES: Outlines, Discrete mathematics, Mathematics-related lists

The following outline is presented as an overview of and topical guide to discrete mathematics:
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.  In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers,  graphs, and statements in logicRichard Johnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008. – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[tpl]MathWorld |title=Discrete mathematics |urlname=DiscreteMathematics[/tpl] Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis.
Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical terms of art that may be encountered.
