Cider apples are a group of apple cultivars grown for their use in cider production. In the UK the Long Ashton Research Station categorised cider apples in 1903 into four main types according to the nature of their flavour components.http://www.cider.org.uk/appledat.htm  For cider production it is important that the fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. Cider apples therefore often have higher sugar levels than Dessert and Culinary apples.
Normally, ciders are blended using juice from several apple cultivars to give the best results. There are few varieties that will make a good cider all by themselves, Golden Russet is one such variety, and is prized in both single variety and multi-variety blends of cider.
Three apple cultivars from England are 'Kingston Black', 'Stoke Red', and 'Dymock Red':
Famous American cider apple cultivars are Harrison Cider Apple, 'Campfield', Hewe's Virginia Crab,Calhoun, Creighton Lee, Jr, Old Southern Apples, Blacksburg, Virginia, The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company, 1995, page 87 and Yates. The first two originated in Essex County, New Jersey before 1776.[tpl]cite book|last=William Coxe|title=A view of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees and the Management of Orchards and Cider|location=Philadelphia|year=1817[/tpl] The Hewe's was grown from early 1700s and by Thomas Jefferson in his cider orchard.

==Notes==

Cider is made in several countries and can be made from any apples. In the UK there are two distinct styles: one using dessert (eating) and culinary (cooking) apples (Eastern Counties style) and one using special cider apples used only for cider production (West Country style).  In the US, unqualified "cider" usually taken to mean apple cider, or unfiltered and unsweetened apple juice; the term "hard cider" is used to refer to the fermented alcoholic variety.
