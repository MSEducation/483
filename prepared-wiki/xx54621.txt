The Runaways were an American all-female rock band that recorded and performed in the second half of the 1970s. The band released four studio albums and one live set during its run. Among its best-known songs are "Cherry Bomb", "Hollywood", "Queens of Noise", "Neon Angels On the Road to Ruin", "California Paradise", "Dead End Justice", and the cover of the Velvet Underground’s "Rock n Roll". The Runaways, though never a major success in the United States, became a sensation overseas, e.g. in Japan, thanks to the hit single "Cherry Bomb".

==History==

===Early years===

The Runaways were formed in late 1975 by drummer Sandy West and rhythm guitarist Joan Jett after they had both introduced themselves to producer Kim Fowley, who gave Jett's phone number to West. The two met on their own at West's home and later called Fowley to let him hear the outcome. Fowley then helped the girls find other members. Two decades later he said, "I didn't put The Runaways together, I had an idea, they had ideas, we all met, there was combustion and out of five different versions of that group came the five girls who were the ones that people liked."Edgeplay: A film about The Runaways, Sacred Dogs LLC, Los Angeles, 2005 (from interviews with Fowley, Currie)
Starting as a power trio with singer/bassist Micki Steele, The Runaways began the party and club circuit around Los Angeles. They soon added lead guitarist Lita Ford who had originally auditioned for the bass spot. Steele was fired from the group, later resurfacing in The Bangles. Local bassist Peggy Foster took over on bass but left after just one month. Lead singer Cherie Currie was found and recruited in a local teen nightclub called the Sugar Shack, followed by Jackie Fox (who had originally auditioned for the lead guitar spot) on bass.

===Fame===

The Runaways were signed to Mercury Records in 1976 and their debut album, The Runaways, was released shortly after. The band toured the U.S. and played numerous sold-out shows. They headlined shows with opening acts such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Van Halen[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl]. The documentary Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways, directed by former Runaway bassist Vicki Blue (aka Victory Tischler-Blue) revealed that each girl patterned herself after her idols: Currie patterned her look after David Bowie, Jett after Suzi Quatro and Keith Richards, Ford as a cross between Jeff Beck and Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, West after Queen drummer Roger Taylor, and Fox after Kiss bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons.
Their second album, Queens of Noise was released in 1977 and the band began a world tour. The Runaways quickly became lumped in with the growing punk rock movement. The band (already fixtures on the West Coast punk scene) formed alliances with mostly male punk bands such as Blondie, The Ramones and The Dead Boys (via New York City's CBGB) as well as the British punk scene by hanging out with the likes of The Damned, Generation X and The Sex Pistols.
In the summer of 1977, their booking agent David Libert sent the group to Japan where they played a string of sold out shows. The Runaways were the number 4 imported music act in Japan at the time, behind only ABBA, Kiss and Led Zeppelin in terms of album sales and popularity[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl]. The girls were unprepared for the onslaught of fans that greeted them at the airport. The mass hysteria was later described by guitarist Jett as being "like Beatlemania".[tpl]IMDb title|0216731|Edgeplay: A film about The Runaways[/tpl] While in Japan, The Runaways had their own TV special, did numerous television appearances and released the live album Live in Japan that went gold. Also in Japan, Fox left the band shortly before the group was scheduled to appear at the 1977 Tokyo Music Festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjnhiWmjnO4&feature=PlayList&p=60AC63B879644AEC&index=0 |title=All Right You Guys (VIDEO) |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2006-07-30 |accessdate=2011-10-31[/tpl] Jett temporarily took over bass duties and when the group returned home they replaced Fox with Vicki Blue.
It was reported in 1977 that they were thrown out of a photo session by Disneyland because "one of the girls threatened one of our people with a homosexual act", cited a rep.  "They were fondling one another or something."  He also went on to say that "they were doing weird things with french fries".  However it seems while he didn't have a problem with the girls hugging, it was more "the gestures they were making... with their middle fingers"...  Lita Ford hit back saying that Cherie wasn't hugging her, "she had her arms around my neck like she was strangling..."  She also said they didn't have any french fries.Rolling Stone, July 14, 1977 - Random Notes section, page 21.
Currie then left the group after this blow-up with Ford in the fall of 1977. Jett, who had previously shared vocals with Currie, took over lead vocals full-time. The band released their fourth album, Waitin' For The Night and started a world tour with their friends The Ramones. Currie released a solo LP, Beauty's Only Skin Deep, produced by Kim Fowley, and began a separate U.S. tour, which included her identical twin sister Marie. Mercury Records chose not to release Currie's album Stateside, although it was available as a pricey import via France. In 1980, billed as Cherie and Marie Currie, the sisters released a poorly received rock album for Capitol, Messin' With The Boys, produced by Steve Lukather, who was engaged to and later married Marie Currie. Cherie had some success after The Runaways. "Since You Been Gone", a duet with Marie, off the album Messin' with the Boys charted number 95 on US charts.

===Dissolution===

Due to disagreements over money and the management of the band, The Runaways and Kim Fowley parted ways in 1977. The group quickly hired new management, Toby Mamis, who also worked for Blondie and Suzi Quatro. When the group split with Fowley, they also parted with their record label Mercury/Polygram, to which their deal was tied. In the Edgeplay documentary, members of the group (especially Fox and Currie) as well as the parents of Currie and West, have accused Fowley, and others assigned to look after the band, of broken promises as to schooling and other care, using divide and conquer tactics to keep control of the band, along with the verbal taunting of band members. The band reportedly spent much time enjoying the excesses of the rock n' roll lifestyle during this time. They partnered with Thin Lizzy producer John Alcock, after Jett's future partner Kenny Laguna turned down the job, to record their last album And Now... The Runaways.
Vicki Blue left the group due to medical problems and was briefly replaced by Laurie McAllister in November 1978. Laurie McAllister was referred to the band by her neighbor, Duane Hitchings, who played keyboards on And Now... The Runaways. Before joining The Runaways, Laurie played with Baby Roulette and the Rave Ons, who had one song released on a Kim Fowley compilation LP called Vampires From Outer Space. Laurie appeared onstage with The Runaways at their final shows in California during the last weeks of December 1978 and McAllister quit soon after in January 1979.
Disagreement between band members included the musical style; Joan Jett wanted the band to take a musical change, shifting towards punk rock/glam rock while Lita Ford, backed by drummer Sandy West, wanted to continue playing hard rock/heavy metal music. Neither would accept the other's point of view.Sherman, Dale. 20th Century Rock And Roll : Women In Rock. Collector's Guide Publishing, inc, p53 Finally, the band played their last concert[tpl]cite web|url=http://therunaways.com/wp-content/themes/the_runaways/scrapbook/year78_right1.jpg |title=The Runaways Scrapbook Year 1978|date= |accessdate=2011-10-31[/tpl] on New Year's Eve 1978 at the Cow Palace near San Francisco and officially broke up in April 1979.

==Post-breakup==

===Joan Jett===

Jett achieved the most success after the Runaways. She went on to become a partner and work with producer and former Shondell Kenny Laguna. After being rejected by 23 record labels, they formed their own label, Blackheart Records, in 1980. In doing so, Jett became one of the first female recording artists to found her own record label.[tpl]cite web|author=Tony Sauro |url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080424/A_ENTERTAIN/80423015/-1/A_ENTERTAIN04 |title=Sauro, Tony.

Jett went on to have massive success with a cover of the Arrows' song "I Love Rock 'N' Roll", as well as other hits such as "Crimson and Clover", "Bad Reputation" and "I Hate Myself For Loving You". Jett also co-starred in the 1987 film Light of Day with Michael J. Fox,[tpl]IMDb title|0093415|Light of Day[/tpl] and appeared in the 2000 Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Show as Columbia.[tpl]IMDb name|0005053|Joan Jett[/tpl] Jett is also on Rolling Stone magazine's list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

==Influence==

The Runaways' success paved the way for many successful female artists and female bands over the past 30 years, including The Go-Go's, Sahara Hotnights, L7, The Donnas, Vixen, and new French rock and roll girl band Plastiscines to enter the male-dominated arena of rock music. They are named as influences by several male and female artists, including Running Thoughts, The Germs, Courtney Love, The Adolescents, Taylor Momsen, White Flag,White Flag's Official site, and their Myspace web sites and Rhino Bucket who acknowledged The Runaways' influence on their music during their performance at the December 2006 tribute concert honoring Sandy West.

==Film==

A biographical film about the band inspired by Currie's memoir was released in 2010. Jett was one of the executive producers for the film. Actresses Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning starred as Jett and Currie, respectively. Michael Shannon played Kim Fowley. None of the band's former bass players were featured in the film; Fox did not want to be involved in any part of the film, and requested that her name be changed in the story. The fictional replacement is named Robin Robbins.[tpl]cite news |first=Matt |last=Belloni |title=The secret legal battle behind 'The Runaways'|work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 21, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/secret-legal-battle-runaways-63735[/tpl]  The film was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi,[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |title=Dakota Fanning fronts 'Runaways'; Actress also set to play vamp in 'New Moon'|work=Variety |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000849.html[/tpl] and was released to limited theaters on March 19, 2010.[tpl]IMDb title|1017451|The Runaways|(2010)[/tpl]

The film reviews were generally positive, and The Runaways currently holds a 68% FRESH rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

==New Runaways (1987)==

In the early eighties,  Gayle Welch, an ambitious 13-year-old girl from Kaitaia, New Zealand, wrote a song "Day of Age", and recorded it in Mandrell Recording Studios in Auckland, New Zealand. The resulting tape found its way to Fowley's desk. He played the Welch tape for colleague and Los Angeles deejay legend Rodney Bingenheimer who played the song on his show on radio KROQ and included it on his annual compilation of his most-liked music for the year. Also on that compilation was a song that featured Chicago-native guitarist Bill Millay.
It did not take long before Fowley, who still owned the Runaways trade mark, was putting together a new Runaways band built around Welch. Missy Bonilla was recruited from the typing pool of CBS records, Denise Pryor came from Compton and Kathrine Dombrowski ("Kathy DiAmber") was also added. Gayle was present only on tape and only on the first song on the CD, "I Want to Run With the Bad Boys". Millay played guitar, David Carr was on keyboard and a drum machine rounded out the team. Glenn Holland, also from New Zealand, a friend of both Bingenheimer and Fowley, facilitated. The album, Young and Fast[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r17064|label=Young and Fast[/tpl] was released in 1987, and was a minor hit. Welch and Millay subsequently married.
