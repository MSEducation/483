[[Laws of infernal dynamics]]

CATEGORIES: Adages

The laws of infernal dynamics are an adage about the cursedness of the universe. Attributed to Science fiction author David Gerrold, the laws are as follows:
The laws are a parody on the first and second of Newton's laws of motion in the spirit of Murphy's law.  Newton's first law of motion has here been split into two parts, the first two laws.  Newton's third law of motion is left unparodied, though a separate adage states that "for every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism."
