Daniel Harvey Patterson acquired Corona in 1875 along with Menamurtree station near Wilcannia. Patterson soon took an interest in the Broken hill mine and later became a director and Chairman of BHP.
Corona produced over 2,090 bales of wool in 1890.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44055947 |title=Union Wool |newspaper=Barrier Miner |location=Broken Hill, New South Wales |date=27 August 1890 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
Patterson sold off his pastoral interests including Corona in 1894.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/patterson-john-hunter-7983|title=Patterson, John Hunter (1841â€“1930)|author=Daniel Boadie|year=2013|accessdate=5 August 2013|publisher=Australian National University[/tpl] During the depression of the 1890s combined with falling wool prices and drought many of the properties in the area including Corona, Sturts Meadows, Mount Arrowsmith, Langwirra, Elsinora nd Thurloo fell into the hands of finance companies. Corona was acquired by Goldsborough Mort & Co Ltd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://outbacknsw.com.au/UA%20Heritage%205%20Pastoral%20Oct06.pdf|title=Unincorporated Area of NSW Heritage Study|year=2006|accessdate=12 August 2013|publisher=River Junction Research[/tpl]
The Corona Pastoral Company sold the property in 1911 to Messrs. T. L. Browne and H. H. Dutton. The station was stocked at this time with a flock of 60,000 sheep, 280 cattle and 190 horses.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88691961 |title=New South Wales pastoral properties|newspaper=Chronicle |location=Adelaide, South Australia |date=15 July 1911 |accessdate=4 August 2013 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] In 1912 when shearing was in full swing the men went on strike over a butter allowance which was not resolved until an AWU representative travelled to Corona to settle the strike.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5317927|title=Strike at Corona Station |newspaper=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide, South Australia|date=1 August 1912|accessdate=11 August 2013|page=8|publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
Sidney Kidman acquired the property in 1917.
In 1925 Corona had a flock of over 42,000 sheep.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64245561 |title=Barrier Shearing Operations |newspaper=South Australian Register |location=Adelaide, South Australia |date=9 September 1925 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
In the 1930s leases in the area were adjusted to give owners financial certainty so long as part of the lease was surrendered. Kidman did not exercise this option and the leasehold remained the same.
Fowler's Gap, which now operates as a research station, was once an out-station of Corona until 1947 when it was resumed and became a station in its own right.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fowlersgap.unsw.edu.au/content/about/fowlers-gap-arid-zone-research-station|title=Fowlers Gap arid zone research station|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=4 August 2013|publisher=University of New South Wales[/tpl]
In 1995 the property was fully stocked with 13,000 head of sheep.
Soft Rolling Skin sheep were introduced to Corona in 2001 by Peter and Tracy Botten who owned the station at the time. In the drought of 2002 the flock was down to about 300. By 2005 the wool price of over [tpl]AUD[/tpl]200 a bale more than previous years and the flock was approximately 6,500.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stockjournal.com.au/news/agriculture/livestock/sheep-meat/srs-top-success-on-corona/20392.aspx|title=SRS top success on Corona|author=Mary-Jane Angus|date=5 May 2005|work=Stock Journal|publisher=Fairfax Media[/tpl]
In 2013 the station was still owned by the owned by Bottens who were running 7,000 sheep on the property. Corona was awarded organic certification earlier the same year. It was gained in just two years rather than the normal three, because the Bottens had not used chemicals for the previous three years prior to starting certification. As a result the wool clip attained prices or up to [tpl]AUD[/tpl]1 per kilogram of wool and were fetching up to [tpl]AUD[/tpl]1,050 per bale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qualitywool.com/index.php?id=5&nid=42|title=Broken Hill organic wool fetches $1/kg premium|year=2013|accessdate=11 August 2013|publisher=Quality Wool[/tpl]
