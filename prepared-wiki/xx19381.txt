They are native to cold water in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and typically found at depths greater than [tpl]convert|50|m|ft[/tpl] in subtropical, temperate, sub-Arctic or sub-Antarctic regions.
The best known species are in the genera Macruronus and Merluccius. These are large, up to [tpl]convert|1.55|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in length (though most only reach about half that length), predatory fish inhabiting the waters of the continental shelf and upper continental slope, where they feed on small fish such as lanternfishes. Several species are important commercial fish, for example the blue grenadier (Macruronus novaezelandiae) that is fished in the southwest Pacific and the North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) that is fished off western North America.
