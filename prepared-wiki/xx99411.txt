CATEGORIES: Scientific institutions, University of California, Los Angeles

The Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS) is a research enterprise funded by the National Science Foundation based at the University of California, Los Angeles.
CENS was established at UCLA in 2002. The group conducts research primarily in the computer science subfield of embedded sensor networks. While the core research is grounded in computer science, the applications studied span a large range of fields including military applications,  ecology, seismology, security monitoring, and farming applications to name just a few. 
While it is headquartered at UCLA, the following universities and organizations also participate in CENS-led research:
