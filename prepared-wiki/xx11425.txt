Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery gray, ductile and malleable transition metal. The element is found only in chemically combined form in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.
Andrés Manuel del Río discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called "brown lead," and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element, which he named erythronium (Greek for "red") since, upon heating, most of its salts turned from their initial color to red. Four years later, however, he was (erroneously) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium. Chlorides of vanadium were generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefström who thereby proved that a new element was involved, which he named "vanadium" after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility, Vanadís (Freyja). Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds. Del Rio's lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for its vanadium content. In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element.
Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.
Large amounts of vanadium ions are found in a few organisms, possibly as a toxin. The oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity. Particularly in the ocean, vanadium is used by some life forms as an active center of enzymes, such as the vanadium bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae. Vanadium is probably a micronutrient in mammals, including humans, but its precise role in this regard is unknown.

==History==

Vanadium was originally discovered by Andrés Manuel del Río, a Spanish-Mexican mineralogist, in 1801. Del Río extracted the element from a sample of Mexican "brown lead" ore, later named vanadinite. He found that its salts exhibit a wide variety of colors, and as a result he named the element panchromium (Greek: παγχρώμιο "all colors"). Later, Del Río renamed the element erythronium (Greek: ερυθρός "red") as most of its salts turned red upon heating. In 1805, the French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils, backed by del Río's friend Baron Alexander von Humboldt, incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only an impure sample of chromium. Del Río accepted Collet-Descotils' statement and retracted his claim.[tpl]cite journal|title = The Road to Chemical Names and Eponyms: Discovery, Priority, and Credit|author = Cintas, Pedro|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 43|issue = 44|year = 2004|pmid = 15376297|doi = 10.1002/anie.200330074|pages = 5888–94[/tpl]
In 1831, the Swedish chemist Nils Gabriel Sefström rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores. Later that same year, Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Río's earlier work.[tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber das Vanadin, ein neues Metall, gefunden im Stangeneisen von Eckersholm, einer Eisenhütte, die ihr Erz von Taberg in Småland bezieht|first = N.

He called the element vanadium after Old Norse Vanadís (another name for the Norse Vanr goddess Freyja, whose facets include connections to beauty and fertility), because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces. In 1831, the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh suggested that vanadium should be renamed "rionium" after del Río, but this suggestion was not followed.[tpl]cite journal|journal = The Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural Science|first = George William|last = Featherstonhaugh|year = 1831|page=69[/tpl]
The isolation of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported the production of the metal, but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, vanadium nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen.[tpl]cite journal|title = Researches on Vanadium.

==Characteristics==

Vanadium is a medium hard, ductile, steel-blue metal. Some sources describe vanadium as "soft", perhaps because it is ductile, malleable and not brittle.[tpl]cite book|author=George F. Vander Voort|title=Metallography, principles and practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GRQC8zYqtBIC&pg=PA137|accessdate=17 September 2011|year=1984|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-0-87170-672-0|pages=137–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=François Cardarelli|title=Materials handbook: a concise desktop reference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PvU-qbQJq7IC&pg=PA338|accessdate=17 September 2011|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-668-1|pages=338–[/tpl] Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses of the elements (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids.[tpl]cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1071–1075|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Vanadium| language = German[/tpl] It is oxidized in air at about 933 K (660 °C, 1220 °F), although an oxide layer forms even at room temperature.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable isotope 51V and one radioactive isotope 50V. The latter has a half-life of 1.5×1017 years and a natural abundance 0.25%. 51V has a nuclear spin of 7/2 which is useful for NMR spectroscopy.[tpl]cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.[/tpl] 24 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 16.0 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most of which are below 10 seconds. At least 4 isotopes have metastable excited states. Electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than the 51V. For the heavier ones, the most common mode is beta decay. The electron capture reactions lead to the formation of element 22 (titanium) isotopes, while for beta decay, it leads to element 24 (chromium) isotopes.

==Compounds==

The chemistry of vanadium is noteworthy for the accessibility of the four adjacent oxidation states 2-5. In aqueous solution, vanadium forms metal aquo complexes the colours are lilac V(H2O)62+, green V(H2O)63+, blue VO(H2O)52+, yellow VO3-. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are oxidizing agents. Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives which contain the VO2+ center.
Ammonium vanadate(V) (NH4VO3) can be successively reduced with elemental zinc to obtain the different colors of vanadium in these four oxidation states. Lower oxidation states occur in compounds such as V(CO)6, [tpl]chem|V(CO)|6||-[/tpl] and substituted derivatives.
The most commercially important compound is vanadium pentoxide.  It is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid. This compound oxidizes sulfur dioxide ([tpl]chem|SO|2[/tpl]) to the trioxide ([tpl]chem|SO|3[/tpl]). In this redox reaction, sulfur is oxidized from +4 to +6, and vanadium is reduced from +5 to +4:
The catalyst is regenerated by oxidation with air:
Similar oxidations are used in the production of maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, and several other bulk organic compounds.Günter Bauer, Volker Güther, Hans Hess, Andreas Otto, Oskar Roidl, Heinz Roller, Siegfried Sattelberger "Vanadium and Vanadium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

===Oxyanions===

In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) forms an extensive family of oxyanions.  The interrelationships within this family are described by the predominance diagram, shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] p. 984 The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, [tpl]chem|VO|4|3−[/tpl], is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Analogies exist between orthovanadate and orthophosphate owing to the similarity in size and charge of phosphorus(V) and vanadium(V). Orthovanadate V[tpl]chem|O|4|3−[/tpl] is used in protein crystallography[tpl]cite journal|volume = 577|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.022|pmid = 15556602|year = 2004|title = The power of vanadate in crystallographic investigations of phosphoryl transfer enzymes|first = Irmgard|last = Sinning|journal = FEBS Letters|last2 = Hol|first2 = Wim G.J.|pages = 315–21[/tpl] to study the biochemistry of phosphate.[tpl]cite journal|volume = 181|pmc =1161148|year = 1979|title = Inhibition of human alkaline phosphatases by vanadate|first = Lorne E.|last = Seargeant|coauthors = Stinson, Robert A.|journal = Biochemical Journal|pmid=486156|issue=1|pages = 247–50[/tpl] The tetrathiovanadate VS43- is analogous to the orthovanadate ion.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] p.988
At lower pH's, the monomer HVO42- and dimer V2O7- are formed, with the monomer predominant at vanadium concentration of less than ca. 10−2M (pV > 2; pV is equal to minus the logarithm of the total vanadium concentration/M). The formation of the divanadate ion is analogous to the formation of the dichromate ion. As the pH is reduced, further protonation and condensation to polyvanadates occur: at pH 4-6 H2VO4- is predominant at pV greater than ca. 4, while at higher concentrations trimers and tetramers are formed. Between pH 2-4 decavanadate predominates, its formation from orthovanadate is represented by this condensation reaction:
In decavanadate, each V(V) center is surrounded by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only a very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species H2VO4- results in the preferential formation of the octahedral VO2(H2O)4+ species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH2(H2O)4+ is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been characterized by X-ray crystallography.
The Pourbaix diagram for vanadium in water, which shows the redox potentials between various vanadium species in different oxidation states is also complex.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Electrochimica Acta|volume = 42|year = 1997|page= 579|doi = 10.1016/S0013-4686(96)00202-2|title = Electrochemical behavior of vanadium in aqueous solutions of different pH|first = F. M.|last = Al-Kharafi|coauthors = Badawy, W. A.|issue = 4[/tpl]
Vanadium(V) also forms various peroxo complexes, most notably in the active site of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase enzymes. The species VO(O)2(H2O)4+ is stable in acidic solutions. In alkaline solutions species with 2, 3 and 4 peroxide groups are known; the last forms violet salts with the formula M3V(O2)4 nH2O (M = Li, Na, etc.), in which the vanadium has an 8-coordinate dodecahedral structure.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl], p994.[tpl]Cite book|year=1992|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Lmt3x9CyfLgC&pg=PA128|page=128|title=Catalytic oxidations with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant|author=Strukul, Giorgio|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-1771-8[/tpl]

===Halide derivatives===

Twelve binary halides, compounds with the formula VXn, are known.  VI4, VCl5, VBr5, and VI5 do not exist or are extremely unstable. In combination with other reagents, VCl4 is used as a catalyst for polymerization of dienes.  Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are Lewis acidic, especially those of V(IV) and V(V).  Many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula VXnL6−n (X = halide; L = other ligand).
Many vanadium oxyhalides (formula VOmXn) are known.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] p.993 The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride, VOF3) and VOCl3) are the most widely studied. Akin to POCl3, they are volatile, adopt a tetrahedral structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis acidic.

===Coordination compounds===

Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are relatively exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants.  Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, as is the case in V(CN)74−. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl]  The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the polyoxovanadates, such as decavanadate.

===Organometallic compounds===

Organometallic chemistry of vanadium is well developed, although they are mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry.[tpl]cite journal|author=Wilkinson, G. and Birmingham, J.G.|title=Bis-cyclopentadienyl Compounds of Ti, Zr, V, Nb and Ta|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=76|year=1954|page=4281|doi = 10.1021/ja01646a008|issue=17[/tpl] Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl.

==Occurrence==

Metallic vanadium is not found in nature, but vanadium compounds occur naturally in about 65 different minerals. Economically significant examples include patronite (VS4),[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-3131.html|title = mineralogical data about Patrónite |accessdate=19 January 2009 |publisher = mindata.org[/tpl] vanadinite ([tpl]nowrap|Pb5(VO4)3Cl[/tpl]), and carnotite ([tpl]nowrap|K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O[/tpl]). Much of the world's vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2010 these three countries mined more than 98% of the 56,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.[tpl]cite web|publisher = United States Geological Survey|first = Michael J.| last = Magyar| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/vanadium/mcs-2011-vanad.pdf |accessdate=15 January 2011 |title = Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011: Vanadium[/tpl]
Vanadium is also present in bauxite and in fossil fuel deposits such as crude oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200 ppm have been reported. When such oil products are burned, the traces of vanadium may initiate corrosion in motors and boilers.[tpl]cite journal|title = Vanadium and nickel complexes in petroleum resid acid, base, and neutral fractions|first = C.

==Production==

Most vanadium is used as an alloy called ferrovanadium as an additive to improve steels. Ferrovanadium is produced directly by reducing a mixture of vanadium oxide, iron oxides and iron in an electric furnace. Vanadium-bearing magnetite iron ore is the main source for the production of vanadium. The vanadium ends up in pig iron produced from vanadium bearing magnetite. During steel production, oxygen is blown into the pig iron, oxidizing the carbon and most of the other impurities, forming slag. Depending on the ore  used, the slag contains up to 25% of vanadium.
Vanadium metal is obtained via a multistep process that begins with the roasting of crushed ore with NaCl or Na2CO3 at about 850 °C to give sodium metavanadate (NaVO3). An aqueous extract of this solid is acidified to give "red cake", a polyvanadate salt, which is reduced with calcium metal. As an alternative for small-scale production, vanadium pentoxide is reduced with hydrogen or magnesium. Many other methods are also in use, in all of which vanadium is produced as a byproduct of other processes. Purification of vanadium is possible by the crystal bar process developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It involves the formation of the metal iodide, in this example vanadium(III) iodide, and the subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal.[tpl]cite journal|title = Preparation of High-Purity Vanadium Metals by the Iodide Refining Process|journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume = 108|page=88|year = 1961|first = O.
