[[Grey alien]]

CATEGORIES: Alleged UFO-related entities, Roswell UFO incident, Goblins

Grey aliens, also referred to as "Greys", "Grays", "Roswell Greys", and "Zetans", are alleged extraterrestrial beings whose existence is promoted in ufological, paranormal, and New Age communities, and who are named for their skin color. Around half of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. Such claims vary in every respect including their nature (ETs, extradimensionals, demons, or machines), origins, moral dispositions, intentions, and physical appearances (even varying in their eponymous skin color). A composite description derived from overlap in claims would have Greys as small-bodied sexless beings with smooth grey-colored skin, enlarged head and large black eyes.
The origin of the idea of the Grey is commonly associated with the Betty and Barney Hill abduction claim which took place 1961, although skeptics see precursors in science fiction and earlier paranormal claims. The Grey aliens are also famous from the Roswell UFO incident from 1947.

==Appearance==

Greys are typically depicted as dark grey-skinned diminutive humanoid beings that possess reduced forms of, or completely lack, external human organs such as noses, ears or sex organs. Their bodies are usually depicted as being elongated, having a small chest, and lacking in muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from what one would expect in a human. Their limbs are often depicted as proportionally different from a human's; their humerus and thighs are the same lengths as their forearms and shins, respectively.
Greys are depicted as having unusually large heads in proportion to their bodies. They are depicted as having no hair anywhere on the body, including the face, and no noticeable outer ears or noses, but only small openings or orifices for ears and nostrils. They are depicted as having very small mouths, and very large opaque black eyes with no discernible iris or pupil. Sometimes Greys are depicted as having no noticeable nostrils or mouths. Also reports of alleged encounters state their height to be 2–4 ft tall.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

===History===

In the 1893 article  "Man of the Year Million", H. G. Wells envisaged humanity transformed into a race of grey-skinned beings, stunted and with big heads. (Compare the Morlocks of Wells's 1895 novel, The Time Machine, who appear greyish-white and large-eyed, but hairy.) In his 1901 book The First Men in the Moon, Wells described Selenites (natives of the Moon) as having grey skin, big heads, large black eyes and wasp-stings. He also briefly describes aliens resembling Greys brought down to Earth as food by the Martian antagonists of his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds.
In 1933, the Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, using the pen name Gabriel Linde, published a science-fiction novel called Den okända faran (The Unknown Danger), in which he describes a race of extraterrestrials: "... the creatures did not resemble any race of humans. They were short, shorter than the average Japanese, and their heads were big and bald, with strong, square foreheads, and very small noses and mouths, and weak chins. What was most extraordinary about them were the eyes – large, dark, gleaming, with a sharp gaze. They wore clothes made of soft grey fabric, and their limbs seemed to be similar to those of humans." The novel, aimed at young readers, included illustrations of the imagined aliens.
In 1965 newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction brought Greys to international attention. The alleged abductees, Betty and Barney Hill, claimed that in 1961 alien beings had abducted them and taken them to a saucer-shaped spaceship. (The term "Greys" did not come into usage until many years later, but the alleged beings described by Betty and Barney Hill generally fit many of the common traits of the so-called Greys.) From a star chart reported by Betty Hill, Marjorie Fish, an elementary-school teacher and amateur astronomer, located the home planet of these beings in the Zeta Reticuli star-system (allegedly the fourth planet of one of the stars of the Zeta Reticuli binary system). The Greys therefore sometimes became known as Zeta Reticulans.
The Greys also appear as the (benevolent) aliens in the 1977 movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

===1980–1991===

During the early 1980s popular culture linked Greys to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. A number of publications  contained statements from individuals who claimed to have seen the U.S. military handling a number of unusually proportioned, bald, child-sized beings. These individuals claimed that the beings had over-sized heads and slanted eyes—but scant other facial features—during and after the incident.[ref]

In 1987, popular novelist Whitley Strieber published the book Communion, in which he describes a number of close encounters he purports to have experienced with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. The book became a New York Times bestseller, and New Line Cinema released a film adaption starring Christopher Walken in 1989.
In 1988 Christophe Dechavanne interviewed the French science-fiction writer and ufologist Jimmy Guieu during a weekly French TV Live Show which, at the time, was entitled “Ciel, mon mardi !”. It was broadcast by TF1, one of the three national TV channels in France. Besides mentioning Majestic 12, Jimmy Guieu described the existence of what he called “the little greys” which, later on, became better known in French under the following name: les petits gris.[tpl]audio[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |title= Les E.T. et les contactés |first= Jimmy |last=Guieu|author2=Dechavanne, Christophe |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI1ZcOvtJo0 |agency= |newspaper= Ciel mon mardi ! |publisher=TF1 |location=Paris, France|year=1988|accessdate=January 15, 2013 |language=French[/tpl] L'émission se déroule dans le contexte de l'époque, en 1998. Si, aujourd'hui, parler de conspirations et d'OVNI, du MJ-12, des « Petits-Gris » et de bases souterraines ou même d'incriminer la famille Bush semble (relativement) familier, l'enregistrement de cette séquence se déroule en 1988, soit bien avant Internet et même bien avant « X-Files », l'affaire de la créature de Roswell, etc. Avec ces déclarations de Jimmy Guieu lors de la diffusion en direct de cette émission « Ciel, mon mardi ! » par la chaîne de télévision TF1 avec Christophe Dechavanne comme animateur, c'était la toute première fois que le grand public français – voire européen – entendait parler de ce dossier. Jimmy Guieu emploie d'ailleurs le terme « Little Greys » pour désigner les « Petits-Gris » qui, par la suite, deviendront rapidement plus connus sous l'appellation de « Short Greys ».  Petit-gris is (perhaps ironically) the name given to one of the more common species of snail served as the appetiser Escargot in many French restaurants.

===1992–present day===

During the 1990s, popular culture began to increasingly link Greys to a number of  military-industrial complex/New World Order conspiracy theories.Grey Aliens Bite The Dust
A well-known example of this was the FOX television series The X-Files, which first aired in 1993. It combined the quest to find proof of the existence of Grey-like extraterrestrials with a number of UFO conspiracy theory subplots, in order to form its primary story arc. Other notable examples include Dark Skies, first broadcast in 1996, which expanded upon the MJ-12 conspiracy, and Stargate SG-1, which in the 1998 episode "Thor's Chariot" introduced the Asgard, a race of benevolent Greys who visited ancient Earth masquerading as characters from Norse Mythology. Greys, referred to as 'visitors', appear in two episodes of South Park, and Roger Smith, a regular character on the animated comedy series American Dad! since its debut in 2005, is a Grey-like alien. On Babylon 5,  the Greys were referred to as the Vree, and depicted as being allies and trade partners of 23rd Century Earth.
In 1995 filmmaker Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained 22 reels of 16 mm film that depicted the autopsy of a "real" Grey supposedly recovered from the site of the 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico.[ref]

[/tpl] However, in 2006 Santilli announced that the film was not original, but was instead a "reconstruction" created after the original film was found to have degraded. He maintained that a real Grey had been found and autopsied on camera in 1947, and that the footage released to the public contained a percentage of that original footage, but he was unable to say what that percentage was. This incident became the subject of the British comedy film Alien Autopsy, starring television presenters Ant & Dec.[tpl]cite news | title = Eamonn Investigates: Alien Autopsy | publisher = British Sky Broadcasting |date=2006-04-04[/tpl][ref]

The 2011 film Paul tells the story of a Grey who attributes the Greys' frequent presence in science-fiction pop-culture to the US government deliberately inserting the stereotypical Grey alien image into mainstream media so that if humanity came into contact with Paul's species, there would be no immediate shock as to their appearance.
The 2012 video game XCOM: Enemy Unknown uses grey aliens (called Sectoids) as a main enemy type.

==Analysis==

===In close encounter claims and ufology===

Greys are commonly included in alien abduction claims. Among reports of supposed alien encounters, Greys make up approximately 50 percent in Australia, 43 percent in the United States, 90 percent in Canada, 67 percent in Brazil, 20 percent  in Continental Europe, and around 12 percent in the United Kingdom.[tpl]Cite book| last = Bryan | first = C.D.B| title =  Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind|year=1995| publisher = Alfred A. Knopf, Inc| id = ISBN B000I1AFBA| isbn = 0-679-42975-1 [/tpl] These reports include two distinct groups of Greys that differ in height.Jacobs, David M. "Aliens and Hybrids." In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press. Pp. 86-90. ISBN 9780964491700 Abductees say that they recognize the leader of their abductors by its "demeanor." Some ufologists and abduction researchers believe that taller Greys, with their reported increased authority and apparently more complex psychology, may be the only Grey type to be biologically alive and that the shorter form could be their artificially constructed robot or cyborg servants.
Some alien abduction reports have depicted variant skin colors such as blue-grey, green-grey, or purple-grey and sometimes not grey at all. The skin is typically described as being extremely smooth, almost as if made of an artificial material like rubber or plastic.
Abduction claims are often described as extremely traumatic, similar to an abduction by humans or even a sexual assault in the level of trauma and distress. (Research has shown that emotional impact of perceived abduction can be as great as or even greater than that of combat, sexual abuse, and other traumatic events.)[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/02.20/01-alien.html |title= Alien abduction claims examined: Signs of trauma found |publisher= Harvard Gazette |author= William J. Cromie |date= 2003-02-20 |accessdate= 2010-01-04[/tpl]
The eyes are often a focus of abduction claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey staring into the eyes of an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions.Jacobs, David M. "Subsequent Procedures." In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press. pp. 64-68. Although abduction claimants often say that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey's chest move from breathing.

===Psychocultural expression of intelligence===

Neurologist Dr. Steven Novella argues that the idea is a byproduct of the human imagination, with the Greys' most distinctive features representing everything that modern humans traditionally link with intelligence. "The aliens, however, do not just appear as humans, they appear like humans with those traits we psychologically associate with intelligence."[tpl]Cite web|last= Novella |first= Dr. Steven |title= UFOs: The Psychocultural Hypothesis |publisher= The New England Skeptical Society |date=October 2000 |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20100915203009/http://www.theness.com/ufos-the-psychocultural-hypothesis/ |accessdate= 2010-02-02[/tpl]

===The "Mother Hypothesis"===

In 2005, Frederick V. Malmstrom, writing in Skeptic magazine, vol. 11 issue 4, presents his hypothesis that Greys are actually residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom reconstructs the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother's face based on our best understanding of early childhood sensation and perception. Malmstrom's study offers a possible alternative to the existence of Greys, the intense instinctive response many people experience when presented an image of a Grey, and the ease of regression hypnosis and recovered-memory therapy in "recovering" memories of alien abduction experiences, along with their common themes.[tpl]Cite web| last = Malmstrom|first = Frederick| title = Close Encounters of the Facial Kind: Are UFO Alien Faces an Inborn Facial Recognition Template?| work = Skeptic| publisher = The Skeptics Society|year=2005| url = http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/featured_articles/v11n4_alien_faces.html| accessdate = 2008-09-18[/tpl]

===Evolutionary feasibility debate===

According to English reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, the typical image of a Grey, given that it would have evolved into a world with different environmental and ecological conditions from Earth, is too physiologically similar to a human to be credible as a representation of an alien. Their physical structure has been sometimes viewed as supporting the Panspermia theory of origins, although the level "parallel evolution" (using the term in as it's used in Sci-Fi, distinct from the real thing and the related Convergent Evolution) required is statistically next to nil. The "parallel evolution" concept is utilized as a plot device by Star Trek writers Gene Roddenberry and Gene Coon and referred to as "Hodgkins Law of Parallel Planet Development". However, even this fictional theory does not explain such remarkable Grey-human similarities as the facial geometry[tpl]which|date=February 2014[/tpl], the apparent sternal-xiphoidal process[tpl]clarify|date=February 2014[/tpl], the evident pectoral-trapezial architecture[tpl]clarify|date=February 2014[/tpl], and the number of toes per foot[tpl]dubious|date=February 2014[/tpl].[tpl]Cite book|last= Cohen |first= Jack |coauthors=Stewart, Ian |title= Evolving the Alien |date= 2002-02-07 |edition= 1st |publisher= Ebury Press |isbn= 0-09-187927-2[/tpl]
Some Ufologists[tpl]who|date=February 2014[/tpl] say such seemingly impossible coincidences[tpl]which|date=February 2014[/tpl] show that extraterrestrial beings had some influence on the evolution of life on Earth in the distant past (the theory of "ancient astronauts"), specifically that extraterrestrials were directly involved in the evolution of primates, including humans. This was supposedly done by genetic engineering, cross-breeding, or a combination of both. This idea may have first gained widespread exposure with the 1968 publication of Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von Däniken and has since been the source of much controversy, inspiring numerous other books with various related theories.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Proponents of this theory of alien genetic/evolutionary intervention on Earth argue that if the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations and/or experiments with pre-human life forms on Earth (and could somehow overcome the vast genetic and biochemical differences involved in the completely separate evolutionary histories) that these alleged aliens may have attempted to influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction consistent with their own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically that is what they would presumably be most familiar with.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Since the history of life on Earth gives some idea of what is and is not feasible on other worlds, and there is no conclusive evidence of any alleged past extraterrestrial genetic manipulation in our own evolution, some Ufologists have offered alternative explanations to accommodate for the evolutionary improbability of Greys (or any other bipedal, humanoid "extraterrestrial" species) by explaining them as being native hominids to Earth either having left or living in hiding, as Mac Tonnies proposed in his book The Cryptoterrestrials, or from another dimension, as proposed by John A. Keel and J. Allen Hynek.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Conspiracy theories===

Some conspiracy theorists believe that Greys represent part of a government-led disinformation or plausible deniability campaign,[tpl]Cite book|last=Clary|first = David A |title = Before and After Roswell |year= 2000|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|isbn = 0-7388-4106-4[/tpl] or that they are a product of government mind control experiments.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cannon|first=Martin|title = The Controllers|isbn=0-922915-32-6[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Constantine|first = Alex|title = Psychic Dictatorship in the U.S.A.|year=1995|publisher = Feral House|isbn=0-922915-28-8[/tpl] Dr. Steven Greer, founder of the Disclosure Project, head of CSETI, and a prominent UFO conspiracy theorist, claims to have over 400 "government, military, and intelligence community witnesses" that have offered testimony to the existence of aliens and UFOs or efforts to cover up their existence and who have stated that they would be willing to defend their claims under oath.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.disclosureproject.org/|title=The Disclosure Project main page|publisher=The Disclosure Project Homepage|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl]
