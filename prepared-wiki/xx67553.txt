The Big Mac (introduced in metro Pittsburgh in 1967 and nationwide in 1968) is a hamburger sold by McDonald's, an international fast food restaurant chain. It is one of the company's signature products. It consists of two 1.6 oz (45.4 g) 100 per cent beef patties, American cheese, "special sauce" (a variant of Thousand Island dressing), iceberg lettuce, pickles, and onions, served in a three-part sesame seed bun.http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/ingredientslist.pdf

==History==

The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc's earliest franchisees, who was operating several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. The Big Mac was invented in the kitchen of Delligatti's first McDonald's franchise which was located on McKnight Road in north suburban Ross Township.Link text, additional text. 
The Big Mac had 2 previous names, both of which failed in the marketplace. The first name was "Aristocrat", which consumers found difficult to pronounce and understand. The second name was "Blue Ribbon Burger", but that failed to catch on with any meaningful sales either. The third name was the name "Big Mac", which was created by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old Advertising Secretary who worked at McDonald’s Corporate Headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Woman-Who-Named-Big-Mac-Finally-Recognized/id-4338738fbc4ed82ddfcd5700c17d6ebd | title=WOMAN WHO NAMED BIG MAC FINALLY RECOGNIZED | publisher=Associated Press | date=May 31, 1985 | accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl]
The Big Mac debuted at Delligatti's south-east suburban Uniontown, Pennsylvania restaurant in 1967 at a selling price of 45 cents.[tpl]cite press release |title=Jim Delligatti Biography |url= http://www.mcdepk.com/bigmac/mediadocs/bio_Jim_MJ_Delligatti.pdf|publisher= McDonald's|year= 2007|accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl] It was designed to compete with the similar Big Boy sandwich. The sandwich was so popular that it was added to the menu of all U.S. restaurants in 1968.

==Product==

The Big Mac is one of the best-known McDonald's products. It consists of two 1.6 oz (45.4 g) 100 per cent beef patties, American cheese, "special sauce" (a variant of Thousand Island dressing), iceberg lettuce, pickles, and onions, served in a three-part sesame seed bun.
One of its most distinctive features is a middle slice of bread ("club" layer) used to stabilize contents and prevent spillage[tpl]Citation needed|reason=purpose, not the fact that it's actually there|date=September 2011[/tpl].
The Big Mac is known worldwide and is often used as a symbol of American capitalism. The Economist has used it as a reference point for comparing the cost of living in different countries – the Big Mac Index — as it is so widely available and is comparable across markets. This index is sometimes referred to as Burgernomics.[tpl]cite web|last=Pakko|first=Michael R.|title=Burgernomics: A "Big Mac" Guide to Purchasing Power Parity|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/03/11/pakko.pdf|work=Review|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|accessdate=May 18, 2011|author2=Pollard, Patricia S.|date=November–December 2003| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110524015220/http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/03/11/pakko.pdf| archivedate= May 24, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Special sauce===

The name was popularized by a 1974 advertising campaign featuring a list of the ingredients in a Big Mac: "Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun."
Big Mac Sauce is delivered to McDonald's restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, from which it is meant to be directly dispensed using a special calibrated "sauce gun" that dispenses a specified amount of the sauce for each pull of the trigger.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/kansas_26apr96.html | title=Sealright designs sauce system for McDonald's in South Africa, China |work=Kansas City Business Journal | accessdate=May 18, 2011|date= April 26, 1996| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604182839/http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/kansas_26apr96.html| archivedate= June 4, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Its design is similar to a caulking gun.
In 2012, McDonald's admitted that the special sauce ingredients were "not really a secret" because the recipe had been available online "for years".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171302/How-make-Big-Mac-home-McDonalds-chef-explains-secret.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Make a Big Mac at home! McDonald's top chef explains the secret to chain's burger (but why doesn't it look quite like what you get at the counter?) | date=July 10, 2012[/tpl] It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard whisked together with vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.

==Advertising==

The earliest instances of McDonald's utilizing advertising for the sandwich were mainly print ads, and a TV ad where Hoyt Axton sings "The Ballad of Big Mac" which aired in 1969.

===Two all-beef patties slogan===

The Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of DDB Worldwide, and his creative group at Needham Harper and Steers. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a "Big Mac Attack".
Many franchises in the United States ran promotions during the original campaign that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success, was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free glass of Coca-Cola instead), in the Portuguese version, which goes as "Dois hambúrgueres, alface, queijo, molho especial, cebola e picles num pão com gergelim".
The slogan soon led to a shaggy dog joke that had as its punchline "two obese Patties, Special Ross, Lester Cheese, picking bunions on a Sesame Street bus".[tpl]cite book|last=Martin|first=Harvey|title=The Shaggy Dog Story Book|year=2009|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|location=Indianapolis, IN |isbn=978-1-59858-932-0|page=7[/tpl]
In 2003, McDonald's revived the phrase. In an English-language ad from McDonald's international "i'm lovin' it" campaign, a rapper rapidly spouts off the trademark in the background music. Also in 2003, American Greetings and Carlton Cards released a Christmas ornament of a Big Mac, on which the slogan was both printed and played aloud by pulling on a string. Roy Bergold, National Advertising Manager at McDonald's, has a big hand in championing the original campaign and helping to bring it back.
In 2008, the phrase was revived by McDonald's Malaysia. The revival includes the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer is able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. This was released in May, along with the promotional Mega Mac, which has four beef patties rather than the standard two.

===1980s advertising===

In the early 1980s, as a promotion, McDonalds staged an in-house rivalry between their two most popular products. Consumers were invited to decide "Which one will be number one? Chicken McNuggets or Big Mac sandwiches?" For each of either item that a customer bought, they received another of the same at half price. Later in the ad campaign, the second was offered for free. It was eventually announced that Big Mac was "number one".

===2005 advertising===

In 2005, McDonald's began offering product placement rewards to hip hop artists who namechecked the Big Mac in their music, giving US$5 to the artist for every time a song mentioning the hamburger was played on the radio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4389751.stm|title=Return of the Mac – coming soon |work=BBC News | date=March 29, 2005 | accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl] This offer quickly spawned a satirical reference from hip hop artist Mad Skillz, who references the marketing ploy in his track "2005 Wrap Up" by stating "And I'm beefin' wit' Mickey D's man, y'all dead wrong, Talkin' 'bout payin' rappers to mention Big Macs in their song, We do rap from the heart, y'all better have some respect, Alright, Big Mac! Big Mac! Big Mac! Now where's my check?"

==Variants==

==McDonaldland character==

In addition to the McDonald's signature hamburger, Big Mac was the name of a character, Officer Big Mac, in McDonaldland, the fictional world created as an advertising campaign for McDonald's. Officer Big Mac was similar to Mayor McCheese, except he was the chief of police, wearing a constable uniform and sporting a large Big Mac for a head.

==Museum==

On August 22, 2007, McDonald’s opened the Big Mac Museum in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania to celebrate the Big Mac’s 40th anniversary. The museum features the world's largest Big Mac statue (measuring 14 feet high and 12 feet wide), and has hundreds of historic artifacts and exhibits that celebrate the Big Mac."McDonald's Celebrates 40 Years Serving 'Twoallbeefpattiesspecialsaucelettucecheesepicklesonionsonasesameseedbun'" PR Newswire. August 22, 2007“Big Mac turns 40” The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Retrieved November 12, 2012
The decision to place the museum in North Huntingdon was to the disappointment of some Uniontown, Pennsylvania residents. According to a McDonald’s spokesperson, the decision was based on logistics and access, but it still did not sit well with some residents and an article was published in Uniontown’s local newspaper, The Herald-Standard.Owens, Al (September 2007). "The Mystery of the Curry Burger!" republished from Herald-Standard (Uniontown). September 15, 2007
