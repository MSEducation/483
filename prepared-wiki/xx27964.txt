[[Telecommunications in Bangladesh]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications in Bangladesh, Communications in Bangladesh

The liberalisation of Bangladesh’s telecommunications sector began with small steps in 1989 with the issuance of a licence to a private operator for the provision of inter alia cellular mobile services to compete with the previous monopoly provider of telecommunications services the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB). Significant changes in the number of fixed and mobile services deployed in Bangladesh occurred in the late 1990s and the number of services in operation have subsequently grown exponentially in the past five years.
The incentives both from government and public sectors have helped to grow this sector.It is now one of the biggest sector of Bangladesh. As a populous country, it's huge market has attracted many foreign investors to invest in this sector

The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) will receive all calls from the mobile and fixed operators whenever the call is made to other network and will pass it to the destination network if the call is local, and will pass to the IGWs if the call is international. ICX will also deliver calls received from IGWs where the call is destined.National Telecommunications Policy 1998

compared to 100,000 in 2000.#BD moble Internet Usage Stats  However, only 0.3% of the population use the internet and thus making Bangladesh the lowest usage  percentage per population of the internet in the world with the exception of North Korea, Myanmar and Sierra Leone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2?order=wbapi_data_value_2008+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc&cid=GPD_44 |title=Internet users (per 100 people) | Data | Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17[/tpl]
But on April, 2010 Akhtaruzzaman Manju, president of Internet Service Providers' Association of Bangladesh, told Xinhua that the country's six cell phone operators and Internet Service Providers have so far provided over 800,000 internet connections. "We've estimated that nearly 10 million people in the country are using 800,000 internet connections on sharing basis," he said, adding the number of internet users in the country is increasing yearly by around 15–16 percent.http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4072376
The number of Internet subscribers in Bangladesh is likely to reach 18.3 million by the year 2020– translating to a 32 percent household Internet penetration at around the same time”, says a study by an international research group.
“This increased internet penetration would resulted in 2.6 per cent contribution to the country’s GDP by 2020 while creating 129 thousand more jobs by the same year” the research added.http://mskhalid.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/internet-subscribers-may-reach-18-3m-by-2020-the-financial-express-22-january-2010/

Though broadband internet access is available it charges high for high speed connection than other south Asian countries, though this is rapidly changing. Broadband internet and e-commerce in Bangladesh is slowly progressing.WiMAX service is now available from some internet service providers. In Bangladesh Broadband is legally defined as 128/128 kbit/s, which is not in line with ITU.[tpl]cite web|author=spumail |url=http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |title=Birth of Broadband - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Itu.int |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2013-05-17[/tpl] Therefore most of the Broadband internet services and also subscribers are using bandwidth that may not be considered a broadband in other countries and may not be broadband in international standards .
