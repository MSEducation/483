==Career==

===Early career (1980–1994)===

At age fifteen, Gilbert Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in New York City and, after a few years, became known around New York as "the comedian's comedian."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gilbertgottfried.com/about.php |title=About Gilbert |publisher=Gilbertgottfried.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01[/tpl] In 1980, Saturday Night Live was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member. During the 1980–1981 season, Gottfried's persona in SNL sketches was very different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in his trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. Despite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to Denny Dillon's Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, "What's It All About?") and two celebrity impersonations: David A. Stockman and controversial film director Roman Polanski.
Although not a regular, he also appeared in the short-lived 1992 TV series The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys and voiced crazed dentist "Dr. Bender" and his son Wendell on the show The Fairly OddParents and the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on Ren and Stimpy. His most prominent voice-over role came in 1992, when he was cast as the parrot Iago in Aladdin. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, "I did the whole DeNiro thing. I moved to South America! I lived in the trees!"
Gottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of USA Up All Night for its entire run from 1989 to 1998.

===Voice acting, television and films (1999–2001)===

Gottfried was a regular guest on the most recent version of Hollywood Squares. He is best remembered for a 1999 episode in which a single round of play took up the entire half-hour. The contestants had each won four stars/squares, leaving Gottfried as the last square available. Because either player could win upon capturing Gottfried's square, they could not win on their competitor's wrong response and had to win it themselves. The contestants alternated agreeing or disagreeing about whether Gottfried was bluffing an answer—and missed six consecutive tries. Five of those times he admonished the contestant with an increasingly incredulous "YOU FOOL!", mimicking Penn Jillette and his partner Teller. The seventh time he and the contestant agreed, and they finally won the square and the game. This segment has been featured on game show blooper programs and is popular on YouTube.
Gottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the AFLAC commercials and Digit in the math-mystery cartoon Cyberchase on PBS Kids GO!, as well as the magical imp Mr. Mxyzptlk on Superman: The Animated Series. He also played a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named "Nick-Nack" who used toys to commit crimes on two episodes of the TV series Superboy (he also co-wrote an issue of the tie-in Superboy: The Comic Book which featured the origin of his character, Nick-Nack). Gottfried has made regular appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

===Recent work (2004–present)===

In 2004, Comedy Central featured his stand up material for an animated series called Shorties Watchin' Shorties.comedycentral.com[tpl]full citation|date=September 2012[/tpl] Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for Microsoft's Office XP software, showing, in a series of Flash-animated cartoons, that the Clippy office assistant would be removed.

In April 2006, Gottfried performed with the University of Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the Let's Make a Deal portion of Gameshow Marathon (as a baby in a large high chair, he says "Hey Ricki, I think I need my diaper changed!"), and in the Dodge Viper in the big deal (where he tells the contestants "What were you thinking?!" because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy as Santa Claus in the one-hour Christmas Special.

==Controversy==

===9/11 joke===

During his monologue at a Friars Club roast of Hugh Hefner three weeks after the September 11 attacks, Gottfried joked that he had intended to catch a plane, but could not get a direct flight because "they said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first." This was one of the first public examples of 9/11 humor. Audience members responded with hisses and a cry of "Too soon!". Gottfried then abandoned his prepared remarks and launched into the venerable Aristocrats joke, winning back the audience.[tpl]cite web| url = http://observer.com/2005/08/why-have-a-night-like-this-in-times-like-these/ | first = Frank | last = DiGiacomo | title = Why Have a Night Like This in Times Like These? | publisher = The New York Observer | date = 2005-08-07 | accessdate = 2013-05-25 [/tpl] Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza used Gottfried's monologue as a segment in their 2005 film, The Aristocrats.[tpl]cite news| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/REVIEWS/50727001 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | authorlink  = Roger Ebert | title = The Aristocrats | publisher = Roger Ebert.com | date = 2005-08-12 | accessdate = 2011-03-28 [/tpl]

===Japanese tsunami jokes===

In March 2011, Gottfried made jokes on his Twitter account about the earthquake disaster in Japan. Aflac, which does 75% of its business in Japan, dismissed Gottfried on March 14, 2011, and announced a casting call for his replacement as the voice of its duck mascot.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gilbert-gottfried-fired-as-aflac-167382 | title = Gilbert Gottfried Fired as Aflac Duck After Japan Tweets | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | date = 2011-03-14| accessdate = 2011-03-15 | first=Mark | last=Cina[/tpl] He was replaced by Daniel McKeague (who did an impression of Gottfried) on April 26, 2011.[tpl]cite web| url =http://tv.yahoo.com/blog/the-aflac-ducks-new-voice-comes-from-a-minnesota-sales-manager--2832 | title = The Aflac Duck's New Voice Comes From a Minnesota Sales Manager | publisher = Yahoo | accessdate = 26 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]
