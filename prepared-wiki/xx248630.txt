[[Mohria]]

CATEGORIES: Schizaeales, Pteridophyta of Africa

The fern genus Mohria is a small one of eight species, restricted to southern Africa and Madagascar.  Plants in this genus superficially resemble Cheilanthes, but the sporangial structure indicates their close affinity to Anemia.  Unlike all other genera in the Schizaeales, plants of Mohria do not have dimorphic fronds.
The basal chromosome count of this genus is consistently n=76, based on the number n=38, which is consistent with Anemia.

==Species==

Because Mohria is considered to be embedded in Anemia, all Mohria species have been transferred to corresponding Anemia species.Christenhusz et al. "A linear sequence of extant families and genera of lycophytes and ferns" Phytotaxa 19: 7-54. 18 Feb. 2011
