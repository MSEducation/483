Festivities began in the afternoon of the day before, when Hitler was driven at the head of a motorcade of fifty white limousines along Albert Speer's newly completed "East-West Axis", the planned central boulevard for "Germania", which was to be the new capital for the Nazi empire. Hitler had been anticipating a speech from the taciturn Speer and was amused when he evaded this by briefly announcing that the work should speak for itself.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2D7SZtMUyXYC&pg=PA121 |title=Albert Speer |author=David Edgar, Gitta Sereny[/tpl]  The next event was a torchlight procession of deputations from all over Germany, which Hitler reviewed from a balcony in the Reich Chancellery.  Then, at midnight, Hitler's courtiers congratulated him and presented him with gifts, including
Notably, Speer gave Hitler a model of the gigantic triumphal arch planned for the rebuilding of Berlin, and Hitler's pilot, Hans Baur, gave him a model of the 'Führer Machine', a four-engined Focke-Wulf 200 'Condor' which was to go into service in the summer as Hitler's official airplane.
