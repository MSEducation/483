[[Weather modification]]

CATEGORIES: Geoengineering, Weather modification

Weather modification is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather.  The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding to increase rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ag.arizona.edu/azwater/arroyo/061wthr.html | title=Weather Modification:  A Water Resource Strategy to be Researched, Tested Before Tried | publisher=University of Arizona | accessdate=April 17, 2012 | author=Gelt, Joe[/tpl] Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare. Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations.

==History==

Magical and religious practices to control the weather are attested in a variety of cultures. In ancient India it is said that yajna or vedic rituals of chanting manthras and offering were performed by rishis to bring sudden bursts of rain fall in rain starved regions. Some American Indians like some Europeans had rituals which they believed could induce rain. The Finnish people, on the other hand, were believed by others to be able to control weather. As a result, Vikings refused to take Finns on their oceangoing raids. Remnants of this superstition lasted into the twentieth century, with some ship crews being reluctant to accept Finnish sailors. The early modern era saw people observe that during battles the firing of cannons and other firearms often initiated precipitation.
In Greek mythology, Iphigenia was offered as a human sacrifice to appease the wrath of the goddess Artemis, who had becalmed the Achaean fleet at Aulis at the beginning of the Trojan War.  In Homer's Odyssey, Aeolus, keeper of the winds, bestowed Odysseus and his crew with a gift of the four winds in a bag.  However, the sailors opened the bag while Odysseus slept, looking for booty, and as a result were blown off course by the resulting gale.Homer, The Odyssey, book 10.  In ancient Rome, the lapis manalis was a sacred stone kept outside the walls of Rome in a temple of Mars.  When Rome suffered from drought, the stone was dragged into the city.Sir James Frazer, The Golden Bough, ch. 5 (abridged edition), "The Magical Control of Rain"
The Berwick witches of Scotland were found guilty of using black magic to summon storms to murder King James VI of Scotland by seeking to sink the ship upon which he travelled.Christopher Smout, A History of the Scottish People 1560-1830, pp. 184-192  Scandinavian witches allegedly claimed to sell the wind in bags or magically confined into wooden staves; they sold the bags to seamen who could release them when becalmed.Adam of Bremen and Ole Worm are quoted as maintaining this in Grillot de Givry's Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy (Frederick Publications, 1954).  In various towns of Navarre, prayers petitioned Saint Peter to grant rain in time of drought.  If the rain was not forthcoming, the statue of St Peter was removed from the church and tossed into a river.Frazer, supra.
Wilhelm Reich performed cloudbusting experiments in the 1950s to 1960s, the results of which are controversial and not widely accepted by mainstream science.
Dr Walter Russell wrote of weather control in Atomic Suicide 1956."--give him complete power to cause rains, wherever he desires, on deserts or meadows and to dissipate cyclones while forming."
For the 2008 Olympics, China had plans to utilize 30 airplanes, 4,000 rocket launchers, and 7,000 anti-aircraft guns in an attempt to stop rain. Each system would shoot various chemicals into any threatening clouds in the hopes of shrinking rain drops before they reached the stadium.Demick, Barbara, "China plans to halt rain for Olympics," Los Angeles Times, January 2008.
In January, 2011, several newspapers and magazines, including the UK's Sunday Times and Arabian Business, reported that scientists backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, had created over 50 artificial rainstorms between July and August 2010 near Al Ain, a city which lies close to the country's border with Oman and is the second-largest city in the Abu Dhabi Emirate. The artificial rainstorms were said to have sometimes caused hail, gales and thunderstorms, baffling local residents.Leigh, Karen. http://www.arabianbusiness.com/abu-dhabi-backed-scientists-create-fake-rainstorms-in-11m-project-371038.html, "Arabian Business", January 3, 2011. Retrieved 2011-01-8. The scientists reportedly used ionizers to create the rainstorms, and although the results are disputed, the large number of times it is recorded to have rained right after the ionizers were switched on during a usually dry season is encouraging to those who support the experiment.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1343470/Have-scientists-discovered-create-downpours-desert.html, "Daily Mail", January 3, 2011.

==Cloud seeding==

Cloud seeding is a common technique to enhance precipitation. Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as aluminium oxide, barium, or silver iodide onto clouds in order to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air.  Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the United States, the People's Republic of China, India, and the Russian Federation. In the People's Republic of China there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to "wash the air" in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing. In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,Hunter, Steven M. (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation). 2007.

==Storm prevention==

Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into storms and seeding the eyewall with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983.  A similar project using soot was run in 1958, with inconclusive results. Various methods have been proposed to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes.  Moshe Alamaro of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology[tpl]cite web|url=http://alamaro.home.comcast.net/Alamaro-bio.htm |title=Moshe Alamaro's brief bio |publisher=Alamaro.home.comcast.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] proposed using barges with upward-pointing jet engines to trigger smaller storms to disrupt the progress of an incoming hurricane; critics doubt the jets would be powerful enough to make any noticeable difference.http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn7995.html - Alamaro proposal and energy critique
Alexandre Chorin of the University of California, Berkeley, proposed dropping large amounts of environmentally friendly oils on the sea surface to prevent droplet formation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7726 |title=Chorin proposal |publisher=Newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] Experiments by Kerry Emanuel[tpl]cite web|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/home.html |title=Kerry Emanuel's Homepage |publisher=Wind.mit.edu |date=2002-05-15 |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] of MIT in 2002 suggested that hurricane-force winds would disrupt the oil slick, making it ineffective.[tpl]cite web|url=http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn7995.html |title=Could humans tackle hurricanes? - earth - 14 September 2005 - New Scientist Environment |publisher=Environment.newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] Other scientists disputed the factual basis of the theoretical mechanism assumed by this approach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7726 |title=Oil on troubled waters may stop hurricanes - earth - 25 July 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] The Florida company Dyn-O-Mat proposes the use of a product it has developed, called Dyn-O-Gel, to reduce the strength of hurricanes. The substance is a polymer in powder form (a polyacrylic acid derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water.  The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm.  When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved.  The company has tested the substance on a thunderstorm, but there has not been any scientific consensus established as to its effectiveness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2002/sep/featrain|title=Rain, Rain, Go Away|publisher=Discover Magazine[/tpl] Numerical simulations performed by NOAA showed however that it would not be a practical solution for large systems like a tropical cyclone.Subject: C5d) Why don't we try to destroy tropical cyclones by adding a water absorbing substance ?, NOAA HRD FAQ
Hail cannons have been used by some farmers since the 19th century in an attempt to ward off hail, but there is no reliable scientific evidence to confirm their effectiveness. Another new anti-hurricane technology[tpl]cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?IA=WO2006085830&DISPLAY=STATUS |title=(WO/2006/085830) A METHOD OF AND A DEVICE FOR THE REDUCTION OF TROPICAL CYCLONES DESTRUCTIVE FORCE |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] is a method for the reduction of tropical cyclones’ destructive force - pumping sea water into and diffusing it in the wind at the bottom of such tropical cyclone in its eyewall.

===US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration===

In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration keeps records of weather modification projects on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, under authority of Public Law 92-205, 15 USC § 330B, enacted in 1971.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-9A | title=15 USC CHAPTER 9A - WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES OR ATTEMPTS; REPORTING REQUIREMENT | accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]

===Proposed US Legislation===

2005 U.S. Senate Bill 517 and U.S. House Bill 2995
U.S. Senate Bill 517S. 517 109th: Weather Modification Research and Development Policy Authorization Act of 2005, proposed by U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and then U.S. Representative (later Senator) Mark Udall of Colorado (GovTrack.us) and U.S. House Bill 2995[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-2995 |title=H.R. 2995 109th: Weather Modification Research and Technology Transfer Authorization Act of 2005 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] were two bills proposed in 2005 that would have expanded experimental weather modification, to establish a Weather Modification Operations and Research Board, and implemented a national weather modification policy.  Neither were made into law. Former Texas State Senator John N. Leedom was the key lobbyist on behalf of the weather modification bills.

==Future aspirations==

Climatologists have simulated hurricane control based on selective heating and cooling (or prevention of evaporation).Hoffman, R, "Controlling Hurricanes," Scientific American, Oct 2004. Futurist John Smart has discussed the potential for weather control via space-based solar power networks. One proposal involves the gentle heating via microwave of portions of large hurricanes. Such chaotic systems may be susceptible to "side steering" with a few degrees of increased temperature/pressure at critical points. A sufficient network might keep the largest and most potentially damaging hurricanes from landfall, at the request of host nations. Blizzards, monsoons, and other extreme weather are also potential candidates for space-based amelioration.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] If large-scale weather control were to become feasible, potential negative implications may include:
