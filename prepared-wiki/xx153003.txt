==History==

The origins of Mason Cash can be traced back to a pottery already operating at Church Gresley around 1800.About - Mason Cash - choice of the discerning cook The location was selected due to the local deposits of clay and coal. The pottery was run by a series of Master Potters, of whom the most colourful was ‘Bossy’ Mason – this is where the ‘Mason’ name came from in the 1800’s. Thomas Cash acquired the pottery in 1901, retaining the 'Mason' name of the previous owner, renamed the pottery Mason Cash & Co.potteryhistories.com Mason Cash ceramic items were made from ‘white and cane’ glazed earthenware sometimes known as ‘yellow ware’ due to the colour of the local clay. 
Mason Cash had been producing mixing bowls during the 1800’s, but in 1901 they designed and manufactured the very first iconic Mason Cash mixing bowl.
