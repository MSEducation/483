On November 12, 2001 at about 9:16 EST, American Airlines Flight 587 N14053, an Airbus A300B4-605R delivered in 1988 with a seating configuration for 267 passengers (16 first-class seats and 251 economy-class seats) and powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2A5 engines,ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A300B4-605R N14053 Belle Harbor, NY crashed into Belle Harbor, a New York City residential area, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York. Flight 587 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight to Las Américas International Airport, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with two flight crew members, seven cabin crew members, and 251 passengers aboard the plane. The flight crew consisted of Captain Ed States, and First Officer Sten Molin. Molin was the pilot flying.
The plane's vertical stabilizer and rudder separated in flight and fell into Jamaica Bay, about one mile north of the main wreckage site. The plane pitched downwards and went into a flat spin, the engines separating due to the aerodynamic loads, and eventually impacted nose down into Belle Harbor, destroying three houses (258, 262, and 266 Beach 131st Street) and spraying fiery debris along Beach 131st Street south of Newport Avenue.  All 260 people aboard the plane and five people on the ground died, and the impact forces and a post-crash fire destroyed the plane. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Flight 587 operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident.

==Investigation==

The A300-600 took off immediately after a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 on the same runway. It flew into the larger jet's wake, an area of turbulent air. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs. The strength of the air flowing against the moving rudder stressed the aircraft's vertical stabilizer, and eventually snapped it off entirely, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the enormous stress on the rudder was due to the first officer's "unnecessary and excessive" rudder inputs, and not the wake turbulence caused by the 747. The NTSB further stated "if the first officer had stopped making additional inputs, the aircraft would have stabilized".  Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 sensitive rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Training Program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alliedpilots.org/Public/Topics/Issues/apa587finalsubmission.pdf|title=Submission of the Allied Pilots Association to the National Transportation Safety Board: Regarding the accident of American Airlines Flight 587 at Belle Harbor, New York November 12, 2001|publisher=Allied Pilots Association (APA)|accessdate=October 15, 2013[/tpl]
The manner in which the vertical stabilizer separated concerned investigators. The vertical stabilizer is connected to the fuselage with six attaching points.  Each point has two sets of attachment lugs, one made of composite material, another of aluminum, all connected by a titanium bolt; damage analysis showed that the bolts and aluminum lugs were intact, but not the composite lugs. This, coupled with two events earlier in the life of the aircraft, namely delamination in part of the vertical stabilizer prior to its delivery from Airbus's Toulouse factory, and an encounter with heavy turbulence in 1994, caused investigators to examine the use of composites.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E6D8103BF93AA25752C1A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=A Workhorse of the Skies, Perhaps With a Deadly Defect | first1=Matthew L. | last1=Wald | first2=Al | last2=Baker | date=November 19, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl] The possibility that the composite materials might not be as strong as previously supposed was a cause of concern because they are used in other areas of the plane, including the engine mounting and the wings. Tests carried out on the vertical stabilizers from the accident aircraft, and from another similar aircraft, found that the strength of the composite material had not been compromised, and the NTSB concluded that the material had failed because it had been stressed beyond its design limit, despite ten previous recorded incidents where A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation in which none resulted in the separation of the vertical stabilizer in-flight.
The official NTSB report of October 26, 2004, stated that the cause of the crash was the overuse of the rudder to counter wake turbulence.In-Flight Separation of Vertical Stabilizer; American Airlines Flight 587; Airbus Industrie A300-605R, N14053; Belle Harbor, New York; November 12 2001. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aircraft Accident Report NTSB/AAR-04/04 of October 26, 2004.
The crash was witnessed by hundreds of people, 349 of whom gave accounts of what they saw to the NTSB.  About half (52%) reported a fire or explosion before the plane hit the ground. Others stated that they saw a wing detach from the aircraft, when in fact it was the vertical stabilizer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/23/weekinreview/23WALD.html|title=Ideas & Trends; For Air Crash Detectives, Seeing Isn't Believing|last=Wald|first=Matthew L|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=October 16, 2013[/tpl] "According to the National Transportation Safety Board, which announced this month that it had gathered 349 eyewitness accounts through interviews or written statements, 52 percent said they saw a fire while the plane was in the air.

==Aftermath==

Since the NTSB's report, American Airlines has modified its pilot training program."Pilot error blamed for Flight 587 crash", AP, accessed February 7, 2008. Previous simulator training did not properly reflect "the actual large build-up in sideslip angle and sideloads that would accompany such rudder inputs in an actual airplane", according to the NTSB final report.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/01/27/321563/getting-control-of-loc.html|title=Getting control of LOC|last=Croft|first=John|date=January 27, 2009|publisher=Flightglobal.Com|accessdate=June 2013[/tpl]
American Airlines no longer used flight number 587. The flight route designation for the flight between JFK and Santo Domingo was initially renumbered to 619 and is now Flight 1749, using a Boeing 767-300 or a Boeing 757-200.[tpl]citation needed|date = November 2012[/tpl]  American Airlines retired all its Airbus A300-600s from service eight years after the accident (and 21 years in service) in August 2009 with its last flight, a flight from Miami to JFK, operating on August 24, 2009.

==Cause==

===Terrorist claims===

Because the crash was two months and one day after the September 11, 2001 attacks and occurred in New York, several major buildings including the Empire State Building and the United Nations Headquarters were evacuated. In the months after the crash, rumors suggested that it had been destroyed in a terrorist plot, with a shoe bomb similar to the one found on Richard Reid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/rumors-about-flight-587/|title=Rumors about Flight 587|last1=Irvine|first1=Reed|last2=Kincaid|first2=Cliff|publisher=Accuracy in Media|date=February 6, 2002|accessdate=October 16, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Speculation about Flight 587 Crash Flourishes in Absence of Answers|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=November 13, 2001[/tpl]
In May 2002, Mohammed Jabarah agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of a plea bargain. Among the details he gave authorities, was that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's lieutenant had told him that Reid and Abderraouf Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to carry out identical shoe-bombing plots as part of a second wave of attacks against the United States, and that they had successfully blown up Flight 587, while Reid had been stymied.Ticin Online, Terrorismo: Canada, accuse ad Al Qaida per aereo caduto a NY, August 28, 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://republicans.smbiz.house.gov/hearings/databaseDrivenHearingsSystem/displayTestimony.asp?hearingIdDateFormat=051117&testimonyId=440|title=Building a Wall Between Friends: Passports to and from Canada?

===NTSB findings===

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the cause of the crash was overuse of the rudder mechanism.
According to the official accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he made a series of alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the vertical stabilizer separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/11/remembering-americas-second-deadliest-plane-crash/248313/|title=Remembering America's Second-Deadliest Plane Crash|last1=Bella|first1=Timothy|last2=Fearnow|first2=Benjamin|publisher=The Atlantic|date=November 11, 2011|accessdate=June 2013[/tpl]
The airplane performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the vertical stabilizer's structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.
Contributing factors include the following: First, the first officer's predisposition to overreact to wake turbulence; second, the training provided by American Airlines that could have encouraged pilots to make large flight control inputs; third, the first officer likely did not understand an airplane's response to large rudder inputs at high airspeeds or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; finally, light rudder pedal forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 rudder pedal system increased the airplane's susceptibility to a rudder misuse.
Airbus and American are currently[tpl]when|date=September 2013[/tpl] disputing the extent to which the two parties are responsible for the disaster. American charges that the crash was mostly Airbus' fault because the A300 was designed with unusually sensitive rudder controls. Most aircraft require increased pressure on the rudder pedals to achieve the same amount of rudder control at a higher speed. The Airbus A300 and later Airbus A310 do not operate on a fly-by-wire flight control system, instead using conventional mechanical flight controls. The NTSB determined that "because of its high sensitivity, the A300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher speeds"."NTSB Press Release". October 26, 2004. Accessed December 6, 2005. The Allied Pilots Association, in its submission to the NTSB, argued that the unusual sensitivity of the rudder mechanism amounted to a design flaw which Airbus should have communicated to the airline. The main rationale for their position came from a 1997 report that referenced 10 incidents in which A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation.[tpl]cite press release |author= |title=Aviation Safety and Pilot Control: Understanding and Preventing Unfavorable Pilot-Vehicle Interactions |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5469 |location= Washington, D.C |publisher=Washington National Academy Press |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl]
Airbus charges that the crash was mostly American's fault because the airline did not train its pilots properly about the characteristics of the rudder. Aircraft tail fins are designed to withstand full rudder deflection in one direction at maneuvering speed. They are not usually designed to withstand an abrupt shift in rudder from one direction to the other. Most American Airlines pilots believed that the tail fin could withstand any rudder movement at maneuvering speed. The NTSB indicated that American Airlines' Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program tended to exaggerate the effects of wake turbulence on large aircraft. Therefore, pilots were being trained to react more aggressively than was necessary.

The Guardian described the flight as having "cult status" in Washington Heights, a Dominican area of Manhattan. Belkis Lora, a relative of a passenger on the crashed flight, said "Every Dominican in New York has either taken that flight or knows someone who has. It gets you there early. At home there are songs about it." Kugel said "For many Dominicans in New York, these journeys home are the defining metaphor of their complex push-pull relationship with their homeland; they embody, vividly and poignantly, the tug between their current lives and their former selves. That fact gave Monday's tragedy a particularly horrible resonance for New York's Dominicans." He also said "Even before Monday's crash, Dominicans had developed a complex love-hate relationship with American Airlines, complaining about high prices and baggage restrictions even while favoring the carrier over other airlines that used to travel the same route."
