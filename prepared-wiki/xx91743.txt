[[Greater Western Sydney]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Sydney

Greater Western Sydney (GWS) is the region of the metropolitan area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia that is generally accepted to embrace the northwest, southwest, central west, and western sub-regions of greater metropolitan Sydney. The University of Western Sydney defines greater western Sydney as comprising 14 local government areas; namely located within Auburn, Bankstown, Blacktown, Blue Mountains, Camden, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Holroyd, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith, The Hills Shire and Wollondilly.
In government administration, the region has a Minister for Western Sydney, currently held by the Premier, the Hon. Barry O'Farrell, MP.
The population is predominantly of a working class background, with major employment in the heavy industries and vocational trade. The fourteen local government areas which comprise the Greater West together generate more than A$95 billion in Gross Regional Product a year, making its economy the third largest in Australia behind the Sydney CBD and Melbourne.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Sub-regions==

Greater Western Sydney local government authorities agree on the broad definition of greater western Sydney, but divide the region based on the regional organisations of councils. The Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC) includes the local government areas of Auburn,  Bankstown, Blacktown, Blue Mountains, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Holroyd, Liverpool, Parramatta and Penrith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wsroc.com.au/|title=The WSROC Region|work=|publisher=Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils Ltd|year=2012|accessdate=13 June 2013[/tpl] The Macarthur Regional Organisation of Councils (MACROC) includes the local government areas of Camden, Campbelltown and Wollondilly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macroc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Macarthur Region|work=|publisher=MACROC|year=2008|accessdate=13 June 2013[/tpl]

==Climate==

Western Sydney experiences a warm temperate climate with the annual temperatures having an average maximum of [tpl]convert|23|C[/tpl] and a minimum of [tpl]convert|12|C[/tpl], making the region a few degrees warmer than the Sydney CBD. In summer, daytime temperatures can be 5 degrees Celsius warmer than the City (in extreme cases the West can even be 10 degrees hotter). This is because sea breezes in the City do not penetrate the inland areas. Winters nights, though, are a few degrees cooler, which may present frost in some areas. Maximum summer temperatures average at around [tpl]convert|28|C[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|30|C[/tpl] and winter temperatures average at around [tpl]convert|17|C[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|18|C[/tpl], depending on the location.
Rainfall is almost evenly spread throughout the year, although the first half tends to be wetter, namely February through to June (late summer/early winter). The months from July through to September tend to be drier (late winter/early spring). Thunderstorms are common in the summer months. Winters are pleasantly cool and sunny, although east coast lows can bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in June.[tpl]cite web|title=About East Coast Lows|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/ecl.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] Most suburbs in the west have an annual precipitation that averages at around [tpl]convert|700|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|900|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl], in contrast to Sydney CBD's [tpl]convert|1217|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The humidity in the summer is usually in the comfortable range, though some days can be slightly humid (due to the ocean proximity) or very dry (thanks to the heat from the desert).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/1217189/sydney-to-be-spared-worst-of-giant-heat-wave/|title=Sydney heatwave|work=|publisher=Daily Liberal|year=2013|accessdate=4 February 2014[/tpl]
