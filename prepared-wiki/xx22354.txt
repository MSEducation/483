==History==

Caroline County was created in 1774Noble, Edward. "The History of Caroline County". Regional Publishing Company, 1971, p.1. from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne's Counties. The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland's last colonial governor Robert Eden.Maryland, Caroline County "She's waiting for you" At the time of its creation, seven commissioners were appointed: Charles Dickinson, Benson Stainton, Thomas White, William Haskins, Richard Mason, Joshua Clark, and Nathaniel Potter.  These men bought [tpl]convert|4|acre|m2[/tpl] of land at Pig Point (now Denton) on which to build a courthouse and jail.Formation of Caroline County
Until the completion of these buildings, court was held at Melvill's Warehouse, approximately [tpl]convert|1.5|mi|km[/tpl] above Pig Point.  Elections and other business transactions were completed there, and the town became the center of the county.  The first court session was held on March 15, 1774, at Melvill's Warehouse. In 1777, court was moved to Bridgetown (now Greensboro), but in the interest of convenience, court was moved back to Melvill's.
Disagreements arose concerning the permanent location of the county seat.  The General Assembly reached a compromise in 1785 and ordered that [tpl]convert|2|acre|m2[/tpl] of land at Melvill's Landing should be purchased for a courthouse and jail. In 1790, the county court and its belongings moved to Pig Point.  The Caroline County Courthouse was completed in 1797.
The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]NRISref|2008a[/tpl]

Growth is a major issue faced by Caroline County and several other Mid-Shore counties.  Retirees and workers willing to commute across the Chesapeake Bay to the western shore are increasingly attracted by the rural environment and low cost of living. The county commissioners have fought to preserve the rural nature of the county.
It is the only county in the state not represented by a resident legislator in the Maryland General Assembly. Caroline last enjoyed a home delegate in the 1994 session. Redistricting and a sparse population are to blame.
