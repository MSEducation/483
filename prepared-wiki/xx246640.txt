CATEGORIES: Computer networking

The Network-Integrated Multimedia Middleware (NMM) is a flow graph based multimedia framework. NMM allows a programmer to create distributed multimedia applications: local and remote multimedia devices or software components can be controlled transparently and integrated into a common multimedia processing flow graph. NMM is implemented in C++ programming language and NMM-IDL, an interface definition language. NMM is a set of cross-platform libraries and applications for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and others. A software development kit (SDK) is also provided.
NMM is distributed under a dual-licensing model: The Linux/Mac OS X/PS3 version of NMM is distributed for free as Open Source under the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The Windows version of NMM is distributed for free as binary version under the terms and conditions of the NMM Non-Commercial License (NMM-NCL). All NMM versions (i.e. for all supported operating systems) are also distributed under a commercial license with full warranty, which allows for developing closed-source proprietary software on top of NMM.
