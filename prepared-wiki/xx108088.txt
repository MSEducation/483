==Raunkiær's law==

When plotting the number of species in a plant community that fell in each 20-percentile frequency class from very frequent, i.e. numerically dominant, to very infrequent, Raunkiær discovered that most species were either very common or very rare. This came to be known as "Raunkiær's law" and is related to R. A. Fisher's logseries distribution and to Frank W. Preston's lognormal distribution of the number of individuals of each species in a community.Preston, F.W. (1948) The commonness, and rarity, of species. Ecology 29, 254-283.Papp, L. & Izsák, J. (1997) Bimodality in occurrence classes: a direct consequence of lognormal and logarithmic series distribution of abundances – a numerical experimentation. Oikos 79, 191-194. The significance of his idea was, however, disputed already by some of his contemporaries.Gleason, H.A. (1929) The significance of Raunkiaer's law of frequency. Ecology 10, 406-408.
Raunkiær's research axiom was that everything countable in nature should be subjected to numerical analysis, e.g. the number of male and female catkins in monecious plants and the number of male and female individuals in dioecious plants. Raunkiær also was an early student of apomixis in flowering plants and hybrid swarms. In addition, he studied the effect of soil pH on plants and plants on soil pH, a work his apprentice Carsten Olsen continued.
