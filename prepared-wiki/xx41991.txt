South Tyrol (German and Ladin: Südtirol, Italian: Sudtirolo), also known by its Italian name Alto Adige, is an autonomous province in northern Italy. It is one of the two autonomous provinces that make up the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.  The province has an area of [tpl]convert|7400|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] and a total population of 511,750 inhabitants (31.12.2011). Its capital is the city of Bolzano (German: Bozen; Ladin: Balsan or Bulsan).
The majority of the population is of Austro-Bavarian heritage and speaks German. Around a quarter of the population speak Italian as first language, mainly concentrated to the two largest cities (Bolzano and Merano), and a small minority speak Ladin as their mother language.
South Tyrol is granted a considerable level of self-government, consisting of a large range of exclusive legislative powers and a fiscal regime that allows the province to retain 90% of most levied taxes. Today, South Tyrol is among the wealthiest and most developed regions in Italy and the European Union.
In the wider context of the European Union, the province is one of the three members of the Euroregion of Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, which corresponds almost exactly to the historical region of Tyrol.Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livinallongo/Buchenstein and Colle Santa Lucia, formerly parts of Tyrol, now belong to the region of Veneto.

==Name==

South Tyrol (occasionally South Tirol) is the term most commonly used in English for the province,Cf. for instance Antony E. Alcock, The History of the South Tyrol Question, London: Michael Joseph, 1970; Rolf Steininger, South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century, New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 2003. and its usage reflects that it was created from a portion of the southern part of the historic County of Tyrol. German and Ladin speakers usually refer to the area as Südtirol; the Italian equivalent Sudtirolo (sometimes spelled Sud Tirolo) is becoming increasingly common.
Alto Adige (literally translated in English: "Upper Adige"), one of the Italian names for the province, is also used in English.Cfr. for instance this article fom britishcouncil.org http://www.britishcouncil.org/language-assistants-ela-success-stories-abbey-cameron-alto-adige-italy.pdf The term had been the name of political subdivisions along the Adige River in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte,[tpl]cite book|title=Raccolta delle leggi, proclami, ordini ed avvisi, Vol 5|year=1798|publisher=Luigi Viladini|location=Milan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1RDgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA184&dq=%22alto+adige%22+benaco+-torri+-trentino&hl=en&ei=s2AkTqjzNMLg0QGP3PmmAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22alto%20adige%22%20benaco%20-torri%20-trentino&f=false|author=Cisalpine Republic|page=184|language=Italian[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Napoleon's Italian campaigns 1805-1815|year=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Milan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cLjJV7AKPkAC&pg=PA99&dq=%22alto+adige%22+departement+napoleon&hl=en&ei=s8AqTvWWBc2UOqyfqOkK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=alto%20adige&f=false|author=Frederick C. Schneid|page=99[/tpl] who created the Department of Alto Adige. It was reused as the Italian name of the current province after its post-World War I creation, and was a symbol of the subsequent forced Italianization of South Tyrol.
The official name of the province today in German is Autonome Provinz Bozen — Südtirol.  German speakers usually refer to it not as a Provinz, but as a Land (such as the Länder of either Germany or Austria).[ref]
