Ike Ibeabuchi (September 21, 1973) (born in Isuochi, Nigeria) is a former professional heavyweight boxer who defeated highly ranked contender David Tua and future heavyweight titlist Chris Byrd. Ibeabuchi's ring nickname is "The President." After compiling a record of 20-0 with 15 knockouts, he was imprisoned in Las Vegas in July 1999, and offering an Alford plea, he served his sentence and was released in February 2014.

==Amateur career==

Ike planned on joining the Nigerian military before he witnessed Buster Douglas knock out Mike Tyson in 1990. Inspired by the fight, Ike started boxing as an amateur. Ike twice defeated countryman and eventual 1996 Olympic Bronze medalist Duncan Dokiwari. Ibeabuchi emigrated to United States and moved to the Dallas area with his mother in 1993/ Ibeabuchi won the Dallas and Texas State Golden Gloves tournaments at heavyweight in 1994.

==Professional career==

Under the guidance of former world welterweight champion Curtis Cokes, Ike made his professional debut at heavyweight with a second round knockout of Ismael Garcia on October 13, 1994.

===Battle with David Tua===

After winning 16 straight fights from the start of his career, Ike made a big jump in competition and fought undefeated prospect David Tua for the WBC International Heavyweight title on June 7, 1997. Tua was 27-0 and considered by many analysts to be 'the next Mike Tyson'.
The fight was spectacular. Both boxers threw bombs and neither took a backward step all night. Ibeabuchi and Tua set a CompuStat heavyweight division record with 1,730 punches thrown. Ike also set the individual CompuStat record by throwing 975 punches and averaging 81 per round. The heavyweight average is around 50. Ibeabuchi won a unanimous 12 round decision over Tua with scores of 117-111, 116-113, and 115-114. The fight established Ibeabuchi as the top contender for the world heavyweight title.

===Troubles outside the ring===

A couple of months after the Tua fight, Ibeabuchi abducted the 15-year-old son of his former girlfriend and slammed his car into a concrete pillar on Interstate 35 north of Austin, Texas. According to the criminal complaint, the boy suffered 'numerous injuries' from the accident 'and will never walk normally again'. The courts concluded Ibeabuchi was trying to commit suicide, and he was sentenced to 120 days in jail after pleading guilty to false imprisonment. Ibeabuchi also paid a $500,000 civil settlement.
Ibeabuchi developed a new persona based on his nickname, 'The President'. At times when he was being churlish or refusing to complete a simple requirement such as attending a weigh-in, his handlers would appeal to The President's regal nature by convincing him it was the noble thing to do. "There were times when he thought he was really a president," boxing promoter and former HBO Sports executive Lou DiBella said. "He would get into these mental states where he insisted on people calling him 'The President'. It was his alter ago, where 'I am The President,' not of the United States, but maybe president of the world."
Once, Ibeabuchi wielded a knife during a dinner meeting in New York to discuss a possible three fight HBO deal. "We were having a fine meal at a nice restaurant," Promoter Cedric Kushner said, "and mid-course Ike picked up a big carving knife, slammed it into the table and screamed 'They knew it! They knew it! The belts belong to me! Why don't they just give them back?'" "That was a peculiar experience," Kushner said. "That wasn't the type of conduct I expected to romance the guy from HBO. He (Ibeabuchi) was like a Viking."Michael Katz .

===Comeback===

Ibeabuchi returned to the ring after thirteen months inactivity, and scored a first round knockout over Tim Ray in July 1998. Two months later, he stopped Everton Davis in nine rounds.
Ike's next fight was against Chris Byrd in March 1999. Byrd, a 1992 Olympic silver medalist and a future world heavyweight champion, was a quick and slick southpaw with a record of 26-0.
After four rounds, the three judges had the fight scored evenly: 38-38 even, 39-37 for Ibeabuchi, and 39-37 for Byrd. In the fifth round, Ibeabuchi landed a devastating left hook which sent Byrd to the canvas. Byrd made it back to his feet, but was quickly knocked back down. Byrd once again rose, but was trapped against the ropes and taking punishment as the referee waived it off at the 2:59 mark.Katherine Dunn. The Cyber Boxing Zone Newswire, 20 March 1999, Retrieved March 29, 2011.
Following the win over Byrd, Ike turned down $700,000 to fight fringe contender Jeremy Williams, and also turned down $1 million for a showdown with the undefeated Michael Grant."Blake Montgomery", Craig's Mind is Ramblin', 7 February 2010, Retrieved March 31, 2011.

==Imprisonment and release==

In July 1999, Ibeabuchi was staying at The Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas when he phoned a local escort service, and had a woman sent to his room. The 21-year-old woman said later she was there to strip-and (for) nothing else. She claimed Ibeabuchi attacked her in the walk-in closet after she demanded to be paid up front.  Ibeabuchi barricaded himself in the bathroom, and police discharged pepper spray under the door till he surrendered.
Ibeabuchi's legal defense faced the further difficulty of the Clark County DA's reopening of a similar sexual assault allegation against him from eight months earlier which took place at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. Ibeabuchi was released on bail and placed under house arrest, able to train and fight again until his trial. He was remanded after two more similar allegations surfaced from Arizona.
Ibeabuchi was deemed incompetent to stand trial and was sent to a state facility. Medical experts concluded he exhibited bipolar disorder, and a judge granted permission to force-medicate him. Eight months later, 2½ years after his arrest, he was ruled cogent enough to plea.
Ibeabuchi subsequently entered an Alford plea, pleading guilty while not admitting guilt to avoid going to trial.  Ibeabuchi was sentenced to two to ten years for battery with intent to commit a crime (from which he was later paroled), and three to 20 years for attempted sexual assault, with the sentences to be served consecutively.
While incarcerated, Ibeabuchi earned two college degrees from Western Nevada Community College: an Associate of General Studies and an Associate of Applied Science in General Business. Ibeabuchi may be released soon from prison by the Nevada Department of Corrections in 2014 after serving his sentence. However, early reports reporting his release were false. Ibeabuchi has been transferred in Nevada to the Washoe County Jail. His release is still pending.http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2014/ike-ibeabuchi-still-in-jail-has-been-transferred-not-released-but-the-41-year-old-hopes-
