==Club career==

Born in Sintra, Lisbon, Henriques joined S.L. Benfica at nearly 16, from neighbouring C.F. Os Belenenses. He played six minutes in his only appearance in the 1993–94 season, a 3–0 away win against Gil Vicente FC, as his team won the national championship.
After a six-month loan at Vitória F.C. and the 1996 arrival of Manuel José as coach, Henriques became a regular in the starting lineups, as Dimas had just been sold to Juventus FC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://serbenfiquista.com/forum/index.php?topic=33611.0|title=Pedro Henriques|publisher=Ser Benfiquista|language=Portuguese|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] In the 1997 summer he signed for F.C. Porto but, due to a knee injury he had contracted still with the Reds, he never appeared official for the club, and returned to Setúbal for the later part of the campaign. 
In the following seven seasons, always in the top division, Henriques represented Vitória de Setúbal, Belenenses,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=38723|title=Belenenses assegura Pedro Henriques|trans_title=Belenenses confirms Pedro Henriques|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=7 July 2000|accessdate=6 November 2013[/tpl] C.D.
