She had one rather tall funnel.  She had an iron hull and was rigged as a barque. She was stricken in 1907. Her hull was sunk as a target ship in 1936.Escobén magazine, February 8 2004[tpl]es[/tpl]

==Allianca incident==

In March 1895, Conde de Venadito was involved in an incident with the American merchant ship Allianca off Cape Maisí, Cuba. The Spanish ship attempted to stop Allianca for search on suspicion of filibustering, or smuggling arms to the insurgents in Cuba. The American ship failing to stop, the Spanish vessel fired several solid shots at the merchant ship during an unsuccessful chase of about 20 miles.Wisen, pg. 71 This touched off much sensational reporting in the American press and is credited by many with crystallizing anti-Spanish sentiment in the American public in the years preceding the Spanish-American War.
