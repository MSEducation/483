The main purpose of the new Transitway facility according to OC Transpo's Transplan program as the result of public consultation process on transit improvement was to improve connections between local routes in Kanata North and route 93, which travels to the Kanata North Business Park from Lebreton Station and Lincoln Fields Station.http://ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/tc/2007/06-06/ACS2007-PTE-TRA-0008.htm Other routes, such as route 164 (serving Bridlewood and Hope Side Road), and route 168 (serving Beaverbrook) were modified in order to serve Teron Station, and both route 164 and route 168 provide a connection to Kanata Centrum at Terry Fox Station from route 93 in Kanata North. 
Additionally, Teron will be part of a future extension of the Western Segment of the Transitway. According to the Ottawa 2020 Transportation Master Plan, the segment from Eagleson Road to Terry Fox Drive is scheduled to be completed by 2013.http://www.ottawa.ca/city_services/planningzoning/2020/transpo/toc_en.shtml
