Indirect presidential elections were held in Guatemala on 5 June 1993. They were sparked by the 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis in which President Jorge Serrano Elías had attempted a self-coup. The result was a victory for Ramiro de León Carpio, who won unopposed in the second round of voting, whilst the army-backed Arturo Herbruger was elected vice-president.Torres Rivas, Edelberto. 1996. “Guatemala: democratic governability.” Constructing democratic governance: Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1990s. 1996.
