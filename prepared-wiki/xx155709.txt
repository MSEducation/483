==History Of Crestview High School==

The first school in Crestview was a two-story frame building. It opened in 1879 on Highway 85, where the cemetery is today. The family names of some of the students who attended this school are still familiar today, among them Lance Richbourg, the Ferdon brothers, Opal Clark, R.D. Bush, and Alice Hart. At that time, the students went to school only four months out of the year. They learned the three "R's" during school and battled hogs at lunchtime.
In 1916, the original school was destroyed in a fire.  Okaloosa County had just been formed and had appointed its first Superintendent, W.G. Prior. Until they had a new school, the students were taught in a room at a small church. The church stood were the Harris Building and the Church of Christ are today.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1917, the school was replaced by a small building across from the courthouse. It had only five rooms and 70 students. At that time, there was only two people in the faculty - Carey Rice (who was a principal, teacher, and general handyman) and her assistant principal. This school had increasing enrollment until it was destroyed by fire in 1920. After that, the students then crammed into an old Baptist Tabernacle for classes.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
For the next six years, the county consolidated its school system. The schools went from 64 one-room buildings to 14 larger institutions with varied equipment and curriculum. The first seniors graduated from Crestview in 1924. There were only three - Purl Adams, Julia Adams, and Alton Clary.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The History Of Crestview High School|url=http://www.crestviewbulldogs.org/about/our-history/|publisher=Crestview High School|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl]
In 1926, there was another new Crestview School, this one located at U.S. Route 90 and State Road 85. In 1928, Crestview High School became an accredited institution. By 1937, Crestview High School contained 200 students from grades one to twelve. The population of Crestview had reached 3000.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
During World War II, Eglin Air Force Base was built. The money from the national defense effort helped Okaloosa County progress. Education facilities were expanded and re-built. In 1942, Northwood Elementary School was built and grades one through eight were moved there. Crestview High School housed ninth through twelfth grade.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1953, disaster struck again, in the form of another fire. It was only a few hours before the students were going to be released for Christmas break. So, another new school was built - what is now the former Richbourg Middle School. It had 23 classrooms, a library, an office, a gym, a clinic and a lunchroom. The school cost $519,000 to build. There were 22 teachers that taught the 520 students enrolled there.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1969, Crestview High School had expanded so drastically that it was necessary to build another school building. This new campus is the present day school.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Bob|title=The History Of Crestview High School|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00028411/00728|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=Crestview News Bulletin|date=26 May 2007|page=9[/tpl]
