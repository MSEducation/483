I Need Drugs is the debut studio album by the American rapper Necro, released on November 7, 2000 by Psycho+Logical-Records. This album maintains emphasis on both his violence and sex themes, rather than focusing on one or the other such as in his 2001 album Gory Days and his 2005 album The Sexorcist, respectively. The album spawned one single, "The Most Sadistic", and a music video for the title track. 
The album contains 13 studio tracks and three radio freestyles. Seven of the studio tracks from the album were previously released on the "Get on Your Knees" single and the Necro EP. Featured guests on the album include Necro's brother Ill Bill and Mr. Hyde.
I Need Drugs contains many Necro classics, all of which showcase notable styles Necro refers to as "gore" ("Your Fuckin' Head Split"), "sex" ("Get on Your Knees") and "violence" ("The Most Sadistic").
A controversial music video was made for the aforementioned title track, which depicts Necro's uncle and a friend shooting heroin and smoking crack cocaine while Necro performs the song.
"The Most Sadistic" and "Fuck You to the Track" were subsequently remixed since this release, in 2003 for Rare Demos and Freestyles Volume 1 and 2005 for Rare Demos and Freestyles Vol. 2 respectively. An alternate mix of "Rugged Shit" was also released in 2003 on Rare Demos & Freestyles Vol. 3.
The track "Your Fucking Head Split" contains a sample from the soundtrack of The Amazing Spider-Man. 
The track "Cockroaches" contains a sample from the 1983 film Scarface
The song "Your Fuckin' Head Split" was featured in the 2011 movie Goon.
