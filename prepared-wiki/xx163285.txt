==Route description==

State Route 455, the Tennessee Waltz Parkway, is a short bypass around Ashland City in Cheatham County. The general routing is southeast-northwest. SR 455 is less than [tpl]convert|2|mi[/tpl] in length.  The route is a continuation of a bypass from State Route 12 to State Route 49 which runs by the A.O. Smith water heater factory to a point just north of the Cumberland River bridge which is not designated a state route.  State Route 455 has its origins in a 1997 referendum in which the voters of Ashland City authorized a 1/2 cent sales tax increase with proceeds going to build and maintain a continuation of the bypass back around to Route 12.  The road was finally completed in 2005.
