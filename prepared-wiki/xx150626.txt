AmiExpress - also known as /X - by Synthetic Technologies was a popular BBS software application for the Commodore Amiga line of computers. AmiExpress was extremely popular among the warez scene for trading (exchanging) software."TC" (July 20, 1994), Pirate's Manifesto VIII, textfiles.com, retrieved June 16, 2007Swinging Man (Autumn, 1992), Hacking AmiExpress, 2600 Magazine, ISSN 0749-3851, retrieved from gbppr.trighost.org on June 16, 2007
AmiExpress was created and updated between 1992 and 1995.  Originally written by Michael Thomas of Synthetic Technologies and later sold to Joseph Hodge of Lightspeed Technologies. Mike Thomas worked on AmiExpress for about two years, modelling the software after the commercial PC BBS software PCBoard. He first ran a BBS on PCBoard on a PC himself, but he was not happy with the PC platform in general and decided to make a comparable product on the Amiga.Michael Thomas, Comments for "BBS - The Documentary", BBSDocumentary.com, retrieved July 27, 2008.
A Usenet post (by /X author Joseph Hodge) later stated that both programming on /X and the developer company (LightSpeed Technologies Inc.) were to be dissolved, with plans for a new bulletin board system - Millennium BBS. This never surfaced.
