==Music career==

===Beginnings===

Juvenile released the song "Back That Thang Up", which was a big hit in the early 2000s. He first began recording his raps in the early 1990s. One of his early recordings was featured on DJ Jimi's 1991 release, "It's Jimi". The song "Bounce For the Juvenile" was a minor local hit and helped popularize "bounce music," a new rap style emerging out of New Orleans. In his smash hit, "Back That Thang Up," Juvenile included dogs barking as part of the beat for the song.

===1994-95: Being Myself===

Juvenile's debut album, Being Myself, was released in 1995 after signing with Warlock Records. The album did not gain much national attention and did not chart, but did fairly well on a local level.

===1997: Solja Rags===

After the regional success of his debut Juvenile signed to the larger Cash Money Records.  In 1997 Solja Rags, Juvenile's debut album with Cash Money Records, was released. It became popular among local rap audiences, and also saw some national success as it charted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.  It was the first time he worked with Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh, who would go on to produce all of Juvenile's albums on Cash Money in their entirety except Juve the Great.  Also in 1997 Juvenile joined the group the Hot Boys with fellow Cash Money rappers B.G., Turk, and Lil Wayne. They released their debut album as a group, titled Get It How U Live!

===1998: 400 Degreez===

Juvenile's next album, titled 400 Degreez was released in 1998. It was his breakout to the national rap scene.   The Cash Money label now had joint distribution by Universal Records, which gave the music much more national promotion.  This along with much more critically praised music made Juvenile a mainstream star.  The album's first single "Ha" and later "Back That Azz Up", both became very successful songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Juvenile – Billboard Singles|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92107/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-06[/tpl] Powered by these two singles 400 Degreez was eventually certified 4X platinum by the RIAA.  It is his best selling album to date.  However, there came a dispute over who owned the rights to the title of "Back That Azz Up", as another New Orleans performer DJ Jubilee claimed that Juvenile's song sounded very similar to a song of his. In January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans denied the case.[tpl]cite news|title=For The Record: Quick News On Nickelback, Mariah Carey, Kanye West, Beyonce, Further Seems Forever, Juvenile & .he also has a 9th album coming out in stores on November according to his myspace page in November More Juvenile net worth $350 million|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496325/20050127/nickelback.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=2005-01-27|accessdate=2008-02-14[/tpl]

===1999-2002: Tha G-Code & Project English===

In 1998, capitalizing off Juvenile's popularity off 400 Degreez, a remixed version of Being Myself and reissue of Solja Rags were released. The second Hot Boys group album, Guerrilla Warfare also came out and was successful, being certified Platinum. Over the next few years Juvenile released two more solo albums for Cash Money Tha G-Code in 1999 being certified Double Platinum, and Project English in 2001 being certified Platinum.  These albums each were very successful as they both reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 200, but they did not match the success of 400 Degreez. UTP Records had promised an album titled 600 Degreez but it never materialized.

===2003-04: Juve the Great & UTP===

Juvenile's manager Aubrey Francis and Cash Money's Baby met and worked out a deal for Juve and CMR to partner for another album.
