[[Giants–Redskins rivalry]]

CATEGORIES: National Football League rivalries, New York Giants, Washington Redskins

The Giants–Redskins rivalry is a rivalry between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins of the National Football League. The rivalry began in 1932 with the founding of the Washington Redskins, and is the oldest rivalry in the NFC East Division. While often dismissed, particularly in recent times, this rivalry has seen periods of great competition. In particular the Giants and Redskins competed fiercely for conference and division titles in the late 1930s and early 1940s and 1980s. Perhaps most fans today recall the 1980s as the most hotly contested period between these teams, as the Redskins under Joe Gibbs and the Giants under Bill Parcells competed for division titles and Super Bowls. During this span the two teams combined to win 7 NFC East Divisional Titles, 5 Super Bowls and even duked it out in the 1986 NFC Championship Game with the Giants winning 17-0. This rivalry is storied and while it tends to be dismissed due to the Redskins recent struggles, Wellington Mara, long time owner of the Giants, always said that he believed the Redskins were the Giants' truest rival.[tpl]cite news| url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/top-10-moments-in-the-giants-redskins-rivalry/ | work=The New York Times | first=Greg | last=Hanlon | title=Top 10 Moments in the Giants-Redskins Rivalry | date=November 30, 2008[/tpl] Despite flagging in recent years, in 2012 the rivalry intensified significantly, both on the field and off it: when, in March of that year, a special NFL commission headed by Giants owner John Mara imposed a $36 million salary cap penalty on the Redskins (and a smaller one on the Dallas Cowboys) for the organization's approach to structuring contracts in the 2010 NFL season, when there was no cap - which he publicly claimed was, if anything, too lenient, and should have cost them draft picks as well - the Redskins organization, particularly owner Daniel Snyder, were convinced that, by so disciplining divisional rivals, Mara had abused his league-wide office to advance his own teams' interests (the draft sanctions Mara sought were regarded as especially malicious, as such a punishment would have likely voided the pick-laden trade with the St. Louis Rams - completed three days before the cap penalties were announced - to acquire the #2 position, used to draft Robert Griffin III); in the week leading up to a crucial Week 13 Monday Night Football showdown eventually won by Washington, copies of Mara's quote, along with statistics implying that NFL referees were biased in the Giants' favor, were posted throughout the teams' facilities, and a smiling Snyder, within earshot of numerous media personnel, told a team employee that "I hate those motherfuckers" in the victorious locker room after the game.http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/dan-snyder-profane-joy-redskins-win-based-salary-174043694--nfl.html
