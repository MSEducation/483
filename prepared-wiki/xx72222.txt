Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 5.1 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion users.[tpl]cite web|title=Xcode on the Mac App Store|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=October 3, 2012[/tpl] Registered developers can download preview releases and previous versions of the suite through the Apple Developer website.[tpl]cite web|title=Mac Dev Center|url=http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/|publisher=Apple Developer|accessdate=July 31, 2011[/tpl]

==Major features==

Previously Xcode supported distributing a product build process over multiple systems. One technology involved was called Shared Workgroup Build, which used the Bonjour protocol to automatically discover systems providing compiler services, and a modified version of the free software product distcc to facilitate the distribution of workloads. Earlier versions of Xcode provided a system called Dedicated Network Builds. These features are absent in the supported versions of Xcode.
Thanks to the Mach-O executable format, which allows for “fat binaries," containing code for multiple architectures, Xcode can build universal binaries, which allow software to run on both PowerPC and Intel-based (x86) platforms and that can include both 32-bit and 64-bit code for both architectures. Using the iOS SDK, Xcode can also be used to compile and debug applications for iOS that run on the ARM processor.
Xcode also includes Apple's WebObjects tools and frameworks for building Java web applications and web services (previously sold as a separate product). As of Xcode 3.0, Apple dropped[tpl]cite web|author=David Holt says: |url=http://www.wocommunity.org/webobjects_faq.html#xcode3 |title=Facts about WebObjects (WebObjects Community) |publisher=Wocommunity.org |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2010[/tpl] WebObjects development inside Xcode; WOLips[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/WOLips |title=WOLips |publisher=Wiki.objectstyle.org |date=February 27, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2010[/tpl] should be used instead. Xcode 3 still includes the WebObjects frameworks.
Xcode includes the GUI tool Instruments, which runs atop DTrace, a dynamic tracing framework created by Sun Microsystems and released as part of OpenSolaris.

==Composition==

The main application of the suite is the integrated development environment (IDE), also named Xcode. The Xcode suite also includes most of Apple's developer documentation, and built-in Interface Builder, an application used to construct graphical user interfaces.
Up to Xcode 4.1, the Xcode suite included a modified version of the GNU Compiler Collection.  In Xcode 3.1 up to Xcode 4.6.3, it included the llvm-gcc compiler, with front ends from the GNU Compiler Collection and a code generator based on LLVM,[tpl]cite web|author=Prince McLean|title=Apple's other open secret: the LLVM Compiler|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/06/20/apples_other_open_secret_the_llvm_complier.html|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=April 3, 2012[/tpl] and, in Xcode 3.2 and later, it included Apple's LLVM Compiler, with the clang front end and a code generator based on LLVM, and the Clang Static Analyzer.[tpl]cite web|title=XCode 3.2: teh awesome edition|url=http://www.mcubedsw.com/blog/index.php/site/comments/xcode_3.2_teh_awesome_edition/|date=August 30, 2009|accessdate=April 3, 2012[/tpl]  Starting with Xcode 4.2, the Apple LLVM Compiler became the default compiler,[tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_2.html |title=What's New In Xcode: New Features in Xcode 4.2 |publisher=Apple |accessdate=March 28, 2012[/tpl] and, starting with Xcode 5.0, it was the only compiler provided.
Up to Xcode 4.6.3, the Xcode suite used the GNU Debugger (GDB) as the back-end for the IDE's debugger. Starting with Xcode 4.3, the LLDB debugger was also provided and, starting with Xcode 4.5, replaced GDB as the default back-end for the IDE's debugger;[tpl]cite web|title=What's New in Xcode 4.5|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_5.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl] as of Xcode 5.0, GDB was no longer supplied. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_5_0.html
Xcode supports C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python, Ruby and Rez source code with a variety of programming models, including but not limited to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java.

==Version history==

===1.x series===

Xcode 1.0 was released in fall 2003. Xcode 1.0 was based on Project Builder, but had an updated UI, ZeroLink, Fix & Continue, distributed build support, and Code Sense indexing.
The next significant release, Xcode 1.5, had better code completion and an improved debugger.

===2.x series===

Xcode 2.0 was released with Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger". It included the Quartz Composer visual programming language, better Code Sense indexing for Java, and Ant support. It also included the Apple Reference Library tool, which lets you search and read online documentation from Apple’s website and local documentation installed on your machine.
Xcode 2.1 could create universal binaries. It supported Shared Precompiled Headers, unit testing targets, conditional breakpoints, and watchpoints. It also had better dependency analysis.
The final version of Xcode for Mac OS X v10.4 was 2.5.

===3.x series===

Xcode 3.0 was released with Mac OS X v10.5 "Leopard". Notable changes since 2.1 includeApple - Mac OS X Leopard - Features - 300+ New Features[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] the DTrace debugging tool (now called Instruments), refactoring support, context-sensitive documentation, and Objective-C 2.0 with garbage collection.  It also supports Project Snapshots, which provide a basic form of version control; Message Bubbles, which show build errors debug values alongside code; and building four-architecture fat binaries (32 and 64-bit Intel and PowerPC).
Xcode 3.1 was an update release of the developer tools for Mac OS X, and was the same version included with the iPhone SDK. It could target non-Mac OS X platforms, including iPhone OS 2.0. It included the GCC 4.2 and LLVM GCC 4.2 compilers. Another new feature since Xcode 3.0 is that Xcode's SCM support now supports Subversion 1.5.
Xcode 3.2 was released with Mac OS X v10.6 "Snow Leopard" and will not install on any earlier version of Mac OS X.  It supports static program analysis, among other features. It also drops official support for targeting versions earlier than iPhone OS 3.0. But it is still possible to target older versions, and the simulator supports iPhone OS 2.0 through 3.1. Also, Java support is "exiled" in 3.2 to the organizer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/02-JavaDevTools/JavaDevTools.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001884-SW1|title=Apple Developer Tools for Java|publisher=Apple|accessdate=February 8, 2011[/tpl]
Xcode 3.2.6 is the last version that can be downloaded for free for users of Mac OS X v10.6. Downloading it requires a free registration at Apple's developer site.

In June 2010 at the World Wide Developers Conference, Apple announced version 4 of Xcode during the Developer Tools State of the Union address. Version 4 of the developer tools consolidates the Xcode editing tools and Interface Builder into a single application, among other enhancements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/08/wwdc-software-notes-safari-5-xcode-4-itunes-9-2/ |title=WWDC Software Notes: Safari 5, Xcode 4, iTunes 9.2 |publisher=Mac Rumors |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/whats-new.html|title=Developer Tools - What's New in Xcode 4|work=Apple Developer|accessdate=February 8, 2011[/tpl] Apple released the final code for Xcode 4.0 on March 9, 2011. The software was made available for free to all registered members of the $99 per year Mac Developer program and the $99 per year iOS Developer program. It was also sold for $4.99 to non-members on the Mac App Store (no longer available).  Xcode 4.0 drops support for many older systems, including all PowerPC development as well as SDKs for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, and all iOS SDKs older than 4.3.  The deployment target can still be set to produce binaries for those older platforms, but for the Mac OS platforms one is then limited to creating x86 and x86_64 binaries. Later, Xcode was "Free" to the General Public. Before version 4.1, Xcode cost $4.99.[tpl]cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/20/apple_makes_xcode_free_to_all_with_release_of_4_1_on_mac_app_store.html |title=Apple makes Xcode free to all with release of 4.1 on Mac App Store |publisher=AppleInsider |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2013[/tpl]
