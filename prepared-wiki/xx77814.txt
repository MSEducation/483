Zagreb County ([tpl]lang-hr|Zagrebačka županija[/tpl]) is a county in central Croatia. It surrounds – but does not contain – the nation's capital Zagreb, which is a separate territorial unit. For that reason, it is often nicknamed "Zagreb ring". According to the 2011 census, the county has 317,606 inhabitants. 
The Zagreb County once included the city of Zagreb, but in 1997 they separated, when the City was given a special status.Narodne novine, br. 62/01, 125/08 Although separated from Zagreb City County both administratively and territorially, it still remains closely linked with it.
