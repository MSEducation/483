Saint Maighneann was a Christian abbot in the 7th century who lived in Dublin, Ireland in an area now known as Kilmainham.  Some of his teachings were recorded in a 15th-century manuscript titled A Life of St Maighneann, an Irish saint of the seventh century.  

==History==

Maighnean is thought to have lived during the first half of the 7th century CE.  He set up his church on a ridge between two rivers, the Liffey and the Camac and presided there as abbot, though in some instances he is referred to with the title bishop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inchicore.info/history/ |title=Inchicore.info |publisher=Inchicore.info |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=O'Broin|first=Seosamh|title=Inchicore,Kilmainham and District|year=1999|publisher=Cois Camoige Publications|location=National Library of Ireland|isbn=978-0953592906|pages=22-24[/tpl]  Maighneann was followed by twenty-seven monks who travelled with him during pilgrimages around the country.  He visited several other Irish saints including Saint Maelruain of Tallaght, Saint Dublitir of Fingal and Saint Finnin of Strangford.  While at Tallaght he made his confession to Saint Maelruain. Maelruain considered Maighneann lazy because he shied away from manual labour. Nonetheless, Maelruain praised Maighneann for keeping his ritual fire, which he kept constantly alight for over thirty years.[tpl]cite book|last=Kenny|first=Colum|title=Kilmainham; A settlement Older than Dublin|year=1995|publisher=Four Courts Press|location=Marsh's Library|isbn=9781851822195|pages=15-21[/tpl]  Such was Maighneann's fame that the historic area of Kilmainham was named after his church "Cill Mhaighneann."[tpl]cite book|last=Ó Cléirigh|first=Mícheál|title=Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters, from the earliest times to the year 1616|year=1856|page=911|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FDlNAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22St.+Maighneann%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|edition=2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Letters Containing Information Relative to the Antiquities of the Counties|year=1928|publisher=Great Britain Ordinance Survey|page=xxxi|author=John O'Donovan|coauthors=Michael O'Flanagan[/tpl]  Subsequently two famous buildings Kilmainham Priory, established by Strongbow after his invasion in 1169,[tpl]cite book|last=Roche|first=Richard|title=The Norman Invasion of Ireland|year=1995|publisher=Anvil Press|location=National Library of Ireland|isbn=978-0947962814|pages=47-49[/tpl] and survived until it was suppressed by Henry VIII, and The Royal Hospital Kilmainham which was built by the Duke of Ormonde in 1680[tpl]cite book|last=Childers|first=Maj.

Maighnean was also the subject of a 15th-century manuscript titled, A Life of St Maighneann, an Irish saint of the seventh century written by Ulliam Mac an Lega.[tpl]cite book|last=Simms|first=Katherine|title=From kings to warlords : the changing political structure of Gaelic Ireland in the later Middle Ages|year=2000|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|location=Woodbridge|isbn=085115784X|page=93|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9Ixtdp2naboC&dq=%22St.+Maighneann%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Martínez|first=edited by Florentino García|title=Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome : studies in ancient cultural interaction in honour of A.

Many of these discussions were derived from Maighnean's interactions with other saints that he visited during his lifetime.
