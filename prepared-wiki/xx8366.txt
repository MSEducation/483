The Nez Perce [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɛ|z|ˈ|p|ɜr|s[/tpl] (autonym: Niimíipu) are a Native American people who live in the Pacific Northwest region (Columbia River Plateau) of the United States. An anthropological interpretation says they descended from the Old Cordilleran Culture, which moved south from the Rocky Mountains and west into lands where the tribe coalesced.Josephy, Alvin M. The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest, Boston: Mariner Books, 1997. p. 15. ISBN 978-0-395-85011-4. The federally recognized Nez Perce Nation currently governs and lives within its reservation in Idaho.R. David Edmunds "The Nez Perce Flight for Justice," American Heritage, Fall 2008. Their name for themselves is Nimíipuu (pronounced [tpl]IPA-sal|nimiːpuː|[/tpl]), meaning, "The People," in their language, part of the Sahaptin family.Aoki, Haruo. Nez Perce Dictionary. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. ISBN 978-0-520-09763-6.
They speak the Nez Perce language or Niimiipuutímt, a Sahaptian language related to the several dialects of Sahaptin. The Sahaptian sub-family is one of the branches of the Plateau Penutian family (which in turn may be related to a larger Penutian grouping).
==Name== 
Nez Percé is an exonym given by French Canadian fur traders who visited the area regularly in the late 18th century, meaning literally "pierced nose". Today the Nez Perce identify most often as Niimíipu in Sahaptin. The tribe also uses the term "Nez Perce," as do the United States Government in its official dealings with them, and contemporary historians. Older historical ethnological works use the French spelling of Nez Percé, with the diacritic. The original French pronunciation is [tpl]IPAc-fr|n|e|-|p|E|r|s|e[/tpl], with three syllables.
William Clark in his journals referred to the people as the Chopunnish [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|oʊ|p|ə|n|ɪ|ʃ[/tpl]. This term is an adaptation of the term cú·pŉitpeľu (the Nez Perce people) which is formed from cú·pŉit (piercing with a pointed object) and peľu (people).[ref]
