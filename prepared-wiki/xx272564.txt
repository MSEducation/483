The Glass Menagerie was Katharine Hepburn's first appearance on television. She had initially been wary of the medium, but was convinced by the opportunity to work with friend Anthony Harvey, with whom she had made the successful film The Lion in Winter. Hepburn was also drawn to the project when she was told her niece Katharine Houghton could co-star as Laura, but Houghton eventually turned down the role.[tpl]cite book|last=Berg|first=A.
