[[Faint blue galaxy]]

CATEGORIES: Galaxies

The faint blue galaxy (F.B.G.) problem in astrophysics first arose with observations starting in 1978 that there were more galaxies with a bolometric magnitude > 22 than then-current theory predicted.Kron R 1978 Ph.D. Thesis, University of California, Berkeley[tpl]Citation | last = Peterson | first = B.A. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = R.S. | last3 = Kibblewhite | first3 = E.J. | last4 = Bridgeland | first4 = M.T. | last5 = Hooley | first5 = T. | last6 = Horne | first6 = D. | title = Number magnitude counts of faint galaxies | journal = Astrophysical Journal, Part 2 - Letters to the Editor | volume = 233 | pages = L109–L113 | date = Nov 1, 1979 | bibcode = 1979ApJ...233L.109P | doi = 10.1086/183087[/tpl][ref]

Neither explanation, nor any combination, initially matched the observations. The distribution of these galaxies has since been found to be consistent with Cosmic inflation, measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and a nonzero cosmological constant, that is, with the existence of the now-accepted dark energy.[tpl]Citation | last = Yoshii | first = Yuzuru | last2 = Takahara | first2 = Fumio | title = On the redshift-volume measurement of the cosmological density parameter | journal = Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 | volume = 346 | pages = 28–33 | date = Nov 1, 1989 | bibcode = 1989ApJ...346...28Y | doi = 10.1086/167983[/tpl][tpl]Cite conference | first = Koo | last = David C. | title = The evolution of field galaxies - Is Omega = 1? | booktitle = Evolution of the universe of galaxies; Proceedings of the Edwin Hubble Centennial Symposium | pages = 268–285 | publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date = June 21–23, 1989 | location = Berkeley, CA | bibcode = 1990ASPC...10..268K[/tpl] It thus serves as a confirmation of supernova observations requiring dark energy.
A second problem arose in 1988, with even deeper observations showing a much greater excess of faint galaxies.[tpl]Citation | last = Broadhurst | first = T.J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = R.S. | last3 = Shanks | first3 = T. | title = The Durham/Anglo-Australian Telescope faint galaxy redshift survey | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 235 | pages = 827–856 | date = Dec 1, 1988 | bibcode = 1988MNRAS.235..827B[/tpl] These are now interpreted as dwarf galaxies experiencing large bursts of stellar formation, resulting in blue light from young, massive stars.[tpl]Citation | last = Colless | first = Matthew | last2 = Ellis | first2 = Richard S. | last3 = Broadhurst |first3 = T.J. | last4 = Taylor | first4 = Keith | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Bruce A. | title = Faint blue galaxies - High or low redshift? | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 261 | pages = 19–38 | date = March 1993 | bibcode = 1993MNRAS.261...19C[/tpl] Thus F.B.G.s are extremely bright for their size and distance.
Most F.B.G.s appear between red-shift 0.5 and 2. It is believed that they disappear as separate objects by merger with other galaxies.[tpl]Citation | last = Carlberg | first = R.G. | title = Merging and fast galaxy evolution | journal = Astrophysical Journal, Part 2 - Letters | volume = 399 | issue = 1 | pages = L31–L34 | date = November 1992 | bibcode = 1992ApJ...399L..31C|doi = 10.1086/186599 [/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = Carlberg | first = R.G. | last2 = Charlot | first2 = Stephane | title = Faint galaxy evolution via interactions | journal = Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 | volume = 397 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–13 | date = September 1992 | bibcode = 1992ApJ...397....5C | doi = 10.1086/171759[/tpl]
