A South American cyclone is a tropical cyclone that affects the continent of South America or its countries. The continent is rarely affected by tropical cyclones, though most storms to hit the area are formed in the North Atlantic Ocean. Typically, strong upper level winds and its proximity to the equator prevents North Atlantic impacts.[tpl]cite web|year=2004|title=Ask Tom Why|publisher=WGN9 Chicago|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://wgntv.trb.com/news/weather/weblog/wgnweather/archives/000098.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427143006/http://wgntv.trb.com/news/weather/weblog/wgnweather/archives/000098.html  |archivedate = 2006-04-27[/tpl] No tropical cyclone has ever affected the Pacific side of South America, while conditions are typically too hostile for many storms to hit the area from the South Atlantic Ocean, but there have been a few. Based on climatology, northern Venezuela and Colombia have a 1 to 5% chance of a hurricane strike in any given year, while all locations south of 10° N have less than a 1% chance of a direct hit.[tpl]cite web|author=Pielke, Rubiera, Landsea, Fernández, and Klein|year=2003|title=Hurricane Vulnerability in Latin America & The Caribbean|publisher=National Hazards Review|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-1769-2003.21.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] A total of 38 tropical cyclones have affected the continent since 1588.

==Storms in the South Atlantic==

The South Atlantic Ocean is generally inhospitable to the formation of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the South Atlantic Ocean near Brazil, such as the unofficially-named Cyclone Catarina of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.

==Deadliest storms==

Data from South American tropical cyclones is sparse and incomplete, though most tropical cyclones that struck the continent caused multiple deaths. Bret, Joan, Cesar, Gilbert, Catarina, and Ivan all caused their deaths through rainfall or flash flooding.

==Tropical cyclone warnings and watches==

In the event an Atlantic hurricane threatens the northern coast of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines nine locations as tropical cyclone warning breakpoints. The westernmost is the border between Panama and Colombia, and the easternmost is Georgetown, Guyana, located at 6.82° N. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning breakpoints extend eastward to the border of Panama and Colombia at 7.23° N.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watch/Warning Breakpoints|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints_list.shtml?[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] No Atlantic hurricane has existed south of 6.82° N,[tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060705190625/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt  |archivedate = 2006-07-05[/tpl] and no Pacific hurricane has existed east of 80° W,[tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949-2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060614182321/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt  |archivedate = 2006-06-14[/tpl] though in the event a tropical cyclone threatens a region of South America without warnings, additional warning sites can be selected. In addition to warnings on the mainland of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines the entire island of San Andres as a tropical cyclone warning breakpoint.
Intense Hurricane Flora in 1963 prompted officials to declare gale warnings for two islands off the north coast of Venezuela.[tpl]cite web|author=Hoose|year=1963|title=Hurricane Flora Advisory 4|publisher=San Juan Weather Bureau|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1963/flora/prenhc/prelim06.gif[/tpl] In 1974, the passage of Tropical Storm Alma warranted the issuance of Gale Warnings for the Paria and Paraguaná Peninsulas. Hurricane Joan in 1988, Tropical Storm Bret in 1993, Hurricane Cesar in 1996, and Hurricane Felix in 2007 resulted in tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings for several locations in South America.[tpl]Cite web|author=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/joan/prelim08.gif|year=1988|title=Hurricane Joan Tropical Cyclone Report Page 8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1993/bret/prenhc/prelim10.gif|title=Tropical Storm Bret Tropical Cyclone Report Page 10|year=1993[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|author=Avila|year=1996|title=Hurricane Cesar Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1996cesar.html|publisher=NHC[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Blake & Avila|year=2007|title=Tropical Depression Six Public Advisory One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2007-09-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al06/al062007.public.001.shtml?[/tpl] The threat of Hurricane Ivan prompted a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning for the northern coast of Venezuela.[tpl]cite web|author=Stewart|year=2004|title=Hurricane Ivan Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004ivan.shtml?[/tpl]
