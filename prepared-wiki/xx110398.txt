==Production history==

The series premiered on July 10, 2005 with a 1.9 (cable Nielsen rating), representing the largest audience for a VH1 premiere ever at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=07/12/05&id=20050712vh101|title=VH1'S SUNDAY NIGHT 'CELEBREALITY' BLOCK ATTRACTS 10.2 MILLION VIEWERS |publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 29, 2009|date=July 12, 2005[/tpl] It began airing on CMT in early 2006 and also airs on Viva, MTV and Bio. in the UK and Ireland, TVtropolis in Canada, MusiquePlus in French Canadian (in French, the show is Hogan a raison, "Hogan is right"), Both VH1 (Seasons 1 - 3) and MTV (Season 4) in Australia, MTV Italia in Italy (in English with Italian subtitles), MTV Central in Germany and Austria (in English with German subtitles), VH1, MTV Portugal in Portugal (in English with Portuguese subtitles), in The Netherlands on MTV Netherlands with Dutch subtitles and in India on VH1, in France on Game one (le monde merveilleux de Hulk Hogan, "The Wonderful World of Hulk Hogan"), C4 and The Box in New Zealand. in Norway both on MTV Norway and VH1 with Norwegian subtitles, in Latin America with Spanish subtitles on VH1 (in Spanish, the show is Papá Hogan a la Lucha!) and in Brazil with Portuguese subtitles on VH1 (the show is called Papai Hogan Sabe Tudo or "'Daddy Hogan Knows Best'"). In Finland with Finnish subtitles on Sub and MTV Finland (the show is called Hurjat Hoganit, Furious Hogans).
The show was originally pitched and offered to Hulk Hogan prior to his famous WrestleMania X8 "Icon vs. Icon" match with The Rock in 2002. It chronicled Hogan's return to the World Wrestling Entertainment after the demise of the World Championship Wrestling and surgery on both of his knees. Hogan declined. However, after later noticing the success of pop stars such as Hilary Duff and Britney Spears, Hogan accepted a deal to do the show as a way to help promote daughter Brooke's singing career. In the episode "Hulkamania Forever", Hulk also mentions that the family has no source of income as lawyer and music studio bills in excess of $200,000 had come in recently.

===Filming===

Hogan explains in his 2009 autobiography My Life Outside the Ring, that paying unionized camera crews to film subjects continuously until something telegenic or dramatic occurs would prohibitively expensive, and that as a result, shows such as Hogan Knows Best are "soft-scripted", and follow a tightly regimented shooting schedule that allows for typical work-related considerations such as lunch breaks. When filming soft-scripted shows, the subjects are given a scenario by the producers to act out, perhaps an exaggerated version of something likely to be encountered in their real lives, are informed of the outcome, and possible "beats" in between, and instructed to improvise, which Hogan says is a version of what he did as a professional wrestler. According to Hogan, this would result in behavior that members of his family would never exhibit in real life, as when his son, Nick tossed water balloons at neighbors from a window, or when his wife would wake up early to apply makeup and do her hair before camera crews arrived to film shots of the couple sleeping.Hogan, Hulk (October 2009), My Life Outside the Ring, St. Martin's Press. pp. 175 - 178, ISBN 0312588895

===Cancellation===

It was reported that taping for an additional season of Hogan Knows Best halted in the summer of 2007, before it was finally determined that the show was canceled in early 2008 due to problems involving Nick, Linda, and Terry Bollea.[tpl]cite web|date=November 11, 2007|url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/11/11/Northpinellas/Reality_clouds_Bollea.shtml|title = Reality clouds Bollea's career|publisher = St. Petersburg Times| accessdate = November 27, 2007[/tpl]
On August 26, 2007, Nick was involved in a car crash while speeding in his Toyota Supra in Clearwater, Florida. Nick was sent to the hospital and released the following morning. However, his friend was seriously injured as a result of the car accident. Nick was charged with a felony for reckless driving and underage drinking. Also he was charged with violating limits on blood alcohol levels while driving. He was arrested on November 7, 2007, and sent to jail. However, his parents released him on a $10,000 bond shortly thereafter. Nick's friend, 22 year-old active-duty Marine John Graziano, is now on life support with serious brain injuries. It is now expected that he will require lifelong care, requiring him to spend the remainder of his life in a nursing home.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0731569720071108|title = Hulk Hogan's son arrested over car crash|publisher = Reuters | date=November 8, 2007[/tpl] The Hogan family issued a statement on how they were saddened that criminal charges had been filed against Nick, and how John was not wearing his seatbelt, but that Nick was.

In 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting Hogan Knows Best, Hulk Hogan allegedly cheated on Linda Hogan with a female friend of his daughter's, Christiane Plante. Plante, the one to confess to the affair with Hulk Hogan, worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album. Plante, 21 years younger than Hulk Hogan, claimed: "My relationship with Terry began at a time when Terry and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending. She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed. Terry is a good man, good father and a good friend, and he and I grew close at a time when he was going through a very difficult period. It seemed right then, but I know it was wrong. Having felt the guilt and pain build up, I gave a note to Brooke apologizing for my actions. I will never be able to fully forgive myself for this. I have lost an amazing friend."[tpl]cite web|url=http://anythinghollywood.com/2008/02/hulk-hogan-cheating-on-his-wife-with-daughters-pal/ |title=Hulk Hogan Cheated On His Wife With Daughter’s Pal! | Celebrity Gossip |publisher=Anythinghollywood.com |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Blemish |first=The |url=http://theblemish.com/2008/02/hulk-hogan-cheated-on-his-wife/ |title=Hulk Hogan cheated on his wife |publisher=The Blemish |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://28intampabay.wordpress.com/2008/03/03/hulk-hogan-acts-like-an-ass-and-cheats-on-his-wife/ |title=Hulk Hogan acts like an ass and cheats on his wife « 28 in Tampa Bay |publisher=28intampabay.wordpress.com |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=March 27, 2010[/tpl]
