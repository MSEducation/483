==Ecology==

Delhi is located at [tpl]coord|28.61|N|77.23|E|display=inline[/tpl], and lies in Northern India. It borders the Indian states of Haryana on the north, west and south and Uttar Pradesh (UP) to the east. During the British Raj, Delhi was part of the province of Punjab and is still historically and culturally connected to the Punjab region.[tpl]cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2000|edition=fourth|page =[/tpl] Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna river was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, north-east and north-west parts of the city. It reaches a height of [tpl]convert|318|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and is a dominant feature of the region.
The National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of [tpl]convert|1484|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|783|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0[/tpl] is designated rural, and [tpl]convert|700|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0[/tpl] urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. It has a length of [tpl]convert|51.9|km|mi|abbr=on|0[/tpl] and a width of [tpl]convert|48.48|km|mi|abbr=on|0[/tpl].
Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV, indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes, but earthquakes have not been common in recent history.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf |title=Hazard profiles of Indian districts |accessdate=23 August 2006 |format=PDF |work=National Capacity Building Project in Disaster Management |publisher=UNDP |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060519100611/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2006[/tpl]

Environmentalists have criticized the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues. Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it. Since mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution — Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/cities/delhi_third_greenest_city.php |title=Delhi 'third greenest' city |publisher=Ndtv.com |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl] and the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally-friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=85665 |title=Express India |publisher=Cities.expressindia.com |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl] In 1996, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its "bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives". The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.Delhi Metro helps reduce vehicular air pollution, indicates research, India Today, 28 April 2013 However, according several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to rise in vehicle numbers, the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[tpl]cite journal | author = R.

The Circles of Sustainability assessment of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable impression of the ecological sustainability of the city only because it is based on a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process

The National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, council of ministers and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.

===Metro===

The Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, and Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's 13th largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro is India's first modern public transportation system, which has revolutionized travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe, and comfortable means of transport. The network consists of six lines with a total length of [tpl]convert|189.63|km|mi|abbr=off[/tpl] with 142 stations, of which 35 are underground, five are at-grade, and the remainder are elevated. All stations have escalators, elevators, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi-ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi-ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge.
Delhi Metro is being built and operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organisation is under administrative control of Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides construction and operation of Delhi metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by Padma Vibhushan E. Sreedharan, the Managing Director of DMRC and popularly known as the "Metro Man" of India. He famously resigned from DMRC, taking moral responsibility for a metro bridge collapse which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded with the prestigious Legion of Honour by the French Government for his contribution to Delhi Metro.

===Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS)===

The 08 RRTS Corridors have been proposed by National Capital Region Planning Board to facilitate the people travelling from nearby cities in NCR to Delhi. The three main corridors in first phase are as follows which are expected to become operational before 2019:
Remaining five corridors are also approved by National Capital Region Planning Board but are planned in the second phase.

===Roads of 2006 and 2007===

Cricket and football are the most popular sports in Delhi. There are several cricket grounds, or maidans, located across the city. The Feroz Shah Kotla Ground (known commonly as the Kotla) is one of the oldest cricket grounds in India and is a venue for international cricket matches. It is the home ground of the Delhi cricket team, which represents the city in the Ranji Trophy, the premier Indian domestic first-class cricket championship. The Delhi cricket team has produced several world-class international cricketers such as Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Madan Lal, Chetan Chauhan and Bishan Singh Bedi to name a few. The Railways and Services cricket teams in the Ranji Trophy also play their home matches in Delhi, in the Karnail Singh Stadium and the Harbax Singh Stadium respectively. The city is also home to the Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils, who play their home matches at the Kotla, and was the home to the Delhi Giants team (previously Delhi Jets) of the now defunct Indian Cricket League.
