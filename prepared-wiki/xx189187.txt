[[Succisa pratensis]]

CATEGORIES: Dipsacaceae

Succisa pratensis Moench, also known as Devil's-bit or Devil's-bit Scabious, is a flowering plant of the genus Succisa in the family Dipsacaceae.  It differs from other similar species in that it has 4-lobed flowers, whereas Small Scabious and Field scabious have 5 lobes and hence it has been placed in a separate genus in the same family.Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland by Rae Spencer Jones and Sarah Cuttle  It also grows on damper ground.The Illustrated Wild Flower Finder's Calendar
Its leaves are also un-lobed unlike Field scabious,Usborne Spotter's Handbook of Birds, Trees, Wildflowers and are arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves and plant can be confused with Greater Knapweed however Knapweed has leaves that are alternate, not opposite.
It prefers moist soilâ€”damp meadows and woods, lowland heath, marshy areas; but will tolerate drier conditions.  Male and female flowers are produced on different heads, the female being smaller.A photographic guide to Wildflowers of Britain and Europe by Paul Sterry and Bob Press Flowers from June until October.
It is a good source of nectar and is the foodplant of Marsh fritillary,  whose eggs are laid in groups on the underside of the plant, and Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth Hemaris tityus.  As both plant and invertebrates are rare, their survival relies on careful management of sites containing these species.
It is parasitized by the chytrid fungus Synchytrium succisae.  Karling, J.S. 1964. Synchytrium.Academic Press: New York. 

==Name==

Species of scabious were used to treat Scabies, and other afflictions of the skin including sores caused by the Bubonic Plague.Kingfisher Field Guides - Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe  The word scabies comes from the Latin word for "scratch" (scabere).  The short black root was in folk tales bitten off by the devil, angry at the plant's ability to cure these ailments,The I-Spy Guide to Wild Flowers by Michelin in anger against the Virgin Mary,Wild Flowers of Britain by Roger Phillips or as part of some 'devilish plot'.Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland by Marjorie Blamey, Richard Fitter, Alastair Fitter

==Management==

The aim is to produce an uneven patchwork of short and long vegetation by the end of the grazing period, between [tpl]convert|8|and|25|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].  This is to allow the Devil's Bit Scabious food plant to grow.
This can be achieved through low intensity grazing (also known as extensive grazing) using cattle.  Sheep are not so good as they are more efficient at removing wild plants.
