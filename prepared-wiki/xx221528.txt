[[Sea-pie]]

CATEGORIES: Quebec cuisine, Savoury pies

Sea-pie is essentially a layered meat pie made with meat or fish, and is known to have been served to British sailors during the 18th century. Its popularity was passed on to the New England colonies sufficiently to be included in American Cookery.
In Quebec this dish is called cipaille, cipâtes or six-pâtes (in French), and is a traditional Quebec dish. The French name originated as an adaptation of sea-pie.
