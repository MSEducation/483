==Playing career==

===Buffalo Sabres===

Biron started his hockey career on the Beauport Harfangs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).Biron made his NHL debut with the Buffalo Sabres on December 26, 1995.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/sports/hockey/after-dreadful-road-trip-rangers-place-a-veteran-goalie-on-waivers.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeff Z. | last=Klein | title=Rangers Put Backup Goaltender on Waivers | date=October 14, 2013[/tpl] After posting a 5.04 goals against average, with no wins and two losses during the 1995–96 season, he was sent back to the QMJHL to improve. After the 2000–01 season, he was a consistent goaltender for the Sabres as his play in the crease improved drastically.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Biron, along with Rob Ray and Dominik Hašek, was one of the three Sabres against whom, in three consecutive years, the NHL made a specific rule. After NHL statisticians discovered a bug in their new stat-tracking software, the "Biron rule" restricted jersey numbers to whole numbers between 1 and 99 (later limited to numbers between 1 and 98 after the league-wide retirement of number 99 for Wayne Gretzky). Biron was the only NHL player affected as only he wore "00" at the time. (Goaltender John Davidson also wore 00 during his playing career, without rebuke, at various points in his playing career between 1973 and 1983.) Upon his return to the NHL three seasons later, Biron switched to number 43, and wore that number until the end of his career.
Biron became the Sabres' starting goaltender after Hašek's departure from Buffalo in 2001 and held the position until the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Biron has always been a fan favorite in Buffalo and although he no longer plays there, he currently resides in the city during the offseason.Vogl, John (September 21, 2012).

===Philadelphia Flyers===

After losing the number one goaltending job to youngster Ryan Miller, Biron requested a trade from the Sabres on June 26, 2006, in an effort to receive more playing time. Finally, on February 27, 2007, the Sabres traded Biron to the Philadelphia Flyers for a second round draft pick.[tpl]cite news | title = Sabres deal Biron to Flyers, get Conklin | publisher = Canadian Press | date = 2007-02-27 | url = http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197883&hubname=nhl= | accessdate = 2007-02-28 [/tpl]
On March 27, 2007, Biron signed a two-year, $7 million contract extension with the Flyers to be the starting goalie in Philadelphia. After appearing in 62 games and recording 30 wins in the 2007–08 season, he led the Flyers to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in five games to the Eastern Conference champion Pittsburgh Penguins. He appeared in 55 games for the Flyers in the 2008-09 NHL Season, winning 29 and helping the Flyers to the 5th overall seed in the Eastern Conference.

===New York Islanders===

On July 1, 2009, Biron entered free agency. He was soon left in a difficult position after the Flyers signed goaltenders Ray Emery and Brian Boucher, while other teams quickly filled up their goaltending roster needs. Biron soon signed a one-year, $1.4 million contract with the New York Islanders on July 22, 2009,[tpl]cite news | title = Isles sign goalie Martin Biron to a one-year deal | publisher = National Hockey League | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=451178 | accessdate = 2009-07-22 [/tpl] joining goaltenders Dwayne Roloson and Rick DiPietro. In 29 appearances, Biron recorded 9 wins to go with 14 losses and 4 overtime losses, with a 3.27 goals against average and .896 save percentage. The Islanders did not qualify for the post-season.

===New York Rangers===

On July 1, 2010, Biron signed a two-year, $1.75 million deal with the New York Rangers, where he prepared to back up Swedish starter Henrik Lundqvist. Biron is one of four players in NHL history to skate for all three teams based in the state of New York. The others were Mike Donnelly and former teammates Jason Dawe and Pat LaFontaine, Biron will have played almost his entire career in the state of New York, except for a brief 2[tpl]fraction|1|2[/tpl]-year stint with the Philadelphia Flyers.
On February 28, 2011, Biron fractured his collarbone during practice, and was forced to miss the remainder of the 2010–2011 season. While Biron played the shortest number of games (17) since his second NHL season in 1998-99, he posted career highs in save percentage (.923) and goals against average (2.13).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/sports/hockey/01trades.html|title=At Deadline, Rangers Are Unable to Fill Sudden Need|author=Klein, Jeff Z.|date=February 28, 2011|publisher=NY Times online|accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]update after|2011|06|30[/tpl]
On June 29, 2012 Biron re-signed with the New York Rangers. The one-way contract is worth $2.6 million over two years, working out to an average of $1.3 million per year.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
