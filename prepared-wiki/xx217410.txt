The first Liga II season in history for the club meant a 13th place finish and a lot of hardship during the season, avoiding relegation very hard.
In July 2009, it was announced by the Buftea mayor that the team sold its Liga II place to Săgeata Stejaru for 500.000 €. They will play in the 2009-10 season in the Liga III, in Săgeata's place.http://www.liga2.ro/seria-1/fc-buftea-vinde-locul-din-liga-a-ii-a-4609665http://www.liga2.ro/seria-1/stejaru-ia-locul-celor-de-la-buftea-cum-comentezi-4610178
Buftea promoted back to the Liga II at the end of the 2011–12 season.
