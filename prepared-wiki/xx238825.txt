[[Ahklun Mountains]]

The Ahklun Mountains are located in the northeast section of the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge in southwest Alaska. They extend southwest from the Kanektok and Narogurum Rivers to Hagemeister Strait and Kuskokwim Bay[tpl]cite gnis|name=Ahklun Mountains|id=1397980[/tpl] and support the only existing glaciers in western Alaska. They are the highest Alaskan mountain range west of the Alaska Range and north of the Alaska Peninsula: some summits in the range are more than [tpl]convert|1500|m|ft|disp=flip[/tpl] high and have many glaciers. To the west is the Kuskokwim River and to the east are the Bristol Bay lowlands.
The Ahklun Mountains have many lakes, some more than [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|disp=flip[/tpl] deep. The mountains cover approximately 80 percent of the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge also contains tundra and coastal plains.

==Environment==

The Ahklun Mountains are dominated by alpine tundra, heath, and barrens, while moist sedge-tussock meadows occur in valley bottoms. Black spruce forest occurs on some hills and ridges. Forests of white spruce, paper birch, and alder cover the low hills along the major rivers.[tpl]USDA|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/land/pubs/ecoregions/ch6.html|article=Ahklun Mountains Tundra - Meadow (Ecoregions of the United States)|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] Blackpoll warblers are common breeders in conifer stands in river valleys. Beaver are abundant, supporting a large annual harvest. Sockeye salmon are the most abundant fish. Chum, king, silver salmon, and rainbow trout are also numerous. The average annual precipitation ranges from [tpl]convert|19|to|25|in|mm[/tpl], while the average annual temperature ranges from [tpl]convert|29|to|33|F|C[/tpl]. The growing season extends approximately from May 15 to September 10.

===Glaciers===

The glaciers were first mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, who used photogrammetry methods based on a
1972 series of aerial photos, revealing the presence of 116 glaciers. In 2006, of the original 109 that were resurveyed, the existence of 97 were verified and 12 were assessed having disappeared. This is a reduction of 11 percent. Of the remaining glaciers, many were much smaller than their size in 1972. This finding indicates that there has been a large decrease in the amount of land area covered by glacial ice in these mountains. The scientific community has long recognized the importance of glaciers as indicators of climatic change.
Geological evidence show that during the Pleistocene era there were repeated glaciations that have carved out a large number of valley troughs.  On the eastern side, these troughs contain networks of glacial lakes, some that are over [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|disp=flip[/tpl] deep and are dammed by terminal moraines. On the southern and western side, the valleys are broader and are interspersed with rolling uplands pierced  by rugged massifs.

===Lowlands===

In the lowlands,  areas not reached by the glaciation, the principal geographic features are the  moraines and  ridges formed by thrusting ice.
