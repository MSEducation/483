A memorial of significance to the nation's history is the Kaiserkreuz ("Emperor's Cross"). Here on 5 June 1400, Duke Friedrich of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel was murdered. The inscription on the cross itself, written in Gothic minuscule, has never been interpreted beyond doubt, despite many attempts over the ages.
A further cultural monument is the St. Michael Kirche (church) on Hundsburgstraße with its late Gothic wall paintings from the 15th to 16th century.
