Lincoln [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən[/tpl] is a cathedral city and county town of Lincolnshire, England. The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln has a 2011 population of 93,541.Office for National Statistics : Census 2011 : cited in James Wilkinson : City of Lincoln Council Lincoln Drivers Report Autumn 2012 Retrieved 21 November 2012 The 2011 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln (which includes North Hykeham and Waddington) a population of 119,200.KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas
Lincoln developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement.  Lincoln's major landmarks are Lincoln Cathedral, a fine example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University. Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff [tpl]convert|141|mi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] north of London, at an elevation of [tpl]convert|20.4|m|1|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level by the River Witham, stretching up to [tpl]convert|72.8|m|1|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral.

==History==

===Earliest history: Lincoln===

The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle).
The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon "The Pool",[tpl]cite book|first=Ranko|last= Matasović|title=Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YN_YPQAACAAJ|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2009|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-17336-1[/tpl] presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn "black pool"). It is not possible to know how big this original settlement was as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, as well as the modern Lincoln.

===Roman history: Lindum Colonia===

The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.[tpl]cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Lincoln|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Lincoln&allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=30 October 2011|location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA|year=2001–2011|quote=Lincoln: English city, county town of Lincolnshire, O.E. Lindcylene, from L. Lindum Colonia from a Latinised form of British *lindo "pool, lake" (corresponding to Welsh llyn). Originally a station for retired IX Legion veterans.[/tpl]
The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below.
It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham, and was even the provincial capital of Flavia Caesariensis when the province of Britannia Inferior was subdivided in the early 4th century, but then it and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629.

===AD 410–1066===

During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become 'Lincylene'.[tpl]cite web|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Parker MS: entry for 942|url=http://www8.georgetown.edu/departments/medieval/labyrinth/library/oe/texts/asc/a.html[/tpl]
After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.Finds suggest a 100-to-1 preponderance over nominal mints Caistor, Horncastle and Louth; a hoard recovered at Corringham, near Gainsborough, is composed mainly of coins minted at Lincoln and York (David Michael Metcalf, An Atlas of Anglo-Saxon and Norman Coin Finds, c.973-1086, 1998:198-200). After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system, ca 900.Richard Hall, Viking Age Archaeology (series Shire Archaeology) 2010:23.  Lincoln experienced an unprecedented explosion in its economy with the settlement of the Danes. Like York, the Upper City seems to have been given over to purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower City, running down the hill towards the River Witham, may have been largely deserted. By 950, however, the banks of the Witham were newly developed with the Lower City being resettled and the suburb of Wigford quickly emerging as a major trading centre. In 1068, two years after the Norman conquest, William I ordered Lincoln Castle to be built on the site of the former Roman settlement, for the same strategic reasons and controlling the same road.[tpl]cite PastScape|mnumber=326536|mname=Lincoln castle|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl]

===Cathedral===

Construction of the first Lincoln Cathedral, within its close or walled precinct facing the castle, began when the see was removed from the quiet backwater of Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire and completed in 1092;[tpl]cite book | last = Kendrick | first = A F | title = The Cathedral Church of Lincoln: a history and description of its fabric and a list of the Bishops | url =http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/PG/BellsLincoln/BellsLincoln.htm | accessdate = 10 April 2012 | date = Reprinted, with corrections, 1899, 1902 | origyear = 1898 | year = 1902 | publisher = George Bell & Sons | location  = London, United Kingdom | isbn = [/tpl] it was rebuilt after a fire but was destroyed by an unusual earthquake in 1185.

The bishops of Lincoln were among the magnates of medieval England: the diocese of Lincoln, the largest in England, had more monasteries than the rest of England put together, and the diocese was supported by large estates.
When Magna Carta was drawn up in 1215, one of the witnesses was Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln. One of only four surviving originals of the document is preserved in Lincoln Castle.
Among the most famous bishops of Lincoln were Robert Bloet, the magnificent justiciar to Henry I; Hugh of Avalon, the cathedral builder canonised as St Hugh of Lincoln; Robert Grosseteste, the 13th-century intellectual; Henry Beaufort, a politician deeply involved in the Wars of the Roses; Philip Repyngdon, chaplain to Henry IV of England and defender of Wycliffe; Thomas Wolsey.
The administrative centre was the Bishop's Palace, the third element in the central complex. When it was built in the late 12th century, the Bishop's Palace was one of the most important buildings in England. Built by the canonised bishop Hugh of Lincoln, the palace's East Hall range over a vaulted under-croft is the earliest surviving example of a roofed domestic hall. The chapel range and entrance tower were built by Bishop William of Alnwick, who modernised the palace in the 1430s. Both Henry VIII and James I were guests of bishops here; the palace was sacked by royalist troops during the Civil War in 1648.
Following a recent break-in, some of the stained glass windows of the cathedral have had to be replaced.

===Medieval town===

During the Anarchy, in 1141 Lincoln was the site of a battle between King Stephen and the forces of Empress Matilda, led by her illegitimate halfbrother Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. After fierce fighting in the city's streets, Stephen's forces were defeated. Stephen himself was captured and taken to Bristol.
By 1150, Lincoln was among the wealthiest towns in England. The basis of the economy was cloth and wool, exported to Flanders; Lincoln weavers had set up a guild in 1130 to produce Lincoln Cloth, especially the fine dyed 'scarlet' and 'green', the reputation of which was later enhanced by Robin Hood wearing woollens of Lincoln green. In the Guildhall that surmounts the city gate called the Stonebow, the ancient Council Chamber contains Lincoln's civic insignia, probably the finest collection of civic regalia.
Outside the precincts of cathedral and castle, the old quarter clustered around the Bailgate, and down Steep Hill to the High Bridge, which bears half-timbered housing, with the upper storeys jutting out over the river. There are three ancient churches: St Mary le Wigford and St Peter at Gowts are both 11th century in origin and St Mary Magdalene, built in the late 13th century, is an unusual English dedication to the saint whose cult was coming greatly into vogue on the European continent at that time.
Lincoln was home to one of the five most important Jewish communities in England, well established before it was officially noted in 1154. In 1190, anti-semitic riots that started in King's Lynn, Norfolk, spread to Lincoln; the Jewish community took refuge with royal officials, but their habitations were plundered. The so-called 'House of Aaron' has a two-storey street frontage that is essentially 12th century and a nearby Jew's House likewise bears witness to the Jewish population.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lincoln.gov.uk/visitor-and-leisure/heritage-and-tourism/local-heritage/jews-house-and-jews-court/110041.article | title = Jews House and Jews Court | accessdate = 11 June 2013 | publisher = City of Lincoln Council[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=326716|title=National Monument record[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first = Eric | last = Weil | title = Lincolnshire Jewish Community | date = September 2003 | publisher = BBC Lincolnshire | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/asop/people/jewish_community.shtml | work = BBC News | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl] In 1255, the affair called 'The Libel of Lincoln' in which prominent Jews of Lincoln, accused of the ritual murder of a Christian boy ('Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln' in medieval folklore) were sent to the Tower of London and 18 were executed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=16356805 |title=Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (1246–1255) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl] The Jews were expelled en masse in 1290.
During the 13th century, Lincoln was the third largest city in England and was a favourite of more than one king. During the First Barons' War, it became caught up in the strife between the king and the rebel barons, who had allied with the French. It was here and at Dover that the French and Rebel army was defeated. In the aftermath of the battle, the town was pillaged for having sided with Prince Louis.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/wendover.htm | title = The Battle of Lincoln (1217), according to Roger of Wendover | accessdate = 12 June 2013 | author1 = Roger of Wendover | author2 = translated by J.A. Giles | date = London 1849 | work = Flowers of History[/tpl]
However, during the 14th century, the city's fortunes began to decline. The lower city was prone to flooding, becoming increasingly isolated, and plagues were common. In 1409, the city was made a county corporate.

===16th century===

The Dissolution of the Monasteries exacerbated Lincoln's problems, cutting off its main source of diocesan income and drying up the network of patronage controlled by the bishop, with no fewer than seven monasteries closed down within the city alone. A number of nearby abbeys were also closed, which led to a further diminution of the region's political power. When the cathedral's great spire rotted and collapsed in 1549 and was not replaced, it was a significant symbol of Lincoln's economic and political decline. However, the comparative poverty of post-medieval Lincoln preserved pre-medieval structures that would probably have been lost in a more prosperous scenario.

===Civil War===

thumb|upright|The west front of Lincoln Cathedral viewed through the Exchequer Gate, one of a number of surviving gates in the Cathedral Close walls.Between 1642 and 1651, during the English Civil War, Lincoln was on the frontier between the Royalist and Parliamentary forces and changed hands several times.[tpl]Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=248[/tpl]. Many buildings were badly damaged. Lincoln now had no major industry and no easy access to the sea and was poorly situated. Thus while the rest of the country was beginning to prosper at the beginning of the 18th century, Lincoln suffered immensely, travellers often commenting on the state of what had essentially become a 'one street' town.

===Georgian Age===

By the Georgian era, Lincoln's fortunes began to pick up, thanks in part to the Agricultural Revolution. The re-opening of the Foss Dyke canal allowed coal and other raw materials vital to industry to be more easily brought into the city.
As well as the economic growth of Lincoln during this era, the city boundaries expanded to include the West Common. To this day, an annual Beat the Boundaries walk takes place along the perimeter of the common.

===Industrial Revolution===

Coupled with the arrival of the railway links, Lincoln boomed again during the Industrial Revolution, and several world-famous companies arose, such as Ruston's, Clayton's, Proctor's and William Foster's. Lincoln began to excel in heavy engineering, building locomotives, steam shovels and all manner of heavy machinery.

===20th century===

Lincoln was hit by a major typhoid epidemic between November 1904 and August 1905 caused by polluted drinking water from Hartsholme Lake and the River Witham.  Over 1,000 people contracted the disease and fatalities totalled 131,100-year-old promise kept following typhoid epidemic in Lincoln including the very man responsible for the city's water supply, Liam Kirk of Baker Crescent. Near the beginning of the epidemic, Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston installed a chlorine disinfection system just ahead of the poorly operating slow sand filter to kill the bacteria causing the epidemic.Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904–05." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905–06:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905–06. London:Local Government Board, 116.  Chlorination of the water supply continued until 1911 when a new water supply was implemented.Houston, Alexander C. (1921). "B. Welchii, Gastro-Enteritis and Water Supply." Engineering News-Record. 87:12, 484.  The Lincoln chlorination episode was one of the first uses of the chemical to disinfect a water supply.Baker, Moses N. (1981). The Quest for Pure Water: the History of Water Purification from the Earliest Records to the Twentieth Century. 2nd Edition. Vol. 1. Denver: American Water Works Association, 336.  Westgate Water Tower was constructed to provide new water supplies to the city.
In the world wars, Lincoln switched to war production. The first ever tanks were invented, designed and built in Lincoln by William Foster & Co. during the First World War and population growth provided more workers for even greater expansion. The tanks were tested on land now covered by Tritton Road (in the south-west suburbs of the city). During the Second World War, Lincoln produced a vast array of war goods, from tanks, aircraft, munitions and military vehicles.
Ruston & Hornsby produced diesel engines for ships and locomotives, then by teaming up with former colleagues of Frank Whittle and Power Jets Ltd, in the early 1950s, R & H (which became RGT) opened the first ever production line to build gas turbine engines for land-based and sea-based energy production. Hugely successful, it was the largest single employer in the city, providing over 5,000 jobs in its factory and research facilities, making it a rich takeover target for industrial conglomerates. It was taken over by English Electric in November 1966, who were then bought by GEC in 1968, with diesel engine production being transferred to the Ruston Diesels Division in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire of GEC at the former Vulcan Foundry, which was eventually bought by the German MAN Diesel (now MAN Diesel & Turbo) in June 2000.
It merged with Alstom of France in the late 1980s, then in 2003 was bought out by Siemens AG of Germany, now being called Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery. This also includes what is left of Napier Turbochargers. Plans were announced early in 2008 for the construction of a new plant just outside the city boundary at Teal Park, North Hykeham.Siemens Press Release 5 February 2008 Unfortunately Siemens made large scale redundancies and moved jobs to both Sweden and the Netherlands. The factory now employs 1300 people. R&H's former Beevor Foundry is now owned by Hoval Group who make industrial boilers (wood chip). The Aerospace Manufacturing Facility (AMF) at the Firth Road site was divested to ITP Engines UK, in January 2009 from Alstom Aerospace Ltd.AMF ITP[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]ITP UK
Lincoln's second largest private employer is James Dawson and Son, a belting and hose manufacturer founded in Lincoln in the late 19th century, which is located on the city's Tritton Road next to the University of Lincoln, it still operates using a coal-fired boiler. Dawson's became part of the Hull based Fenner group in the late 1970s.
In the post-war years after 1945, new suburbs were built, but heavy industry declined towards the end of the 20th century, mimicking the wider economic profile of the United Kingdom. More people are nevertheless still employed today in Lincoln building gas turbines than anything else.

==Economy==

Lincoln's economy is based mainly on public administration, commerce, arable farming and tourism, with industrial relics like Ruston (now Siemens) still in existence. However, many of Lincoln's industrial giants have long ceased production in the city, leaving large empty industrial warehouse-like buildings. More recently, these buildings have become multi-occupant units, with the likes of Lincs FM radio station (in the Titanic Works) and LA Fitness gym taking up space. The main employment sectors in Lincoln are; public administration, education and health, which accounts for 34% of the workforce. Distribution, restaurants and hotels account for 25% of the workforce.http://www.scribd.com/doc/157187867/Central-Lincolnshire-Local-Plan-Core-Strategy page 158
Like many other cities in Britain, Lincoln has developed a growing IT economy, with many e-commerce mail order companies setting up in or around the city. A plethora of other, more conventional small industrial businesses are located in and around Lincoln. One of the reasons for building the University of Lincoln was to increase inward investment and act as a springboard for small companies. The University's presence has also drawn many more licensed premises to the town centre around the Brayford Pool. A new small business unit next door to a university accommodation building, the Think Tank, opened in June 2009.Think Tank
The Extra motorway services company is based on Castle Hill, with most new UK service areas being built by Swayfields who are the parent company. There are two main electronics companies in the town: Chelmsford-based e2V (formerly Associated Electrical Industries before 1961) is situated between Carholme Road (A57) and the Foss Dyke next-door to Carholme Golf Club;Carholme Golf Club and Dynex Semiconductor (formerly Marconi Electronic Devices) is on Doddington Road (B1190) near the A46 bypass just inside the borough boundary, and near North Hykeham. Bifrangi, an Italian company, makes crankshafts for off-road vehicles (tractors), using a screw press; it is based at the former Tower Works formerly owned by Smith-Clayton Forge.
Lincoln is also the functional hub of a wider area that encompasses several satellite settlements such as Welton, Saxilby, Skellingthorpe and Washingborough. These villages look to Lincoln for most of their service and employment needs, and effectively boost its population to around 165,000.http://www.scribd.com/doc/157187867/Central-Lincolnshire-Local-Plan-Core-Strategy Due to its size and central location, Lincoln is the main centre for jobs and facilities in Central Lincolnshire, and performs a wider regional role that extends to cover much of Lincolnshire and parts of Nottinghamshire.

===Retail parks===

Around the Tritton Road (B1003) trading estate, many new businesses have begun trading from large units with car parking. Lincoln has a choice of five large national supermarkets. The St Mark's Square complex has Debenhams as its flagship store and has an accompanying trading estate with well-known chain stores such as BHS.
Another development is also expected to be completed by 2015 called Lindongate which includes plans for a new department store, shops, hotel, flats and new transport facilities. The viability of proposed developments such as this may, however, now be called into question by the sudden economic downturn starting late in 2007. The scheme depends on a continuing demand for retail space, and a continuation of a strong housing market, but by mid-2008 both of these factors had become conspicuously absent.

===Tourism===

The city is a tourist centre and those who come do so to visit the numerous historic buildings including the cathedral, the castle, and the Medieval Bishop's Palace.
The Collection, of which the Usher Gallery is now a part, is an important attraction. Housed partly in a recently opened, purpose-built venue, it currently contains over 2,000,000 objects, and was one of the four finalists for the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize. Any material from official archaeological excavations in Lincolnshire is eventually deposited at in The Collection so it is growing all the time.
Other attractions include the Museum of Lincolnshire Life and the Sir Joseph Banks Conservatory at the Lawn, adjacent to Lincoln Castle. Tranquil destinations close by include Whisby Nature Reserve and Hartsholme Country Park (including the Swanholme Lakes Local Nature Reserve), while noisier entertainment can be found at Waddington airfield, Scampton airfield (base of the RAF's Red Arrows jet aerobatic team), the County Showground or the Cadwell Park motor racing circuit near Louth.
Because of its climate, Lincoln attracts many of its tourists in summer, but also on the first Thursday of December until the following Sunday when the Bailgate area of the city holds its annual Christmas Market in and around the Castle grounds. The market is based upon the traditional German-style Christmas market as found in several German cities, including Lincoln's 'twin town' Neustadt an der Weinstrasse.  In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Christmas Market, the event was cancelled due to 'atrocious conditions' of heavy snowfall across Lincolnshire and most of the United Kingdom.[ref]

==Topography: 'uphill' and 'downhill'==

Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff (a major escarpment that runs north-south through Lindsey and Kesteven, in central Lincolnshire and rising to [tpl]convert|200|ft|0|abbr=off[/tpl] in height).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/jca45+47_tcm6-5658.pdf|title=Northern Lincolnshire Edge with Coversands and Southern Lincolnshire Edge |publisher=Natural England|accessdate=8 April 2013 [/tpl] The River Witham flows through this gap. Lincoln is thus divided informally into two zones, known locally as 'uphill' and 'downhill', with uphill at [tpl]convert|72.8|m|1|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level in the area near Lincoln Cathedral, and downhill at a height of [tpl]convert|20.4|m|1|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level by the River Witham.
The uphill area comprises the northern part of the city, on top of the Lincoln Cliff (to the north of the gap). This area includes the historical quarter, including Lincoln Cathedral, Lincoln Castle and the Medieval Bishop's Palace, known locally as 'the Bail' (although described in tourist promotional literature as 'the Cathedral Quarter').[tpl]cite book|first1=Robert |last1=Beachy|first2=Ralf |last2=Roth|title=Who Ran the Cities?: City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750–1940|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UQzGUZasbQkC&pg=PA74|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5153-6|pages=74–78[/tpl] It also includes residential suburbs to the north and northeast. The downhill area comprises the city centre (located in the gap) and the suburbs to the south and south-west. The aptly named street 'Steep Hill' connects the two (although it is too steep for vehicular traffic, which must take a more roundabout route).
This divide marks out Lincoln from other historic cities in England and elsewhere in Europe. Whereas in most such cities, the chief historical buildings (cathedrals and castles) tend to be centrally located and intermingled with the present-day city centre, in Lincoln they are separate.
The divide was also once an important class distinction, with 'uphill' more affluent and 'downhill' less so. This distinction dates from the time of the Norman conquest, when the religious and military elite occupied the hilltop. The construction and expansion of suburbs in both parts of the city since the mid-19th century has diluted this distinction, nevertheless 'uphill' residential property continues to fetch a premium, and is almost invariably referred to as such in literature emanating from local estate agents.

==Climate==

Like the rest of the British Isles, Lincoln has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Waddington, about [tpl]convert|4|mi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] to the south of the city centre. Temperature extremes since 1948 have ranged from as high as [tpl]convert|34.8|C|F[/tpl] in August 1990,[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=351 | title = 1990 temperature | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl] to as low as [tpl]convert|-15.6|C|F[/tpl] in February 1956.[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=8&year=1956&indexid=TNn&stationid=351 | title = 1956 temperature | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl] A now closed weather station still holds the record for the lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded in England in the month of December: [tpl]convert|-9.0|C|F[/tpl] on 17 December 1981.[tpl]cite web | publisher = UKMO | url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/extremes/monthly_temperature_country.html | title = 1981 temperature | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl] The coldest temperature reported in recent years was [tpl]convert|-10.4|C|F[/tpl] during December 2010,[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=18&year=2010&indexid=TNn&stationid=351 | title = 2010 temperature | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl] although another weather station, at Scampton, a similar distance north of the city centre, fell to [tpl]convert|-15.6|C|F[/tpl], thus equalling Waddington's record low set in 1956.[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SCAMPTON_RAF/07-12-2010/33730.htm | title = 2010 Scampton temperature[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Rail===

Lincoln Central railway station has five platforms and a steady flow of trains and passengers. Trains run to various destinations including Newark-on-Trent, Grimsby and Peterborough. In May 2010, East Coast began a new direct train service to London, calling at Newark, Peterborough and Stevenage. One service in each direction operates daily, but there is only a northbound journey on Sundays.TRAIN trips direct from Lincoln to London

===Road===

The £19-million A46 bypass was opened in December 1985. The B1190 is an east-west road through Lincoln, starting from the Nottinghamshire-Lincolnshire boundary on the (Roman) Foss Dyke and A57 and finishing in the east at Thimbleby on the A158 near Horncastle. It originally terminated at the Canwick Road junction, then was extended to the west.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
For many years[tpl]when|date=November 2011[/tpl] the two main roads through Lincoln were the A46 and A15; there were no other main roads, and they both passed along the High Street. At the intersection of Guildhall Street and the High Street, these two roads met the A57, where it terminated.

==Education==

===Higher education===

Lincoln has two higher education institutions, the older being Bishop Grosseteste University, which started life as a teacher training college linked to the Anglican Church in 1862. During the 1990s, the college branched out into new subject areas with a focus on the arts and drama. Bishop Grosseteste College, as it was, became a University College in 2006 when it was awarded taught degree powers, so that students graduate with degrees from BGUC and not the University of Leicester as previously. The college became a university in 2012. A graduation celebration takes place every year in Lincoln Cathedral. Bishop Grosseteste University has no links with the University of Lincoln.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
