It consisted of a majority of volunteers from Norway, and some enlisted German soldiers. Of the officers and non-commissioned officers, most were Norwegian.Halle, Frode 1972: Fra Finland til Kaukasus. Nordmenn på østfronten 1941–1945. Litt av deres historie—fortalt av dem selv.

It was formed in February 1942, after it was decided to create a SS Ski company with Norwegian volunteers—attached to the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord (although the company was formally a police unit). By the winter of 1943 and the newly constructed company was designated as a combat battalion, with three full infantry companies and a staff company. For almost its entire career, the battalion was part of the 6th SS Mountain Division "Nord", fighting on the Karelian Front in Finland.

==Background==

The initiative for the establishment of the unit came from a Waffen-SS volunteer named Gust Jonassen, (a Dane who had married a Norwegian and assumed Norwegian citizenship). He had passed the idea of constructing a Norwegian ski unit on to other Waffen-SS officers and the notion swiftly went up the command ladder to the SS Main Administrative Office which approved of the endeavor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Training===

During the winter of 1942, a Ski jäger Company, with a strength of 120 men, was formed in Finland. The first recruits were chosen for their skiing abilities, and few had had any extensive military training. Those who had attended Norwegian Army NCO schools were selected as candidates for troop leader positions. In September 1942 the embryonic company was sent to the Waffen-SS Germanic Volunteer Camp in Sennheim, Alsace for basic military training.
At the same time, those chosen for command positions were shipped off to NCO schools or the SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz in Bavaria for officers' training. At Sennheim the Norwegian enlisted men were put in the care of a Finnish SS- Hauptsturmführer who oversaw their program of instruction. Infantry training continued until about Christmas, when it was decided that the formation of the actual Ski battalion could now commence.
The formation of the new Norwegian SS Skijaeger Battalion (which was also given the title "Norge" and a sleeve title bearing that name), took place at military training grounds in Oulu, Finland (also known by its Swedish name of Uleåborg) in the autumn of 1943. The following Norwegian Untersturmführer(s) (Ustuf. - 2nd Lt.) were assigned to command companies in the battalion: Martin Skjefstad, Tor Holmesland Vik and Rolf Uglestad. The battalion CO and a four company commander were both Germans. A few German enlisted men were also included in each company as a "stiffening" element. For the most part the Norwegian officers were young men who had obtained front line experience with the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking or the "Frw. Legion Norwegen" before going on to the SS-JS "Tölz."
The Norwegian Ski Battalion was strictly light-weight in nature consisting only of one staff company and three ski (or infantry/assault) companies. Unlike the other battalions normally found in a German mountain division there was no 4th Heavy Weapons Company assigned. Each of the Norwegian ski companies contained the following sub-units: three platoons consisting of 3 squads each along with 1 machine-gun troop and 1 mortar section. The staff company contained the administrative personnel, a weapons and clothing dispersal office, an engineer platoon, a signals platoon (communications), a medical section and truck and horse supply columns.

===The Karelian Front===

In 1943 the Ski Company(Skikompaniet—the predecessor of the "Ski Battalion") was sent to the Kiestinki Front.[tpl]cite web|title=En annen deltaker forteller (Kjelstrup)|trans_title=Another participant recounts (Kjelstrup): lecture by Sverre Kjelstrup |url=http://nordiki.no/kaprolat.htm|publisher=Nordiki|date=1992-05-25|author=Sverre Kjelstrup |page=2|quote=Så kommer vi frem til året 1943 da Skikompaniet ble sendt bort til Kiestinkifronten.[/tpl]

During the winter '43 / '44 the battalion counted around 700 men - many former soldiers from the Norwegian Legion. By January 1944 the battalion and was sent to the front. Another Norwegian Unit, The 2nd police company was also serving at the front at this time and was in severe skirmishes with the Russians, before they returned to Norway in May 1944.
The battalion was placed in position in the northern flank of the "Nord" Division, which was about 30 kilo meters north of the division HQ. The battalion had the job of patrolling the division's left wing up to Tiksje Lake. This part of the Eastern Front had long since lapsed into static warfare apd the idea was to prevent Soviet infiltration through no-man's-land.
Battalion soldier Sverre Kjelstrup has described battle at Mayweg (outside Kiestinki) and patterns of warfare by local Soviet forces: "The Norwegians the Battalion and other units lost 4 men, and 92 dead Russians were counted in front of the fortifications—these are conditions that we witnessed many times ... that they kept heaping (on with more) people. And the ones charging first knew that if they tried to turn around and flee, they would be shot by the politruks who were in tow. And these are reasons for the size of losses that the Russians had on several occasions."[tpl]cite web|title=En annen deltaker forteller (Kjelstrup)|trans_title=Another participant recounts (Kjelstrup): lecture by Sverre Kjelstrup |url=http://nordiki.no/kaprolat.htm|publisher=Nordiki|date=1992-05-25|author=Sverre Kjelstrup |page=3|quote=...

Og de som gikk forrest viste at om de prøvde å snu om og flykte så gikk politrukene bak og skøyt dem. Og dette er årsakene til de tapenen som russerne ved flere anledninger hadde.[/tpl]

The battalion had fortified positions: the Hasselmann Position related to Peak 331 (as designated by German military—which rose from the north shore of Lake Kapanets(копанецMap including Lake Kapanets (копанец)); and Stützpunkt Kaprolat—related to Peak 328, around one kilometer north of the other peak—and separated by a lake that the battalion called Støvlevann ("boot lake").
