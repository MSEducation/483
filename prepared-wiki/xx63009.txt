===Talk shows===

In 1986, the Fox network introduced The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, created to directly challenge The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After a moderate start, ratings for the show sagged. Behind-the-scenes relations between Rivers and network executives at Fox quickly eroded, and Rivers left in 1987.[tpl]cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title=Joan Rivers: 'I'm the funniest person performing stand-up today'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/joan-rivers-im-the-funniest-person-performing-standup-today-2111966.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=October 23, 2010[/tpl] The series was subsequently renamed The Late Show, and featured several hosts, including Ross Shafer, Suzanne Somers, Richard Belzer and Robert Townsend before it was cancelled in 1988.[tpl]IMDb title|199237|The Late Show[/tpl] Hall was also chosen to host the show in the fall of 1987, and his stint proved to be immensely popular, developing a cult following which eventually led to Hall landing his own show in syndication.[tpl]cite news|last=Njeri|first=Itabari|title=Fresh Talk: 'We Be Havin' a Ball,' Says Arsenio Hall. But Can the Talk-Show Host's Hip New Style Succeed on Late-Night TV?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-16/magazine/tm-2132_1_arsenio-hall-cher-tonight-show|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 16, 1989[/tpl]
From January 2, 1989 until May 27, 1994, he had a Paramount contract to host a nationwide syndicated late night talk show, The Arsenio Hall Show. The show became a breakout, late-night success, especially rating high among the coveted younger demographic and known for its audience's distinctive alternative to applause: chanting "Roo, Roo, Roo!," while pumping their fists. The practice soon became such a ritual that by 1991 had become a "pop culture stamp of approval" — one that Hall said had become "so popular it's getting on people's nerves."[tpl]cite web| title= Crank It Up! | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-04-03/lifestyle/9104020300_1_woof-woof-woof-arsenio-hall-crank | work=Los Angeles Daily News | author=Diana E. Lundin | publisher=Orlando Sentinel | date= April 3, 1991| accessdate=January 26, 2010[/tpl] The gesture made it into films of the time: the title character played by Julia Roberts did it in a polo scene in Pretty Woman (1990), and characters played by Penny Marshall and Michael J. Fox did it in  The Hard Way. In Disney's Aladdin (1992), the Genie character voiced by Robin Williams performs the gesture while mimicking the physical appearance of Hall. This popular gesture can also be found in the 1993 Mel Brooks' comedy, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. It was also seen in the movie Passenger 57, in which an old woman confuses the character played by Wesley Snipes with Arsenio Hall. After saving the day, the passengers on the hijacked plane do the gesture toward the protagonist.
He also had a rivalry with Jay Leno, after the latter was named host of The Tonight Show, during which time Hall said that he would "kick Jay's ass" in ratings.[tpl]cite news | title=Celebrity Quotes | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296183,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly | date=February 24, 1995 | accessdate=July 17, 2008[/tpl]
Hall used his fame during this period to help fight worldwide prejudice against HIV/AIDS, after Magic Johnson contracted the disease. Hall and Johnson filmed a PSA about the disease that aired in the early 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-04-19/news/9204190407_1_magic-johnson-hiv-aids|title=Magic Johnson, Arsenio Team Up For Aids Video|date=April 19, 1992|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=January 4, 2011[/tpl]
