The 1987–88 Serie A season marked A.C. Milan's first Scudetto under the Silvio Berlusconi era and their first since the 1978/1979 season.  S.S.C. Napoli, with a team including Diego Maradona, Ciro Ferrara and Careca were pre-season favourites.  The championship went down to the last day of the season, with Milan pipping Napoli by only 3 points.
A.C. Milan's Scudetto started a remarkable run of trophies which culminated in the winning of 2 European Cups in a row in 1988/1989 and 1989/1990.  The 1987/1988 was also the last season comprising 16 teams with the 1988/1989 season comprising 18 teams, the expansion meaning that two teams were relegated to Serie B, with four gaining promotion to Serie A.
