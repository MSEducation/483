</ref> Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common with many treatments and some forms of cancer. Since the 1990s, several novel classes of [[antiemetics]] have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients. Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance by the patient, and due to better overall health of the patient.

===Hair loss===

Hair loss (Alopecia) can be caused by chemotherapy that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment, and sometimes can change colour, texture, thickness and style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in "chemo curls." Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and etoposide. Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.
Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifests as alopecia totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often alopecia areata.[tpl]cite pmid|17642856[/tpl] It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,[tpl]cite pmid|23187775[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|9589208[/tpl] although permanent cases can occur.[tpl]cite pmid|20487675[/tpl] Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.[tpl]cite pmid|22901547[/tpl]
Scalp cooling offers a means of preventing both permanent and temporary hair loss, however concerns for this method have been raised.[tpl]cite journal |author=Trüeb RM |title=Chemotherapy-induced alopecia |journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=11–4 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19341937 |doi=10.1016/j.sder.2008.12.001 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Chon SY, Champion RW, Geddes ER, Rashid RM |title=Chemotherapy-induced alopecia |journal=J.

===Secondary neoplasm===

Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment can occur. The most common secondary neoplasm is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors.U. Rüther, C. Nunnensiek, H.-J. Schmoll,Secondary Neoplasias following Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Immunosuppression,Contributions to Oncology (Beiträge zur Onkologie); Vol 55, 2000, ISBN 3-8055-7116-X Survivors of childhood cancer are more than 13 times as likely to get a secondary neoplasm during the 30 years after treatment than the general population.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.11.1207 | last1 = Hijiya | first1 = N | last2 = Hudson | first2 = MM | last3 = Lensing | first3 = S |year = 2007 | last4 = Zacher | first4 = M | last5 = Onciu | first5 = M | last6 = Behm | first6 = FG | last7 = Razzouk |first7 = BI | last8 = Ribeiro | first8 = RC | last9 = Rubnitz | first9 = JE | title = Cumulative Incidence of Secondary Neoplasms as a First Event After Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 11| pages = 1207–1215 | pmid = 17374815 | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | last10 = Sandlund | first10 = JT | last11 = Rivera | first11 = GK | last12 = Evans | first12 = WE | last13 = Relling | first13 = MV | last14 = Pui | first14 = CH [/tpl] Not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy.

===Infertility===

Some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol|volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958[/tpl] Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.
Female infertility by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to premature ovarian failure by loss of primordial follicles.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms022[/tpl] This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.
Patients may choose between several methods of fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy, including cryopreservation of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A |title=Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment|journal=Placenta |volume=29 Suppl B |issue= |pages=152–9 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18790328|doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 |url=[/tpl] As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients. A study in France between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34% of cases, and a live birth in 27% of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant, with the follow-up time varying between 1 and 13 years.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humrep/det268[/tpl]
In chemotherapy as a conditioning regimen in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a study of patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone for severe aplastic anemia came to the result that ovarian recovery occurred in all women younger than 26 years at time of transplantation, but only in five of 16 women older than 26 years.[ref]André Tichelli, Alicia Rovó. Fertility Issues Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. Expert Rev Hematol. 2013;6(4):375-388.

===Teratogenicity===

Chemotherapy is potentially teratogenic during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, to the extent that abortion usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/humupd/7.4.394[/tpl] http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various complications of pregnancy and fetal myelosuppression.
In males previously having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy. The use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk. In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions. However, when in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservationis practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.

===Peripheral neuropathy===

Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a progressive, enduring, and often irreversible condition, causing pain, tingling, numbness and sensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs.[tpl]vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6[/tpl] Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, epothilones, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, proteasome inhibitors, and the platinum-based drugs.[tpl]vcite journal|url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf|author=Grisold W, Oberndorfer S, Windebank AJ|journal=European Association of Neurooncology Magazine|title=Chemotherapy and polyneuropathies|year=2012|volume=12|issue=1[/tpl]http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory, in some cases motor nerves and the autonomic nervous system are affected.[tpl]vcite journal | author = Beijers AJM, Jongen, JLM & Vreugdenhil1 G | date = January 2012 | journal = The Netherlands journal of medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 1 |pmid = 22271810 | url = http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794[/tpl] CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment.[tpl]vcite journal | author = Windebank AJ & Grisold W | title = Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | journal =  Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System | date = 2008 Mar | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–46 | pmid = 18346229[/tpl] Some CIPN appears to be irreversible. Pain can often be managed with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.[tpl]vcite journal | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| title = Chemotherapy-induced pain puzzles scientists | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | author = Savage L | date = 2007 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/14/1070.long | pages = 1070–1071[/tpl]

===Cognitive impairment===

Some patients report fatigue or non-specific neurocognitive problems, such as an inability to concentrate; this is sometimes called post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment, referred to as "chemo brain" by patients' groups.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS|title=Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop |journal=J. Clin. Oncol.|volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=2233–9 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15169812 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.08.094|url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15169812[/tpl]

===Tumor lysis syndrome===

In particularly large tumors and cancers with high white cell counts, such as lymphomas, teratomas, and some leukemias, some patients develop tumor lysis syndrome. The rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes the release of chemicals from the inside of the cells. Following this, high levels of uric acid, potassium, phosphate and calcium are found in the blood. This causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause cardiac arrhythmia. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.Wood, p. 202

===Organ damage===

Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is especially prominent with the use of anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and liposomal doxorubicin). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and clofarabine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shaikh AY, Shih JA |title=Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity |journal=Curr Heart Fail Rep |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=117–27 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22382639 |doi=10.1007/s11897-012-0083-y |url=[/tpl]
Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) can be caused by many cytotoxic drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, viral hepatitis, immunosuppression and nutritional deficiency. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, hepatic sinusoidal syndrome (obstruction of the veins in the liver), cholestasis (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and liver fibrosis.[tpl]cite journal|last=A.V.

Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) can be caused by tumor lysis syndrome and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys. Different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be asymptomatic (only seen on blood or urine tests) or may cause acute renal failure.[tpl]cite journal |author=de Jonge MJ, Verweij J |title=Renal toxicities of chemotherapy |journal=Semin.

===Other side-effects===

Less common side-effects include red skin (erythema), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth (xerostomia), water retention, and sexual impotence. Some medications can trigger allergic or pseudoallergic reactions.
Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including cardiovascular disease(e.g., doxorubicin), interstitial lung disease (e.g., bleomycin) and occasionally secondary neoplasm (e.g., MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

==Limitations==

Chemotherapy does not always work, and even when it is useful, it may not completely destroy the cancer. Patients frequently fail to understand its limitations. In one study of patients who had been newly diagnosed with incurable, stage 4 cancer, more than two-thirds of patients with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of patients with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Weeks JC, Catalano PJ, Cronin A, et al. |title=Patients' expectations about effects of chemotherapy for advanced cancer|journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=367 |issue=17 |pages=1616–25 |date=October 2012 |pmid=23094723|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1204410 |url= |pmc=3613151[/tpl]
The blood brain barrier poses a difficult obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the brain. This is because the brain has an extensive system in place to protect it from harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small lipophilic alkylating agents such as lomustine or temozolomide are able to cross this blood brain barrier.[tpl]cite journal |author=Deeken JF, Löscher W |title=The blood-brain barrier and cancer: transporters, treatment, and Trojan horses |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1663–74 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17363519 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2854 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Agarwala SS, Kirkwood JM |title=Temozolomide, a novel alkylating agent with activity in the central nervous system, may improve the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma |journal=Oncologist |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=144–51 |year=2000 |pmid=10794805 |doi= 10.1634/theoncologist.5-2-144|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gerstner ER, Fine RL |title=Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier to chemotherapy in metastatic brain tumors: establishing a treatment paradigm |journal=J.

Blood vessels in tumors are very different from those seen in normal tissues. As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen (hypoxic). To counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the circulatory system.[tpl]cite journal |author=Minchinton AI, Tannock IF |title=Drug penetration in solid tumours |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=583–92 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16862189 |doi=10.1038/nrc1893 |url=[/tpl]

==Efficacy==

The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. The overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias,[tpl]cite journal|last=Nastoupil|first=LJ|coauthors=Rose, AC; Flowers, CR|title=Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: current treatment approaches|journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)|date=May 2012 |volume=26|issue=5|pages=488–95|pmid=22730604[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Freedman |first=A |title=Follicular lymphoma: 2012 update on diagnosis and management |journal=American journal of hematology|date=October 2012 |volume=87 |issue=10 |pages=988–95 |pmid=23001911 |doi=10.1002/ajh.23313[/tpl] to being ineffective, such as in some brain tumors,[tpl]cite journal |last=Rampling |first=R |coauthors=James, A; Papanastassiou, V |title=The present and future management of malignant brain tumours: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy |journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry |date=June 2004 |volume=75 Suppl 2 |pages=ii24–30 |pmid=15146036 |pmc=1765659 |issue=Suppl 2 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.040535[/tpl] to being needless in others, like most non-melanoma skin cancers.[tpl]cite journal |last=Madan |first=V |coauthors=Lear, JT; Szeimies, RM |title=Non-melanoma skin cancer |journal=Lancet |date=February 20, 2010 |volume=375 |issue=9715 |pages=673–85 |pmid=20171403 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61196-X[/tpl]
Even when it is impossible for chemotherapy to provide a permanent cure, chemotherapy may be useful to reduce symptoms like pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will be possible in the future.

==Resistance==

Resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult.[tpl]cite journal |author=Goldman B |title=Multidrug resistance: can new drugs help chemotherapy score against cancer? |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=255–7 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12591977 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/95.4.255|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=E. Crowley, CA. McDevitt, R. Callaghan|title=Multidrug Resistance in Cancer. Generating Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein: Where to, Now?|year=2009|publisher=Springer Protocols|pages=405–432[/tpl] Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Luqmani YA |title=Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy |journal=Med Princ Pract |volume=14 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=35–48 |year=2005 |pmid=16103712 |doi=10.1159/000086183 |url=[/tpl]

==Cytotoxics and targeted therapies==

Targeted therapies are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome, a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gerber DE |title=Targeted therapies: a new generation of cancer treatments |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=311–9 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18297955 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Allen TM |title=Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=2 |issue=10|pages=750–63 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12360278 |doi=10.1038/nrc903 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Chen HX, Cleck JN |title=Adverse effects of anticancer agents that target the VEGF pathway |journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology |volume=6|issue=8 |pages=465–77 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19581909 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2009.94 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Zhang J, Yang PL, Gray NS |title=Targeting cancer with small molecule kinase inhibitors |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19104514 |doi=10.1038/nrc2559 |url=[/tpl]

==Newer and experimental approaches==

===Targeted therapies===

Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells. This should result in an increased tumor kill and/or reduced toxicity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chidambaram M, Manavalan R, Kathiresan K |title=Nanotherapeutics to overcome conventional cancer chemotherapy limitations |journal=J Pharm Pharm Sci |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=67–77|year=2011 |pmid=21501554 |doi= |url=[/tpl]

====Antibody-drug conjugates====

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) comprise an antibody, drug and a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a tumor antigen) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel endothelial cells. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Teicher BA, Chari RV |title=Antibody conjugate therapeutics: challenges and potential |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=17 |issue=20 |pages=6389–97 |date=October 2011 |pmid=22003066 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1417 |url=[/tpl] Reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The first approved drug of this type was gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), released by Wyeth (now Pfizer). The drug was approved to treat acute myeloid leukemia, but has now been withdrawn from the market because the drug did not meet efficacy targets in further clinical trials.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sievers EL, Linenberger M |title=Mylotarg: antibody-targeted chemotherapy comes of age |journal=Current Opinion in Oncology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=522–7 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11673694 |doi= 10.1097/00001622-200111000-00016|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=FDA|title=Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): Market Withdrawal|url=http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts/ucm216458.htm|accessdate=18 August 2013[/tpl] Two other drugs, trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin, are both in late clinical trials, and the latter has been granted accelerated approval for the treatment of refractory Hodgkins lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

====Nanoparticles====

Nanoparticles are 1-1000 nanometer (nm) sized particles that can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low-solubility drugs. Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits the difference between tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are "leaky" because they have gaps from 200-2000 nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules (antibodies, proteins, DNA and receptor ligands) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells. There are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems, such as silica, polymers, liposomes and magnetic particles. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field.  They have emerged as a useful vehicle for poorly soluble agents such as paclitaxel.[tpl]cite journal|author=Vines T, Faunce T |title=Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs |journal=J Law Med|volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=822–45 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19554862 |doi= |url=[/tpl]

===Electrochemotherapy===

Electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.
Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heller R, Gilbert R, Jaroszeski MJ. |title= Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy |journal=Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2 |pmid=10837693 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Larkin JO, Collins CG, Aarons S, Tangney M, Whelan M, O’Reily S, Breathnach O, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC |title=Electrochemotherapy - Aspects of preclinical development and early clinical experience |journal=Ann Surg |volume=245 |issue=3 |pages=469–479 |year=2007 |pmid=17435555|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000250419.36053.33 |pmc=1877027[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O’Sullivan GC, Mir LM |title=Electrochemotherapy - An easy, highly effective and safe treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases |pages=3–13 |journal=Eur J Cancer Suppl |volume=4 |issue=11 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Sersa G, Miklavcic D, Cemazar M, Rudolf Z, Pucihar G, Snoj M. |title=Electrochemotherapy in treatment of tumours |journal=Eur J Surg Oncol |volume=34 |issue=2|pages=232–240 |year=2008 |pmid=17614247 |doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2007.05.016 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Möller MG, Salwa S, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC. |title=Electrochemotherapy as an adjunct or alternative to other treatments for unresectable or in-transit melanoma |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue= 11 |pages=1611–1630|year=2009 |doi=10.1586/era.09.129 |pmid=19895245 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Testori A, Tosti G, Martinoli C, Spadola G, Cataldo F, Verrecchia F, Baldini F, Mosconi M, Soteldo J, Tedeschi I, Passoni C, Pari C, Di Pietro A, Ferrucci PF |title=Electrochemotherapy for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor lesions: a novel therapeutic approach|journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=651–661 |year=2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01370.x|pmid=21054709 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Hampton T |title=Electric Pulses Help With Chemotherapy, May Open New Paths for Other Agents |journal=JAMA |volume=305 |issue=6 |pages=549–551 |year=2011 |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.92|pmid= 21304073 [/tpl] The method has been reported as safe, simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy.

===Hyperthermia therapy===

Hyperthermia therapy is heat treatment for cancer that can be a powerful tool when used in combination with chemotherapy (thermochemotherapy) or radiation for the control of a variety of cancers.  The heat can be applied locally to the tumor site, which will dilate blood vessels to the tumor, allowing more chemotherapeutic medication to enter the tumor.  Additionally, the bi-lipid layer of the tumor cell membrane will become more porous, further allowing more of the chemotherapeutic medicine to enter the tumor cell.
Hyperthermia has also been shown to help prevent or reverse "chemo-resistance."  Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops overtime as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication. “Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. mitomycin C, anthracyclines, BCNU, melphalan) including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.[tpl]cite journal|last=Issels|first=R.|title=Hyperthermia Combined with Chemotherapy – Biological Rationale, Clinical Application, and Treatment Results|journal=Onkologie|year=1999|volume=22|issue=5|pages=374–381|doi=10.1159/000026986[/tpl]

==Other uses==

Some chemotherapy drugs are used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders. They are often used at lower doses, which means that the side effects are minimized.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ben-Ari ET |title=Dual purpose: some cancer therapies used to treat autoimmune diseases |journal=J.

The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gray O, McDonnell GV, Forbes RB |title=Methotrexate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003208 |year=2004 |pmid=15106195 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003208.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Gray |editor1-first=Orla[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gray OM, McDonnell GV, Forbes RB |title=A systematic review of oral methotrexate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Mult.

Chemotherapy drugs are also used in conditioning regimens prior to bone marow transplant (hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system in order to allow a transplant to engraft. Cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner, and is often used in conjunction with total body irradiation. Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (myeloablative conditioning) or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning).[tpl]cite journal |last=Bacigalupo |first=A |coauthors=Ballen, K; Rizzo, D; Giralt, S; Lazarus, H; Ho, V; Apperley, J; Slavin, S; Pasquini, M; Sandmaier, BM; Barrett, J; Blaise, D; Lowski, R; Horowitz, M |title=Defining the intensity of conditioning regimens: working definitions |journal=Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation |date=December 2009 |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1628–33 |pmid=19896087 |doi=10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.07.004 |pmc=2861656[/tpl]

==Occupational precautions==

Healthcare workers exposed to anti-neoplastic agents take precautions to keep their exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] since pharmacists that prepare these drugs or nurses that may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs during the course of their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/antineoplastic/|title=NIOSH Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic Agents |accessdate=10 October 2007 |publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health[/tpl] Routes of entry into the users body are skin absorption, inhalation and ingestion. The long term effects of exposure include chromosomal abnormalities and infertility.Wood, p. 38.

==In other animals==

Chemotherapy is used in veterinary medicine similar to in human medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=McKnight JA|title=Principles of chemotherapy |journal=Clin Tech Small Anim Pract |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12831063 |doi= 10.1053/svms.2003.36617|url=[/tpl]
