==Career==

===Early career===

Carver was the assistant manager to Bobby Robson at Newcastle United. Following Robson's sacking in August 2004, Carver was appointed caretaker manager and guided the team to a 3-0 win against Blackburn Rovers.[tpl]cite news|title=Newcastle force Robson out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3610042.stm|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=30 August 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Carver leaves Newcastle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3649438.stm|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=12 September 2004[/tpl] Carver later dedicated the win to Bobby Robson. Despite the victory, Carver was not considered for the permanent job, that position going to Graeme Souness who opted to bring in his own backroom staff; Carver left the club in September 2004.
In July 2005 Leeds United appointed Carver as a first team coach, replacing the departed Adrian Boothroyd who left the club to be the new manager of Watford. He was part of the management team of Kevin Blackwell and Sam Ellis. Following the exit of Sam Ellis in May 2006, Carver was promoted to the position of assistant manager.
Carver became a caretaker manager for the second time in his career after Leeds United fired Kevin Blackwell following a disastrous start to the season.[tpl]cite news|title=Carver takes Leeds caretaker role|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/5366520.stm|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=21 September 2006[/tpl] Carver celebrated a win in his first game in charge after beating Birmingham City 3-2. However a series of heavy defeats under Carver's management, culminating in a 5-1 drubbing by Luton Town, led to Leeds Chairman Ken Bates opting instead to recruit the Swindon management team of Dennis Wise and Gus Poyet.[tpl]cite news|title=Wise takes over as Leeds manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6076568.stm|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=24 October 2006[/tpl] Carver left Leeds United on 23 October 2006.
Kevin Blackwell subsequently became the manager of Luton Town, and he recruited Carver as his assistant, along with another ex-Leeds coach Sam Ellis. With Luton going through major financial difficulties, including the administrator's decision to sell players from under the management's feet, Carver, along with Blackwell and Ellis were sacked.

===Toronto FC===

On 1 February 2008 he became head coach of the Major League Soccer side Toronto FC, with previous coach, Mo Johnston, remaining as manager and Director of Soccer.[tpl]cite news|title=Toronto FC make coaching change|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2008/02/01/toronto-fc-johnston.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=CBC|date=1 February 2008[/tpl]  He was thereby reunited with an old friend from Newcastle United since Paul Winsper had been hired in January as Strength and Conditioning Coach.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200801/ai_n21194972 |title= Beckham's fitness guru lands with Toronto MLS club |publisher=findarticles.com |accessdate=2008-08-03 | date=1 January 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In April 2009, Carver was charged $750 (USD) by MLS for openly criticising the standard of refereeing during a 3-2 loss away to FC Dallas. He was absent from the bench during a 1-0 home win over Chivas USA four days later and eventually resigned on 25 April 2009, one day before the team's home clash with Kansas City Wizards.[tpl]cite news|last=Molinaro|first=John F|title=John Carver out as Toronto FC coach|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2009/04/25/sp-john-carver.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=CBC|date=25 April 2009[/tpl]

===Plymouth Argyle and Sheffield United===

In December 2009, Carver was appointed assistant head coach to Paul Mariner at Plymouth Argyle.
On 14 January 2010 he rejected an approach from Burnley manager Brian Laws to join the Lancashire club as a coach, stating his desire to repay the loyalty shown by Paul Mariner and the club as his reason for staying.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/8458272.stm | work=BBC News | title=Carver rejects Burnley job offer | date=14 January 2010 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]
In August 2010, Carver was appointed first team coach at Sheffield United by manager Gary Speed, who had played under Carver when he was assistant manager at Newcastle United. This appointment reunited Carver with Sam Ellis, who was assistant to Speed.  Following Speed's departure from Sheffield United to become coach of the Wales national football team on 14 December, Carver was appointed as caretaker manager.[tpl]cite news|title=Gary Speed plans Craig Bellamy Wales captaincy talks|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_of_wales/9287874.stm|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=15 December 2010[/tpl]  He left the club on 30 December 2010 when Micky Adams was appointed as manager.[tpl]cite news|title=Micky Adams confirmed as Sheffield United manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/port_vale/9327422.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=30 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/dec/30/micky-adams-sheffield-united-port-vale|title=Micky Adams appointed Sheffield United manager after leaving Port Vale|date=30 December 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 December 2010|location=London[/tpl]

===Return to Newcastle United===

On 18 January 2011, Newcastle United announced that John Carver was their new assistant manager until the end of the season.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6669370,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Carver back at Newcastle[/tpl] Manager Alan Pardew said it was only a short term deal to see how the two worked together and if he worked well with the setup. On 25 February, he signed a new five and a half year contract with Newcastle.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/newcastle-assistant-john-carver-signs-new-contract-2225570.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Damian | last1=Spellman | title=Newcastle assistant John Carver signs new contract | date=25 February 2011[/tpl]
On 17 March 2013, Carver was sent to the stands by the match officials at half-time during Newcastle's match at Wigan Athletic. This was due to his reaction towards Wigan player Callum McManaman following a high tackle on Newcastle's defender Massadio Haïdara, which saw Haïdara have to be stretchered off and McManaman escape any punishment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21823350 |title=Massadio Haidara: Newcastle United fear knee ligament damage |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 March 2013 [/tpl] Carver was fined £1,000 and warned as to his future conduct as a result.
