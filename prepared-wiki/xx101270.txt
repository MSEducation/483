==Club career==

===Early career===

Adriano started his career in 1999 on Flamengo's youth squad and earned promotion to the senior squad one year later. He made his team debut on February 2, 2000, a Torneio Rio-São Paulo match against Botafogo. He scored a goal against São Paulo in the same competition 4 days later.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.flamengo.com.br/portal/index.php//AgenciaFla/Adriano-ja-e-do-Mengao|title= Adriano já é do Mengão|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009|publisher=Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|language=Portuguese| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090509074019/http://www.flamengo.com.br/portal/index.php/AgenciaFla/Adriano-ja-e-do-Mengao| archivedate= May 9, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Despite signing a two-year contract with Flamengo in June 2000, he secured a move to Internazionale for the 2001–02 season. Inter sold another half of Vampeta to PSG (ultimately to Flamengo from PSG for undisclosed fee) for €9.757 million in exchange for Adriano who was valued €13.189 million.FC Internazionale Milano SpA Report and Accounts on June 30, 2002 [tpl]it icon[/tpl], CCIAA[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=957&L=en|title=ADRIANO-VAMPETA: THE DEALING IS ALMOST CLOSED|date=August 7, 2001|accessdate=October 1, 2012|publisher=Inter Milan[/tpl]

===Inter return===

Adriano returned to the San Siro in 2004 on a 4½-year contract, for about €23.4 million[tpl]#tag:ref|Internazionale did not disclosed the exact amount until attached the "Player identification table"  into 2008–09 statutory financial filing in CCIAA, which shown €32.2 million and Dejan Stanković €6.165 million.

In September 2005, Inter rewarded him for his efforts with an improved contract running until June 30, 2010.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?L=en&N=20193 |title=Inter, Adriano together until 2010 |publisher=inter.it |date=September 26, 2005 |accessdate=August 22, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930181100/http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?L=en&N=20193| archivedate= September 30, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Following the signing of the new deal, Adriano's future at Inter suffered due to poor performances, fueled by questions and speculation regarding his work ethic, which was called into question when he was twice caught partying at nightclubs during the 2006–07 campaign. Brazilian coach Dunga did not call Adriano up for a friendly against Ecuador on October 10, 2006, and called for him to "change his behavior" and "focus on football". On February 18, 2007, Adriano skipped a team practice due to effects from a lengthy celebration of his birthday the night before, which led to Inter manager Roberto Mancini benching him for the team's Champions League match against Valencia and subsequent Serie A fixture against Catania.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

====Stint at São Paulo====

On November 16, 2007, Inter owner Massimo Moratti sent Adriano on unpaid leave to his native Brazil for the second time in eighteen months, where he attended São Paulo's training center, due to his poor physical condition and a past battle with alcoholism. Though his agent denied Adriano's desire to return to Brazilian club football, Adriano claimed he was willing to leave Inter in the January transfer window in search of regular playing time, with the Italian press stating interest from West Ham United and Manchester City.[tpl]cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=482699&cc=5901 |title=Adriano sent to Brazil to save career |publisher=ESPN  |accessdate=October 21, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071119091658/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=482699&cc=5901| archivedate= November 19, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In December 2007, Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra expressed interest in bringing Adriano to the club during the January transfer window, commenting, "Adriano was a top player, but he lost form when his father died, and he put on weight."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=22991fac-9151-469b-b05d-cf344d7528f0|title=Corner Kicks|publisher=Montreal Gazette |date=December 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007[/tpl] Moratti, however, stated that Adriano would remain with Inter.

Inter finalized a deal on December 19 to loan Adriano to São Paulo for the remainder of the 2007–08 season in order to allow him to compete in the 2007–08 Copa Libertadores. São Paulo fans were soon seen standing in long lines to buy his new number 10 jersey at the team's official merchandise retailer after Adriano was introduced and his shirt was unveiled at a team press conference.[tpl]cite news |url=http://tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=70643 |title=São Paulo fans queue to buy Adriano shirt |publisher=Tribalfootball.com |accessdate=December 24, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Adriano celebrated his competitive debut with São Paulo by scoring both goals in their 2–1 victory over Guaratinguetá on the opening day of the 2008 Paulista tournament.

According to team sporting director Marco Aurélio Cunha, Adriano "left the training ground because he wanted to. The team does not miss him.

São Paulo sporting director Carlos Augusto de Barros e Silva announced on June 17 that Adriano was returning to Inter ahead of schedule.

==International career==

Adriano made his first international appearance for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Colombia on November 15, 2000 at the age of 18. He was often considered as the long-term successor to Ronaldo. He scored his first international goal on June 11, 2003 in a friendly match against Nigeria. Later that month, he was included in Brazil team for 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He led Brazil's attack alongside Ronaldinho in the absence of Ronaldo. He appeared in all three matches and scored two goals as Brazil was eliminated in the group stage. He missed 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injuries.
The following year, he was included in Brazil team for Copa América 2004. Brazil won the cup and Adriano won the Golden Boot as the competition's leading scorer with seven goals. In the final match against Argentina, Adriano dramatically scored the equalizer in the 93rd minute. The match went on to penalties and Brazil finally won 4–2. After the match, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira singled out Adriano as a very important factor in winning the title.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/soccer/07/25/copa.final/index.html |title=Brazil battles back, World champs beat Argentina on penalties in Copa America final |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated |accessdate=May 15, 2009 | date=July 25, 2004[/tpl]
In 2005, Adriano once again has an impressive tournament with Brazil, this time in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Adriano was named Player of the Tournament and received the Golden Boot Award as the competition's leading scorer with five goals. In the final, he steered Brazil to victory, scoring two goals in a 4–1 victory over Argentina.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=101/edition=8503/overview.html |title=Germany 2005: Wonderful tournament whets appetite for the main event |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=August 22, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070825084935/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=101/edition=8503/overview.html| archivedate= August 25, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Adriano was called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal on June 18, 2006 in a 2–0 win against Australia and his second in a 3–0 victory against Ghana. Despite his two goals, Adriano's World Cup campaign was considered a disappointment, as he managed only five shots all tournament, while Brazil as a whole were unable to find the right mix between defence and attack, ultimately being eliminated in the quarter-finals by France.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.golaccio.com/adriano/WC06review.php |title=Adriano – His World Cup |publisher=Golaccio.com |accessdate=August 22, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926233848/http://www.golaccio.com/adriano/WC06review.php| archivedate= September 26, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
After the disappointing World Cup, Adriano's international career declined due to a series of poor club performances and personal problems. Adriano has featured once for Brazil under Dunga's regime since the conclusion of the World Cup, as a halftime substitute during a 2–0 friendly loss to Portugal on February 6, 2007. In 2008, Adriano finally regained his form during his stint at São Paulo FC and earned a recall to the national team.
