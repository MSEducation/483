Motel Murder Madness is the first album by Lollipop Lust Kill, released in 2000. The album is noted for having three distinctive versions. The original release, through MP3.com, contained the original track listing as indicated below. The second (independent) release featured a radio-edited version of "Knee Deep in the Dead" following "Check-out Time", which was only distributed on that particular version of the album. A second MP3.com release contained the original track listing, minus "Knee Deep in the Dead" and "The Perfect Woman", which had to be removed due to copyright issues relating to samples from The Dark Half used in the two tracks.
