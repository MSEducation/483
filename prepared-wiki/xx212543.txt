CATEGORIES: Taxation in the United States, United States law, Legal doctrines and principles

Economic substance is a doctrine in the tax law of the United States under which a transaction must have an economic purpose aside from reduction of tax liability in order to be considered valid. This doctrine is used to determine whether tax shelters, or strategies used to reduce tax liability, are considered "abusive" by the Internal Revenue Service.
It was adopted into law as part of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[ref]http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/17/require-economic-justification-for-tax-cuts/
