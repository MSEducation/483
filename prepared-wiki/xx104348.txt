[[Marianne (Sergio Endrigo song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1968 singles, Eurovision songs of Italy, Cliff Richard songs

"Marianne" was the Italian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968, performed in Italian by Sergio Endrigo.
The song is a ballad, with Endrigo expressing his love for the titular character. He sings, however, that she never stays with him, and he wonders about what she is doing. Nonetheless, his feelings for her remain unaltered.
The song was performed eleventh on the night (following France's Isabelle Aubret with "La source" and preceding the United Kingdom's Cliff Richard with "Congratulations)". At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing it 10th in a field of 17.
Following the Contest, it was rewritten in English by Mike Sammes and Bill Owen for Cliff Richard to perform. Richard recorded a minor hit with his rendition of the song.
It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1969 Contest by Iva Zanicchi with "Due grosse lacrime bianche".
