==Background on "Hold On, I'm Comin'"==

According to Steve Cropper, lead guitarist for Booker T and the MG's, the Stax Recording Studio played a key role in the creation of the title track, Hold on, I'm Comin'.  Stax Records was an old Movie Theater located at 926 East McLemore Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee.  The men's restroom in the theater-turned studio had tile walls and tile floors.  To produce reverb and echo a speaker from the studio was placed in the men's room to pipe the sound into the men's room; and a microphone was placed in the men's room to return the sound back to the recording studio.  This arrangement produced both the reverb and echo heard on Stax Records.  One night, as Sam and Dave were recording, Dave had to stop and make a trip to the men's room.  When Dave took a little longer than what Isaac Hayes thought was necessary. He yelled at Dave to "hurry up!"  Dave heard him on the speaker in the men's room and replied, "Hold on; I'm coming".  With a few additions this became the title track of the album, and a hit for Sam and Dave.
