This article describes the geography of Anguilla.
Anguilla is one of the Leeward Islands, which lie between the Caribbean Sea in the west and the open Atlantic Ocean in the east. It is a long, flat, dry/wet, scrub-covered
coral island, south and east of Puerto Rico and north of the Windward chain. It is an island of no significant elevations with its terrain consisting entirely of beaches, dunes, and low limestone bluffs.

==Hills==

Anguilla’s highest elevation, Crocus Hill, is [tpl]convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Crocus Hill is among the cliffs that line the northern shore.

==Coastline==

The numerous bays, including Barnes, Little, Rendezvous, Shoal, and Road Bays, lure many vacationers to this tropical island. The coast and the beautiful, pristine beaches are integral to the tourism-based economy of Anguilla. Because of Anguilla’s warm climate, the beaches can be used year-round.

Anguilla’s coral and limestone terrain provide no subsistence possibilities for forests, woodland, pastures, crops, or arable lands. Its dry climate and thin soil hamper commercial agricultural development.
