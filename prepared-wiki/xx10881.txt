 gives [[Base64]] binary to [[ASCII]] text encoding: L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI=
Even a small change in the message will, with overwhelming probability, result in a completely different hash due to the avalanche effect. For example, changing dog to cog produces a hash with different values for 81 of the 160 bits:
 SHA1("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy '''c'''og")
