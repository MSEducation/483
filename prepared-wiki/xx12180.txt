The rise of Hitler in the 1930's drove Gropius out of Germany. With the help of the English architect Maxwell Fry, Gropius was able to leave Nazi Germany in 1934, on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Italy for a film propaganda festival, he then fled to Britain to avoid the fascist powers of Europe . He lived and worked in Britain, as part of the Isokon group with Fry and others and then moved on to the United States with his family. Walter Gropius and his second wife Ise Gropius arrived in the United States in February 1937, while their twelve year old daughter Ati finished the school year in England.Gropius House History by Historic New England Though built in 1938, the Gropius’ believed their house could embody similar architectural qualities that are practiced today, such as simplicity, economy, and aesthetic beauty. In designing his house, Gropius used the approach developed at the Bauhaus. The house the Gropius’ built for themselves in Lincoln, Massachusetts, (now known as Gropius House) was influential in bringing International Modernism to the U.S. but Gropius disliked the term: "I made it a point to absorb into my own conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate."Gropius House by Walter Gropius Helen Storrow, a bankers wife and a charitable woman, became Gropius' benefactor when she invested a portion of her land and wealth for the architects home. She was so satisfied with the result that she gave more land and wealth to four other professors, two of which Gropius designed homes for. With the Bauhaus philosophy in mind, every aspect of the homes and their surrounding landscapes were planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius’ house received a huge response and was declared a National Landmark in 2000.http://www.ncmodernist.org/gropius.htm
