Topology of a membrane protein refers to location of N-terminus of the protein at the cytosolic or non-cytosolic sides of the biological membrane occupied by the protein.Membrane-protein topology by Gunnar von Heijne For example, topology of a protein attached to the cell plasma membrane indicates location of its N-terminus at the cytoplasmic or extracellular side of the membrane. Every individual transmembrane segment of a protein also has topology, depending on location of its N-terminus on the inner or outer side of the membrane. There are several databases which provide topologies of membrane proteins including Uniprot, TOPDBTOPDB: topology data bank of transmembrane proteinsTOPDB database  and ExTopoDB.ExTopoDB: a database of experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane proteins There are several computational methods for predicting transmembrane domains, both for helices and Î²-barrels.Links to topology prediction methods in Expasy[tpl]cite web|last=Bagos|first=P.G|title=PRED-TMBB, A Hidden Markov Model method, capable of predicting and discriminating beta-barrel outer membrane proteins.|url=http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl]
