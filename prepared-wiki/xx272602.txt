Time-division Long-Term Evolution (TD-LTE), also referred to as Long-Term Evolution Time-Division Duplex (LTE TDD), is a 4G telecommunications technology and standard co-developed by an international coalition of companies, including China Mobile, Datang Telecom, Huawei, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Qualcomm, Samsung, and ST-Ericsson. It is one of two variants of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology standard, the other being Frequency-Division Long-Term Evolution (LTE FDD).

==Overview of technology==

Time-Division Duplex LTE, abbreviated as TD-LTE, TDD LTE, or LTE TDD is one of the two mobile data transmission technologies that fall under the international standard of LTE, the other being Frequency-Division Duplex (LTE FDD).[tpl]cite news |title=Huawei rejects EU dumping, subsidy charges |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=58GH-7NJ1-DXKD-J157&csi=401290&oc=00240&perma=true |work=China Daily (European edition) |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/217123/article.html |title=Huawei: More Trials of TD-LTE in Asia Expected |author=Michael Kan |date=20 January 2011 |work=PC World |accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/chinas-td-lte-spreads-across-globe-2062300869/ |title=China's TD-LTE spreads across globe |author=Liau Yun Qing |date=22 June 2011 |work=ZDNet |accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl] TD-LTE was developed specifically with idea of migration to 4G from the third generation 3G TD-SCDMA networks in mind.[tpl]cite conference |last1=Yonis |first1=A.

There are two major differences between TD-LTE and LTE FDD: how data is uploaded and downloaded, and what frequency spectra the networks are deployed in. While LTE FDD uses paired frequencies to upload and download data,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20130225/wireless_technology/mwc-2013-td-lte-claims-successful-global-roaming-trials/ |title=MWC 2013: TD-LTE group touts successful global roaming trials |author=Dan Meyer |date=25 February 2013 |work=RCR Wireless News |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] TD-LTE uses a single frequency, alternating between uploading and downloading data through time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/4g-lte/defining-4g-what-the-heck-is-lte-tdd/a/d-id/699059 |title=Defining 4G: What the Heck Is LTE TDD? |author=Dan Jones |date=16 October 2012 |work=Light Reading |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Gov't to pick 4th mobile carrier |author=Kim Yoo-chul |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=59VX-65D1-JCBN-53W1&csi=174045&oc=00240&perma=true |work=The Korea Times |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] The ratio between uploads and downloads on a TD-LTE network can be changed dynamically, depending on whether more data needs to be sent or received.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/cellulartelecomms/lte-long-term-evolution/lte-fdd-tdd-duplex.php |title=LTE FDD, TDD, TD-LTE Duplex Schemes |author=Ian Poole |work=Radio-electronics.com |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl] TD-LTE and LTE FDD also operate on different frequency bands,[tpl]cite news |title=Nokia developing TD-LTE devices for China Mobile |author=Cian O'Sullivan |url=http://www.gomonews.com/nokia-developing-td-lte-devices-for-china-mobile/ |work=GoMo News |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl] with TD-LTE working better at higher frequencies, and LTE FDD working better at lower frequencies.[tpl]cite news |title=Optus to launch TD-LTE 4G network in Canberra |author=Josh Taylor |url=http://www.zdnet.com/au/optus-to-launch-td-lte-4g-network-in-canberra-7000008252/ |work=ZDNet |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl] Frequencies used for TD-LTE range from 1850 MHz to 3800 MHz, with several different bands being used.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/cellulartelecomms/lte-long-term-evolution/lte-frequency-spectrum.php |title=LTE Frequency Bands & Spectrum Allocations |author=Ian Poole |work=Radio-electronics.com |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl]  The TD-LTE spectrum is generally cheaper to access, and has less traffic. Further, the bands for TD-LTE overlap with those used for WiMAX, which can easily be upgraded to support TD-LTE.
Despite the differences in how the two types of LTE handle data transmission, TD-LTE and LTE FDD share 90 percent of their core technology, making it possible for the same chipsets and networks to use both versions of LTE.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wireless-mag.com/News/24482/MWC_2013_Ericsson_and_China_Mobile_demo_first_dual_mode_HD_VoLTE_call_based_on_multi-mode_chipsets.aspx |title=MWC 2013: Ericsson and China Mobile demo first dual mode HD VoLTE call based on multi-mode chipsets |date=4 March 2013 |work=Wireless - Wireless Communications For Public Services And Private Enterprises |publisher=Noble House Media |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl] A number of companies produce dual-mode chips or mobile devices, including Samsung and Qualcomm,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mobileworldlive.com/gcf-and-gti-partner-for-td-lte-device-certification |title=GCF and GTI partner for TD-LTE device certification |author=Steve Costello |date=2 August 2013 |work=Mobile World Live |accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Qualcomm India's Dr. Avneesh Agrawal on 4G, Snapdragon and more |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=57VJ-XG41-JDKC-R3F2&csi=376858&oc=00240&perma=true |work=Digit |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] while operators China Mobile Hong Kong Company Limited and Hi3G Access have developed dual-mode networks in China and Sweden, respectively.[tpl]cite news |title=ZTE, China Mobile Hong Kong to construct LTE-TDD network |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=5653-S1F1-JC11-C4VY&csi=279499&oc=00240&perma=true |work=TT_Magazine |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The creation of TD-LTE involved a coalition of international companies that worked to develop and test the technology.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.caixin.com/2013-05-07/100524715.html?p2 |title=Competitors Try Curbing China Mobile's 4G Urge |author=Tan Min |date=7 May 2013 |work=Caixin Online |publisher=Caixin Media |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] China Mobile was an early proponent of TD-LTE,[tpl]cite news |title=Nokia developing TD-LTE devices for China Mobile |author=Cian O'Sullivan |url=http://www.gomonews.com/nokia-developing-td-lte-devices-for-china-mobile/ |work=GoMo News |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://news.techworld.com/networking/3327781/td-lte-4g-standard-gains-momentum-abi-research/ |title=TD-LTE 4G standard gains momentum: ABI Research |author=Sophie Curtis |date=4 January 2012 |work=Techworld |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] along with other companies like Datang Telecom[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.caixin.com/2013-05-07/100524715.html?p2 |title=Competitors Try Curbing China Mobile's 4G Urge |author=Tan Min |date=7 May 2013 |work=Caixin Online |publisher=Caixin Media |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] and Huawei, which worked to deploy TD-LTE networks, and later developed technology allowing TD-LTE equipment to operate in white spacesâ€”frequency spectra between broadcast TV stations.[ref]
