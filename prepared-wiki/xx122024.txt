The Bleecker Street Cinema was an art house movie theater located at 144 Bleecker Street in New York City. It became a landmark of Greenwich Village and an influential venue for filmmakers and cinemaphiles through its screenings of foreign and Independent films. It closed in 1990, reopened as a gay adult theater for a time afterward, then again briefly showed art films until closing for good in 1991.

==History==

The building at 144 Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village that would eventually house the Bleecker Street Cinema was originally built in 1832 as two rowhouses at 144 and 146 Bleecker Street. Placido Mori converted 144 into the restaurant Mori in 1883.[tpl]cite news | title = Streetscapes: The Bleecker Street Cinema; The 'Lost' Frescoes of an Artist-Soldier | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/04/realestate/streetscapes-the-bleecker-street-cinema-the-lost-frescoes-of-an-artist-soldier.html | first = Christopher | last = Gray |  authorlink= Christopher Gray | work = The New York Times | date = November 4, 1990 | accessdate = April 7, 2013[/tpl] As architecture historian Christopher Gray wrote,
Mori closed in 1937. The building remained unoccupied until 1944 when political and activist organizations including Free World House headquartered there for two years. Sometime afterward, the space became the Restaurant Montparnasse. By 1959, the building was owned by New York University.

She further said that Souto, after renting to her for four years for $160,000 annually, raised the rent to $275,000, more than the theater could sustain.

==Influence and legacy==

The foreign and independent-film programming of the Bleecker Street Cinema helped inspire future filmmakers and contributed to the cinematic education of film historians, critics and academics. As one historian wrote,
[tpl]quote|Sid Geffen was one of a series of men who made a huge difference in film history through their exhibition choices in New York City. Geffe, who ran the Bleecker Street Cinema in the crucial years of the late seventies and early eighties, along with Amos Vogel and Fabiano Canosa, significantly affected the course of film history.[tpl]cite book | title = Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories of the Feminist Film Movement | first = B.

François Truffaut was a frequent visitor to the Bleecker Street Cinema (as were other New Wave directors) and the famed scene in La Peau Douce where the professor wanders in back of a cinema screen was inspired by a tour of the theater's back stage during a film performance.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] The cavernous office area of the theater (which in later years was converted to a second theater) was also the unofficial headquarters of the pro politique des auteurs crowd of critics.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] In his review of Jonathan Demme's The Truth About Charlie, Andrew Sarris stated that "not to mention the dedication of the film to the late Ted Demme and Marshall Lewis, one of the two guys in the back of the Bleecker Street Cinema (the other was Rudy Franchi) with whom I spent many convivial hours of Francophilia and cinephilia. After all that, how can I pretend to be objective about Mr. Demme’s labor of love?"[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]  
The back office was also the publishing home of NY Film Bulletin, a publication that was the first to translate the writings of Truffaut and others into English. It is credited with introducing the auteur theory to the U.S. through the writings of such critics as Sarris and a two-part interview with Truffaut on the politique. The second part of that interview was done at the Bleecker Street Cinema.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

Several scenes in Desperately Seeking Susan 1985) were shot there, as one of the characters (Dez, played by Aidan Quinn) works there as a projectionist. In Woody Allen's 1989 Crimes and Misdemeanors, the character played by filmmaker-star Allen visits the Bleecker Street Cinema to see Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the 1943 musical Happy Go Lucky.[tpl]cite book | title = New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York | first = Richard | last =  Alleman | page = 256 | publisher = Broadway | year = 2005 | isbn =  978-0767916349 | accessdate = April 5, 2013[/tpl]
