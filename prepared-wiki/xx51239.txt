The Vancouver Ravens were a member of the National Lacrosse League (NLL), from 2002 to 2004. They played their three seasons at General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After the three-year lease at GM Place expired, they were unable to secure a lease with either GM Place or the Pacific Coliseum, but the main reason was lack of attendance due to unstable ownership. On December 14, 2004, the NLL announced that the Ravens would not be playing in the 2005 NLL season. 
On June 18, 2007 a bid was submitted to the NLL for the return of the Vancouver Ravens for the 2008 season. The bid that was submitted to the NLL was approved on the condition that an arena lease is obtained and 2,500 season tickets are sold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=70aaa468-be53-467f-a636-44e484f457c5|title=New ownership could revive NLL's Ravens|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=June 18, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl]
