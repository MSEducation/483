Thunderbird is the name of the northernmost wooden roller coaster in the world, located at PowerPark in Alahärmä, Western Finland. The two Millennium Flyer trains operating it were manufactured by Great Coasters International (GCI). Its layout is identical to American Thunder at Six Flags St. Louis
Thunderbird was the first wooden roller coaster in Europe to be built by GCI.  Approximately 1,000 cubic meters of wood, 750,000 bolts and 1.8 million nails were used for Thunderbird's construction.  President of GCI, Clair Hain, Jr., commended the Finnish carpenters for their remarkable chainsaw skills.  The track is one kilometer in length and reaches a speed of nearly 100 km/h.
