Patrick "Paddy" Dignam is a fictional character in Ulysses by James Joyce. Leopold Bloom attends his funeral from the family home to Glasnevin Cemetery in the chapter Hades. He is survived by Mrs. Dignam and their son Patrick Aloysius "Patsy" Dignam.
The Dignams live at number 9, Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount.
As he dies in a drunken stupor, he is considered Joyce's analog of Elpenor, who died in similar circumstances and who greeted his friend Odysseus.
