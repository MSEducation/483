It was named Kahlúa, meaning "House of the Acolhua people"  in the Veracruz Nahuatl language spoken before the Spanish Conquest. (Kahlúa was Hispanicized as Ulúa, forming the name of modern San Juan de Ulúa fortress.)
The company merged in 1994 with Allied Lyons to become Allied Domecq. In turn, that company was partially acquired in 2005 by Pernod Ricard, now the largest spirits distributor in the world since its merger with the Swedish Vin & Sprit in March 2008.

==Uses==

Kahlúa is used to make cocktails and as a topping or ingredient in several desserts, including ice cream, cakes, and cheesecakes.
Kahlúa can be used in a few notable cocktails, including the following:
It can also be drunk in cold milk or cream, or mixed with hot coffee or cocoa. A licensed line of chocolates, with Kahlúa-flavored centers, is sold in Mexico, as well as small chocolate shot glass-style "cups" in which the liqueur may be served.
Because Kahlúa is made from coffee beans, it does contain a small amount of caffeine.  According to the company, this is "approximately 10 mg per 100 mL (4.85 mg in each 1.5 oz) drink" or about 25% the amount found in the same volume of coffee.[tpl]cite web|last=Carnaha|first=Ted|title=Kahlua and Caffeine|url=http://www.tedcarnahan.com/2007/01/22/kahlua-and-caffeine/|accessdate=11 March 2012[/tpl]
