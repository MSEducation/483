Herdwick lambs are born black, and after a year they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled.[tpl]cite web |title=Herdwick Sheep |work=Breeds of Livestock |publisher=Oklahoma State University |url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/herdwick/index.htm |accessdate =2007-10-31[/tpl] For shows and auctions, Herdwicks traditionally have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks â€“ now replaced by ear tags.
