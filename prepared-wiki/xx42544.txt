Starpath was a U.S. company known for creating the Starpath Supercharger in 1982. The company was founded in 1981 under the name Arcadia Corporation, but it changed its name to Starpath shortly after for trademark reasons (Emerson Radio Corporation had released a video game console named the Emerson Arcadia 2001). It was founded by Alan Bayley, Robert Brown, and Craig Nelson.
The Starpath Supercharger was an add-on for the Atari 2600 video game console that expanded the machine capabilities by adding more RAM, allowing for higher resolution graphics and larger games, and by providing a connector to which a regular cassette player could be connected, thus permitting larger games, stored on tape, to be loaded. The Supercharger was connected to the Atari's cartridge slot.
Starpath merged with Epyx in 1983. Rights to Starpath games are [tpl]As of|2004|alt=currently[/tpl] owned by Bridgestone Multimedia, a religious multimedia company.
