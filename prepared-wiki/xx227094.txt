The Neotropical Bird Club (NBC) is a British-based ornithological and birdwatching club established in 1994 for people interested in the birds of the Neotropics, namely South America, Central America from Mexico to Panama, and the islands of the Caribbean.
Its aims are to foster interest in Neotropical birds among birdwatchers, support conservation in the region, encourage birdwatchers there to contribute to bird conservation, publish articles and notes about the birds, their identification and conservation, focus on priority species and sites, drawing attention to conservation needs, publicise the activities of local individuals and groups, and improve their liaison and collaboration with other birdwatchers.[tpl]cite book |title=Field Guide to the Songbirds of South America: The Passerines |last= Ridgely|first= Robert S. |authorlink= |coauthors= Guy Tudor|year=2009 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location= |isbn=978-0-292-71979-8 |page=5 |url= |accessdate= |quote= In recent years the Neotropical Bird Club has come to play a role as well, not only by publishing the journal Cotinga but also increasingly by supporting direct conservation efforts.[/tpl]
