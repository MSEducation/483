Amylase [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ɪ|l|eɪ|z[/tpl] is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch into sugars. Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potato, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. As diastase, amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated (by Anselme Payen in 1833).(1)  Robert Hill and Joseph Needham, The Chemistry of Life:  Eight Lectures on the History of Biochemistry (London, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970), page 17 ; (2)  Richard B.

Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters. All amylases are glycoside hydrolases and act on α-1,4-glycosidic bonds.

==Classification==

===α-Amylase===

The α-amylases ([tpl]EC number|3.2.1.1 [/tpl]) (CAS# 9014-71-5) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes, completely unable to function in the absence of calcium.  By acting at random locations along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain carbohydrates, ultimately yielding maltotriose and maltose from amylose, or maltose, glucose and "limit dextrin" from amylopectin.  Because it can act anywhere on the substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase.  In animals, it is a major digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.Effects of pH (Introduction to Enzymes)
In human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are α-amylases.
The α-amylases form is also found in plants, fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and bacteria (Bacillus)

===β-Amylase===

Another form of amylase, β-amylase ([tpl]EC number|3.2.1.2 [/tpl]) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also synthesized by bacteria, fungi, and plants.  Working from the non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second α-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units (maltose) at a time.  During the ripening of fruit, β-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit.
Both α-amylase and β-amylase are present in seeds; β-amylase is present in an inactive form prior to germination, whereas α-amylase and proteases appear once germination has begun. Many microbes also produce amylase to degrade extracellular starches.  Animal tissues do not contain β-amylase, although it may be present in microorganisms contained within the digestive tract. The optimum pH for β-amylase is 4.0–5.0"Amylase, Alpha" , I.U.B.: 3.2.1.11,4-α-D-Glucan glucanohydrolase.

===γ-Amylase===

γ-Amylase ([tpl]EC number|3.2.1.3 [/tpl]) (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; Exo-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; lysosomal α-glucosidase; 1,4-α-D-glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, as well as the last α(1–4)glycosidic linkages at the nonreducing end of amylose and amylopectin, yielding glucose. The γ-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3.

==Uses==

===Fermentation===

Amylases are used in breadmaking and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This is the reason for long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.[ref]

Alpha and beta amylases are important in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch.  In fermentation, yeast ingest sugars and excrete alcohol.  In beer and some liquors, the sugars present at the beginning of fermentation have been produced by "mashing" grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes).  In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a "mash," which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars.  Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars.  In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.
In some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva.  This practice is no longer in general use.

===Molecular biology===

In molecular biology, the presence of amylase can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the structural gene for amylase, successful integration will disrupt the amylase gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through iodine staining.

===Other uses===

An inhibitor of alpha-amylase, called phaseolamin, has been tested as a potential diet aid.[tpl]cite journal |author=Udani J, Hardy M, Madsen DC|title=Blocking carbohydrate absorption and weight loss: a clinical trial using Phase 2 brand proprietary fractionated white bean extract |journal=Altern Med Rev |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=63–9 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15005645 |url=http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/9/1/63.pdf[/tpl]
When used as a food additive, amylase has E number E1100, and may be derived from swine pancreas or mould mushroom.
Bacilliary amylase is also used in clothing and dishwasher detergents to dissolve starches from fabrics and dishes.
Factory workers who work with amylase for any of the above uses are at increased risk of occupational asthma. Five to nine percent of bakers have a positive skin test, and a fourth to a third of bakers with breathing problems are hypersensitive to amylase.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mapp CE |title=Agents, old and new, causing occupational asthma |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=354–60, 290 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11303086 |pmc=1740131 |url=http://oem.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11303086 |doi=10.1136/oem.58.5.354[/tpl]

==Hyperamylasemia==

Blood serum amylase may be measured for purposes of medical diagnosis. A higher than normal concentration may reflect one of several medical conditions, including acute inflammation of the pancreas (it may be measured concurrently with the more specific lipase),http://www.merck.com/mmpe/print/sec02/ch015/ch015b.html but also perforated peptic ulcer, torsion of an ovarian cyst, strangulation ileus, mesenteric ischemia, macroamylasemia and mumps.  Amylase may be measured in other body fluids, including urine and peritoneal fluid.
A January 2007 study from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme could be used to indicate sleep deficits, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep."First Biomarker for Human Sleepiness Identified", Record of Washington University in St. Louis, January 25, 2007

==History==

In 1831, Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1800–1837) described the hydrolysis of starch by saliva, due to the presence of an enzyme in saliva, "ptyalin", an amylase.Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1831) "Wirkung des Speichels auf Stärke" (Effect of saliva on starch), Poggendorff's Annalen der Physik und Chemie, vol. 22, page 623 (modern citation:  Annalen der Physik, vol. 98, no. 8, page 623).

==Human evolution==

Carbohydrates are a food source rich in energy. Amylase is thought to have played a key role in human evolution in allowing humans an alternative to fruit and protein. A duplication of the pancreatic amylase gene developed independently in humans and rodents, which could be suggestive of the importance of the gene. The salivary amylase levels found in the human lineage are six to eight times higher in humans than in chimpanzees, which are mostly fruit eaters and ingest little starch relative to humans.[tpl]cite journal | journal=American Scientist |date=March–April 2010[/tpl]
