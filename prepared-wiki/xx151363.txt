[[Gory Days]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Necro albums, Horrorcore albums

Gory Days is the second studio album by rapper Necro, released on November 7, 2001 by Psycho+Logical-Records. In this album, Necro emphasizes his death rap theme, rather than sex, such as in his 2005 album The Sexorcist. The album spawned two singles, "Bury You with Satan" and "Morbid".
The album was Necro's quickest selling release at the time. Featured guests on the album include Mr. Hyde, Goretex, Ill Bill, Captain Carnage and Kid Joe. The track "Circle of Tyrants" features all four members of the then-non-existent hip hop supergroup Circle of Tyrants who named their group after the title of this collaboration. Band members of the group include Necro, Mr. Hyde, Goretex and  Ill Bill.
The single "Bury You with Satan" was subsequently remixed twice since this release; once in 2003 for Street Villains Vol. 1, with a new verse recorded exclusively for the remix, and again in 2005 for Street Villains Vol. 2. The songs "Dead Body Disposal" and "Poetry in the Streets" were subsequently remixed only once since this release for Street Villains Vol. 1, with a new verse recorded exclusively for both remixes.
