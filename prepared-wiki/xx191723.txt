The Dodge County Courthouse is an historic courthouse building located  in Eastman, Georgia. Built in 1908, it was designed by Eastman-born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who is noted for the  courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida, Georgia and Texas. The builder was M.L. Lewman & Company. This was the very first courthouse Hosford had ever designed. His commission was controversial because his father, Charlie Columbus Hosford, was a member of the building committee  appointed by the county commissioners. Since Edward C. Hosford then lived in Atlanta, it was rumored that he was going to farm the project out to the more experienced architect who had been bypassed in order to give him the commission, but he moved back to Eastman and did all the work himself.Caldwell, Wilber W, The Courthouse and the Depot: The Architecture of Hope in an Age of Despair: A Narrative Guide to Railroad Expansion and Its Impact on Public Architecture in Georgia, 1833-1910, Macon: Mercer University Press, 2001, p.252 & 366.National Register listings for Dodge County
