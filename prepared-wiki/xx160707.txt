[[Acaranga Sutra]]

CATEGORIES: Jain texts, Agamas

The Acaranga Sutra (First book c. 5th-4th century BCE; Second book c. 2nd-1st century BCE)[tpl]sfn|Jain|1998|p=4[/tpl] is the first of the eleven Angas, part of the agamas (religious texts) which were compiled based on the teachings of Mahavira.
The Acaranga Sutra discusses the conduct of a Jain monk. In antiquity, Acaranga was the first text that was studied by the Jain monks.
The existing text of the Acaranga Sutra which is used by the Svetambara sect of Jainism was recompiled and edited by  KshamaShraman Devardhigani, who headed the  council held at Valabhi c. 454 CE. The Digambaras do not recognize the existing text, and regard the original text as having been lost in its original form. The Digambara Mulachara text includes the Digambara tradition derived from Acharanga.

==Introduction==

The Acharanga Sutra is the oldest agam, from a linguistic point of view, written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. The Acaranga Sutra contains two books, or Srutaskandhas. The first book is the older part, to which other treatises were later added. It describes the conduct and behavior of ascetic life: the mode of asking for food, bowl, clothes, conduct while walking and speaking and regulation of possessions by ascetics. It also describes the penance of Mahavira, the Great Hero.
The second book is divided into four sections called Kulas. There were originally five Kûlâs, but the fifth, the Nisîhiyagghana, is now reckoned as a separate work. The first and second parts lay down rules for conduct of ascetics.
All references about the course of studies for the Jaina monks and nuns, which are found in Āgama-literature, are related to the eleven Aṅgas and fourteen Pūrvas. In these references we find numbers of monks and nuns such as Gautama, Padmāvatῑ, Kālῑ, Atimuktaka Kumāra etc. Some of them are known to be the disciples of Ariṣṭanemi and some of them in the order of Mahāvῑra.
The Ācārāṅga has been described in details in Samavāyāṅga and the Nandῑ. According to them, the main studies of the Ācārāṅga are 'Ācāra gocara' i.e. code of conduct, vinaya (humility), vaināyika (fruition of humility), sthāna (difference postures), gamana (travelling), cankramaṇa (movements), bhojana-mātra (quantity of food intake), svādhyāya (spiritual studies), bhāṣā samiti (principles of speech), gupti (restraint or of mind, speech and body), sayyā (place of stay), upādhῑ (belongings) etc. The Ācārāṅga recommends purity of all these aspects. Acharya Umāsvati has briefly dealt with the subject matter of the nine chapters of the Ācārāṅga. They are:
