Some Kind of Wonderful is a 1987 American romance film starring Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Lea Thompson. It is one of the several successful teen dramas written by John Hughes in the 1980s, although this one was directed by Howard Deutch.

==Plot==

The film is set against the strict social hierarchy of an American public high school. The tomboyish Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) has always considered working class misfit Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz) her best friend. But when Keith asks out the most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), Watts realizes she feels something much deeper for him. Meanwhile, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer), Amanda's Corvette-driving ex-boyfriend from the rich section of town, plans to cause trouble for Keith; although he has no real feelings for Amanda, he feels humiliated at losing her to a social inferior. However, Keith cunningly manages things to his own and Amanda's advantage and gives Hardy his well-deserved comeuppance. In the end, Amanda realizes that she needs time alone and Keith clues into Watts's feelings for him. Realizing that he loves her too, he gives her the diamond earrings he had originally bought as a present for Amanda.

Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson almost worked together in the hit 1985 film Back to the Future. Stoltz was dropped from the film in favor of original choice Michael J. Fox. The two worked together in the 1984 teen comedy The Wild Life.[tpl]cn|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Thompson had originally turned down the role, but changed her mind when the role was offered to her a second time as the film she did do - Howard the Duck - had turned out to be a major bomb.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/lea-thompson,69639/ |title=Random Roles: Lea Thompson|first= Will|last= Harris|work=avclub.com |date= 2012-02-21|accessdate=19 October 2012[/tpl]
