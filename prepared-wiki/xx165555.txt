==Origins==

LatiNation was originally produced by the AIM Tell-A-Vision Group (AIM TV), a New York based production and syndication company. AIM is a division of Artist and Idea Management and helped establish the business model of producing English language content for U.S. born Latinos beginning in 2001.
AIM TV was established in February 2000 by Robert G. Rose and Renzo Devia. AIM TV was the first television company to successfully produce, distribute and syndicate television programming targeting U.S. born Latinos, helping to spawn an industry that had not existed before (television programming in English, targeted to young, mostly U.S. born Latinos). 65% of U.S. Latinos are U.S. born according to U.S. Census data, but rarely if ever watch Spanish-language TV (according to Tomas Rivera Policy Inst. 1999).
In January 2008 the syndicated programs and the American Latino brand name were acquired by LATV Networks, the nation’s first bilingual entertainment/music network distributed via digital multicast. The broadcast syndication division (American Latino Syndication) continues to operate under the LATV Networks umbrella with offices located in New York City and Los Angeles, California.
