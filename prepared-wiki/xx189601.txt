Former President Vladimir Putin has installed  "siloviki", or colleagues from his time in the KGB. These key subordinates "may be critical determinants of the course Putin will pursue in the year ahead."
The CIA believes Putin perceived that his policies toward Ukraine have not unfolded as he will like, so he is likely "to redouble his efforts to defend Russian interests abroad while balancing cooperation with the West. Russia's most immediate security threat is terrorism, and counterterrorism cooperation undoubtedly will continue. Separatism, and radical Islamic movements crossing borders into Southern Russia, threaten stability in Southern Russia. He expects more Chechen terrorist attacks in Russia, at both civilian and military targets.
While Putin says there is a role outside powers to play with the CIS, "we believe he is nevertheless concerned about further encroachment by the US and NATO into the region.
Putin will use increases in the military budget to "help Russia create a professional military by replacing conscripts with volunteer servicemen". His priority appears to be keeping strategic weapons in good condition, and modernizing where possible.  .
"Russia remains an important source of weapons technology, materials and components for other nations. The vulnerability of Russian WMD materials and technology to theft or diversion is a continuing concern."
