==Pirate Party==

Troberg's entry into the Pirate Party has been described as a complete ideological turnaround from the stances associated with her previous publishing career. She challenged the pirates with questions on her blog, and getting them answered to satisfaction, she decided that the pirates were right and that technology had superseded much of copyright law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://falkvinge.net/2011/01/01/from-publishing-to-piracy/|title=From Publishing to Piracy|author=Anna Troberg|work=Falkvinge.net|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lönegård|first=Claes|title=Vi har inget att erbjuda medlemmarna|url=http://www.fokus.se/2011/05/%C2%BBvi-har-inget-att-erbjuda-medlemmarna%C2%AB/|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Fokus|date=23 May 2011|language=Swedish[/tpl]

She considers one of her most important tasks as leader of the Pirate Party to add more compassion to pirate politics and go beyond the technical focus.[tpl]cite news|last=Forsström|first=Anders|title=Anna Troberg: Jag ska föra in hjärta i piratpolitiken|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/anna-troberg-jag-ska-fora-in-lite-hjarta-i-piratpolitiken|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Dagens Nyheter|date=2 January 2011|language=Swedish[/tpl]
