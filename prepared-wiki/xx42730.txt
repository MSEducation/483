 Mormon leaders immediately proclaimed Pratt as another [[martyr]],
"Murder of Parley P. Pratt, One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", JD 19(27):417 (July 4, 1857) ("Another Martyr has fallen – another faithful servant of God has sealed his pure and heavenly testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon with his blood."); [tpl]Harvnb|Pratt|1975|p=16[/tpl]; "Reminiscences of Mrs. A. Agatha Pratt, January 7, F564, No. 16, LDS Church Archives, stating that Brigham Young said, "Nothing has happened so hard to reconcile my mind to since the death of Joseph.").
 and many Mormons held the people of Arkansas responsible.
Eleanor McLean Pratt, "Mrs. McLean's Letter to the Judge", JD 19(27):426 (July 4, 1857) ("The blood of innocence has freely flowed to stain the soil of the fair State of Arkansas."); [tpl]Harvnb|Brooks|1950|pp=36–37[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|Linn|1902|pp=519–20[/tpl]: "It was in accordance with Mormon policy to hold every Arkansan accountable for Pratt's death, just as every Missourian was hated because of the expulsion of the church from that state.").
In 1857, Mormon leaders taught that the Second Coming of Jesus was imminent,
[tpl]Harvnb|Young|Kimball|Hyde|Pratt|1845|p=5[/tpl] ("there are those now living upon the earth who will live to see the consummation"). Based on a somewhat ambiguous statement by Joseph Smith, some Mormons believed that Jesus would return in 1891 [tpl]Harvnb|Erickson|1996|p=9[/tpl].
 and that God would soon exact punishment against the United States for persecuting Mormons and martyring Joseph Smith, Jr., Hyrum Smith, Patten and Pratt.
[tpl]Harvnb|Grant|1854|p=148[/tpl] "It is a stern fact that the people of the United States have shed the blood of the Prophets, driven out the Saints of God,… consequently I look for the Lord to use His whip on the refractory son called 'Uncle Sam'."
