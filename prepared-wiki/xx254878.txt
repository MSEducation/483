Betts v. Armstead, L.R. 20 Q.B.D. 771 (1888), was an English case decided by the Queen's Bench that adopted a strict liability standard for violations of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1875 (38 & 39 Vict. c. 63).  The defendant contended that he did not know that his product did not abide by the standards of the statute, but the court held that there was no mens rea requirement for the violation.Bonnie, R.J. et al.
