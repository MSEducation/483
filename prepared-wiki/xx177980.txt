==Gregorian Code discovery==

In 2010 the Volterra database was used by Corcoran and Salway to  identify previously unknown fragments of the Gregorian Code. The "Fragmenta Londiniensia" are seventeen pieces of parchment estimated to date from AD400, the document having been cut up and re-used as book-binding material. This is the  first direct evidence yet discovered of the Gregorian Codex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/?p=3466  |title=Lost Roman legal text found |first=Roger |last=Pearse |date=27  January 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News/Podcasts/Pages/lostromanlaw.aspx  |title=Lost Roman law code discovered in London |publisher=Arts and Humanities Research Council  |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010 |format=Podcast[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Cracking  the codex: Long lost Roman legal document discovered |last=Jack  |first=Malcolm |date=28 January 2010 |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/cracking-the-codex-long-lost-roman-legal-document-discovered-1881769.html|quote=These  fragments are the first direct evidence of the original version of the  Gregorian Code.
