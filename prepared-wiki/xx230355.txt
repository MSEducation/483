[[Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access]]

CATEGORIES: Maritime communication

Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) is a channel access method which was designed by HÃ¥kan Lans, based on time-division multiplexing.
The term "Self-Organized" describes the manner in which time slots are assigned to users. Time division multiple access (TDMA) divides a channel into frames, which furthermore are subdivided into a vast number of time slots. Users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using his own time slot. One of the drawbacks of TDMA is that it requires a central station for slot assignment and time synchronisation. STDMA proposes a method for assigning slots without the involvement of a central station. Time synchronisation is usually taken care of using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
STDMA is in use by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a standard marine short range coastal tracking system, and is the base of the International Civil Aviation Organization VHF Data Link Mode 4 .
While the method was patented, a US patent ex-parte reexamination certificate was issued in 2010 canceling all claims.USPTO ex-parte reexamination certificate (7428th), issued on March 30, 2010
