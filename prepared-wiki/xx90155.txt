Although the earliest traces of human habitation in the area stretch back 5,000 years, Dongguan's emergence as a true city is a recent phenomenon.
In 1839, at the outset of the First Opium War, large quantities of seized opium were burned in the local town of Humen. Several of the major battles of the war were fought in this area.
During the Second World War, the city served as the base for guerrilla resistance against the Japanese occupation.Dongguan - History, Dongguan Government

==Economy==

Dongguan is a major manufacturing hub, although it suffered significant loss of economic activity from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90778/8252981.html |title=Dongguan 'remains processing trade hub' |date=22 May 2013 |work=People's Daily Online |publisher= |accessdate=29 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1329797/dongguan-city-search-reason-exist |title=Dongguan is city in search of reason to exist |author=He Huifeng |date=12 October 2013 |work=South China Morning Post |publisher= |accessdate=29 October 2013[/tpl] The largest industrial sector is manufacturing of electronics and communications equipment; international companies with facilities in Dongguan include DuPont, Samsung Electronics, Nokia, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Maersk.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.dg.gov.cn/Manufacturing%20Base.htm |title=Manufacturing Base' |date= |work=People's Daily Online |work=http://english.dg.gov.cn/ |publisher=DongGuan Government |accessdate=29 October 2013[/tpl]
The Dongguan Science & Technology Museum (opened in December 2005), the high tech commerce park in the Songshan Lake district (opened in 2003) and a partnership with the Global IT Academy of the Brea Olinda Unified School District in Southern California have demonstrated the city's emphasis on attracting technology business.

While the city is the third largest export region in China, behind Shanghai and Shenzhen (and a major centre for Taiwanese investment), outside of China, Dongguan has yet to gain the kind of name recognition realized by Shenzhen. This may be because the city has focused on infrastructure investment rather than the directly targeting of major corporations with financial incentives for economic development. Nevertheless, Dongguan has been identified by high level representatives of the National Development and Reform Commission of the central government as one of the most significant growth regions for technology in the coming years. As part of this plan the Dongguan local government has announced a plan to create and support a 100-billion-yuan photovoltaic manufacturing industry by 2015.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinamarketpulseaviationpremiumincometourismlabormarket8088/index.html |title= China Market Pulse|publisher=The China Perspective |date=2011-01-12 [/tpl]

==Social issues==

The city and province have been the recent focus of press and journalist attention with coverage of the many young Chinese workers, principally females (so-called factory girls), from agricultural areas who work in the area's factories and manufacturing/assembly facilities, where many are housed in large dormitories, usually several to a room.Chang, Leslie T., Factory Girls: From Village to City In A Changing China, New York: Random House (2008), ISBN 978-0-385-52017-1
An article in the High Tech Misery in China series reports research conducted, over 2008 to 2009, on working conditions at one of the city's major keyboard makers (Dongguan Meitai Plastics & Electronics Factory); in it, Meitai factory won some unwanted attention, due to the disappointing conditions for its young, mostly female workers. The articleThe Dehumanization of Young Workers Producing Our Computer Keyboards, New York: The National Labor Committee http://www.nlcnet.org/admin/media/document/China/2009_meitai/HIGHTECH_MISERY_CHINA_WEB.pdf  http://wen.org.cn/xu/HIGHTECH_MISERY_CHINA_WEB.pdf (Feb 2009, pp 63) includes details of those conditions, photos, translations of employer's rules and evidence that well-known computer brands use this keyboard supplier's products.
Dongguan has as well a variety of types of brothels, massage parlours, nightclubs, sauna centres and karaoke bars, the city has more than 120 top-end luxury hotels and hundreds of other mid-range places that offer illegal sexual services or lease floors to sex operators, and many parts of the broader service sector benefit from the trade brought by visitors. Although much of the business is illegal, police operations to limit these activities were for a long time largely ineffective, in part because many members of the local administration and other officials have business interests in the sector.Party chief vows to crack down but excessive measures will be avoided, SCMP, 26 Nov 2009[tpl]cite web|last=Dzodin|first=Harvey|title=Dongguan's poor reputation hides a city of two tales|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/665490/Dongguans-poor-reputation-hides-a-city-of-two-tales.aspx|work=Global Times|publisher=Global Times|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
