===Fokker 100 Executive Jet===

Starting in December 2007, MJET becomes the operator of three Fokker 100EJ bizliners. The Fokker 100 Executive Jet is the result of a modification project which had two phases: interior modification (2007) and additional fuel tank system installation (2010). The bizliner has a charter capacity of 19 seats (commercial operation configuration) in three distinct privacy areas. The additional fuel tanks increase the aircraft range to approximatively 4,800 km.

In 2010 and 2011 MJET took delivery of 5 new business jets on behalf of various customers; the new additions to the company's fleet of managed aircraft included 2 Hawker 900XP, 2 Gulfstream G200 and 1 Gulfstream G450. In 2012 MJET was granted a Global 5000 management contract by an undisclosed Eastern European corporation.
