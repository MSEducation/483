The Windward Passage is a strait in the Caribbean Sea, between the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The strait specifically lies between the easternmost region of Cuba and the northwest of Haiti.See Riley, Shannon Rose. _Imagi-Nations in black and white: Cuba, Haiti, and the performance of difference in United States national projects, 1898--1940_ PhD, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS, © 2006, UMI-Proquest, 3230676, page 50.

80km wide, the Windward Passage has a threshold depth of 1,700m.  Navassa Island lies on its southern approach.
It connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, and is in the direct path of shipping between the Panama Canal and the eastern seaboard of the United States.See Riley, Shannon Rose. _Imagi-Nations in black and white: Cuba, Haiti, and the performance of difference in United States national projects, 1898--1940_ PhD, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS, © 2006, UMI-Proquest, 3230676, page 50.
