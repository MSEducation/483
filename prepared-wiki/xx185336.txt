==Lineage==

Ko Bong Sunim was Dharma heir to Man Gong Sunim, who was in turn Dharma heir to Kyong Ho Sunim. Ko Bong Sunim's best known student was Seung Sahn Sunim (1927–2004), founder of the Kwan Um School of Zen. Seung Sahn Sunim received Dharma transmission from Ko Bong Sunim at 22 years of age. Ko Bong had never given inka to any monk before he met Seung Sahn Sunim and Sahn remained his only dharma heir.
Sunim is a Korean word that means ordained Buddhist and can refer to both men and women who have taken ordination vows.
