[[Dimethylaminopropylamine]]

CATEGORIES: Amines

Dimethylaminopropylamine (aka "DMAPA") is a diamine used in the preparation of some surfactants, such as cocamidopropyl betaine which is an ingredient in many personal care products including soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics.
DMAPA is commonly produced commercially via the reaction between dimethylamine and acrylonitrile to produce dimethylaminopropionitrile. A subsequent hydrogenation step yields DMAPA.
