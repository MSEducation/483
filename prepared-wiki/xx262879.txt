Run archery is a discipline connecting archery with running. It is similar to the sport of biathlon.

==History==

Run archery was developed during the 1990s by European archery associations.Journal of the German archery association "DBSV - Bogensport Info" 2008/2, Page 9 editor: Dieter Scheel Since 2000, some countries in other areas like Russia, Hungary, the NetherlandsOpen Dutch Run-Archery Championship 2012 and GermanyOpen German Run-Archery Championship 2012 in English have begun organizing annual national championships. Run archery was officially admitted as a discipline of the International Archery Federation in 2003.

==Rules==

Like in the sport of biathlon, participants start with running, and alternate between running and shooting series of three arrows at a target. For scoring, it does not matter whether the target is hit in the center or at the edge. For each missed shot the athlete must run a penalty loop. The number of laps and target sizes depend on age and bow type. At the end, the fastest athlete wins.
The bow must be held in hand during running; arrows can be left at the shooting range or may be carried in a back quiver.
