He then computes various sums and subtractions within the diagram, finding numbers related to the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and the sidereal periods of various planets. According to Klaus Klostermaier, "Subhash Kak, with his 'decoding of the Rigveda' has opened up an entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint."Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, Second Edition. State University of New York Press, 1995, pp. 129.
Kak's method depends on the structure of the Rigveda as redacted by Shakalya in the late Brahmana period as opposed to the intrinsic content in the oldest portions of the text. Specifically, Witzel (2001) believes that Kak's approach relates to the organizations of the Rigveda into mandalas ("books"), a process of redaction undertaken by the shakhas long after the composition of the individual hymns (the samhita prose period, dating to well within the Indian Iron Age), rendering the attempt to date the text in this flawed. Other scholars have discredited Kak's claims and methods. Nanda has said that Kak's "method is breathtakingly ad hoc and reads like numerology 101."[tpl]Cite book | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 978-0-8135-3358-2 | last = Nanda | first = Meera | title = Prophets facing backward: postmodern critiques of science and Hindu nationalism in India | year = 2003 | page = 112[/tpl]

===In Search of the Cradle of Civilization===

Kak co-authored In Search of the Cradle of Civilization (1995) participating in the controversy in Indian politics surrounding Indigenous Aryans and the Out of India theory.Edwin Bryant, The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Oxford University Press, 2001.

===Ashvamedha===

Kak's book The Asvamedha: The Rite and Its Logic (2002) provides an interpretation of the Vedic Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) rite.The Asvamedha: The Rite and Its Logic, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, (2002) ISBN 81-208-1877-6.

==Indian politics==

Kak takes a conservative stance politically, supporting Indian "nuclear deterrence" against China, opposing what he calls "socialist ideas" in the Indian constitution, the "Soviet-style ideas of the Congress party" and "terrorists from across the Pakistani border".2002 pbs.org interview http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/india/debate1.html http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/india/debate3.html

==Philosophy==

Kak claimed to be the first to have used the term "quantum neural computing",In Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, vol. 94, pp. 259-313, 1995 taking a Quantum mind position not unlike that notably proposed by Roger Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind which was published in 1989.
He sees the brain as a machine that reduces the infinite possibilities of a "quantum-like universal consciousness", which is a consequence of the "recursive nature of reality".Karl H. Pribram and Robert King (eds.), Learning and Self-Organization, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996, 185-219.
Kak's "philosophy of recursionism" is expounded in his books The Gods Within, The Architecture of Knowledge, and The Prajna Sutra. Kak contributes to the Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy and Culture.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
In The Architecture of Knowledge, Kak talks about  quantum mechanics, neuroscience, computers, and consciousness. The book is one of the twenty planned monographs in the multi-volume series on the Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy and Culture under the general editorship of Professor D. P. Chattopadhyaya.
The book provides philosophical connections to contemporary science that reach back not only to the Greek but also to the Indian tradition. 
The book seeks to find a consistent framework for knowledge in logic, purpose, and awareness, and sees science as representation and transformation of machines, of reality, and of life. Reality is seen in different layers, and

==Twin paradox==

In February 2007 a Louisiana State University (LSU) press releaseLSU professor resolves Einstein's twin paradox
asserted that Kak had "resolved the twin paradox".
The actual paperMoving Observers in an Isotropic Universe http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0605199, May 2006, published in International Journal of Theoretical Physics. states that the twin paradox has  "various 'resolutions' that are not in consonance with each other", while standard physics does not consider that such a paradox exists.
