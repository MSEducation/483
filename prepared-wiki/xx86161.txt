He first studied law and philosophy at the University of Berlin, but later studied painting and drawing in Weimar in 1869, in Paris in 1872, and in the Netherlands in 1876–77. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Liebermann served as a medic with the Order of St. John near Metz. After living and working for some time in Munich, he finally returned to Berlin in 1884, where he remained for the rest of his life.  He was married in 1884 to Martha Marckwald (1857–1943, see portrait by Anders Zorn).Martha Liebermann (Marckwald) geni.com. Retrieved October 30, 2011
He used his own inherited wealth to assemble an impressive collection of French Impressionist works. He later chose scenes of the bourgeoisie, as well as aspects of his garden near Lake Wannsee, as motifs for his paintings. In Berlin, he became a famous painter of portraits; his work is especially close in spirit to Édouard Manet. In his work he steered away from religious subject matter, with one cautionary exception being an early painting, The 12-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple With the Scholars (1879). His painting of a Semitic-looking boy Jesus conferring with Jewish scholars sparked debate.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times. At the International Art Show in Munich it stirred up a storm for its supposed blasphemy, with one critic describing Jesus as "the ugliest, most impertinent Jewish boy imaginable."Grace Glueck (March 20, 2006), A Berlin Painter, Jewish and Proudly Assimilated New York Times. Noted for his portraits (he did more than 200 commissioned ones over the years, including of Albert Einstein and Paul von Hindenburg), Liebermann also painted himself from time to time.Grace Glueck (March 20, 2006), A Berlin Painter, Jewish and Proudly Assimilated New York Times.
On the occasion of his 50th birthday, Liebermann was given a solo exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, and the following year he was elected to the academy.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times. From 1899 to 1911 he led the premier avant-garde formation in Germany, the Berlin Secession. In his various capacities as a leader in the artistic community, Liebermann spoke out often for the separation of art and politics. He did contribute regularly to a newspaper put out by artists during World War I.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times. He pushed for the right of artists to do their own thing, unconcerned with politics or ideology, and his interest in French Realism went against conservatives who viewed it as an offensive incursion.Grace Glueck (March 20, 2006), A Berlin Painter, Jewish and Proudly Assimilated New York Times. Beginning in 1920 he was president of the Prussian Academy of Arts. In 1933 he resigned when the academy decided to no longer exhibit works by Jewish artists, before he would have been forced to do so under laws restricting the rights of Jews.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times. While watching the Nazis celebrate their victory by marching through the Brandenburg Gate, Liebermann was reported to have commented: "Ich kann gar nicht soviel fressen, wie ich kotzen möchte." ("I cannot eat as much, as I would like to puke").Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times.
In 1909 Liebermann bought property in Wannsee, a wealthy suburb of summer homes on the outskirts of Berlin, and designed a villa with gardens there. From the 1910s until his death, images of the gardens dominated his work.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times. Together with Lovis Corinth and Max Slevogt, Liebermann became an exponent of German Impressionism.
On his 80th birthday, in 1927, Liebermann was celebrated with a large exhibition, declared an honorary citizen of Berlin and hailed in a cover story in Berlin's leading illustrated magazine.Leah Ollman (September 30, 2005), A dramatic life; the work, not quite so Los Angeles Times.
