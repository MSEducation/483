==Etymology==

The name "Rhayader" is corrupted from the Welsh "Rhaeadr Gwy", meaning Waterfall on the Wye. Little remains of the waterfall itself, it having been destroyed in 1780 to make way for the bridge linking the town to Cwmdauddwr and the Elan Valley - the Lakeland of Wales.

==History==

The oldest town in Mid Wales,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] the abundance of cairns and standing stones bears witness that man inhabited the area several thousand years BCE. Rhayader has always been a natural stopping point for travellers - the Romans had a stop-over camp in the Elan Valley, Monks travelled between the Abbeys of Strata Florida and Abbeycwmhir and drovers headed to the lucrative markets with their livestock. While Rhayader is known to date to the 5th Century,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhayader.co.uk/index.php/rhayader/aboutdetail/more_about_rhayader/ |title=About |publisher=Rhayader |date= |accessdate=2013-04-24[/tpl] it wasn't until the 12th Century that documented history of the town began with the building of a Castle in 1177. Little remains today, with the exception of a dry moat that can be seen from Wauncapel Park.
In the 19th Century, turnpike roads were only passable on payment of extortionate tolls, imposing additional burdens on already poor communities. This led to the Rebecca Riots across South and Mid Wales from 1839–1842, with no less than six of Rhayader's tollgates being demolished with impunity by local farmers dressed as women. The actions of these 'Rebeccaites' led to a Commission of Inquiry being set up, and most of Rebecca's grievances were righted two years later.http://history.powys.org.uk/school1/rhayader/origins.shtml
In the 1890s the rapidly expanding city of Birmingham, 70 miles east, viewed the nearby Elan Valley as the ideal source of clean, safe water. This was to change the face of Rhayader forever, bringing thousands of workers involved in building this massive complex of dams and reservoirs to the area. A new railway was built connecting this huge area with the main network in Rhayader, and the construction of a new village to house the workers was built on the banks of the River Elan. Work started in 1894 and the scheme was officially opened in 1904 by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.http://history.powys.org.uk/school1/rhayader/elanmenu.shtml

==Transport==

The station on the Mid Wales Railway line that served the town was closed under the 'Beeching Axe' programme of modernisation on 31 December 1962. (?Beeching was not published until 1963?) The nearest station is now at Crossgates on the Heart of Wales Line, though connections are usually made at the more accessible Llandrindod railway station a similar distance away.
An extensive bus service connects with outlying villages and neighbouring towns, with two-hourly daytime departures to Builth Wells, Llandrindod Wells, Aberystwyth and Newtown, with connections to Hereford, Shrewsbury, Cardiff and further afield.
Due to the volume of traffic generated by the convergence of two of Wales's most important trunk roads, the construction of a bypass to relieve congestion at the town centre crossroads has been an ongoing debate for many years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/2006/10/16/trade-fears-over-bypass |title=Shropshire Star |publisher=Shropshire Star |date= |accessdate=2013-04-24[/tpl]
The town is also a popular cycling centre and is on Route 8 of the United Kingdom National Cycle Network - Lôn Las Cymru.

==Sport==

Rhayader Town F.C., despite previously having some success in the League of Wales - the top-tier of domestic Welsh football between 1997 and 2002, ceased to exist in the summer of 2006. The club has since reformed, and in its inaugural season gained promotion into the Spar Mid Wales League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.countytimes.co.uk/sport/Rhayader-Town-secure-promotion-to.4041094.jp|title=Rhayader Town secure promotion to Spar|publisher=County Times |date=1 May 2008[/tpl] A subsequent promotion to the Cymru Alliance followed, but a finishing position of 15th saw the team relegated after just one season. The town's rugby union team play in the Cambrian Training Mid Wales League. There is also a cricket club and thriving local darts, dominos and pool leagues.
The town is also well known by motocross fans. Every summer a series of events take place at the nearby Cwmythig Hill circuit, with many of Britain's top riders taking part. The race series regularly attracts over 5,000 spectators.
As part of the annual carnival celebrations, Rhayader also plays host to a number of World Championship events in lesser celebrated sports, including wheelbarrow racing and rock-paper-scissors.
