==History==

Founded by Michael E. Fisher and Wayne Ison in the early 1980s as Lite Flite Inc, Aero Visions and later Fisher Aero Corporation, ownership of Fisher Flying Products was later passed to Gene and Darlene Jackson-Hanson in 1984. The company was originally based in South Webster, Ohio and later Edgeley, North Dakota, USA. In 2007 the Jackson-Hansons decided to sell the company and retire.Taylor, John WR: Janes All the Worlds Aircraft 1986-87 Page 662, Janes Publishing Company, 1986. ISBN 0-7106-0835-7
The company was purchased by Paul Riedlingerand moved to Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada. By early 2009 the new owner had re-established the manufacturing operation and commenced producing kits, starting with the Dakota Hawk and the FP-202. By late 2009 all kits were once again available.

The first two designs the company built were the Fisher Flyer, which incorporated a new fuselage and tail and the existing wings from the UFM Easy Riser hang glider and the Fisher Barnstormer, a negative stagger biplane. Plans and kits for the latter design were offered in the early 1980s.Taylor, John WR: Janes All the Worlds Aircraft 1982-83 page 642, Janes Publishing Company, 1982. ISBN 0-7106-0748-2
