The Cherokee Southwest Township (CSWT) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is a large group of Cherokee families from the Cherokee Nation.
The township incorporated under the Cherokee Nation as a Cherokee Township for Cherokee Nation citizens who migrated to New Mexico during the Oklahoma dust bowl in the 1930s. All of the township members originated in Eastern Oklahoma and migrated to New Mexico and are members of either the Cherokee Nation or United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. The township has monthly meetings and hosts Cherokee language and history classes. The Albuquerque Cherokee Township has a significant number of native Cherokee speakers.  Principal chief Chad "Corntassel" Smith visits the township four times per year.
