Meridian owns and operates a single turbine in Wellington, the Brooklyn turbine and has another wind farm under construction outside Wellington, Mill Creek.

==History==

Meridian originated from the breakup of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) in 1999 as a result of the reforms of the New Zealand electricity market. Meridian's share of ECNZ was corporatised as a state-owned enterprise with its own board of directors and with two Ministerial shareholders: the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. In 2013 it was partially privatised by the fifth National Government of New Zealand.Meridian to be listed in October. 3 News NZ. 16 September 2013.

==Carbon footprint==

In 2006, Greenpeace judged Meridian as the only "green" electricity company in New Zealand. In 2007, Meridian announced that it had received CarboNZero certification from Landcare Research confirming that the generation and retailing of its electricity was carbon neutral.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=EC136p7b.pdf|title=New Zealand to be carbon neutral by 2020|work=Ecos 7|date=April–May 2007|pages=136|accessdate=2007-11-26[/tpl]
In June 2008, National's Climate Change spokesman Nick Smith complained to the Commerce Commission that Meridian's claim of carbon neutrality in its advertising was misleading as Smith considered that Meridian has to buy thermally generated power during dry years to supply its customers. A spokesman for Meridian said they stood by the validity of the certification of their carbon-neutral status. In July 2009, the Commerce Commission concluded that Meridian's statements of carbon neutrality were not misleading.
