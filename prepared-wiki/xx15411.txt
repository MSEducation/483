Alfred Charles Kinsey (June 23, 1894 – August 25, 1956) was an American biologist, professor of entomology and zoology, and sexologist who in 1947 founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/origins.html|title=Origin of the Institute |accessdate=2010-03-30|publisher=The Kinsey Institute[/tpl] now known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. He is best known for writing Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), also known as the Kinsey Reports, as well as the Kinsey scale. Kinsey's research on human sexuality, foundational to the field of sexology, provoked controversy in the 1940s and 1950s. His work has influenced social and cultural values in the United States, as well as internationally.

==Early life and education==

Kinsey was born on June 23, 1894, in Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Sarah Ann (née Charles) and Alfred Seguine Kinsey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/timeline/index.html |title=American Experience | Kinsey | Timeline |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl] Kinsey was the eldest of three children. His mother received little formal education; his father was a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology.
Kinsey's parents were poor for most of his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey receiving inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including rickets, rheumatic fever, and typhoid fever. His health records indicate that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (often the cause of rickets, before milk and other foods were fortified with vitamin D) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being drafted in 1917 for World War I.
Kinsey's parents were devout Christians. His father was known as one of the most devout members of the local Methodist church. Most of Kinsey's social interactions were with other members of the church, often as a silent observer, while his parents discussed religion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html |title=American Experience | Kinsey | People & Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04[/tpl] Kinsey's father imposed strict rules on the household, including mandating Sunday as a day of prayer and little else.
At the age of 10, he moved with his family to South Orange, New Jersey.
At a young age, Kinsey showed great interest in nature and camping. He worked and camped with the local YMCA throughout his early years. He enjoyed these activities to such an extent that he intended to work professionally for the YMCA after completing his education. Kinsey's senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the group dynamics of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the Boy Scouts when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization that was based on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn Eagle Scout in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html |title=Alfred Charles Kinsey (1894-1956) |accessdate=2006-11-09 |work=American Experience: Kinsey |publisher=PBS| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061221010804/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html| archivedate= 21 December 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.
In high school, Kinsey was a quiet but hard-working student. While attending Columbia High School, he devoted his energy to academic work and playing the piano. At one time, Kinsey had hoped to become a concert pianist, but decided to concentrate on his scientific pursuits instead. Kinsey's ability to spend immense amounts of time deeply focused on study was a trait that would serve him well in college and during his professional career. He seems not to have formed strong social relationships during high school, but earned respect for his academic ability. While there, Kinsey became interested in biology, botany and zoology. Kinsey was later to claim that his high school biology teacher, Natalie Roeth, was the most important influence on his decision to become a scientist. Kinsey approached his father with plans to study botany at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology instead. Kinsey was unhappy at Stevens, and later remarked that his time there was one of the most wasteful periods of his life.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Regardless, he resumed his commitment to study. At Stevens, he primarily took courses related to English and engineering, but was unable to satisfy his interest in biology. At the end of two years at Stevens, Kinsey gathered the courage to confront his father about his interest in biology and his intent to continue studying at Bowdoin College in Maine.
In the fall of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he studied entomology under Manton Copeland, and was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Weinberg |first=Martin S. |year=1976 |title=Sex Research: Studies from the Kinsey Institute |page=25 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= |postscript=[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last=Gathorne-Hardy |first=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Sex, the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C.

He continued his graduate studies at Harvard University's Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under William Morton Wheeler, a scientist who made outstanding contributions to entomology. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.
Kinsey chose to do his doctoral thesis on gall wasps, and began zealously collecting samples of the species. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements of hundreds of thousands of gall wasps; his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. Kinsey was granted a Sc.D. degree in 1919 by Harvard University, and published several papers in 1920 under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, introducing the gall wasp to the scientific community and describing its phylogeny. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum's collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Yudell |first=Michael |title=Kinsey's Other Report |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_6_108/ai_55127889 |journal=Natural History |issn=0028-0712 |date=July 1, 1999 |volume=108 |issue=6| postscript=[/tpl]

==Personal life==

===Marriage and family===

Kinsey married Clara Bracken McMillen in 1921, whose ceremony, like his college graduation, was also avoided by Alfred Sr. They had four children. Their first-born, Donald, died from the acute complications of juvenile diabetes in 1927, just before his fifth birthday. His daughter, Anne, was born in 1924, followed by Joan in 1925, and Bruce in 1928.
Kinsey was bisexual.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6hw1X-f6L8kC&pg=PA48&dq=%22kinsey+was+bisexual%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z7azUN3GI7O80QGpuICICA&ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22kinsey%20was%20bisexual%22&f=false |title=Look Both Ways: Bisexual Politics - Jennifer Baumgardner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04[/tpl] He and his wife agreed that both could sleep with other people as well as with each other.

There he practiced his deep interest in gardening.Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory.  City of Bloomington Interim Report. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04, 90.

==Sexology==

===The Kinsey Reports===

Kinsey is widely regarded as the first major figure in American sexology; his research is cited as having paved the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, and as having liberated female sexuality.[tpl]cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =1592131514 |isbn= 978-1592131518|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37–43|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=&f=false|author=Janice M. Irvine[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =Cengage Learning|year= 2007|pages=227–228|accessdate = March 15, 2014| isbn = 0495095109 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U7YkU4f6J4iI2gX864HYCQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl] For example, Kinsey's work disputed the notions that women generally are not sexual and that female orgasms experienced vaginally are superior to clitoral orgasms. He initially became interested in different forms of sexual practices in 1933, after discussing the topic extensively with a colleague, Robert Kroc. Kinsey had been studying the variations in mating practices among gall wasps. During this time, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the Kinsey scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual and 6 is exclusively homosexual; a rating of X for "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions" was later added.
In 1935, Kinsey delivered a lecture to a faculty discussion group at Indiana University, his first public discussion of the topic, wherein he attacked the "widespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology" and promoted his view that "delayed marriage" (that is, delayed sexual experience) was psychologically harmful. Kinsey obtained research funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to further study human sexual behavior. He published Sexual Behavior in the Human Male in 1948, followed in 1953 by Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, both of which reached the top of the bestseller lists and turned Kinsey into a celebrity. These publications later became known as the Kinsey Reports. Articles about him appeared in magazines such as Time, Life, Look, and McCall's. The Kinsey Reports, which led to a storm of controversy, are regarded by many as a precursor to the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.

===Controversial aspects===

Kinsey's research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. The data published in the Kinsey Reports as his Sexual Behavior books is controversial in the scientific and psychiatric communities due to the low amount of research that was done and Kinsey's decision to sexually experiment with volunteers who may not have been representative of the general population.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/50-years-after-the-kinsey-report/|title=50 Years After The Kinsey Report|author=Boothe Cosgrove-Mather|publisher=Associated Press, CBS News|date=January 27, 2003|accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl] Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participant's responses.[tpl]cite journal|first=Vern L.|last=Bullough|title=Book Review "Alfred C.

Kinsey collected sexual material from around the world, which brought him to the attention of U.S. Customs when they seized some pornographic films in 1956; he died before this matter was resolved legally.
Kinsey wrote about pre-adolescent orgasms using data in tables 30 to 34 of the male volume, which report observations of orgasms in over three-hundred children between the ages of five months and fourteen years.[tpl]cite book|title= Sexual Behavior in the Human Male  |last= Kinsey|first= Alfred Charles|author2=Clyde Eugene Mart|year= 1998 (reprint of 1948 original)|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=178–180 |isbn= 0-253-33412-8[/tpl] This information was said to have come from adults' childhood memories, or from parent or teacher observation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/controversy%202.htm |title=Kinsey Institute statement denies child abuse in study |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04[/tpl] Kinsey said he also interviewed nine men who had sexual experiences with children, and who told him about the children's responses and reactions.  Little attention was paid to this part of Kinsey's research at the time, but where Kinsey had gained this information began to be questioned nearly 40 years later.[tpl]cite news | last = Brown| first = Mick | title = The bedroom and beyond | publisher = Telegraph magazine | date = November 2004 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/12/1100227565498.html | accessdate = 2009-12-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091202074932/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/12/1100227565498.html| archivedate= 2 December 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  It was later revealed that Kinsey used data from a single pedophile and presented it as being from various sources.

Jones wrote that Kinsey's sexual activity influenced his work, that he over-represented prisoners and prostitutes, classified some single people as "married",Jones, James H. (1997). Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life. New York: Norton. and that he included a disproportionate number of homosexual men, which may have distorted his studies. While he has been criticized for omitting African-Americans from his research,[tpl]cite journal|last = Reumann|first = Miriam|title = American Sexual Character: Sex, Gender, and National Identity in the Kinsey Reports|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume = 36|issue = 5|page = 294|publisher = Springer Netherlands|location = University of California Press, Berkeley|year = 2005[/tpl] his report on the human male includes numerous references to African American Participants.[tpl]page = 24[/tpl]  Historian Vern Bullough explains that the data was later reinterpreted, excluding prisoners and data derived from an exclusively gay sample, and the results indicate that it does not appear to have skewed the data. Kinsey may have over-represented homosexuals, but Bullough considers that this may have been because homosexual behavior was stigmatized and needed to be better understood.  It was Paul Gebhard, in the 1970s, who removed all suspect data, and recalculated Kinsey's findings. He found only slight differences between the original and updated figures.Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathan (2005). Kinsey: A Biography, p 285. London: Pimlico

==In the media==

The popularity of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male prompted widespread media interest in 1948. Time magazine declared, "Not since Gone With the Wind had booksellers seen anything like it."[tpl]cite news | date = 1948-03-01 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794270,00.html| title = How to Stop Gin Rummy| work = Time | accessdate = 2007-09-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017155052/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794270,00.html| archivedate= 17 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The first pop culture references to Kinsey appeared not long after the book's publication; Martha Raye sold a half-million copies of 'Ooh, Dr. Kinsey!'"[tpl]cite news | date = 2004-12-12 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/arts/12rich.html?ex=1260334800&en=0297f1d1dff963fa&ei=5088| title = The Plot Against Sex in America| work = New York Times | accessdate = 2007-09-11 | first=Frank | last=Rich[/tpl] Cole Porter's song "Too Darn Hot", from the Tony Award–winning Broadway musical Kiss Me, Kate, devoted its bridge to an analysis of the Kinsey report and the "average man's favorite sport." In 1949 Mae West, reminiscing on the days when the word "sex" was rarely uttered, said of Kinsey, "That guy merely makes it easy for me.

Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word."  That same year, Kinsey appeared as a character in an episode of the Jack Benny TV program (September 15, 1953), in which he and his research were written into a sketch about Benny's 'fantasy' about Marilyn Monroe, a guest on the program.[tpl]cite web|title=The Jack Benny Show from September 15, 1953|url=http://archive.org/details/Jack_Benny_09_15_1953 |publisher=Archive.org[/tpl]

==Death==

Kinsey died on August 25, 1956, at the age of 62. The cause of death was reported to be a heart ailment and pneumonia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/kinsey.html|title=Dr. Kinsey is Dead; Sex Researcher, 62|work=New York Times|date=1956-08-26[/tpl] The New York Times ran the following editorial on August 27, 1956:
[tpl]quote|The untimely death of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey takes from the American scene an important and valuable, as well as controversial, figure. Whatever may have been the reaction to his findings—and to the unscrupulous use of some of them—the fact remains that he was first, last, and always a scientist.  In the long run it is probable that the values of his contribution to contemporary thought will lie much less in what he found out than in the method he used and his way of applying it.  Any sort of scientific approach to the problems of sex is difficult because the field is so deeply overlaid with such things as moral precept, taboo, individual and group training, and long established behavior patterns.  Some of these may be good in themselves, but they are no help to the scientific and empirical method of getting at the truth. Dr. Kinsey cut through this overlay with detachment and precision.  His work was conscientious and comprehensive.  Naturally, it will receive a serious setback with his death.  Let us earnestly hope that the scientific spirit that inspired it will not be similarly impaired.Quoted in Pomeroy (1972).[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06E2D9103EE333A05754C2A96E9C946792D6CF&ref=alfredckinsey|title=Dr. Kinsey|work=New York Times|date=1956-08-27[/tpl][/tpl]

==Legacy in popular culture==

After the publication of Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, a character called "Dr. Kinsey" appeared on the September 15, 1953 television episode of The Jack Benny Program as a bow-tied man interviewing a young woman on board a cruise ship that has left Hawaii.  When "Dr. Kinsey" identifies himself to Jack Benny, Benny steps away in embarrassment.[tpl]cite web|title=The Jack Benny Show from September 15, 1953|url=http://www.archive.org/details/Jack_Benny_09_15_1953|accessdate=6 November 2011[/tpl]
The early 2000s saw a renewed interest in Kinsey. In 2003 Theatre of NOTE produced the Steve Morgan Haskell play titled Fucking Wasps which followed Kinsey's life from childhood until death.  Matt Sesow's paintings adorned the theatre along with David Bickford playing piano live.  Written and directed by Steve Morgan Haskell,  Fucking Wasps received many accolades, including a Playwriting of the Year nomination from Backstage West.  Premiering in 2003, the musical Dr. Sex focuses on the relationship between Kinsey, his wife, and their shared lover Wally Matthews (based on Clyde Martin).
