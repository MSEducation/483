==Plot summary==

The protagonist is a Boston aristocrat who is captured by a Native American tribe.  Initially enslaved, he comes to respect his captors' culture and gains their respect. He joins the tribe by showing his bravery and, later, gets back his dignity by marrying his owner's daughter, killing rival Indians and taking their horses.  Taking the native name "Horse" (he was treated as a horse), he becomes a respected member of the tribe.
