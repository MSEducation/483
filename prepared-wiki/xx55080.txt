The Perfect General is a turn-based tactics game designed by Mark Baldwin and published in 1991 by Quantum Quality Productions for the Amiga and DOS. A sequel, The Perfect General II, was released in 1994. A refurbished version of the original is available for Windows since 2003. 
The game is a turn-based map-oriented military simulation game. Along with Modem Wars and Populous, it was one of the early successful commercial games ever offering an online mode to be used for real-time-matches via telecommunication networks. The original online-game was played via modem or null modem serial connection.
The rights for the original version were purchased by Mark Kinkead in 2002, and later released in 2003 as "The Perfect General Internet Edition" by Killer Bee Software. As the name suggests, this version can be played via Internet.
