Nykolai Aleksander was born in 1978 in Germany but in the 1990s emigrated to England. In 2001 she and Andrew E. Maugham worked on a book called Convivium which by 2002, with the help of new technology called  Wacom, gave her an idea to establish herself as a digital media artist. Throughout early 2000s she worked for the Ballistic Publishing company to which she donated her CGI drawings. She also did illustrations for the Digital Art Masters and Focal Press and even for  magazines by using such programs as 2Dartist, Photoshop, Fantasy Art China, and INTEL Visual Adrenaline. She was awarded by the 3DTotal,  CGSociety, GFX Artist, and even got a Stellar Art Award from the Digital Arts California and CG Excellence Award on the 2009 CG Overdrive Expo in Singapore.
