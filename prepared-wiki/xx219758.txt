==Background==

Barangay Batasan Hills is a portion of Barangay Matandang Balara separated and constituted into a new barangay thru the initiative of Ben Morales/President- Filinvest 1 Homeowners association, Melvin Morallos/Chairman-Tanggol Karapatan Dist.II/August Twenty One Movement and Manolo Taroy/Congressional Staff of Congressman Alberto of Catanduanes who sponsored the bill for the creation of Barangay Batasan Hills, and by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 343 - An Act Creating Barangay Batasan Hills in Quezon City, Metropolitan Manila on February 25, 1983. Section 2 of the act specified the area of the new barangay:
A plebiscite was conducted and ratified by the majority of the votes casts by the residents. In 1986, after the People Power Revolution and 3 years after the approval of Batas Pambansa Blg. 343, the first set of barangay officials were appointed by President Corazon C. Aquino through the (then) Secretary of Interior and Local Government Aquilino Pimentel. Manuel D. Laxina was the first appointed Barangay Chairman, along with 6 Barangay Kagawads (Barangay Counselors).
The barangay was envisioned to be the new home of the National Government Center, an area housing the three branches of the Philippine government (legislative, executive and judicial), because Quezon City was declared the capital of the country in 1948. This government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now Quezon Memorial Circle, before it was moved north to the area of what is now Batasan Hills. Even as the Batasang Pambansa Complex was being completed, the capital of the country was transferred to Manila in 1976. Before its creation as a barangay, the area was called "Constitution Hill", referring to the hilly area on where the government center was supposed to rise.
Today, most of Batasan Hills is residential. Although it has one of the largest urban poor populations in the country, it is also home to middle and upper class real estate properties like Filinvest 1 and 2, Northview 1 and 2, and Treviso which were developed by real estate firm Filinvest Land.Filinvest 2 Website Other middle and upper class real estate properties include Vista Real Executive Village and Vista Real Classica Subdivision.

Also, the road has a tunnel which connects the southbound side of the road to Commonwealth Avenue. The third major route is the Batasan-San Mateo Road which connects the barangay to the town of San Mateo, Rizal where the Batasan-San Mateo Bridge in the Marikina River connects the two areas. There are smaller roads like Filinvest 2 Road which connects with the Batasan-San Mateo Road, and the Filinvest 1 Road which connects with Batasan Road.
Future MRT line
Currently there are no train lines along Commonwealth Avenue, traversing through the barangay. But there are plans to build one along the highway via the MRT 7 which will begin construction in 2010 or 2011. This MRT line starts from Quirino Highway in San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan through parts of Northern Caloocan and Quezon City through Commonwealth Avenue, and will end at North Avenue to connect with the MRT 3 line. This is expected to decongest traffic on the avenue.
