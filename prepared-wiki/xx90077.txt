There is no middle ground."

==Plot summary==

A Game of Thrones follows three principal storylines simultaneously.

===In the Seven Kingdoms===

Eddard Stark—known to his intimates as Ned—is the Lord of Winterfell. On behalf of the Seven Kingdoms, he must condemn and execute a deserter from the Night's Watch, and takes his sons along as witnesses. On the return journey to Winterfell, Eddard's sons discover six direwolf pups, which are entrusted to Eddard's five legitimate children and his bastard, Jon Snow. (The direwolf, the sigil of House Stark, is integral to the Stark family tradition.) Following the death of Lord Jon Arryn, previous "Hand of the King" (the highest advisor to the king), King Robert Baratheon asks Eddard to become the new Hand. Eddard agrees, and at the same time promises his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark, to investigate Arryn's death; Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister and Lord Arryn's widow, having suggested that Arryn may have been the victim of poison and political intrigue by King Robert's wife, Queen Cersei, and her powerful family of House Lannister.
Before the Starks leave for King's Landing in the South, Eddard's young son Bran Stark witnesses Cersei committing incest with her twin brother Jaime Lannister, who flings Bran from a tower to conceal the secret. Bran survives, but enters a coma. During his recuperation, an assassin attempts to murder him, only to encounter Catelyn; whereupon Bran's direwolf kills the assassin. Catelyn, on grounds that only dire intrigue would necessitate killing a comatose child, visits King's Landing, the capital city incognito to warn Eddard, leaving the eldest son Robb Stark to rule Winterfell. Not long after Catelyn's departure, Bran awakens from his coma as a paraplegic, with no memory of Jaime's role in his fall. He remains at Winterfell with his older brother Robb and younger brother Rickon. 
Meanwhile, Lord Eddard travels to King's Landing, taking his daughters Sansa and Arya. There, Sansa is betrothed to King Robert's son Joffrey, the heir apparent. Joffrey takes Sansa out for a picnic, while the Arya plays with her friend Mycah, the son of a butcher. When Joffrey sees Mycah fencing with a stick, he brandishes his own iron sword, whereupon Arya and her dire wolf injure Joffrey. Before his parents, Joffrey claims that Mycah and the direwolf attacked him unprovoked, while Arya tells the true events and Sansa refuses to side with either. King Robert attempts to gloss the incident; but Queen Cersei sends Joffrey's guard, Sandor Clegane, to kill Mycah, and decrees that Sansa's innocent direwolf must be killed in place of Arya's, which Arya has chased away.
At King's Landing, Eddard assumes the rule, while Robert gives his time to sensual pleasures and has little interest in governance. Eddard discovers that the king has let the royal treasury grow dangerously in debt, largely to the Lannisters. Ned meets the King's closest advisors: Lord Varys, an enigmatic eunuch; Grand Maester Pycelle, an elderly scholar; and Petyr Baelish, known as Littlefinger, a scheming petty lord who has become "Master of Coin" or Treasurer to the King, and a former suitor of Catelyn's.
Upon Catelyn's arrival in King's Landing, she is brought to Petyr Baelish, who identifies Tyrion Lannister, the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, as the owner of the dagger used against Bran. Returning to Winterfell, Catelyn captures Tyrion and takes him to her sister, Lady Lysa Arryn. There, Tyrion demands trial by combat and regains his freedom when his champion, hired-sword Bronn, wins the duel. In retaliation for Tyrion's abduction, Tyrion's father, Lord Tywin Lannister, wages war. He is soon joined by Jaime, who angrily confronts Eddard in King's Landing, killing a number of his men and crippling Eddard. 
Thereafter Eddard learns, as the murdered Jon Arryn had learned before him, that Robert's legal heirs are Jaime Lannister's children by his sister. He confronts Cersei and offers her a chance to escape before he tells Robert the truth; but Eddard withholds the revelation when Robert is mortally wounded in a hunt. As Robert lies dying, his youngest brother Renly suggests to Eddard that they should take control of the throne before the Lannisters can act. Eddard refuses, and Renly flees Kings Landing with the loyal House Baratheon guards. Eddard recruits Littlefinger to have the city guards arrest and charge Cersei, but is betrayed by him, resulting in Eddard's arrest, the death of all of his men, and Sansa's capture. The Lannisters attempt to capture Arya as well, but she flees the castle after her fencing master, Syrio Forel, the ex-First Sword of Braavos, intervenes.
With Eddard imprisoned, Cersei and Jaime's eldest son, Joffrey, is crowned as Robert's heir and King of the Seven Kingdoms. Eddard is persuaded by Varys to swear fealty to Joffrey in exchange for Sansa's life and his own; but Joffrey orders his execution, and Lord Eddard is beheaded in full view of his daughter Sansa. Yoren of the Night's Watch then removes Arya from King's Landing, with the intention of delivering her to Winterfell on his journey north. 
As news of Eddard's arrest spreads across the Seven Kingdoms, a civil war erupts. Robb, now Lord of Winterfell, masses an army of northmen and marches south, joining with Catelyn, to rescue his father and sisters; but upon learning of Eddard's death, goes instead to raise support from his maternal grandfather, Lord Hoster Tully. To reach Riverrun, he agrees to a marriage pact with House Frey. At Riverrun, Jaime Lannister is laying siege, while holding Lord Hoster's heir, Edmure Tully, as hostage. Upon hearing of Robb's march, Lord Tywin also advances his army to meet Robb's. In a bold move, Robb covertly detaches his cavalry towards Riverrun, while his infantry, under Lord Roose Bolton, engages Tywin's army. Tywin, joined by the now-liberated Tyrion, who has massed his own army of mountain clansmen, defeats Bolton's host, only to discover too late that they were a decoy. Robb's forces then take Jaime's army by surprise during the night, capturing Jaime himself. Jaime's host is scattered and Edmure Tully is liberated, joining the houses of the Riverlands to Robb's army. During "The Battle of the Whispering Wood" Jaime slays two of Lord Rickard Karstark's sons. Tywin pulls his armies to the castle of Harrenhal to regroup, while sending Tyrion to King's Landing as Hand of the King in his stead, ordering Tyrion to stop the young king from mistakes.
While Lord Stannis Baratheon is the next rightful heir, Lord Renly Baratheon of Storm's End—the youngest brother of King Robert and Lord Stannis—campaigns for the Throne, and wins the support of House Tyrell by wedding Lord Mace Tyrell's daughter, Margaery Tyrell. Declaring himself king, Renly masses a host of 100,000, and marches on King's Landing. After extended discussion, the House Stark bannermen and the House Tully bannermen proclaim Robb "King in the North", a title long abandoned after the last King in the North swore fealty to House Targaryen some 300 years earlier.

===On the Wall===

The Prologue of the novel introduces the Wall, an ancient 700-foot-high (200 m), 300-mile-long (480 km) barrier of ice, stone, and magic, shielding the Seven Kingdoms from a Northern wilderness full of dangers. The Wall is manned by the order of the Night's Watch: a set of warriors sworn to serve on the Wall for life, foregoing marriage, titles, property and children, and they wear clothing dyed only in black. North of the Wall, a small patrol of Rangers from the Night's Watch encounter the Others, an ancient and evil race of beings thought to be long extinct and mythological. All the Rangers are killed except a single survivor (who flees south, becoming the deserter whom Ned executes at the beginning of the Stark's story). Jon Snow, the bastard son of Lord Eddard, is inspired by his uncle, Benjen Stark, to join the Night's Watch; but becomes disillusioned when he discovers that it is little more than a penal colony meant to keep "wildlings" (human tribesmen in relative anarchy north of the Wall) in check.
At the Wall, Jon unites the recruits against their harsh instructor, and protects the cowardly but good-natured and intelligent Samwell Tarly. Jon hopes that his combat skills will earn him assignment to the Rangers, the military arm of the Night's Watch; but is assigned as steward to the Lord Commander of the Watch, Jeor Mormont, nicknamed "the Old Bear". He is angered until Samwell suggests that Lord Mormont is keeping Jon to take command, and makes Samwell steward to elderly Maester Aemon, one of the last of the deposed ruling family. Meanwhile, Benjen Stark leads a small party of Rangers beyond the Wall but fails to return.  Nearly six months later, the dead bodies of two of the Rangers from Benjen's party are recovered from beyond the Wall, and their corpses re-animate as wights, which kill six men while Jon and his direwolf, Ghost, save Lord Commander Mormont, who presents Jon with the Valyrian-steel bastard sword "Longclaw", an heirloom of the Lord Commander's House Mormont, but replaces the existing bear pommel with a pommel in the shape of a white direwolf's head, representing both House Stark and Jon's albino direwolf.
When word of his father's execution reaches Jon, he attempts to join his half-brother Robb against the Lannisters, but is recovered by his comrades and persuaded by Mormont. With Jon's loyalty secured, Mormont declares his intention to lead a massive ranging north of the Wall, to find Benjen Stark—dead or alive—as well as to investigate the disappearance of many wildlings and the dark rumors circling the King-Beyond-the-Wall, a deserter from the Night's Watch known as Mance Rayder.

===In the East===

In the Free City of Pentos, Viserys Targaryen, the only surviving male heir of Aerys II of House Targaryen, "the Mad King" overthrown by Robert Baratheon, betroths his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo, a warlord of the nomadic Dothraki, in exchange for use of Drogo's army to reclaim the Westeros Iron Throne for House Targaryen.  The wealthy merchant, Magister Illyrio, hosting Viserys and Daenerys, gives a wedding gift to Daenerys of three petrified dragon eggs; and Ser Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled from Westeros, joins Viserys as an advisor. When Drogo shows little interest in conquering Westeros, Viserys initially tries to browbeat his sister into coercing Drogo; but Daenerys, emboldened by her position, refuses to be bullied. Initially, Drogo endures Viserys and punishes his outbursts with public humiliation; but when Viserys publicly threatens the pregnant Daenerys, Drogo executes him by pouring a pot of molten gold on his head, ironically giving him the "golden crown" he had been promised in return for Daenerys. As the last Targaryen, Daenerys takes up her brother's quest to reclaim the Iron Throne of Westeros.
An assassin seeking King Robert's favor unsuccessfully attempts to poison Daenerys and her unborn child; whereupon Drogo agrees to seek revenge. While sacking villages to fund the invasion, Drogo is wounded. The wound festers and Daenerys commands a captive maegi (magician) to save him; but the maegi sacrifices Daenerys' unborn child to power the spell, which reclaims Drogo's life but leaves him in a vegetative state. As the Dothraki horde departs to follow a new leader, Daenerys smothers Drogo, orders the maegi tied to Drogo's funeral pyre, places her three dragon eggs on the pyre, and having entered the pyre herself, emerges unscathed with three newly hatched dragons nursing at her breasts. The remaining Dothraki and Ser Jorah swear their allegiance to her as "The Mother of Dragons".

==Reception==

A Game of Thrones has received much critical acclaim. Lauren K. Nathan of the Associated Press wrote that the book "grips the reader from Page One" and is set in a "magnificent" fantasy world that is "mystical, but still believable."[tpl]cite news|title=`Game of Thrones' fit for a king|last=Nathan|first=Lauren K.|agency=The Associated Press|date=November 10, 1996[/tpl] Steve Perry told readers of The Oregonian that the plot is "complex and fascinating" and the book is "rich and colorful" with "all the elements of a great fantasy novel".[tpl]cite news|last=Perry|first=Steve|title=Writer leaves TV to create epic fantasy|work=The Oregonian|date=October 13, 1996[/tpl] Writing in The Washington Post, John H.
