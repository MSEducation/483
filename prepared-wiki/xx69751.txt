==Sports==

As with previous Paralympics, the 1972 games were intended for wheelchair athletes only. However, demonstration events such as goalball and a 100 m sprint for the visually impaired allowed visually impaired competitors to participate for the first time.[tpl]cite web |title=Heidelberg 1972 |publisher=International Paralympic Committee |date=2008 |url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/Past_Games/Heidelberg_1972/ |accessdate=2011-07-12 [/tpl]

South Africa was competing at the Paralympics for the third time. Although banned from the Olympic Games due to its policy of apartheid, it was not banned from the Paralympics until 1980, and West Germany, as host country, did not object to its participation."'The Netherlands against Apartheid' - 1970s", International Institute of Social History South Africa at the Paralympics, International Paralympic Committee
Rhodesia competed for the last time. Its invitation to take part in the 1972 Summer Olympics was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee four days before the opening ceremony, in response to African countries' protests against the Rhodesian government. But as the Paralympics that year were held before the Olympics (and independently from them), Rhodesia was able to take part in the 1972 Paralympic Games."1972: Rhodesia out of Olympics", BBC "Rhodesia expelled", Montreal Gazette, August 23, 1972
