Brigantine Island (also known as Brigantine Beach Island) is a 6 mile long (9.7 km) island off the Atlantic Ocean coast of New Jersey, located northeast of Atlantic City. The resort community of Brigantine is located on the island.
The island is accessible via Route 87, which terminates at the end of the Brigantine Bridge, after crossing the Absecon Channel.  After crossing the channel, the road's designation changes to County Route 638 (Brigantine Boulevard).
The Brigantine Lighthouse is a lighthouse on Brigantine Island. It was built in 1926 by the Island Development Real Estate Company to attract people to Brigantine Island and not as an operating lighthouse, somewhat like Lucy the Elephant to the south.
