Manchester Cricket Club was founded in 1816 in Manchester, England and was a forerunner of the modern Lancashire County Cricket Club, founded in 1864. Manchester played first-class cricket from 1844 to 1858.

==History==

Cricket may not have reached Lancashire until the 18th century. The earliest known reference to cricket being played in Lancashire is in 1781.Bowen, p.266. In 1816, Manchester Cricket Club was founded and soon became representative of Lancashire as a county in the same way that Sheffield Cricket Club and Nottingham Cricket Club represented Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
Manchester played mostly against opponents from the north of England.  Of these, thirteen that were played between July 1844 and September 1858 are regarded as having first-class status: ten against Sheffield, who in three of these games were called Yorkshire; and one apiece against Surrey, Sussex and MCC. On 23, 24 & 25 July 1849, the Sheffield and Manchester clubs played each other at Hyde Park Ground, Sheffield but the fixture was called Yorkshire versus Lancashire. As such, it was the first match to involve a Lancashire county team and also, therefore, the first "Roses Match".  Yorkshire won by 5 wickets.
A noted Manchester player was John Sherman.  On 27 July 1852, he made his final first-class appearance for Manchester versus Sheffield at the Hyde Park Ground in Sheffield.  His career had spanned 44 seasons from his debut at Lord's Old Ground on 20 September 1809 when he played for Beauclerk's XI versus Ladbroke's XI. His was the longest first-class career span, equalled only by W. G. Grace.
In 1857, the Manchester Cricket Club moved to the Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester and this has been the main home of Lancashire cricket ever since. Lancashire County Cricket Club was formed on 12 January 1864 at a meeting of thirteen Lancashire cricket clubs in Manchester. In 1865, Lancashire CCC joined the County Championship and played its initial first-class match versus Middlesex at Old Trafford on 20, 21 & 22 July.
