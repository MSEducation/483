Fever (also known as pyrexia[tpl]cite journal |author=Axelrod YK, Diringer MN |title=Temperature management in acute neurologic disorders |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=585–603, xi |date=May 2008 |pmid=18514828 |doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2008.02.005 |url=[/tpl] or febrile response) is one of the most common medical signs and is characterized by an elevation of body temperature above the normal range of [tpl]convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F|1[/tpl] due to an increase in the temperature regulatory set-point.[tpl]cite journal |author=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A |title=Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=11 |pages=1179–80 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18788094 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc081418|url=[/tpl]  This increase in set-point triggers increased muscle tone and chills.
As a person's temperature increases, there is, in general, a feeling of cold despite an increase in body temperature. Once body temperature has increased to the new set-point temperature, there is a feeling of warmth.
A fever can be caused by many different viral or bacterial conditions ranging from benign to potentially serious.  Some studies suggest that fever is useful as a defense mechanism as the body's immune response can be strengthened at higher temperatures, however there are arguments for and against the usefulness of fever, and the issue is controversial. With the exception of very high temperatures, treatment to reduce fever is often not necessary; however, antipyretic medications can be effective at lowering the temperature, which may improve the affected person's comfort.
Fever differs from uncontrolled hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the body's thermoregulatory set-point, due to excessive heat production or insufficient thermoregulation.

==Definition==

A wide range for normal temperatures has been found.[tpl]cite journal |author=Laupland KB |title=Fever in the critically ill medical patient |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=37 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=S273–8 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19535958 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181aa6117 |url=[/tpl]
Fever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature is caused by a raised set point and:
In healthy adult men and women, the range of normal, healthy temperatures for oral temperature is [tpl]convert|33.2|–|38.2|C|F|1[/tpl], for rectal it is [tpl]convert|34.4|–|37.8|C|F|1[/tpl], for tympanic membrane (the ear drum) it is [tpl]convert|35.4|–|37.8|C|F|1[/tpl], and for axillary (the armpit) it is [tpl]convert|35.5|–|37.0|C|F|1[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal |author=Sund-Levander M, Forsberg C, Wahren LK |title=Normal oral, rectal, tympanic and axillary body temperature in adult men and women: a systematic literature review |journal=Scand J Caring Sci |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=122–8 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12000664 |doi= 10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x|url=[/tpl] Harrison's textbook of internal medicine defines a fever as a morning oral temperature of >37.2°C (>98.9°F) or an afternoon oral temperature of >37.7°C (>99.9°F) while the normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5°C (0.9°F).[tpl]cite book|first=ed.

Normal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more.  A raised temperature is not always a fever.  For example, the temperature of a healthy person rises when he or she exercises, but this is not considered a fever, as the set-point is normal.  On the other hand, a "normal" temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person.  For example, medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a "normal" temperature of [tpl]convert|37.3|C|F[/tpl] may represent a clinically significant fever.
