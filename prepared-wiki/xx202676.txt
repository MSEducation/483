==History==

The Catharine Clark Gallery opened in 1991 with a location in the Hayes Valley district of San Francisco. In 1995, the gallery moved from its original "hole in the wall"[tpl]cite web|last=Baker|first=Kenneth|title=Potrero flats are emerging hot spot on art scene|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Potrero-flats-are-emerging-hot-spot-on-art-scene-4858468.php#page-2|publisher=San Francisco Gate|accessdate=2014-01-14[/tpl] to a space at 49 Geary. In 2007, the gallery was moved to a location on nearby Minna Street. The new location placed the gallery close to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of the African Diaspora. The move from Geary to Minna brought the gallery's exhibitions a larger and more committed audience, as the gallery's change in location gave it greater independence from the numerous galleries at 49 Geary.[tpl]cite web|last=Vasilyuk|first=Sasha|title=S.F. art galleries forge into new territories|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/S-F-art-galleries-forge-into-new-territories-3211216.php|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] With the demolition and on-going construction going on at the San Francisco MoMa next door, Clark decided to move her gallery once more, this time to 428 Utah St. in the Potrero Hill region of San Francisco. On September 7, 2013, the gallery opened its new location with an exhibition titled "This is the Sound of Someone Losing the Plot."[tpl]cite web|title=For Immediate Release|url=http://cclarkgallery.com/uploads/exhibitions/PR_This_is_the_Sound_Final.pdf|publisher=Clark Gallery|accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl]
