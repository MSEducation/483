[[Double II Set]]

The Double II Set is a chapter of the Bloods street gang centered in East Orange, New Jersey.  Chapters of the Bloods are called "sets."
In 1993, Blood members from the Queen Street Bloods Gang ("QSBG") of Inglewood, California came to East Orange, initiating East Orange members in the practices and traditions of the west coast Bloods. East Orange is known colloquially as "Illtown," so the set was titled "Double II" (pronounced "Double EYE"). Tewhan Butler was the "Godfather" of the Double II Set.                                                                                                                                                                                  
The East Orange hip hop group Naughty by Nature cultivates the perception of a connection to the Double II Set, double spelling the letter I in album titles (e.g. "IIcons").
