"Leaving So Soon?" is a song performed and composed by English piano rock and alternative rock band Keane, featured on their second studio album, Under the Iron Sea. "Leaving So Soon?" was the last song composed for the album, circa 2005.
The song is considered a fan favourite, and was believed by some to be a potential single for the album. It remains the Keane song with the highest tempo released (144). Written by pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, it has been rumoured amongst fans that the lyrics were aimed at fellow band member Tom Chaplin after the band had an argument, similarly to two other songs on the album, 'Hamburg Song' and 'Broken Toy'. Others claim it's a jab at former band member Dominic Scott, who left the band in 2001.
