[[Christian Cemetery, Narayanguda]]

CATEGORIES: Cemeteries in India, Christian cemeteries

The Christian Cemetery at Narayanguda is one of the largest cemeteries located at Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.
The cemetery is divided into two sections, namely Roman Catholic and Protestant, to accommodate people of the two different Christian denominations. More recently the older graves are being replaced by new ones due to lack of space for the newly dead, as even the government had refused to donate new land despite repeated requests.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-23/hyderabad/28233573_1_graves-cemetery-managers-bodies The cemetery pays its electricity bills in the name of Prophet Isaiah.http://www.greatandhra.com/viewnews.php?id=22976&cat=10&scat=25
