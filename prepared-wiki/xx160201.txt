==History==

"Living Type" was released with one b-side track, dubbed "Other Delicacies".  The track consisted of six 90 second blocks of music, with instrumental backgrounds.  Guitarist Darren Middleton explained that the single would only have two tracks listed, and when referring to "Other Delicacies", said that "all the songs are recorded in a block so you can't skip them, you have to listen to the whole single".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl14.htm|title=Make Mine a Double|last=Lawrence|first=Angie|work=Rave|year=1996|publisher=Powderfinger Central| accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl]
"Living Type" was first performed live by Powderfinger whilst opening for You Am I on their "Uptight Express Tour".[tpl]cite book|author=Powderfinger (Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, Coghill), et al.|title=Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000 (Companion booklet)|publisher=Powderfinger|pages=9[/tpl]  The shows were considered highly successful; much more so than Powderfinger's live performances with US band Pantera, which were problematic to say the least.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl24.htm|title=Budding Interntionalists|last=Mengel|first=Noel|work=The Courier Mail|date=16 November 1996|publisher=Powderfinger Central| accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl]

===Song meanings===

Whilst there was some speculation that "Living Type" was "a cheesy, angsty love song", Powderfinger's lead singer; Bernard Fanning (who wrote the song) said it was actually about Charles Manson, and the people affected by his cult.  Fanning said that he was unable to control what people thought about the song, and so didn't try, but that "cheesy love song" that it had been dubbed was "not the intention" of the song.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/article5.htm|title=Out of the Blue|first=Simon|last=Wooldridge|date=March 1997|work=Juice|publisher=Powderfinger Central| accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl] In a subsequent interview, Fanning told Juice magazine that people had been asking him if "Living Type" was about menstruation, which he dismissed as being "so stupid".  However, he also re-iterated his statement that he was unable to control interpretations of the song, saying that "people have a freedom to think what they like".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl38.htm|title=Taking Flight|first=Samantha|last=Clode|date=October 1998|work=Juice|publisher=Powderfinger Central| accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl]

==Music video==

The music video for "Living Type" was directed by David Barker,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clipland.com/Summary/944439098/|publisher=Clipland|title=Powderfinger "Living Type" Music Video at Clipland|accessdate=2007-10-17[/tpl] and filmed in Harrisville, near Powderfinger's home town; Brisbane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/song_file/%5Eliving.htm|publisher=Powderfinger Central|title=Living Type|work=Song file|accessdate=2007-10-29[/tpl] It was proclaimed as "most lavish visual work to date" by numerous commentators.  The video tells the story of Squinty B Jones (played by Fanning), a man on the run from forces unknown (it is likely he is running from a psychiatric ward, which would tie in with the song's background).  The video was shot in outback Australia, and was praised as "dripping with Australiana." When asked which Powderfinger videos "had been crap", drummer Jon Coghill jokingly said that they all had, before stating that he liked the videos for "Living Type" and "Good-Day Ray", and stating that he hadn't always understood the "vibe" of the band's other videos.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl38.htm |title=Powderfinger|first=Christie| last=Eliezer|date=Spring (Southern Hemisphere), 1999|work=Australian Musician Magazine |publisher=Powderfinger Central| accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl]
