Australia's changing security environment will lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. The unstable governments in many South Pacific countries may lead to some of these countries becoming failed states in the future. States such as Fiji may require Australian military-led interventions to restore civil government.Australian Department of Defence (2007a), pp. 13–23.
Australian demographic trends will put pressure on the ADF in the future.Ken Henry (2005) 'Australia's Defence to 2045: The Macro-economic Outlook' in Defender, Spring 2005, p. 19 Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget.Henry (2005), pp. 22–23. In addition, relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.Grey (2008), p. 280
The ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia's changing strategic environment and population base. These strategies include expanding the ADF and introducing new equipment to increase Australia's strategic weight. To maintain Australia's qualitative lead over neighbouring states the ADF intends to introduce new technologies and maintain the high quality of Australian military training. The ADF is also seeking to develop and implement improved military tactics based upon the integration of technology and better co-operation between the services.Australian Department of Defence (2006a). Submission to the Joint Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into the Economic, Social and Strategic Trends in Australia's Region and the Consequences for Our Defence Requirements[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. Australian Department of Defence. Canberra, pp. 11–14.

==Current structure==

The Australian Defence Force, Department of Defence and Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) make up the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO), which is often referred to as 'Defence'.[tpl]cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/ips/aboutus.htm|work=Information Publication Scheme|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] A diarchy of the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) and the Secretary of the Department of Defence administers the ADO. The ADF is the military component of the ADO and consists of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).Khosa (2011), pp. 2–3
The Department of Defence is staffed by both civilian and military personnel and includes agencies such as the DMO, Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO) and Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). The DMO purchases and maintains defence equipment. The DSTO provides science and technology support to the defence forces.Khosa (2010), pp. 50–51

===Command arrangements===

The ADF's command arrangements are specified in the Defence Act (1903) and subordinate legislation.Khosa (2011), p. 2 This act states that the Minister of Defence "shall have the general control and administration of the Defence Force" and that the CDF, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the chiefs of the three services must act "in accordance with any directions of the Minister".[tpl]cite web|title=Defence Act 1903 – Section 8|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/da190356/s8.html|work=Defence Act 1903|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] The leaders of the ADO are also responsible to the junior ministers who are appointed to manage specific elements of the defence portfolio. Senator David Johnston is the current Minister of Defence, Stuart Robert is Assistant Minister for Defence and Darren Chester the Parliamentary Secretary of Defence.[tpl]cite web|title=Defence Ministers|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=18 September 2013[/tpl]
The CDF is the most senior appointment in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF, and is notionally the equal of the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a General, Admiral or Air Chief Marshal. In addition to their command responsibilities, the CDF is also the Minister of Defence's principal military adviser.Khosa (2011), p. 3 General David Hurley is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 4 July 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Chief of the Defence Force|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/leaders/chief/index.htm|work=Defence Leaders|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=24 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110705093101/http://www.defence.gov.au/leaders/chief/index.htm| archivedate= 5 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.[tpl]cite news |first=Hugh |last=White |title=The real battle is far from the battlefield |url=http://www.lowyinstitute.org/PublicationGet.asp?i=403 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=23 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Under the current ADF command structure the day-to-day management of the ADF is distinct from the command of military operations.Khosa (2011), p. 13 The services are administered through the ADO, with the head of each service (the Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force) and the service headquarters being responsible for raising, training and sustaining combat forces. The Chiefs are also the CDF's principal advisor on matters concerning the responsibilities of their service.Khosa (2011), pp. 12–13
While the individual members of each service ultimately report to their service's Chief, the Chiefs do not control military operations. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS), who reports directly to the CDF. The CJOPS commands the Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) as well as temporary joint task forces. These joint task forces comprise units assigned from their service to participate in operations or training exercises.Khosa (2011), p. 14

===Joint combat forces===

Operational command of the ADF is exercised by HQJOC, which is located at a purpose-built facility near Bungendore, New South Wales. This is a 'joint' headquarters comprising personnel from the three services and includes a continuously manned Joint Control Centre. HQJOC's main role is to "plan, monitor and control" ADF operations and exercises, and it is organised around groups of plans, operations and support staff. HQJOC also monitors the readiness of the ADF units which are not assigned to operations and contributes to developing Australia's military doctrine.
As well as HQJOC, the ADF has a number of permanent joint operational commands responsible to the CJOPS. Joint Operations Command (JOC) includes the two headquarters responsible for patrolling Australia's maritime borders on a day-to-day basis, Northern Command and Border Protection Command. Other JOC units include the Joint Movements Group and the Air and Space Operations Centre. In addition, individual ADF units and Joint Task Groups are assigned to JOC during operations, and HQJOC includes officers responsible for submarine and special operations forces.Khosa (2010), pp. 13–15

===Royal Australian Navy===

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. The RAN operates 74 vessels of all sizes, including frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships.International Institute for Strategic Studies (2011), p. 224 The RAN is one of the most modern navies in the Pacific and is responsible for defending Australian waters and undertaking operations in distant locations.Royal Australian Navy (2006), p. 3.
There are two parts to the RAN's structure. One is an operational command, Fleet Command, and the other is a support command, Navy Strategic Command. The Navy's assets are administered by four 'forces' which report to the Commander Australian Fleet. These are the Fleet Air Arm, the Mine Warfare, Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Force, Submarine Force and Surface Force. All naval bases across Australia also report to the Commander Australian Fleet.[tpl]cite web|title=Organisation|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/organisation|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=27 December 2013[/tpl]

===Australian Army===

The Australian Army is Australia's military land force. While the Australian Army is principally a light infantry force, it is currently being 'hardened and networked' and expanded to enable it to conduct higher-intensity operations.Davies (2010), p. 3
The Army is organised into three main elements which report to the Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. Special Operations Command is responsible for preparing the ADF's special forces units for operational deployments. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.Australian Army (2008a), pp. 5–8International Institute for Strategic Studies (2011), p. 223
The Australian Army's main combat forces are grouped in brigades. These comprise a mechanised brigade—1st Brigade, a light infantry brigade—3rd Brigade, a motorised brigade—7th Brigade, six Army Reserve brigades, an aviation brigade (16th Brigade), a combat support and ISTAR brigade (6th Brigade) and a logistics brigade (the 17th Brigade).Khosa (2011), pp. 24–27 The Army's main tactical formations are battlegroups formed around the headquarters of a battalion-sized formation.
Special Operations Command (SOC) commands the ADF's special forces units. It comprises the Special Air Service Regiment, two commando regiments, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment and signals, logistics and training units.Khosa (2011), p. 24 The Army's special forces units have been expanded since 2001 and are well equipped and capable of being deployed by sea, air or land.Davies (2010), p. 6

===Royal Australian Air Force===

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the air force branch of the ADF. The RAAF has modern combat and transport aircraft and a network of bases in strategic locations across Australia.
Unlike the other services, the RAAF has only a single operational command, RAAF Air Command, which includes the Air Force Training Group. RAAF Air Command is the operational arm of the RAAF and also consists of the Air Combat Group, Air Lift Group, Surveillance and Response Group, Combat Support Group and Aerospace Operational Support Group. Each group consists of a number of wings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/Structure/|title=Our Structure: Royal Australian Air Force|work=Royal Australian Air Force official website|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=15 November 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101116111328/http://airforce.gov.au/Structure/| archivedate= 16 November 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The RAAF has eighteen flying squadrons; four combat squadrons, two maritime patrol squadrons, five transport squadrons, six training squadrons (including three Operational Conversion Units and a forward air control training squadron) and one Airborne Early Warning & Control squadron. The Air Force also includes a single independent flight (No. 5 Flight).Pittaway (2014), p. 78 A large number of ground support units support these flying squadrons, including three expeditionary combat support squadrons, two airfield defence squadrons and communications, radar and medical units.Khosa (2011), pp. 28–35

==Logistic support==

The ADF's logistics are managed by the DMO and the Joint Logistics Command. The DMO was created in 2000 by merging the ADF's Support Command Australia with the Department of Defence's Defence Acquisition Organisation and National Support Division.Horner (2001), pp. 278–279 The DMO purchases all forms of equipment and services used by the ADF and is also responsible for maintaining this equipment throughout its life of type.Khosa (2011), p. 53
The DMO is not responsible for directly supplying deployed ADF units; this is the responsibility of the Joint Logistics Command and the single service logistic units.[tpl]cite web|title=Joint Logistics Command|url=http://www.directory.gov.au/osearch.php?ou%3DJoint%20Logistics%20Command,ou%3DVice%20Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force,ou%3DDepartment%20of%20Defence,o%3DDefence,o%3DPortfolios,o%3DCommonwealth%20of%20Australia,c%3DAU&changebase|work=Government Online Directory|publisher=Department of Finance and Deregulation |accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl] These units include the Navy's Systems Command and replenishment ships, the Army's 17th Combat Service Support Brigade and Combat Service Support Battalions, and the Combat Support Group RAAF.Horner (2001), p. 273
The increasing role of the private sector forms an important trend in the ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size.Horner (2001), pp. 265–279 Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.Thomson (2005d), pp. 30–32.

==Military intelligence==

The Australian Defence Force's intelligence collection and analysis capabilities include each of the services' intelligence systems and units, two joint civilian-military intelligence gathering agencies and two strategic and operational-level intelligence analysis organisations.Horner (2001), p. 150[tpl]cite web|title=The Australian Intelligence Community|url=http://www.igis.gov.au/aic/index.cfm|publisher=Inspector General of Intelligence and Security|accessdate=24 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716021804/http://www.igis.gov.au/aic/index.cfm| archivedate= 16 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Each of the three services has its own intelligence assets. RAN doctrine states that "all maritime units" contribute to the collection of intelligence and many of the RAN's ships are capable of collecting communications and electronic transmissions. The Collins class submarines are particularly effective in this role.Sea Power Centre – Australia (2005), p. 56 The Army's intelligence units include the 1st Intelligence Battalion, 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), three Regional Force Surveillance Units and the Special Air Service Regiment.Australian Department of Defence (2006). Defence 2005–06 Annual Report – web only section. ADF Units and Establishments. Retrieved 6 May 2007. The RAAF monitors the airspace of Australia and neighbouring countries using the Vigilare system, which combines input from the service's Jindalee Operational Radar Network, other ADF air defence radars (including airborne and naval systems) and civilian air traffic control radars.Pittaway (2014), p. 76[tpl]cite news|last=Kerr|first=Julian|title=Vigilare up and running|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/vigilare-up-and-running/story-e6frg8yo-1225940235791|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Australian|date=23 October 2010[/tpl] The RAAF's other intelligence assets include No. 87 Squadron and the AP-3 Orion aircraft operated by No. 92 Wing.Khosa (2011), pp. 31–35[tpl]cite web|title=Aerospace Operational Support Group|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/groups/aosg.aspx|work=RAAF website|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=18 December 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110102071711/http://www.airforce.gov.au//groups/aosg.aspx| archivedate= 2 January 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Defence Intelligence and Security Group within the Department of Defence supports the services and co-operate with the civilian agencies within the Australian Intelligence Community. This Group consists of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO), Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) and Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO). The DIGO is responsible for geospatial intelligence and producing maps for the ADF, the DSD is Australia's signals intelligence agency and the DIO is responsible for the analysis of intelligence collected by the other intelligence agencies. The three agencies are headquartered in Canberra, though the DIGO has staff in Bendigo and the DSD maintains several permanent signals collection facilities in other locations.Khosa (2011), p. 125
The DSD includes a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) which is responsible for protecting Defence and other Australian Government agencies against cyberwarfare attacks. The CSOC was established in January 2010 and is jointly staffed by the DSD, other sections of the ADO, Attorney-General's Department, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and Australian Federal Police.[tpl]cite web|last=Defence Signals Directorate|title=Cyber Security Operations Centre|url=http://www.dsd.gov.au/_lib/pdf_doc/csoc_brochure.pdf|publisher=Defence Signals Directorate|accessdate=9 October 2010|page=5|date=January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Berkovic |first=Nicola|title=Defence on a cyber war footing|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/defence-on-a-cyber-war-footing/story-e6frg6nf-1225820171172|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=The Australian|date=16 January 2010[/tpl] Unlike the United States military, the ADF does not class cyberwarfare as being a separate sphere of warfare.[tpl]cite news|last=Welsh|first=Dylan|title=Cyber soldiers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/cyber-soldiers-20101008-16c7e.html|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101013074112/http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/cyber-soldiers-20101008-16c7e.html| archivedate= 13 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Personnel numbers===

Over the 2011–2012 financial year the ADF had an average strength of 57,994 permanent (full-time) and 22,072 reserve (part-time) personnel.Department of Defence (2012), pp. 20–22 In addition there were 22,166 inactive members of the Standby Reserve as at June 2009.[tpl]cite web|title=People|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6D4CD661FDBA3226CA25773700169C59?opendocument|work=Year Book Australia, 2009–10|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=18 July 2010|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|location=Canberra|year=2010[/tpl] The Army is the largest service, followed by the RAAF and RAN. The ADO also employed an average of 22,635 civilian Australian Public Service (APS) staff, of whom 1,766 were also members of reserve branches of the ADF as at 30 June 2012.Department of Defence (2012), p. 289 The average distribution of ADF personnel between the services and categories of service over the 2011–12 financial year was as follows:
During the 2009–10 financial year 6,063 people enlisted in the ADF on a permanent basis. This represented 91% of the ADF's recruitment target for that year.Department of Defence (2010a), p. 351 A further 671 people enlisted as part of the gap year scheme (96% of the target) and 2,629 joined the reserves (84% of the target).Department of Defence (2010a), pp. 353–354 During that financial year 4,000 people left the ADF's permanent force, representing a 7.1% separation rate.Department of Defence (2010a), p. 356
The number of ADF personnel has changed over the last 20 years. During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the commercialisation of some elements of the military. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength. During the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial years the strength of the ADF dropped as a result of problems with attracting further recruits. The ADF has consistently grown in all subsequent financial years, however. This growth is attributable to increased spending on recruitment and improved recruitment and retention policies. Nevertheless, some parts of the ADF are suffering from shortages of personnel (such as technicians and trades people) and demand for skilled labour in the broader economy is driving up the wages the ADF needs to pay to retain key personnel.Thomson (2009), pp. 35–38 As of May 2010, 20 employment categories were considered "critical or perilous" due to a shortage of skilled personnel, though this had been reduced from 32 such categories in 2009.[tpl]cite news|last=Parnell |first=Sean|title=Skill shortage threatens defence|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/skill-shortage-threatens-defence/story-e6frg8yo-1225966030939|accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper=The Australian|date=6 December 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101205141520/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/skill-shortage-threatens-defence/story-e6frg8yo-1225966030939| archivedate= 5 December 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
As of the 2011–12 budget, Defence planned to have a strength of 58,627 full-time personnel supported by 21,397 civilians and contractors in the 2018–19 financial year.Thomson (2011), pp. 34–35 The Strategic Reform Program has included transferring the roles filled by several hundred ADF members to civilian APS staff as a means of reducing costs.[tpl]cite web|last=Watt|first=David|title=Workforce|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/BudgetReview2010-11/DefenceWorkforce.htm|work=Budget 2010–11: Defence|publisher=Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library|accessdate=23 July 2011|year=2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Reserves===

Each of the branches of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve.ANAO (2011), p. 11. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel.ANAO (2001), p. 29 As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF. However, the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require additional training before they can be deployed.ANAO (2001), p. 30 It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.
There are two main categories of reserve personnel; those in the active reserve and those in the standby reserve. Members of the active reserve have an annual minimum training obligation.ANAO (2001), p. 31 Army and RAAF reservists may also volunteer for the high readiness reserve; this category of reservists have higher training and active service obligations.[tpl]cite web|title=Categories of Service|url=http://www.defencereserves.com/aspx/categories_of_service.aspx|work=Defence Reserves Support|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]Department of Defence (2009), p. 90 Members of the standby reserve are not required to undertake training, and would only be called up in response to a national emergency or to fill a specialised position. Most standby reservists are former full-time members of the ADF.ANAO (2001), p. 58
While Australian Naval Reserve personnel are assigned to permanent units, most members of the Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve are members of reserve units. Most of the RAAF's reserve units are not capable of being deployed, however, and reserve personnel are generally attached to regular air force units during their periods of active service.ANAO (2001), pp. 36, 61, 65, 76 In contrast, the Army Reserve is organised into permanent units, though it is unlikely that these would be deployed in their entirety.ANAO (2001), pp. 36, 45 There have been long-running debates over whether the Army Reserve and its structure remain relevant to modern warfare.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 46
The ADF's increased activities since 1999 and shortfalls in recruiting permanent personnel has led to reservists being more frequently called to active service. This has included large scale domestic deployments, which have included providing security for major events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics and responding to natural disasters. Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia's region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve rifle companies to East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of reservists have taken part in operations in locations distant from Australia. Notably, companies of the Army Reserve 1st Commando Regiment have regularly been deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group.[tpl]cite journal|title=Afghanistan : International Security Assistance Force|journal=Australian & NZ Defender|year=2009|volume=No. 68|issue=Summer 2009|page=p. 28[/tpl]

===Training===

Individual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation which manages this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.Horner (2001), p. 281.
Military academies include HMAS Creswell for the Navy, Royal Military College, Duntroon for the Army, and the Officer Training School – RAAF Base East Sale for the Air Force. The Australian Defence Force Academy is a tri-service university for officer cadets of all services wishing to attain a university degree through the Australian Defence Force. Navy recruit training is conducted at HMAS Cerberus, Army recruits are trained at the Army Recruit Training Centre and Air Force recruits at RAAF Base Wagga.Horner (2001), pp. 294–301.

===Women in the ADF===

Women first served in the Australian military during World War II when each service established a separate female branch. The RAAF was the first service to fully integrate women into operational units, doing so in 1977, with the Army and RAN following in 1979 and 1985 respectively.Horner (2001), pp. 321–324. The ADF initially struggled to integrate women, with integration being driven by changing Australian social values and Government legislation rather than a change in attitudes within the male-dominated military.Joan Beaumont (2001). Australian Defence Sources and Statistics. Oxford University Press, Melbourne, p. 357.
The number of positions available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990.Australian Parliamentary Library Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. Retrieved 16 December 2006. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. The only positions which women are currently excluded from are those in which there is a high probability of 'direct combat', which includes all infantry positions and other positions in which there is a high probability of hand to hand combat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/fr/RR/Womenindefence/Roles.html|title=Roles of Women in the ADF|year=2009|work=Women in Defence|publisher=Australian Department of Defence|accessdate=12 March 2010[/tpl] As a result, while almost all positions in the Navy and Air Force are open to women, women are excluded from a high proportion of Army positions.Khosa (2004), p. 52.
Despite the expansion in the number of positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, there has been little growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel.Thomson (2009), p. 49 In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%.Khosa (2010), p. 79 In 2008, defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon instructed the ADF to place a greater emphasis on recruiting women and addressing barriers to women being promoted to senior roles.[tpl]cite news |first=Tom |last=Allard |title=Women, your armed forces need you |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/women-your-armed-forces-need-you/2008/03/23/1206206927415.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 March 2008 |accessdate=24 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Plan to put women in combat roles |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23302398-2,00.html |publisher=News.com.au |date=2 March 2008|accessdate=23 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080305024607/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23302398-2,00.html| archivedate= 5 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years.

===Ethnic composition===

A high percentage of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2007 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson argues that the ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regards and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.Thomson (2009), pp. 47–49 The ADF is developing a new advertising campaign to attract recruits from non-Anglo-Celtic backgrounds.
The ADO is currently seeking to expand the number of Indigenous Australians it recruits and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of Indigenous men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of Indigenous Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though they continue to be under-represented among the officer corps. Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists.Dennis et al. (2008), pp. 3–5 In 2007 Indigenous Australians made up 1.4% of permanent ADF personnel and 1.8% of reservists.Khosa (2010), p. 81

===Sexuality===

Australia allows gay men and lesbians to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian personnel were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate.Grey (2008), p. 275Dennis et al. (2008), p. 264 Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, however, and the reform caused relatively few problems.Dennis et al. (2008), pp. 264–265 A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.Belkin and McNichol (2000)

==Defence expenditure and procurement==

===Current expenditure===

The Australian Government allocated [tpl]A$|25.4 billion[/tpl] to the Australian Defence Organisation in the 2013–2014 financial year. This level of expenditure is equivalent to approximately 1.59% of Australian Gross Domestic Product and 6.6% of the Government's planned expenditure over the 2013–2014 financial year.Thomson (2013), p. vi In broad terms, 42.2% of the 2011–2012 defence budget will be allocated to personnel expenses, 35.4% to operating costs and 22.4% to investment. The amount allocated to defence in the 2013–14 budget was 2.3% higher than that in the previous year's budget in real terms, though the 2012–13 expenditure was the lowest proportion of GDP to be allocated to Defence since 1938. The 2013–14 budget also forecast that total expenditure on Defence over the next six years will be $200 billion, representing a real annual growth rate of 2.5%.
The 2009 defence white paper included a commitment to increase defence spending by 3% in real terms each year over a 21-year period.Thomson (2011), p. viii In addition, the white paper also specified that defence would be required to undertake a package of reforms named the 'Strategic Reform Program' which aimed to save [tpl]A$|20.6 billion[/tpl] over ten years through improvements to management practices and other efficiencies.Thomson (2011), p. 119 However, the actual rate of growth in funding over the seven years covered by the white paper will be 1%.Thomson (2012), p. 25
In relative terms, Australia's defence expenditure as a proportion of GDP is greater than that of most developed Western nations, but is smaller than the proportion allocated to defence by Australia's larger neighbours. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2010 was the 13th highest of any country in purchasing power parity terms.SPRI (2011), Constant (2009) USD table As a proportion of GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 57th of the countries for which data is available.SPRI (2011), Share of GDP table
In 2012 the Government and senior military officers of Australia's major defence ally, the United States, expressed concerns at cuts to the Australian Defence Budget.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/us-voices-fears-over-defence-cuts/story-fn59niix-1226431313636 US voices fears over defence cuts Australian defence expert Alan Stephens has countered these concerns, arguing that the Australian Defence Budget is more than adequate and that it is a matter for Australia and not the United States to determinehttp://www.canberratimes.com.au/opinion/australias-defence-budget-is-more-than-adequate-20120725-22qhk.html Australia's defence budget is more than adequate Australia's Federal Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, supported American concerns that by cutting its defence spending to below that expected of the United States' European allies, Australia will not be able to meet its alliance obligations.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/tony-abbott-pitches-himself-to-us-as-future-pm-in-washington-speech/story-e6frg8yo-1226428707536 Tony Abbott backs US hawks critical of Australian defence cuts The Liberal Party's policy is to "restore responsible defence spending to 3 per cent real growth per year subject to improvements in the Budget".[tpl]cite web|title=Our Plan : Real Solutions for all Australians|url=http://lpa.webcontent.s3.amazonaws.com/realsolutions/LPA%20Policy%20Booklet%20210x210_FINAL_LNP.pdf|publisher=Liberal Party of Australia|accessdate=12 April 2013|year=2013|page=48[/tpl]

===Long term procurement projects===

The Defence Capability Plan (DCP) sets out the ADF's long term capital programs. DCPs have been regularly produced since 2000.Thomson (2011), p. vi The current public version DCP, which was released in 2009 and updated in late 2010, contains 140 projects and phases of projects which have a total estimated cost of [tpl]A$|153 billion[/tpl] in 2010 dollars. Work on these projects will take place between 2011 and 2020.Department of Defence (2010), pp. iii, 1 The most expensive and complex projects in the DCP are the Collins class submarine replacement project, the purchase of at least 72 F-35 Lightning II fighters, upgrades to the RAAF's Wedgetail AEW&C aircraft, the replacement of many of the ADF's wheeled vehicles, the replacement of the Army's ASLAV and M-113s and the development of new offshore combatant vessels and frigates to replace most of the RAN's surface combatants.Department of Defence (2010), p. 309
The increasing cost of defence equipment poses a challenge to the ADF. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates that the cost of purchasing and operating the equipment in the Defence Capability Plan may exceed the projected Defence Budget. If additional resources are not made available to correct this funding shortfall the government may be forced to reduce the ADF's size.Thomson (2006a).

==Current equipment==

While the Australian Defence Force seeks to be a high-technology force, much of its equipment is approaching obsolescence and is scheduled to be replaced or upgraded in the near future.Thomson (2005b), pp. 9–10 Australia does not possess weapons of mass destruction and has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.Khosa (2011), pp. 98–99 Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.Khosa (2011), p. 39
The Royal Australian Navy operates 51 commissioned ships and submarines. The Navy's 12 frigates are its most capable surface combatants; the four remaining Adelaide class frigates provide the RAN's surface offensive capability, while the eight Anzac class frigates are general purpose escorts.Davies (2008), p. 2 The RAN's submarine force has six Collins class submarines.Frame (2004), pp. 284–285. There are 14 Armidale class patrol boats for border security and fisheries patrol duties in Australia's northern waters. The RAN's amphibious force comprises the dock landing ship [tpl]HMAS|Choules|L100|6[/tpl], the heavy landing ship [tpl]HMAS|Tobruk|L 50|6[/tpl], and three Balikpapan class heavy landing craft. The Navy's minesweeping force operates six Huon class minehunters. Two replenishment vessels ([tpl]HMAS|Sirius|O 266|2[/tpl] and [tpl]HMAS|Success|OR 304|2[/tpl]) and six survey vessels (the Leeuwin and Paluma classes) support these combatants. Non-commissioned ships operated by the RAN include the support vessel [tpl]Ship|ADV|Ocean Shield[/tpl], the sail training ship Young Endeavour, and two Bandicoot class minesweeper tugboats. As at December 2010, the Fleet Air Arm's helicopter force comprised 16 Seahawks for anti-submarine tasks, six Sea King and five MRH 90 transport helicopters and 13 Squirrel and three AW109s for training purposes.Flightglobal Insight (2010), p. 10
The Australian Army is primarily a light infantry force equipped with equipment which may be carried by individual soldiers. However, the Army's equipment includes a substantial quantity of armoured vehicles and artillery. Moreover, the Army is introducing additional armoured vehicles into service as part of the 'hardened and networked army' initiative.Australian Army The Hardened and Networked Army. Retrieved 17 December 2006. The Army's armoured, mechanised and motorised units are currently equipped with 59 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 774 M113 armoured personnel carriers (including vehicles in store), and 257 ASLAV armoured reconnaissance vehicles. 838 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles are being introduced into service. The Army's artillery holdings consist of 109 L119 Hamel 105 mm calibre towed guns, 36 155 mm towed M198 howitzers, an unspecified number of 81 mm mortars and 30 RBS-70 surface-to-air missiles.Khosa (2011), pp. 36–37 As at December 2010 Australian Army Aviation is equipped with 91 helicopters, including 26 Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters, 16 of a planned 22 Eurocopter Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters, 34 S-70A-9 Blackhawk, six CH-47 Chinook and eight of a planned 41 MRH 90 transport helicopters and a single Squirrel. The Army also operates several ScanEagle and Skylark unmanned aerial vehicles. In addition, the Army is equipped with 15 LCM-8 watercraft to support amphibious operations.
The Royal Australian Air Force operates combat, maritime patrol, transport and training aircraft. As at October 2011 the combat aircraft force comprised 71 F/A-18A and B Hornets and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets. The maritime patrol force was equipped with 19 AP-3C Orions and three of a planned six Boeing Wedgetail Airborne early warning and control aircraft had been accepted into service. The air transport force operated 21 C-130 Hercules and five C-17 Globemaster IIIs. The RAAF also operates three Bombardier Challenger and two Boeing Business Jet 737 aircraft as VIP transports. One of five Airbus KC-30B Multi-Role Tanker Transports being introduced into service. The RAAF also operates 67 Pilatus PC-9 and 33 Hawk 127 training aircraft. Nine Beechcraft B300 King Air are used for training and transport tasks.Flightglobal Insight (2010), p. 9 Twelve EA-18G Growler aircraft have been ordered to improve electronic warfare capability.http://www.airforce.gov.au/Technology/Future-Acquisitions/EA18G-Growler/?RAAF-wWtm2RqFW2K0Pyup3hIJncFVFKb02OLN

==Current bases==

The Australian Defence Force maintains 60 major bases and many other facilities across all the states and territories of Australia. These bases occupy millions of hectares of land, giving the ADO Australia's largest real estate portfolio. In addition, Defence Housing Australia manages around 17,000 residences which are occupied by members of the ADF. While most of the Army's permanent force units are based in northern Australia, the majority of Navy and Air Force units are based near Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Few ADF bases are currently shared by different services. Small Army and RAAF units are also located at Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth.Khosa (2010), pp. 16–35
The administrative headquarters of the ADF and the three services is located in Canberra alongside the main offices of the Department of Defence and Defence Materiel Organisation and the interim headquarters of Joint Operations Command. JOC and the other operational headquarters will be co-located near Bungendore, New South Wales as part of the Headquarters Joint Operations Command Project.Australian Department of Defence, Headquarters Joint Operations Command Project – Project Purpose[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. Retrieved 25 May 2007.
The Royal Australian Navy has two main bases; Fleet Base East (HMAS Kuttabul) in Sydney and Fleet Base West (HMAS Stirling) near Perth. The Navy's operational headquarters, Fleet Headquarters, is located adjacent to Fleet Base East. The majority of the Navy's patrol boats are based at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin, Northern Territory with the remaining patrol boats and the hydrographic fleet located at [tpl]HMAS|Cairns|naval base|6[/tpl] in Cairns. The Fleet Air Arm is based at [tpl]HMAS|Albatross|air station|6[/tpl] near Nowra, New South Wales.Royal Australian Navy (2006), pp. 44–47.
The Australian Army's regular units are concentrated in a small number of bases, most of which are located in Australia's northern states. The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. Most elements of the Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. The Deployable Joint Force (Land) Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks. Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia and Campbell Barracks in Perth. Dozens of Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.Australian Department of Defence 2005–06 Defence Annual Report – Web Section, p. 42.
The Royal Australian Air Force maintains a number of air bases, including three which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, Air Command, is located at RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force's combat aircraft are based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF's maritime patrol aircraft are based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide and most of its transport aircraft are based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF's training aircraft are based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three 'bare bases' in Queensland and Western Australia.Khosa (2011), pp. 28–35, 48[tpl]cite web|title=RAAF Bases|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/bases/index.aspx|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=14 August 2011[/tpl] Of the RAAF's operational bases, only Tindal is located near an area in which the service's aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF's assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and aircraft are generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.Peacock and von Rosenbach (2011), p. 28

==Domestic responsibilities==

The Australian Defence Force has a number of domestic responsibilities. In most of these tasks the ADF supports the relevant civilian authorities. These responsibilities are typically undertaken by specialised elements of the ADF, though the services' combat elements can be deployed within Australia in response to major emergencies.
The ADF makes a significant contribution to Australia's domestic maritime security. ADF ships, aircraft and Regional Force Surveillance Units conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the Australian Customs Service. This operation, which is code-named Operation Resolute, is commanded by the Border Protection Command which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and Customs. Up to 400 personnel were assigned to Operation Resolute in July 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Operation RESOLUTE|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opresolute/index.htm|work=Global Operations|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=18 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100706080604/http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opresolute/index.htm| archivedate= 6 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Protecting Australia's Offshore Maritime Areas|url=http://www.bpc.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/ProtectingAustraliasOffshoreMaritimeAreas.pdf|work=Fact sheet|publisher=Border Protection Command|accessdate=18 July 2010|author=Border Protection Command|location=Canberra|year=2009[/tpl]
While the ADF does not have a significant nation-building role, it provides assistance to remote Indigenous Australian communities through the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program. Under this program, which has been conducted since 1996, an engineer squadron works with one community for several months each year to upgrade local infrastructure and provide training.Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs media release Army celebrates 10 years of service to Indigenous communities. 17 November 2006.[tpl]cite web|title=Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/exercises/aacap/index.htm|work=Operations and Exercises|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=18 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100808002014/http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/exercises/aacap/index.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The ADF also took part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities between June 2007 and October 2008.

The ADF shares responsibility for counter-terrorism with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the State and Territory police and emergency services have the primary responsibility for responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be 'called out' to provide support. To meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite Tactical Assault Groups, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment as well as a company-sized high readiness group in each Army Reserve brigade and the 1st Commando Regiment.The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2004). Protecting Australia Against Terrorism[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. DPMC, Canberra, pp. 52–53. While these forces provide a substantial counter-terrorism capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its 'core business'.Andrew Smith and Anthony Bergin (2006).

==Foreign defence relations==

The Australian Defence Force cooperates with militaries around the world. Australia's formal military agreements include the ANZUS Alliance with the United States of America, the Closer Defence Program with New Zealand and the Five Power Defence Arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.Khosa (2010), p. 98 Australia is currently developing closer security ties with Japan.[tpl]cite journal | author=Nazemroaya, Mahdi Darius | title=Global Military Alliance: Encircling Russia and China | publisher=Centre for Research on Globalization |date=10 May 2007 |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=NAZ20070510&articleId=5605[/tpl] ADF activities under these agreements include participating in joint planning, intelligence sharing, personnel exchanges, equipment standardisation programs and joint exercises.Australian Department of Defence (2002).

The ADF provides assistance to militaries in Australia's region through the Defence Cooperation Program. Under this program the ADF provides assistance with training, infrastructure, equipment and logistics and participates in joint exercises with countries in South East Asia and Oceania. The Pacific Patrol Boat Program is the largest Defence Cooperation Program activity and supports 22 Pacific class patrol boats operated by twelve South Pacific countries. Other important activities include supporting the development of the Timor Leste Defence Force and Papua New Guinea Defence Force and supplying watercraft to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.Khosa (2010), p. 111 Australia also directly contributes to the defence of Pacific countries by periodically deploying warships and aircraft to patrol their territorial waters; this includes an annual deployment of RAAF AP-3 Orions to the region as part of a multi-national maritime surveillance operation.[tpl]cite news|title=Orion casts its net in fisheries op|url=http://australianaviation.com.au/2011/11/orion-casts-its-net-in-fisheries-op/|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=Australian Aviation|date=24 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Operation Kurukuru catches illegal ships|url=http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/9020--operation-kurukuru-catches-illegal-ships|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=Solmon Star|date=16 November 2011[/tpl] Under an informal agreement Australia is responsible for the defence of Nauru.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Nauru|last=Central Intelligence Agency|year=2009|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=17 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100116200912/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html| archivedate= 16 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Assessment of capabilities==

The ADF's capabilities enable it to carry out a range of tasks. The size of the force that the government can deploy differs according to the likelihood of high-intensity combat and the distance from Australia. In overall terms, Dr. Mark Thomson of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute assesses the ADF's size and capability as being typical for a Western nation with Australia's economic and population base.Thomson (2005), p. 10.
The ADF has probably the most capable air and naval capabilities in the South-East Asia region. However, the small size of the Army and the age of much of the RAN and RAAF's equipment constrains Australia's ability to make large-scale deployments or engage in high-intensity combat.Thomson (2003), p. 17. The ADF's personnel shortages may also limit its ability to quickly conduct new deployments.Ferguson, Gregor. 'People and Logistics is the Key'. Australian Defence Magazine, June 2007, p. 18.
The ADF is highly capable of defeating direct attacks on Australia by conventional forces, though such attacks are highly improbable at present. The ADF's intelligence gathering capabilities should enable it to detect any attacking force before it reaches Australia. Once detected, the RAN and RAAF would be able to defeat the attacking force while it was still in Australia's maritime approaches. The Army and RAAF are also capable of defeating small raiding forces once they are detected.Thomson (2003), p. 16. The ADF currently maintains sufficient forces to meet its domestic security and counter-terrorism responsibilities.Smith and Bergin (2006), p. 15.
The RAN and RAAF are capable of deploying significant numbers of capable ships and aircraft, these forces are large and modern enough to operate independently in a high-threat environment and would typically make up a small part of a larger international coalition force. Due to its relatively small size the Army's capability for high intensity warfare is more limited than that of the other services.
As a result of these limitations, the ADF is capable of providing only relatively small, but high-quality, 'niche' forces for high intensity warfare. Such forces include the Navy's submarines, the Army's special forces and the RAAF's Orion aircraft.Thomson (2003), pp. 13–14. See also Horner (2001), p. 202. However, the ADF's logistic capabilities are insufficient to independently supply such forces deployed in areas distant from Australia. As a result, the ADF can only contribute forces to high intensity warfare outside of Australia's region when larger coalition partners provide logistical support.Palazzo (2004), p. 267.
The ADF is highly capable of undertaking peacekeeping operations around the world. The Navy's frigates and transport ships, the Army's light infantry battalions and the RAAF's transport aircraft are well-suited to peacekeeping. The ADF has the capability to undertake peacekeeping and low-intensity warfare operations independently in Australia's region and can sustain such deployments for a lengthy period. It is also capable of leading international peacekeeping forces in the Asia-Pacific region and, in the unlikely event of an external attack, defending Australia's Pacific neighbours.Thomson (2003), pp. 14–16.
