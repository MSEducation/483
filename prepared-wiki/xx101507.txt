[[Clifford Bay, New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Marlborough Region, Bays of New Zealand

Clifford Bay is a bay in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand, in the Marlborough Region. It lies between Cloudy Bay to the northwest, and Cape Campbell, the easternmost point of the South Island. The bay's most notable feature is the solar salt extraction works at Lake Grassmere, close to the southern end of the bay.
Since the 1920s, there have been various proposals for an inter-island port and ferry terminal to replace Picton, the last time being in 1995. However, such plans never proceeded beyond an investigation stage, often due to the capital costs.  In May 2011, plans were announced to revisit the development of a port at Clifford Bay, using a mix of private and public funding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/4976977/Ferry-setting-sail-for-Clifford-Bay |title=Cook Strait ferry setting sail for Clifford Bay |author=Hartevelt, John |date=9 May 2011 |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]
Such a port would reduce both sailing time across the Cook Strait from Wellington and the surface distance to Christchurch. It would also allow fast ferries to operate at higher speeds than they can in the ecologically sensitive Marlborough Sounds and remove the steep grades on the railway line that lead out of Picton.
While a new port at Clifford Bay would have an impact on the economy of Picton, there are positive options to focus Picton as a tourist centre, and the gateway to the Marlborough Sounds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4984115/New-port-interest-already |title=New port interest already |author=Butterfield, Tania |date=10 May 2011 |work=The Marlborough Express |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]
In November 2013, the Government announced it would not be building a new port at Clifford Bay, putting an end to two years of speculation.Clifford Bay ferry terminal axed. 3 News NZ. 14 November 2013.
