[[Indonesian Political Federation]]

CATEGORIES: Dutch East Indies, Politics of Indonesia

The Indonesian Political Federation (Indonesian: Gabungan Politik Indonesia, GAPI), was created in 1939 in the former Dutch East Indies, and consisted of native Indonesian political parties (except the PNI). The GAPI was created in response to the rejection by the Netherlands Soetardjo Petition. The aim of the Federation was to promote a full Indonesian parliamentary administration.
After the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the GAPI again called for an independent Indonesia, but Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer again rejected the demand, because the Netherlands was not prepared to implement constitutional changes before the war was over.
