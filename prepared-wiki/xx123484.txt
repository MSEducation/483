Sophisti-pop was a sub-genre of pop that flourished in the UK between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, incorporating elements of soft rock, jazz, new wave, and blue-eyed soul. The genre made extensive use of electronic keyboards, synthesizers, and polished arrangements, particularly horn sections.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d11379 |title= Sophisti-Pop |work= Allmusic |publisher= Rovi Corporation |accessdate= 21 October 2013 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110515221140/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d11379 |archivedate= 15 May 2011[/tpl]
