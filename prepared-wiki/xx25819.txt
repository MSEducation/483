[[Angular velocity]]

CATEGORIES: Angle, Physical quantities, Rotational symmetry, Tensors, Velocity

In physics, the angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement and is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) which specifies the angular speed (rotational speed) of an object and the axis about which the object is rotating. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second, although it may be measured in other units such as degrees per second, degrees per hour, etc. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, rarely Ω).
The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, in a direction which is usually specified by the right-hand rule.[ref]

==Angular velocity of a particle==

===Particle in two dimensions===

The angular velocity of a particle is measured around or relative to a point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ɸ and θ in radians), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity (v) of the particle has a component along the radius (radial component, v‖) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, v⊥). If there is no radial component, then the particle moves in a circle. On the other hand, if there is no cross-radial component, then the particle moves along a straight line from the origin.
A radial motion produces no change in the direction of the particle relative to the origin, so for purposes of finding the angular velocity the radial component can be ignored. Therefore, the rotation is completely produced by the perpendicular motion around the origin, and the angular velocity is completely determined by this component.
In two dimensions the angular velocity ω is given by
This is related to the cross-radial (tangential) velocity by:
An explicit formula for  v⊥ in terms of v and θ is:
Combining the above equations gives a formula for ω:
In two dimensions the angular velocity is a single number that has no direction, but it does have a sense or orientation. In two dimensions the angular velocity is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example if one of the axes is inverted or if they are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the x axis. If parity is inverted, but the sense of a rotation does not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.
There are three types of angular velocity involved in the movement on an ellipse corresponding to the three anomalies (true, eccentric and mean).

===Particle in three dimensions===

In three dimensions, the angular velocity becomes a bit more complicated. The angular velocity in this case is generally thought of as a vector, or more precisely, a pseudovector. It now has not only a magnitude, but a direction as well. The magnitude is the angular speed, and the direction describes the axis of rotation. The right-hand rule indicates the positive direction of the angular velocity pseudovector.
which, by the definition of the cross product, can be written:

====Addition of angular velocity vectors====

With this operation defined like this, angular velocity, which is a pseudovector, becomes also a real vector because it has two operations:

==Rotating frames==

Given a rotating frame composed by three unitary vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed in any instant. In such a frame each vector is a particular case of the previous case (moving particle), in which the module of the vector is constant.
Though it is just a particular case of the previous one, is a very important one for its relationship with the rigid body study, and special tools have been developed for this case. There are two possible ways to describe the angular velocity of a rotating frame: the angular velocity vector and the angular velocity tensor. Both entities are related and they can be calculated from each other.

===Angular velocity vector for a frame===

It is defined as the angular velocity of each of the vectors of the frame, in a consistent way with the general definition.
It is known by the Euler's rotation theorem that for a rotating frame there exists an instantaneous axis of rotation in any instant. In the case of a frame, the angular velocity vector is over the instantaneous axis of rotation.
Any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has to behave as a two dimensional rotation. Thus, the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time t is consistent with the two dimensions case.
Angular velocity is a vector defining an addition operation. Components can be calculated from the derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frame (Euler angles or rotation matrices)

====Addition of angular velocity vectors in frames====

As in the general case, the addition operation for angular velocity vectors can be defined using movement composition. In the case of rotating frames, the movement composition is simpler than the general case because the final matrix is always a product of rotation matrices.

====Components from the vectors of the frame====

Substituting in the expression

====Components from Euler angles====

The components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by Leonhard Euler using his Euler angles and an intermediate frame made out of the intermediate frames of the construction:
Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector over these three axes was the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decompose the instant rotation in three instantaneous Euler rotations). Therefore:K.S.HEDRIH: Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and rigid body dynamics
This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:
where IJK are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aeroengineering.info/angspeedconventions.html |title=online tool to calculate angular speed vectors |publisher=Aeroengineering.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23[/tpl]

====Components from infinitesimal rotation matrices====

The components of the angular velocity vector can be calculated from infinitesimal rotations (if available) as follows:

===Angular velocity tensor===

Given the orientation matrix A(t) of a frame, we can obtain its instant angular velocity tensor W as follows. We know that:
As angular speed must be the same for the three vectors of a rotating frame, if we have a matrix A(t) whose columns are the vectors of the frame, we can write for the three vectors as a whole:
And therefore the angular velocity tensor we are looking for is:

===Properties of angular velocity tensors [tpl]anchor|Angular velocity tensor[/tpl]===

In general, the angular velocity in an n-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor which is a second rank skew-symmetric tensor.
This tensor W will have n(n-1)/2 independent components and this number is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the Lie group of rotations of an n-dimensional inner product space.Rotations and Angular Momentum on the Classical Mechanics page of the website of John Baez, especially Questions 1 and 2.

====Exponential of W====

In three dimensions angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are dual to pseudovectors in three dimensions.
And if the angular speed is constant then [tpl]math|W[/tpl] is also constant and the equation can be integrated. The result is:
which shows a connection with the Lie group of rotations.

====W is skew-symmetric====

Applying the formula (AB)t = BtAt:
Thus, W is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is a skew symmetric matrix.

====Duality with respect to the velocity vector====

The tensor is a matrix with this structure:

===Coordinate-free description===

Because of W is the derivative of an orthogonal transformation, the
Taking the dual vector L* of L we get
where
by definition.

===Angular velocity as a vector field===

For angular velocity tensor maps velocities to positions, it is a vector field. In particular, this vector field is a Killing vector field belonging to an element of the Lie algebra so(3) of the 3-dimensional rotation group SO(3). This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector.

==Rigid body considerations==

The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point which is moving with a linear velocity V(t) in each instant.
To obtain the equations it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed "laboratory" system.
As shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point O, the rigid body system origin is at O' and the vector from O to O' is R. A particle (i) in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is Ri in the lab frame, and at position ri in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:
Taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:
or
Substituting ω for W into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:
It can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the "spin" angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point O' about the origin O.

===Consistency===

We have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.
The above two yields that
If the reference point is the instantaneous axis of rotation the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a pure rolling spherical rigid body.
