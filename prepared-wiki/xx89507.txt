==Branch line==

The Uxbridge High Street branch was intended to be extended across the town to a point just south of Uxbridge Vine Street railway station, the terminus of the GWR branch from West Drayton. Whilst some land was purchased, and the lines extended over High Street via a bridge,Mitchell & Smith, fig. XXX  this proposal was abandoned in 1914.
The branch from Uxbridge High Street ran along the west side of Shire Ditch and Frays River and through the centre of the present Denham Country Park. A triangular junction with the main line at the north end connected west towards Denham and east towards West Ruislip. The three junctions were named Denham South, Denham West and Denham East. The curve between the South and East Junctions was little used, and closed during World War I.
The locations of the curves joining the main line can be seen in the landscape today, forming the northern perimeters of the park's northern lake and woodland adjacent to Uxbridge Golf Course.

==Route==

Most services from Uxbridge High Street ran to Denham via Denham West Junction, with some extended two stations further west to Gerrards Cross.
