The style was once banned at Japanese schools and became a widespread topic of the civic right to self-expression, but discussion of the topic died down due to the ubiquity of the style.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Imidas | title = 茶髪 | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-07-26 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shueisha | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | trans_title = Chapatsu | oclc = 506996961[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends98/honbun/ntj990202.html|title=Brown But Not Brazen|date=3 February 1999|publisher=Trends in Japan|accessdate=6 October 2012[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The word Chapatsu is formed from two kanji: [tpl]linktext|茶[/tpl], meaning "tea" and [tpl]linktext|髪[/tpl], meaning "hair". Chapatsu originally referred to a variety of colors of hair dye, including blonde, red, orange, and blue, it now refers to a brown-tea hue.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru Daijisen | title = 茶髪 | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-07-26 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | trans_title = Chapatsu | oclc = 56431036[/tpl] In Japanese the word is also frequently written in hiragana syllabary.

==Style==

While the style itself began to show up in Tokyo streets during the early to mid-1990s, chapatsu was first described in Imidas, an annual publication of new words and concepts in the Japanese language, in 1997. Chapatsu did not appear in Kōjien, an authoritative dictionary of the Japanese language, until 1998. The style first gained popularity among adolescent girls, seeking to accentuate their tanned skin (rebelling against more traditional definitions of beauty), but quickly grew into the mainstream.

Chapatsu came to be allowed as not only young people but also members of society according to the type of business, and it was established before long as one of the Japanese fashions.
