==Career==

===2004–08: Early work and film debut===

Before starting her career off as an actress, Sonam and Ranbir Kapoor worked as assistant directors under Sanjay Leela Bhansali in 2004, and assisted him during the making of his film, Black which was released in early 2005.[tpl]cite web|title=Sonam Kapoor Biography|url=http://in.movies.yahoo.com/artists/Sonam-Kapoor/biography-14551.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl]
She made her acting debut alongside newcomer, Ranbir Kapoor in Bhansali's Saawariya (2007), which failed to do well at the box office,[tpl]cite web|title=Box Office 2007|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214&catName=MjAwNw==|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=9 January 2008[/tpl] but her performance opened to mixed to good reviews by critics.[tpl]cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Movie Review: Saawariya|date=9 November 2007|url=http://www.indiafm.com/movies/review/12780/index.html|publisher=IndiaFM|accessdate=3 December 2007[/tpl] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama commented saying, "Sonam Kapoor is an average actor. However, her role doesn't give her the opportunity to display histrionics. She looks gorgeous at places, but plain ordinary at times."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/201636 |title=Saawariya (2007) | Hindi Movie Critic Review By Taran Adarsh |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl] Sonam had no release in 2008, although, was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, though lost out to actress Deepika Padukone for Om Shanti Om, which, coincidentally was released alongside Saawariya.

===2009–12: Breakthrough and professional setbacks===

In 2009, Kapoor appeared in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Delhi-6, opposite Abhishek Bachchan. The film flopped at the box office and received mixed critical reviews, but her performance was praised and she received recognition from within and outside the film industry. Critic Rajeev Masand commented, "Sonam Kapoor is the revelation in Delhi 6. She's a firecracker, instinctive and uninhibited in what isn't even a conventional female lead".[tpl]cite web|author=Masand, Rajeev|title=Delhi-6, a film with heart|date=21 February 2009|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-movie-review-delhi6-a-film-with-heart/85915-8-p1.html|publisher=IBN Live|accessdate=21 February 2009[/tpl] Sonia Chopra, film criric from Rediff commented, "Sonam Kapoor is an earnest and effortless performer so she does make you like the character somewhat, despite the typical Delhi-girl recipe".[tpl]cite web|author=Chopra, Sonia|title=Delhi-6, a tad too loud|date=20 February 2009|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/review-delhi-6-a-tad-too-loud-review-bollywood-14859289.html|publisher=IBN Live|accessdate=21 February 2009[/tpl]
In 2010, she appeared in Punit Malhotra's I Hate Luv Storys opposite Imran Khan. The film went on to become her first box office success, collecting over [tpl]INRConvert|400|m[/tpl] at the domestic box office.[tpl]cite web|title=I Hate Luv Stories Box office Update|url=http://www.indicine.com/movies/bollywood/i-hate-luv-stories-box-office-update/|publisher=Indicine|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=I Hate Luv Stories, a hit|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/i-hate-luv-stories-a-hit/643373/|publisher=Screenindia.com|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl] Kapoor also garnered positive reviews for her performance as film critic Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama commented saying, "Sonam is a revelation. From salwars Delhi 6 to skirts in I Hate Luv Storys, Sonam finally gets a role that does justice to her as an actress. The ease and class with which she carries off the glam look is fantastic. She's like a whiff of fresh air and you actually wonder, is she the same girl from Saawariya and Delhi 6? In fact, I Hate Luv Storys will only multiply Imran and Sonam's fan base manifold."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/534726 |title=I Hate Luv Storys (2010) | Hindi Movie Critic Review By Taran Adarsh |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]
She next appeared in the romantic comedy, Aisha, opposite Abhay Deol, which was a decent success at the box office, as it was declared an "average" grosser.[tpl]cite web|title=AISHA charms box office with a stylish opening – 10 Aug 2010|url=http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/10/aug/10-aisha-charms-box-office-with-a-stylish-opening-081005.asp|accessdate=10 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=318&catName=MjAxMA== |title=BOI |publisher=Box Office India |accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] Kapoor also received mainly positive to mixed reviews for her performance. Film critic Sonia Chopra of Sify.com gave a favourable review stating, "Sonam Kapoor gives an ace performance as the somewhat nasty-sometimes angelic Aisha. With this role rendered so perfectly, Sonam has proven herself to be an actor to watch out for, capable of belting out an entire range of emotions".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/aisha-review-this-one-goes-perfectly-with-the-popcorn-review-bollywood-14952231.html |title=Movie Review : Aisha review: This one goes perfectly with the popcorn |publisher=Sify.com[/tpl] NDTV Movies also gave a positive review as they wrote, "But the film belongs to Sonam Kapoor, make no mistake of that. She makes the best of a rather rare opportunity for an Indian leading lady to be part of a Bollywood film that salutes Victorian mores and Delhi's elitist affectations in one clean cool sweep".[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/review-aisha-538 |title=Review: Aisha | NDTV Movies.com |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=6 August 2010[/tpl] However, Rajeev Masand of IBN Live only gave a mixed review, as he said, "...doesn't help that Sonam Kapoor offers a cardboard cutout personality to the lead. She plays the airhead convincingly and pulls off the flighty princess part, but flounders when it comes to drumming up tears, anger or hurt", after criticising the writing of the character.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masand-aisha-is-a-tiring-film/128359-47-84.html |title=Masand: 'Aisha' is a tiring film |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=13 August 2010[/tpl]
Sonam's first release in 2011, Thank You was a critical failure, although the film was a moderate success at the box office, as its collections surpassed the [tpl]INRConvert|450|m[/tpl] mark.[tpl]cite web|title=All India 2011 (Figures in INR Crore)|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=368&catName=MjAxMQ==|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl] The same year, she made an appearance at the 64th Cannes Film Festival representing L'Oréal, the brand she endorses in India. Her second film of the year was the romance film Mausam, in which she and co-star Shahid Kapoor had four different looks representing each of the four seasons. The film received mixed reviews and was a failure at the box office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxdetail.php?page=shownews&articleid=3512&nCat= |title=Force Decent Opening Mausam Fails |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl] However, Kapoor's performance was appreciated by most prominent critics. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV commented, "Sonam Kapoor may still have some way to go as an actress, but she conveys the essential vulnerability of a girl forever under duress, bringing out just the right mix of feminine fragility and native resolve."[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_review.aspx?lang=hindi&id=653&moviename=Mausam |title=Review: Mausam |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]
Her first release of 2012 is Players, a remake of The Italian Job, alongside Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu and Neil Nitin Mukesh. The film received mixed to negative reviews and didn't do well at the box office. Her performance received mainly mixed reviews from top critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama stated that, "It's an image transformation for Sonam in Players. She has never done a full-on glamorous role before and Players should change the perception. However, the rawness, as an actor, shows in a variety of scenes."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/540906 |title=Players (2012) | Hindi Movie Critic Review By Taran Adarsh |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl] Later that year, Kapoor made her second appearance at the Cannes Film Festival.

===2013–present: Success and recent work===

Kapoor made her third appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2013, representing not only L'Oréal, but also some Indian brands (dress by Huemn and jewellery by Suhani Pittie). Her first release of 2013, Raanjhanaa, opened to a positive critical reception[tpl]cite news|title=Critics review Raanjhanaa: watch it for performances, first half|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Critics-review-Raanjhanaa-watch-it-for-performances-first-half/Article1-1080116.aspx|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=21 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Raanjhanaa Review|url=http://www.indicine.com/bollywood/raanjhanaa/reviews/|publisher=Indicine|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] and proved to be a commercial success, netting [tpl]INRConvert|340|m[/tpl] nett approx domestically in the first week.[tpl]cite web|title=Raanjhanaa Is A HIT|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&articleid=5803&nCat=|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]
Kapoor's portrayal of Zoya Haider, a headstrong but emotional middle class girl, earned her a positive critical reception, with Komal Nahta saying that "Sonam Kapoor looks very pretty and plays Zoya beautifully. The character of Zoya has tremendous range and Sonam does full justice to it. Her transition is amazing."[tpl]cite web|last=Nahta|first=Komal|title=RAANJHANAA Review|url=http://komalsreviews.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/raanjhanaa-review/|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] Rajeev Masand adds that "Kapoor does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya’s inherent vulnerability."[tpl]cite web|last=Masand|first=Rajeev|title=Bleeding heart: Raanjhanaa|url=http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/bleeding-heart/|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl]  For her performance in the film, Kapoor has been nominated for "Best Actress" at several award ceremonies, including the prestigious Filmfare Award for Best Actress.
