Chopped, Screwed, Live and Unglued is a Korn fanpack of See You on the Other Side,  including two CDs and one DVD in set, issued by Virgin Records on September 26, 2006.

==Overview==

The compilation features remixes of selected songs from See You on the Other Side made using chopped and screwed technique by DJ Michael "5000" Watts, exclusive mash-up remix entitled "Coming Undone wit It" with Atlanta crunk-rap group, Dem Franchize Boyz along with two fan remixes of hit single "Coming Undone" from the winners of the Acid Planet remix contest, as well as live performances recorded in various locations, two acoustic renditions of singles - "Twisted Transistor", and "Coming Undone", previously unreleased, animated video for the song "Liar", music videos for "Twisted Transistor", and "Coming Undone" and interviews with the band. Korn is the first alternative metal band to have an album chopped and screwed, as this method of remixing is often reserved for Southern Rap style groups, or music stylings.
