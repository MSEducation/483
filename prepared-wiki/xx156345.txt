"Schrei nach Liebe" ("Scream for love") is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It is the second track and the first single from their 1993 album Die Bestie in Menschengestalt. It is one of the best known political anthems and anti-fascist songs in Germany and was made in the context of the Riot of Hoyerswerda.

==Content and music style==

The verses tell the story of a fictional right-wing extremist, who gets insulted. Excerpts from the songs lyrics (with English translation): 
In the chorus the insults go further: 
The chorus ends with "Arschloch", which is German for Asshole. 

==Music video==

In the beginning three men wielding a chainsaw, an axe and something on a chain, with evil glints in their eyes, walk towards a church. Two children, one of them dark-skinned, run inside the church and hide under coffins. The weapon-wielding men find two old women and a man (Rod) sitting inside the church as Farin and Bela B. rise from the coffins and start to read the fascist morals. The three men are stunned by what they are told and their tough exterior shell breaks. In the end of the song, the two children who had run in to find sanctuary in the church clean their faces, removing the make-up which had ringed their eyes.
