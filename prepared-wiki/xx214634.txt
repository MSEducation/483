A government member oversaw the production of Sabaidee Luang Prabang so that it portrayed Laotian culture in a positive manner and cut any scenes that the Lao government may perceive to be controversial.

==Release==

The film premiered on May 24, 2008 at one of Laos' two theaters (both located in its capital, Vientiane) and was released in Thai on June 5. Open-air screenings occurred throughout Laos, including the UNESCO World Heritage city of Luang Prabang. Upon its release, it was the first Laotian private film, authorities seeing Sabaidee Luang Prabang as the start of a new source of income. The aim of the film was also to encourage bilateral cooperation between Thailand and Laos.
