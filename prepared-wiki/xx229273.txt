WJEZ broadcasts the Chicago Cubs. Whenever the Cubs were playing the St. Louis Cardinals, sister stations WJBC and WJBC-FM carried the Cardinals radio broadcasts as well, making it so that the two sister stations carried the same game, but with different broadcasts.  WJEZ broadcasts high school football games, along with WJBC's Friday night football show.
On November 29, 2012, WJEZ changed their format from adult contemporary to classic hits.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/79773/wjez-shifts-to-classic-hits/
