In number theory, Skewes' number is any of several extremely large numbers used by the South African mathematician Stanley Skewes as upper bounds for the smallest natural number x for which

==Skewes' numbers==

John Edensor Littlewood, Skewes' teacher, proved (in [tpl]harv|Littlewood|1914[/tpl]) that there is such a number (and so, a first such number); and indeed found that the sign of the difference π(x) − li(x) changes infinitely often. All numerical evidence then available seemed to suggest that π(x) is always less than li(x), though mathematicians familiar with Riemann's work on the Riemann zeta function would probably have realized that occasional exceptions were likely by the argument given below (and the claim sometimes made that Littlewood's result was a big surprise to experts seems doubtful). Littlewood's proof did not, however, exhibit a concrete such number x.
[tpl]harvtxt|Skewes|1933[/tpl] proved  that, assuming that the Riemann hypothesis is true, there exists a number x violating π(x) In [tpl]harv|Skewes|1955[/tpl], without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, Skewes managed to prove that there must exist a value of x below
Skewes' task was to make Littlewood's existence proof effective: exhibiting some concrete upper bound for the first sign change. According to George Kreisel, this was at the time not considered obvious even in principle. The approach called unwinding in proof theory looks directly at proofs and their structure to produce bounds. The other way, more often seen in practice in number theory, changes proof structure enough so that absolute constants can be made more explicit.
Although both Skewes' numbers are big compared to most numbers encountered in mathematical proofs, neither is anywhere near as big as Graham's number.

==More recent estimates==

These (enormous) upper bounds have since been reduced considerably by using large scale computer calculations of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The first estimate for the actual value of a crossover point was given by [tpl]harvtxt|Lehman|1966[/tpl], who
showed that somewhere between 1.53[tpl]e|1165[/tpl] and 1.65[tpl]e|1165[/tpl] there are more than 10500 consecutive integers x with π(x) > li(x).
Rigorously, [tpl]harvtxt|Rosser|Schoenfeld|1962[/tpl] proved that there are no crossover points below x = 108, and this lower bound was subsequently improved by [tpl]harvtxt|Brent|1975[/tpl] to 8[tpl]e|10[/tpl], and by [tpl]harvtxt|Kotnik|2008[/tpl] to 1014.
There is no explicit value x known for certain to have the property π(x) > li(x), though computer calculations suggest some explicit numbers that are quite likely to satisfy this.
[tpl]harvtxt|Wintner|1941[/tpl] showed that the proportion of integers for which π(x)-li(x) is positive, and [tpl]harvtxt|Rubinstein|Sarnak|1994[/tpl] showed that this proportion is about .00000026, which is  surprisingly large  given how far one has to go to find the first example.

==Riemann's formula==

Riemann gave an explicit formula for π(x), whose leading terms are (ignoring some subtle convergence questions)
where the sum is over zeros ρ of the Riemann zeta function. The largest error term in the approximation π(x) = li(x) (if the Riemann hypothesis is true) is li([tpl]radic|x[/tpl])/2, showing that li(x) is usually larger than π(x). The other terms above are somewhat smaller, and moreover tend to have different complex arguments so mostly cancel out. Occasionally however, many of the larger ones might happen to have roughly the same complex argument, in which case they will reinforce each other instead of cancelling and will overwhelm the term li([tpl]radic|x[/tpl])/2. The reason why the Skewes number is so large is that these smaller terms are quite a lot smaller than the leading error term, mainly because the first complex zero of the zeta function has quite a large imaginary part, so a  large number (several hundred) of them need to have roughly the same argument in order to overwhelm the dominant term. The chance of N random complex numbers having roughly the same argument is about 1 in 2N. This explains why π(x) is sometimes larger than li(x), and also why it is  rare for this to happen. It also shows why finding places where this happens depends on large scale calculations of millions of high precision zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The argument above is not a proof, as it assumes the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are random which is not true. Roughly speaking, Littlewood's proof consists of Dirichlet's approximation theorem to show that sometimes many terms have about the same argument.
In the event that the Riemann hypothesis is false, the argument is much simpler, essentially because  the terms li(xρ) for zeros violating the Riemann hypothesis (with real part greater than 1/2) are  eventually larger than li(x1/2).
