CATEGORIES: Hasbro products, 2000s toys, Marvel Comics action figure lines

Iron Man 2 is a toy line manufactured by Hasbro,  composed mainly of 3[tpl]fraction|3|4[/tpl]" scale action figures based on the movie of the same name. This is the company's second 3[tpl]fraction|3|4[/tpl]" line based on a Marvel movie following X-Men Origins: Wolverine and like that line will include figures modeled after characters from the movie as well as figures based on their comic book counterparts.

==Single Carded 3[tpl]fraction|3|4[/tpl]" Figures==

All of the single-carded figures come with three "armor cards" and a stand that will hold both the figure and the cards. Variants or running changes that share the same numbering as the original figure are noted by an asterisk to the right of a figure followed by "W#", with # being the wave that the variant was released alongside.

==Hall of Armor Collection (Target Exclusive)==

This series consists of movie-based figures from wave 1 of the single carded series, repackaged with interlocking light-up bases. The figures lack the accessories that were originally included in the single carded release. The only physical difference from the singled carded series is on the Iron Man Mark VI figure, which has silver markings, making it more movie-accurate. This later became a running change on the single-carded figure.
