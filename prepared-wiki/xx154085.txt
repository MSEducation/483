Since 2005 the Galerie Traversée has promoted bridging the gap between renowned and young artists in contemporary art. The gallery’s concept aims at building up obscure but extraordinary artists. Along with internationally established contemporary artists, Galerie Traversée integrates those young artists to the gallery's program to make them accessible to a broad audience. Video, photography, sculpture, installation art and painting are the media which are represented by Galerie Traversée. Special attention is given to artists that face today’s world with acuteness and sophisticated criticism while they likewise question political and social manifestations of contemporary society.
The Galerie Traversée is an art gallery in the city of Munich, Germany. Situated in the famous Kunstareal Munich, it can be quickly reached by tram or by foot from the Karlsplatz or Marienplatz. It was founded by Dr. Judit Bönisch in 2005 and quickly gained a reputation for being on the cutting edge of contemporary art development with its selected number of international artists.
