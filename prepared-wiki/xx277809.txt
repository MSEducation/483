CATEGORIES: Presbyterian denominations in South Korea, Presbyterian denominations in Asia

The Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDongSeongHoe) came into existence out of a desire to maintain the unity of the Presbyterian Church in Korea (BoSuHapDong). But a number of concerned pastors formed this denomination in 1987. They want to " gather the members in a holy meeting ". The denomination subscribes the Apostles Creed and the Westminster Confession. In 2004 it had 10,013 members in 78 congregations and 64 ordained ministers in 5 Presbyteries.http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=13124&lg=eng
