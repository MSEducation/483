[[Philadelphia Firebirds (IWFL)]]

The Philadelphia Firebirds are a women's football team in the Independent Women's Football League based in Philadelphia.  They are in the Eastern Conference, North Atlantic Division with the Boston Militia, New York Nemesis, and New York Sharks.  The team was formerly known as the Philadelphia Phoenix and formerly played in the National Women's Football Association.  Upon moving to the IWFL, they changed their name so as to avoid confusion with their fellow IWFL franchise, the Carolina Phoenix.
Philadelphia's first women's tackle football team was founded in 2001 as the Philadelphia Liberty Belles. The Belles won the inaugural NWFL Championship that year. In 2002, the Belles lost in the semi-final playoff round. Heading into the 2003 season, the team split and the Philadelphia Phoenix was formed. The two teams existed simultaneously until the Philadelphia Liberty Belles eventually folded. The Liberty Belles have since reformed for the 2009 season and have joined the new WFA.
