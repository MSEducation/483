An extremophile (from Latin [tpl]lang|la|extremus[/tpl] meaning "extreme" and Greek [tpl]lang|grc-Latn|philiā[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|φιλία[/tpl]) meaning "love") is an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth.Rampelotto, P. H. (2010). Resistance of microorganisms to extreme environmental conditions and its contribution to Astrobiology. Sustainability, 2, 1602-1623.Rothschild, L.J.; Mancinelli, R.L. Life in extreme environments. Nature 2001, 409, 1092-1101 In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles.

==Characteristics==

In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbial life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments — niches that are extraordinarily hot, or acidic, for example — that would be completely inhospitable to complex organisms. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far under the ocean's surface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA [/tpl] According to astrophysicist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, "There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth — and we know they're very hardened to radiation."[tpl]cite web |author=BBC Staff |title=Impacts 'more likely' to have spread life from Earth |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14637109 |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2011[/tpl] On 6 February 2013, scientists reported that bacteria were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in Antarctica.[tpl]cite web |last=Gorman |first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html |date=6 February 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=6 February 2013 [/tpl] On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on the Earth.[tpl]cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=17 March 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Glud |first1=Ronnie |last2=Wenzhöfer |first2=Frank |last3=Middleboe |first3=Mathias |last4=Oguri |first4=Kazumasa |last5=Turnewitsch |first5=Robert |last6=Canfield |first6=Donald E. |last7=Kitazato |first7=Hiroshi |title=High rates of microbial carbon turnover in sediments in the deepest oceanic trench on Earth |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1773.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo1773 |date=17 March 2013 |journal=Nature Geoscience |accessdate=17 March 2013 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..284G [/tpl] Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 1900 feet below the sea floor under 8500 feet of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.[tpl]cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life Thrives in Ocean Floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=17 March 2013 [/tpl] According to one of the researchers,"You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are."

==Morphology==

Most known extremophiles are microbes. The domain Archaea contains renowned examples, but extremophiles are present in numerous and diverse genetic lineages of bacteria and archaeans. Furthermore, it is erroneous to use the term extremophile to encompass all archaeans, as some are mesophilic. Neither are all extremophiles unicellular; protostome animals found in similar environments include the Pompeii worm, the psychrophilic Grylloblattidae (insects), Antarctic krill (a crustacean) and Tardigrades (water bears).

==Classifications==

There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and termed as polyextremophiles. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as Thermococcus barophilus.Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. IJSEM, p. 351-359, 49, 1999. A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the Atacama Desert might be a radioresistant xerophile, a psychrophile, and an oligotroph. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low pH levels.

==In astrobiology==

Astrobiology is the field concerned with forming theories, such as panspermia, about the distribution, nature, and future of life in the universe. In it, microbial ecologists, astronomers, planetary scientists, geochemists, philosophers, and explorers cooperate constructively to guide the search for life on other planets. Astrobiologists are particularly interested in studying extremophiles, as many organisms of this type are capable of surviving in environments similar to those known to exist on other planets. For example, Mars may have regions in its deep subsurface permafrost that could harbor endolith communities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] The subsurface water ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa may harbor life, especially at hypothesized hydrothermal vents at the ocean floor.
Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 times "g" (the normal acceleration due to gravity). Paracoccus denitrificans was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful  growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |work=National Geographic- Daily News|publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |coauthors=Hirokazu Shimoshige, Mikiko Tsudome, Sada-atsu Mukai, Robert W.

On 29 April 2013, French scientists, funded by NASA, reported that, during spaceflight on the International Space Station, microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways "not observed on Earth" and in ways that "can lead to increases in growth and virulence".[tpl]cite journal |author=Tengra FK et al. |title=Spaceflight Promotes Biofilm Formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062437 |date=29 April 2013 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=e6237 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062437 |accessdate=5 July 2013 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...862437K [/tpl]

==Examples==

New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid asphalt lake, Pitch Lake. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 106 to 107 cells/gram.Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake. the physics arXiv blog 15 April 2010.Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert. Likewise, until recently boron tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of Bacillus boroniphilus, borophiles came into discussion.A novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, Bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth. Extremophiles Vol. 11, p. 217-224. Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.

==Industrial uses==

The thermoalkaliphilic catalase, which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, Thermus brockianus, found in Yellowstone National Park by Idaho National Laboratory researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30°C to over 94°C and a pH range from 6-10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other  catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the T. brockianus catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from Aspergillus niger had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.[tpl]cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]

==DNA transfer==

Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell’s chromosome.Johnsborg O, Eldholm V, Håvarstein LS. (2007). Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function. Res Microbiol 158(10):767-78. Review. PMID 17997281  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.
The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  D. radiodurans is competent to perform genetic transformation.Moseley BE, Setlow JK. (1968). Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 61(1):176-83. PMID 5303325  PMCID: PMC285920  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.  The extreme thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and other related Thermus species are also capable of genetic transformation.Koyama Y, Hoshino T, Tomizuka N, Furukawa K. (1986). Genetic transformation of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus and of other Thermus spp. J Bacteriol. 166(1):338-40. PMID 3957870
Halobacterium volcanii, an extreme halophilic archaeon, is capable of natural genetic transformation.  Cytoplasmic bridges are formed between cells that appear to be used for DNA transfer from one cell to another in either direction.Rosenshine I, Tchelet R, Mevarech M.  (1989). The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium.  Science 245(4924):1387-9. PMID 2818746
Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are hyperthermophilic archaea. Exposure of these organisms to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induces species-specific cellular aggregation.Fröls S, Ajon M, Wagner M, Teichmann D, Zolghadr B, Folea M, Boekema EJ, Driessen AJ, Schleper C, Albers SV. (2008). UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation. Mol Microbiol 70(4):938-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06459.x. PMID 18990182Ajon M, Fröls S, van Wolferen M, Stoecker K, Teichmann D, Driessen AJ, Grogan DW, Albers SV, Schleper C. (2011). UV-inducible DNA exchange in hyperthermophilic archaea mediated by type IV pili. Mol Microbiol 82(4):807-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07861.x.  PMID 21999488  UV-induced cellular aggregation of S. acidocaldarius mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency.  Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude.  Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to repair damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination.  Van Wolferen et al.van Wolferen M, Ajon M, Driessen AJ, Albers SV. (2013). How hyperthermophiles adapt to change their lives: DNA exchange in extreme conditions. Extremophiles 17(4):545-63. doi: 10.1007/s00792-013-0552-6.  PMID 23712907 noted that this DNA exchange process may be crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperatures. It has also been suggested that DNA transfer in Sulfolobus may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damageBernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).
