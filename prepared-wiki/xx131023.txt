At 0-1 down the tykes went on to win the game 2-1, giving Letheren his first clean sheet on his tykes debut. Barnsley that year went on to beat Liverpool & Chelsea and reached the fa cup semi finals
He was loaned to Doncaster Rovers for the second-half of the 2008–2009 season as cover for veteran goalkeeper Neil Sullivan,[tpl]cite web|title=Doncaster sign Letheren on loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/doncaster/7853495.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] but he didn't make an appearance for them.
He was released from his contract in the summer of 2009[tpl]cite news|title=Quartet to leave Oakwell|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11687/5294329/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] and then signed a short-term contract with Plymouth Argyle in the Championship to provide cover for Romain Larrieu.[tpl]cite web|title=Plymouth sign goalkeeper Letheren|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/8189778.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl]
On 31 December 2009, Letheren was released from Plymouth Argyle after his contract expired.[tpl]cite news|title=Pilgrims let trio leave|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/5818104/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] In April 2010, he agreed to join Motherwell until the end of the season,[tpl]cite web|title=Goalkeeper Kyle Letheren agrees Motherwell deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8616494.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] but the Scottish Premier League blocked the move as it was outside the transfer window.[tpl]cite web|title=SPL block Letheren's Motherwell move|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/motherwell/169940-spl-block-letherens-motherwell-move/|publisher=STV|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] He remained at fir park to train with the squad for the remainder of the season
Letheren signed for Kilmarnock in August 2010 to provide backup to Cammy Bell.[tpl]cite web|title=Goalkeeper Kyle Letheren joins Kilmarnock|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8902687.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 August 2010|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] Letheren failed to make an appearance for Kilmarnock in his first season, mostly down to the form of Bell.

Later that year he was handed his full SPL debut away to Dunfermline, in a 2-1 win.
During the 2012-2013 season, Cammy Bell suffered an injury leading to Letheren having a run in the first team. That run lasted until mid-October, when Bell returned. His second run in the first team came in early-February, when he played twice, he was involved in a 2-0 win over motherwell & in what was his last appearance for the club, a 1-1 draw against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.[tpl]cite news|title=Inverness CT 1-1 Kilmarnock|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21348199|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 February 2013|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl]
