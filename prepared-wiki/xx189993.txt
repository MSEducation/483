Southeast Engine was an indie-folk-rock band from Athens, Ohio.  With the help of The Wrens, the band signed with Misra Records in 2007 and released their first internationally distributed album, "A Wheel Within A Wheel," later that year.  The band played both the CMJ and South By Southwest Music Festivals.

==History==

Founding members Adam Remnant (lead vocals, guitar) and Leo DeLuca (drum kit, percussion) grew up in Dayton, Ohio and attended the same high school during the 1990s. During this time, underground bands like Guided By Voices, Brainiac, and Swearing at Motorists made significant and long-standing impressions upon the two. Around 2000, the pair moved to Athens, Ohio and were equally inspired by the Appalachian old-timey and folk music of the area. As a hybridization of the Dayton musical underground and the Athens folk scene, Southeast Engine was formed in 2000. Soon after formation, Michael Lachman (keyboards) joined  and the current lineup now also includes Jesse Remnant (Adam's younger brother) on bass guitar.
Conrad Dillon played on, engineered, and helped produce the group's first 2 records -- Love is a Murder, a Mystery of Sorts and One Caught Fire -- at 178 N. Congress St. in Athens, Ohio. Josh Antonuccio then played on, engineered, and helped produce the following two records -- Coming to Terms with Gravity and A Wheel Within A Wheel -- at 3 Elliott Studio also in Athens.
The group performed at the annual Nelsonville Music Festival in Nelsonville, Ohio in 2008, 2011, and 2012.  "Past Shows." Stuart's Opera House: Nelsonville, Ohio.
