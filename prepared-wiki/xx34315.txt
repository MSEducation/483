[[Bhaga]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu gods, Adityas, Rigvedic deities

Sanskrit [tpl]IAST|bhaga[/tpl] is a term for "lord, patron", but also for "wealth, prosperity". The cognate term in Avestan and Old Persian is [tpl]lang|peo-Latn|baga[/tpl], of uncertain meaning but used in a sense in which "lord, patron" might also apply. A Slavic cognate is [tpl]lang|sla-Latn|bog[/tpl] "god". While the word "bog" denoted nearly all Slavic gods, the word Deva in its cognate Div was used only for the creator god - Rod, the Slavic equivalent of Brahma.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The semantics is similar to English lord (from hlaford "bread warden"), the idea being that it is part of the function of a chieftain or leader to distribute riches or spoils among his followers. The name Baghdad shares its origins with the Middle Persian baga (baga-data: "god given", modern Persian: "Baghdad")
Personified, [tpl]IAST|Bhaga[/tpl] is  one of the Adityas, a god of wealth and marriage in Hinduism. Virabhadra, a great powerful hero created by Shiva, once blinded him. In the Rigveda Bhaga is the god who supervises the distribution of goods and destiny to each man corresponding to his merits. The word apparently, is cognative to "Bhagavan" and "Bhagya", terms used in several Indian languages to refer to God & destiny respectively.
In some references Bhag, Bhaga or Bhagya is miss-termed as Lord Sun. In fact Bhagya is the son of Lord Sun. Father Sun awarded him with the powers to give away or take away anything from the human race. He is the real and practical benefactor among all the 33 Crore deities.
