===Agriculture===

North Dakota's earliest industries were fur trading and agriculture. Although less than 10% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector,[tpl]cite web| url =http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US38&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP3&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-redoLog=false | title=North Dakota — DP-3.

The share of people employed in agriculture is comparatively high: [tpl]as of|2008[/tpl], only approximately 2-3 percent of the population of the United States is directly employed in agriculture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/qlinks/extension.html |title=Extension |publisher=Csrees.usda.gov |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2012[/tpl] North Dakota has about 90% of its land area in farms with [tpl]convert|27500000|acre|km2[/tpl] of cropland, the third largest in the nation.  Between 2002 and 2007 total cropland increased by about one million acres (4,000 km²), the only state showing an increase.  Over the same period, [tpl]convert|1800000|acre|km2[/tpl] were shifted into soybean and corn production, the largest such shift in the United States.United States Department of Agriculture (December 2009). 2007 Census of Agriculture. 1.

The state is the largest producer in the U.S. of many cereal grains including barley (36% of U.S. crop), durum wheat (58%), hard red spring wheat (48%), oats (17%), and combined wheat of all types (15%). It is the second leading producer of buckwheat (20%).  As of 2007, corn became the state's largest crop produced, although only 2% of U.S. production. The Corn Belt extends to North Dakota, but is situated more on the edge of the region instead of in its center. Corn yields are high in the southeast part of the state and smaller in other parts of the state. Most of the cereal grains are grown for livestock feed.
The state is the leading producer of many oilseeds including 92% of the U.S. canola crop, 94% of flax seed, 53% of sunflower seeds, 18% of safflower seeds, and 62% of mustard seed. Canola is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of canola for oil production produces canola meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed. Soybeans are also an increasingly important crop with [tpl]convert|400000|acre|km2[/tpl] additional planted between 2002 and 2007. Soybeans are a major crop in the eastern part of the state and cultivation is common in the southeast part of the state. Soybeans were not grown in North Dakota in the 1940s, but it has become more common in the last 50 years and especially since 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Trends_in_U.S._Agriculture/Oats_and_Soybeans/index.asp |title=NASS - Publications - Trends in U.S. Agriculture |publisher=Nass.usda.gov |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=October 23, 2012[/tpl] In North Dakota soybeans have to mature fast, because of the comparatively short growing season. Soybeans are grown for livestock feed.
North Dakota is the second leading producer of sugarbeets, grown in the Red River Valley.  The state is also the largest producer of honey, dry edible peas and beans, lentils, and the third largest producer of potatoes.

The energy industry is a major contributor to the economy. North Dakota has both coal and oil reserves. Shale gas is also produced. Lignite coal reserves in Western North Dakota are used to generate about 90% of the electricity consumed, and electricity is also exported to nearby states.State Renewable Fuels Profile.

==Transportation==

Transportation in North Dakota is overseen by the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The major Interstate highways are Interstate 29 and Interstate 94, with I-29 and I-94 meeting at Fargo, with I-29 oriented north to south along the eastern edge of the state, and I-94 bisecting the state from east to west between Minnesota and Montana.  A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system, is that virtually all of it is paved in concrete, rather than blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure.  The largest rail systems in the state are operated by BNSF and the Canadian Pacific Railway. Many branch lines formerly used by BNSF and Canadian Pacific Railway are now operated by the Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad and the Red River Valley and Western Railroad.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.dmvwrr.com/ |title=Dakota, Missouri Valleya and Western Railroad |publisher=Dakota, Missouri Valleya and Western Railroad | accessdate = October 5, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.rrvw.net/about/about.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Red River Valley and Western Railroad| accessdate = October 5, 2007[/tpl]

==Governance==

As with the federal government of the United States, power in North Dakota is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.[tpl]cite web| title = State Government | url = http://www.nd.gov/category.htm?id=82 | publisher=State of North Dakota | accessdate =  October 6, 2007 [/tpl]

===Executive===

The executive branch is headed by the governor. The current governor is Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who took office December 7, 2010 after his predecessor, John Hoeven won his race for U.S. Senate, and resigned to prepare for that office. The current Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota is Drew Wrigley, who is also the President of the Senate. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor have four-year terms, which are next up for election in 2016. The governor has a cabinet consisting of the leaders of various state government agencies, called commissioners. The other elected constitutional offices are secretary of state, attorney general, state auditor, and state treasurer.

===Legislative===

The North Dakota Legislative Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The state has 47 districts. Each district has one senator and two representatives. Both senators and representatives are elected to four-year terms. The state's legal code is named the North Dakota Century Code.

===Judicial===

North Dakota's court system has four levels. Municipal courts serve the cities, and most cases start in the district courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction.

===Federal===

North Dakota's United States Senators are John Hoeven (R) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-NPL). The state has one at-large congressional district represented by Representative Kevin Cramer (R).
Federal court cases are heard in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, which holds court in Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot. Appeals are heard by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis, Missouri.

===Politics===

The major political parties in North Dakota are the Democratic-NPL and the Republican Party. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], the Constitution Party and the Libertarian Party are also organized parties in the state.
At the state level, the governorship has been held by the Republican Party since 1992, along with a majority of the state legislature and statewide officers. Dem-NPL showings were strong in the 2000 governor's race, and in the 2006 legislative elections, but the League has not had a major breakthrough since the administration of former state governor George Sinner.
The Republican Party presidential candidate usually carries the state; in 2004, George W. Bush won with 62.9% of the vote. Of all the Democratic presidential candidates since 1892, only Grover Cleveland (1892, one of three votes), Woodrow Wilson (1912 and 1916), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932 and 1936), and Lyndon B. Johnson (1964) received Electoral College votes from North Dakota.
On the other hand, Dem-NPL candidates for North Dakota's federal Senate and House seats have won every election between 1982 and 2008, and the state's federal delegation was entirely Democratic from 1987 to 2011.
