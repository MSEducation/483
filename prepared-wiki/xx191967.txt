==History==

Swift was founded in 1965.Swift Leisure :: History[tpl]dl|date=December 2013[/tpl] The company started with the single Swift brand of caravans, based on a distinctive tri-front window design (all of which opened - unique at the time), which also allowed easy see through to the rear for the driver whilst travelling.
Following the break-up of the travelling caravan business of Cosalt plc, in 1994 the company acquired the Cosalt brand of  Abbey, followed in 1994 with the purchase of Sprite leisure and the Ace brand in 2001. Since late 2008 Swift Leisure has dropped the Abbey and Ace brands of touring caravans. Within the Swift International division, the company has operations in Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand.Swift Leisure :: Swift International[tpl]dl|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The company moved manufacturing from Hedon Road, Kingston upon Hull to Dunswell Lane, near Cottingham in 1970. In the early 2000s the company moved to an adjacent site in Cottingham to allow expanded production facilities.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.hull.co.uk/news.asp?PageID=74&MediaCategoryID=9&NewsID=261&MediaType=news| title = Plans Unveiled for Multi Million Pound Scheme to Safeguard Jobs and Ease Traffic Problems| date = 15 June 2005| work = www.hull.co.uk|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url = http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/8216-Remarkable-8217-spirit-community/story-11978667-detail/story.html| title = 'Remarkable' spirit of a community| date = 13 July 2009|work= This is Hull and East Riding|accessdate=2 February 2013|quote = ..Cottingham's own caravan maker, the Swift Group, based at Dunswell Road. The story of Swift Caravans is a rags-to-riches affair, since a company that in 2007 had sales of Â£191.3 million, began life in 1964 as a small operation located in a garage on Hedon Road, Hull.
