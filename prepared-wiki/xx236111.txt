The Indestructible Beat of Soweto, later repackaged as The Indestructible Beat of Soweto Volume One, is a compilation album released in 1985 on the Earthworks label, featuring musicians from South Africa, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Mahlathini.

==Overview==

The album was conceived by white South African expatriates Trevor Herman and Jumbo Vanrenen and released in 1985 on the British-based Earthworks label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-01-05/music/not-yet-uhuru/|publisher=The Village Voice|accessdate=17 October 2009|title=Not Yet Uhuru|first=Robert|last=Christgau[/tpl]  The following year it was released in the USA by the Shanachie Records label.  It features twelve tracks by artists from South Africa.  The sleeve notes state that all songs are in the mbaqanga style, a guitar-based style popular at the time in the townships of Johannesburg and Durban, but the tracks actually cover four different styles, mbaqanga, mqashiyo, maskanda, and isicathamiya.  The former two are the least traditional-sounding of the styles, while the latter two styles incorporate elements of urban and more rural music.  Released prior to the more commercially successful Graceland by Paul Simon, it was one of the first albums of contemporary South African music to be widely available outside the country.[tpl]cite book|title=Focus: Music of South Africa|first=Carol Ann|last=Muller|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|page=86|isbn=0-415-96071-1[/tpl]
The album has been re-released several times and also spawned a succession of later volumes in the Indestructible Beat series, released by the Earthworks label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/mahotella_queens_36643/en_US|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=17 October 2009|title=Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens|first=Banning|last=Eyre[/tpl]
