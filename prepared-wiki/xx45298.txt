==Biography==

Getty was born to Sarah Catherine McPherson Risher and George Getty, who was in the petroleum business, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was one of the first people in the world with a fortune estimated at over one billion U.S. dollars.
He enrolled at the University of Southern California, then at University of California, Berkeley, before graduating in 1914 from Magdalen College, Oxford, with degrees in economics and political science. He spent his summers between studies working on his father's oil fields in Oklahoma. Running his own oil company in Tulsa, he made his first million by June 1916. The Nancy Taylor No. 1 Oil Well Site near Haskell, Oklahoma, was crucial to his early financial success. This oil well was the first to be drilled by J.P. Getty. However, in 1917, he announced that he was retiring to become a Los Angeles-based playboy. Although he eventually returned to business, Getty had lost his father's respect.  Just before George Franklin Getty died in 1930, he believed that Jean Paul would destroy the family company, and told him so.
After taking a few years off from the money-making grind to enjoy spending his earnings on women, Getty returned to Oklahoma in 1919. During the 1920s, he added about $3 million to his already sizable estate. His succession of marriages and divorces (three during the 1920s, five throughout his life) so distressed his father, however, that J. Paul inherited a mere $500,000 of the $10 million the senior Getty left at his death in 1930.
Shrewdly investing his resources during the Great Depression, Getty acquired Pacific Western Oil Corporation, and he began the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation, which included Tidewater Oil and Skelly Oil. In 1967 the billionaire merged these holdings into Getty Oil.
Beginning in 1949, Getty paid Ibn Saud $9.5 million in cash and $1 million a year for a 60-year concession to a tract of barren land near the border of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. No oil had ever been discovered there, and none appeared until four years and $30 million had been spent. From 1953 onward, Getty's gamble produced [tpl]convert|16000000|oilbbl[/tpl] a year, which contributed greatly to the fortune which made him one of the richest people in the world.
Getty increased the family wealth, learning to speak Arabic which enabled his unparalleled expansion into the Middle East. Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Associates identified his overall wealth at between $2 billion and $4 billion. It didn't come easily, perhaps inspiring Getty's widely quoted remark—"The meek shall inherit the earth, but not the mineral rights.""Thoughts On The Business Of Life" at Forbes
He moved to Britain in the 1950s and became a prominent Anglophile. He lived and worked at his 16th century Tudor estate, Sutton Place near Guildford, Surrey; the traditional country house became the centre of Getty Oil and his associated companies and he used the estate to entertain his British and Arabian friends (including the British Rothschild family and numerous rulers of Middle Eastern countries). Getty lived the rest of his life in the British Isles, dying of heart failure at the age of 83 on June 6, 1976.

===Marriages, divorces and children===

Getty was married and divorced five times. He had five sons with four of his wives:Vallely, Paul. Don't keep it in the family. The Independent (London), 19 July 2007. Retrieved 6 September 2008.
At age 99, in 2013, Getty's fifth wife, Louise—now known as Teddy Getty Gaston—published a memoir reporting how Getty had scolded her for spending money too freely in the 1950s on the treatment of their six-year-old son, Timmy, who'd become blind from a brain tumor. Timmy died at age 12, and Getty, living in England apart from his wife and son back in the U.S., did not attend the funeral. Teddy divorced him that year.[tpl]cite news|last=Newman|first=Judith|title=His Favorite Wife: ‘Alone Together,’ by Teddy Getty Gaston|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/alone-together-by-teddy-getty-gaston.html?ref=books|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 August 2013[/tpl]
Getty was quoted as saying "A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure", and "I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success."The Price of Success

===Coin-box telephone===

Getty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place, helping to seal his reputation as a miser.[tpl]cite news |title=J. Paul Getty III oil Scion.. |first=Elaine |last= Woo |page= B4 |newspaper= The Desert Sun |date= Feb 8, 2011[/tpl] In his autobiography, he described his reasons:
Getty placed dial-locks on all the regular telephones, limiting their use to authorised staff, and the coin-box telephone was installed for others.

==Grandson's kidnapping==

On July 10, 1973 in Rome, kidnappers abducted 16-year-old John Paul Getty III  and, over the telephone, demanded $17 million for his safe return. However, "the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather."Sir Paul Getty (obituary). Telegraph, April 17, 2003. John Paul Getty, Jr. asked his father for the money, but was refused.Profile: Sir John Paul Getty II. BBC News, June 13, 2001.
In November 1973 an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million: "This is Paul’s ear. If we don’t get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits."
When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million—the maximum that would be tax deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in Southern Italy shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html?hp|work=The New York Times|first=Bruce|last=Weber|title=J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors|date=February 7, 2011[/tpl] Nine people were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted.J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors The New York Times, February 7, 2011. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011 at the age of 54.
Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added:
