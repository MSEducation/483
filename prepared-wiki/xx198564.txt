Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy, and Culture is a book by Alan Sokal  detailing the history of the Sokal affair in which he submitted an article full of "nonsense".

His critique would also gain more credibility from encompassing his own community: the failure of scientific institutions to address the abuse of statistical methods or promote systematic reviews is no less of a threat to progress than the ramblings of postmodernists or fundamentalists."
