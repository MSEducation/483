Some of the clay pits used by the brickworks are now lakes and there are also two disused Portland Cement Company chalk pits, one of which is the Blue Lagoon, which hosts fishing and sailing clubs. Although the lake is private, large numbers of people go there to swim. There have been a number of drownings that have been reported in the national news. In 2001 three children died when the car they were in was accidentally driven into the lake.[tpl]cite web | publisher=Bedford Today | url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Lagoon-plunge-driver-is-charged.283705.jp | title= Lagoon plunge driver is charged  | accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] Most recently a teenager drowned while swimming in April 2007.[tpl]cite web | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6569123.stm | title= Drowned teenager named by police  | accessdate=2008-02-11 | date=18 April 2007[/tpl]
