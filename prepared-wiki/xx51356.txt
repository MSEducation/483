[[Whistling thrush]]

CATEGORIES: Myophonus, Bird genera

The whistling thrushes comprise a genus Myophonus (MyiophoneusDelacour 1942 (Auk 146-264) writes "the proper spelling is Myiophoneus Temminck and Laugier, 1822 Myophonus T. and L., 1822 is an orthographic error, as well as Myophoneus in their tables, x859, while Myiophonus Agassiz, 1846, is an unnecessary emendation.") of the family Muscicapidae. 
They are all medium-sized mostly insectivorous or omnivorous birds. They are all brightly coloured species found in India and southeast Asia. The male is usually blue, and the females are either similar to the male or brown.
The brighter blue patches found on the shoulders and sometimes the head, of whistling thrushes, uniquely for a passerine, reflect strongly in the ultraviolet.[tpl]cite journal|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| title= Bright Ultraviolet Colouration in the Asian Whistling-Thrushes (Myiophonus spp.)|volume= 263|issue= 1372|pages= 843â€“848|year=1996|author=Staffan Andersson|doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0124[/tpl]
Many of the species are confined to single islands or countries.
Species:
Javan, Bornean and Brown-winged were formerly lumped as Sunda Whistling Thrush, but split by Collar (2004).

==Habits==

Whistling thrushes are mostly seen in hilly areas except during winter when they may descend to streams near the plains. They specialize in feeding on snails and their strong hooked bills are used to deal with them. They may choose a particular rock on which they crack the shells.Delacour 1942
The nests are usually in crevices of rocks and boulders close to water. The cup nests have moss and twigs and is lined with roots and leaves. The eggs are usually three and sometimes four, elongate with a gray ground colour and marked with speckles.
