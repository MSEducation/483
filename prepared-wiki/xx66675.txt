Robert N. "Rob" Buck (August 1, 1958, Jamestown, New York – December 19, 2000, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was a founding member and guitarist of 10,000 Maniacs from 1981 until his death from liver disease in 2000. Some of his compositions with Natalie Merchant are among the most popular songs recorded by 10,000 Maniacs, including "What's the Matter Here", "Hey Jack Kerouac", "You Happy Puppet" and "These Are Days".

==Biography==

Buck also played in the short-lived Texas-based superstar-band League of Blind Women, writing much of the band's material.  In 2000, while on tour in upstate New York, he was rushed to the hospital when it was discovered he was suffering from acute liver disease. He was transferred to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center for treatment where his condition soon worsened despite the efforts of the leading transplant teams at the facility.
