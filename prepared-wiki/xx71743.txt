Johan Marius Nicolaas "Johannes" Heesters (5 December 1903 – 24 December 2011) was a Dutch-born actor of stage, television and film as well as a vocalist of numerous recordings and performer on the concert stage, with a career dating back to 1921. Active almost exclusively in the German-speaking world from the mid-1930s, he was a controversial figure for his actions during the Second World War and his success in Nazi Germany.'Heesters was Methusalem van Nederlandse podiumkunsten' [tpl]nl icon[/tpl] Heesters was considered one of the oldest stage performers in history.

==Early life==

Heesters was born in Amersfoort, Netherlands, the youngest of four sons. His father Jacobus Heesters (1865–1946) was a salesman and his mother Geertruida Jacoba van den Heuvel (1866–1951), a homemaker.
Heesters was fluent in German from a very early age having lived for several years in the household of a German great uncle from Bavaria.Peter Czada/Günter Große: Comedian Harmonists. Ein Vokalensemble erobert die Welt, p. 15, Edition Hentrich, Berlin 1993; ISBN 978-3-89468-082-4 Heesters decided to become an actor and a singer at the age of sixteen and began vocal training. Heesters specialized in Viennese operetta very early in his career, and made his Viennese stage debut in 1934 in Carl Millöcker's Der Bettelstudent (The Beggar Student).

==Nazi Germany==

Aged 31, Heesters permanently moved to Germany with his wife and daughters in 1935. During his time there, he performed for Adolf Hitler and visited the Dachau concentration camp which made him a controversial figure for many Dutch.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7249119.stm |title=Nazi-era singer returns to stage |date=17 February 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 February 2008[/tpl] Joseph Goebbels placed Heesters on the Gottbegnadeten list as an artist considered crucial to Nazi culture."Goebbels' Gottbegnadeter" by Alfred Wagner, Jüdische Allgemeine (11 December 2008) [tpl]De icon[/tpl]
Heesters is known to have funded the German war machine by donating money to the weapons industry.[tpl]cite book|last=Ross|first=Beatrix|title=Johannes Heesters, Beatrix Ross: Johannes Heesters.

He always denied having visited concentration camps, although he did have knowledge of their existence.Anna Reimann "Johannes Heesters – KZ-Besuch ohne Gesang?" Der Spiegel, 22 August 2006 [tpl]De icon[/tpl]
According to German author Volker Kühn, Heesters did in fact perform for the SS in Dachau concentration camp. For this claim he uses as evidence the testimony of Dachau inmate Viktor Matejka who worked for the SS and told Kühn he pulled the curtain when Heesters performed in 1941."Der Sänger will nur geredet haben", Süddeutsche Zeitung (27 November 2008) [tpl]De icon[/tpl]"Schlagabtausch um Heesters' KZ-Auftritt" Mitteldeutsche Zeitung (27 November 2008) [tpl]De icon[/tpl] According to German writer Jürgen Trimborn however, the interview with Matejka may not be reliable as it occurred some fifty years after the performance was said to have taken place."Experte sieht keine Beweise für Heesters-Auftritt im KZ Dachau" Neue Musikzeitung (24 October 2008) [tpl]De icon[/tpl] In December 2009, Heesters lost his libel suit against Kühn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7785613.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Nazi-era singer loses libel suit|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] While acknowledging having visited the camp, Heesters denied having performed as entertainment for the SS troops. In its ruling, the German court did not find that Kühn's allegations were true, but rather that too much time had passed for an accurate determination of fact to be made.Case citation: Kammergericht Berlin 10 U 6/09
Heesters' signature tune was Count Danilo Danilovitch's entrance song "[tpl]lang|de|Da geh' ich ins Maxim[/tpl]" from Franz Lehár's [tpl]lang|de|Die Lustige Witwe[/tpl] (The Merry Widow).

==After the war==

Heesters worked extensively for UFA until almost the end of the Second World War (his last wartime movie being [tpl]lang|de|Die Fledermaus[/tpl], produced in 1945) and easily made the transition from the Nazi-controlled cultural scene to post-war Germany and Austria, appearing again in a number of films. These included [tpl]lang|de|Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach[/tpl] and the 1957 version of [tpl]lang|de|Viktor und Viktoria[/tpl]. Heesters stopped making movies around 1960 to concentrate on stage and television appearances and on producing records.
In later years Heesters spoke fondly of Hitler as a person, but condemned his political stance."Historiker darf weiter von Heesters' SS-Auftritt sprechen", Der Spiegel (16 December 2008) [tpl]De icon[/tpl] In the 1990s, he and his wife toured Germany and Austria with Curth Flatow's play [tpl]lang|de|Ein gesegnetes Alter[/tpl] (A Blessed Age), which was also televised in 1996. On 5 December 2003, he celebrated his 100th birthday with a television special [tpl]lang|de|Eine Legende wird 100[/tpl] (A legend turns 100) on the ARD television channel.
On his 100th birthday Heesters received the title "[tpl]lang|de|Kammersänger[/tpl]". In December 2004, aged 101, Heesters appeared in Stuttgart at the [tpl]lang|de|Komödie im Marquardt[/tpl] theatre in a show commissioned on the occasion of his 100th birthday, [tpl]lang|de|Heesters – eine musikalische Hommage[/tpl]. In 2005 aged 102 he was featured as a soloist in a major concert tour with the [tpl]lang|de|Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg[/tpl] under the direction of Scott Lawton.
On 5 December 2006 Heesters celebrated his 103rd birthday with a concert at the [tpl]lang|de|Wiener Konzerthaus[/tpl]. On 5 December 2007 he celebrated his 104th birthday with a concert at the Admiralspalast, Berlin, and in February 2008 he performed in his home country for the first time in four decades amidst protests against his Nazi associations.
Heesters apologised for calling Adolf Hitler a "good chap" on the popular German TV show [tpl]lang|de|Wetten, dass..?[/tpl] on Saturday, 13 December 2008, aged 105. He said that he had said something stupid and horrible and asked for forgiveness."Mr. Sexy meets Ministerin" by Silke Burmester, Der Spiegel, 14 December 2008 [tpl]De icon[/tpl]] In addition, German media suggested that he had failed to understand the show's satirical nature."Hitler war ein guter Kerl" by Thomas Burmeister, Stern, 4 December 2008] [tpl]De icon[/tpl]
Heesters became less active in his last years and played smaller roles, as he began to lose his eyesight due to macular degeneration and could not perform on stage for long periods of times. Unable to read a teleprompter, he had to memorize his lines before a show.
