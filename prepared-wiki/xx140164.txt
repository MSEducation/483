[[Sturgeon Pool]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Ulster County, New York, Wallkill River

Sturgeon Pool is a reservoir near the hamlet of Rifton, in the Town of Esopus in Ulster County, New York. 
It was created by damming the Wallkill River just above its confluence with Rondout Creek for hydroelectricity (thus the flow of the Wallkill that reaches the Rondout is greatly attenuated, making the Wallkill a rare instance of a river that drains into a creek).
Writer J MacKinnon says that due to damning of the water supplies and over-fishing, there are now no sturgeon in Sturgeon Pool.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=1RyqAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA168&dq=%22Sturgeon%20Pool%22&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q=%22Sturgeon%20Pool%22&f=false | title=The Once and Future World: Nature as It Was, as It Is, as It Could Be | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | author=MacKinnon, J.
