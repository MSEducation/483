These socks come in a variety of styles—defined by the knitting pattern of the upper. The two most popular styles are the traditional 2×2 rib knit (pictured) and tube-style loose socks, which are thigh-high length tube socks worn pushed down around the ankles. 
They were adopted as a fashion which flattered plump calves and also expressed rebellious deviation from Japan's strict dress code for school uniforms.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-iaiARtuCaIC&pg=PA810 |title=Japan: The Rough Guide |first=Jan |last=Dodd |coauthors=Simon Richmond |publisher=Rough Guides |location=London |edition=1st |date=1999 |page=810 |isbn=9781858283401 |oclc=441275694[/tpl] It is used as an inspiration for photography by Akira Gomi.
