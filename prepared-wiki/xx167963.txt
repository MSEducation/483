Paul Marney (born 28 April 1982) is an English footballer currently unattached. 
Marney first came to prominence during the 2001/02 season when his allegedly 'improper' registration for St. Patrick's Athletic resulted in the League deducting the club nine points. St Pat's took the League to arbitration and won their case (Marney had already been playing for the club for some time).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2002/0412/world/st-pats-keep-mum-til-report-published-26585.html |title=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2002/0412/world/st-pats-keep-mum-til-report-published-26585.html |author=George, Bill |newspaper=Irish Examiner |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl] 
Marney made 29 appearances and scored one goal during that league campaign for the Saints, and though League winners' medals were awarded to both Shelbourne and St Pat's (due to further alleged irregularities), the Saints maintain that they are the sole and rightful League Champions for that season. The League's system for registering players was subsequently changed. He made 16 appearances the following season but after falling out of favour at Richmond Park, Marney was plucked from there before the closure of the final 2003 season transfer window when Trevor Anderson signed him for Dundalk.
Paul scored his first goal for Dundalk against Galway United F.C. in 2004. Marney also had previous spells with West Ham United F.C. and Sutton United F.C..
Marney won a FAI First Division winners medal after the 2008 season with Dundalk but he departed the Lilywhites after that season and has since has moved back to England.
