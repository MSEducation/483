Pelican Lake is a lake located about seven miles north of Pelican Rapids, in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, United States.  Pelican Lake is now a highly developed lake with its major uses being predominantly recreation, but its fishing is also excellent.  The lake was recently discovered to be infested with zebra mussels, which threatens not only Pelican Lake, but all lakes connected by the Pelican River.
