CATEGORIES: Greek-language surnames

The name Nevrakis is a Greek surname of Greek origin.

==Description==

The name has its origin from a feud in Greece. The Turks and the Greeks were fighting for possession of parcels of land on the Island of Crete. Some of the Turks had barricaded off a section of land. Several of the Greeks in the ensuing fight were wounded but successful in winning possession of the land. Thus gaining the reputation of being courageous or nervy. The Greeks having very little education and so not being able to read and write began to call themselves by this name. Thus the surname Nevrakis was born. In the United States of America it has been changed to Nevers.
