The Boeing 777 is a family of long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of [tpl]convert|5235|to|9380|nmi|km|lk=in[/tpl]. Commonly referred to as the "Triple Seven",[tpl]cite news |last=Robertson |first=David |date=March 13, 2009 |title=Workhorse Jet Has Been Huge Success with Airlines that Want to Cut Costs |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5898240.ece |deadurl=yes |work=The Times |location=London, England, United Kingdom |publisher=Times Newspapers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612140321/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5898240.ece |archivedate=June 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |subscription=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Grantham |first=Russell |url=|title=Delta's new Boeing 777 Can Fly Farther, Carry More |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |quote=Delta will put the new "triple seven" — as airline folks call the jet — into service March 8.[/tpl] its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, six wheels on each main landing gear, a circular fuselage cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between Boeing's 767 and 747. As Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner, it has computer-mediated controls; it is also the first entirely computer-designed commercial aircraft.
The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths [tpl]As of|2014|lc=y[/tpl]. The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is [tpl]convert|33.3|ft|abbr=on|adj=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] longer, entered service in 1998. The longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while a freighter version, the 777F, debuted in February 2009. Both longer-range versions and the freighter feature General Electric GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips. The earlier 777-200, -200ER and -300 versions are equipped with GE90, Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. The 777-200LR is the world's longest-range airliner and can fly more than halfway around the globe; it holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft.
United Airlines first placed the 777 into commercial airline service on June 7, 1995. The 777 has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of February 2014, 60 customers had placed orders for 1,548 aircraft of all variants, with 1,178 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 464 delivered and over 700 orders, and Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 127 passenger and freighter aircraft as of June 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/Emirates.htm|title=Emirates Fleet |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] The 777 has been involved in four hull-loss accidents as of March 2014; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of commercial service.
The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, upcoming Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8X and 777-9X models, collectively named 777X, featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787.

==Development==

===Background===

In the early 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar became the first generation of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service.[tpl]Harvnb|Wells|Rodrigues|2004|p=146[/tpl] In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its venerable 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946981,00.html |title=The 1980s Generation |work=Time |date=August 14, 1978 |accessdate=July 19, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/19/business/new-boeing-airliner-shaped-by-the-airlines.html |title=New Boeing Airliner Shaped by the Airlines|date=December 19, 1990 |last=Weiner |first=Eric |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=98, 102–103[/tpl] The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=99–104[/tpl] These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=128[/tpl] Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants.[tpl]Harvnb|Yenne|2002|p=33[/tpl] Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=112[/tpl]
By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=126[/tpl] McDonnell Douglas was working on the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing their A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X,[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=127[/tpl] to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies like the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=106[/tpl] The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=11[/tpl] Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.
Airline customers were unimpressed with the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new design, which became the 777 twinjet.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|pp=9–14[/tpl] The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=129[/tpl] On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.

===Design effort===

The design phase for Boeing's new twinjet was different from the company's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines – had a role in the development of the airliner.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|pp=13–16[/tpl] This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input. The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the "Working Together" group. At the first group meeting in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines, asking each what it wanted in the new design. By March 1990, Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747's, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and 10 percent better seat-mile costs than the A330 and MD-11. Boeing also selected its Everett factory in Washington, home of 747 production, as the final assembly site for the 777.[tpl]cite web |last=Lane |first=Polly |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911201&slug=1320330 |title=Aerospace Company May Be Rethinking Commitment To The Puget Sound Area |work=Seattle Times |date=December 1, 1991 |accessdate=October 15, 2009[/tpl]
On October 14, 1990, United Airlines became the 777's launch customer when it placed an order for 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11 billion with options on an additional 34.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971474,00.html |title=Business Notes: Aircraft |work=Time |date=October 29, 1990 |accessdate=July 19, 2008[/tpl] The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=14[/tpl] United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a hot and high airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United,[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=13[/tpl] given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=132[/tpl] In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=15[/tpl] The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=20[/tpl] The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options for the basic aircraft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64618874.html |title=BA Gets New 777 Model |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=February 10, 1997 |accessdate=May 8, 2011[/tpl]
The 777 was the first commercial aircraft designed entirely on computer.[tpl]cite book|title=An Introduction to Mechanical Engineering.|publisher=Cl-Engineering|isbn=978-1-111-57680-6|page=19|quote=As an example, the Boeing 777 was the first commercial airliner developed through a paperless computer-aided design process.[/tpl]  Each design drawing was created on a three-dimensional CAD software system known as CATIA, sourced from Dassault Systemes and IBM.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=133[/tpl] This lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft, in simulation, to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly—thus reducing costly rework.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=133–134[/tpl] Boeing developed their own high-performance visualization system, FlyThru, later called IVT (Integrated Visualization Tool) to support large-scale collaborative engineering design reviews, production illustrations, and other uses of the CAD data outside of engineering.[tpl]Harvnb|Abarbanel|McNeely|1996|p=124[/tpl] Note: IVT is still active at Boeing in 2010 with over 29,000 users. Boeing was initially not convinced of CATIA's abilities and built a physical mock-up of the nose section to verify its results. The test was so successful that additional mock-ups were canceled.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=21[/tpl]

===Production and testing===

The production process included substantial international content, with an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner,[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=108[/tpl] exceeded only by the later 787.[tpl]cite news |last=Hise |first=Phaedra |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2007/07/01/100123032/index.htm|title=The power behind Boeing's 787 Dreamliner|publisher=CNN|date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=October 15, 2009[/tpl]  International contributors included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (fuselage panels),[tpl]cite news |last=Richardson |first=Michael |url=http://spiderbites.nytimes.com/iht/1994/02/00000.html |title=Demand for Airliners Is Expected to Soar: Asia's High-Flying Market |work=International Herald Tribune |date=February 23, 1994 |accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl] Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd.

The initial 777-200 model was launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers, General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce,[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=136–137[/tpl] giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2000/03/01/62872/a-question-of-choice.html |title=A question of choice |work=Flight International |date=January 3, 2000 |accessdate=March 29, 2009[/tpl] Each manufacturer had agreed to develop an engine in the [tpl]convert|77000|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] and higher thrust class (a measure of jet engine output) to power the world's largest twinjet.
To accommodate production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5 billion to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993.[tpl]Harvnb|Sabbagh|1995|pp=168–169[/tpl] By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%200691.html |title=Boeing prepares for stretched 777 launch |date=March 31, 1993 |last=Norris |first=Guy |work=Flight International |accessdate=May 8, 2011[/tpl] Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4 billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2 billion from suppliers.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=7[/tpl]
On April 9, 1994, the first 777, line number WA001, was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100,000 invited guests.[tpl]Harvnb|Sabbagh|1995|pp=256–259[/tpl] The first flight took place on June 12, 1994,[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=107[/tpl] under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=25[/tpl] This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model.[tpl]cite web |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930816&slug=1716209 |title=Boeing's 777 Will Be Tops When It Comes To ETOPS |work=Seattle Times |last=Andersen |first=Lars |date=August 16, 1993 |accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl] Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=40[/tpl] To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=20[/tpl] The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=34[/tpl] At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.

===Entry into service===

Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15, 1995.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=69[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16824929.html |title=First Boeing 777 delivery goes to United Airlines|work=Business Wire |date=May 15, 1995 |accessdate=December 1, 2008[/tpl] The FAA awarded 180-minute ETOPS clearance ("ETOPS-180") for the Pratt & Whitney PW4084-engined aircraft on May 30, 1995, making it the first airliner to carry an ETOPS-180 rating at its entry into service.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=139[/tpl]  Longer ETOPS clearance of 207 minutes was approved the following October.180-minute ETOPS approval was granted to the General Electric GE90 powered 777 on October 3, 1996, and to the Rolls-Royce Trent 800-powered 777 on October 10, 1996. The first commercial flight took place on June 7, 1995, from London Heathrow Airport to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=80[/tpl]
On November 12, 1995, Boeing delivered the first model with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways,Eden 2004, p. 115. which placed the aircraft into service five days later.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=143[/tpl] Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear issues, which caused the airline to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997. British Airways' aircraft returned to full service later that year, and General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=144[/tpl]
The first Rolls-Royce Trent 877-powered aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways International on March 31, 1996, completing the introduction of the three powerplants initially developed for the airliner.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=147[/tpl] Each engine-aircraft combination had secured ETOPS-180 certification from the point of entry into service.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=146–147[/tpl] By June 1997, orders for the 777 numbered 323 from 25 airlines, including satisfied launch customers that had ordered additional aircraft. Operations performance data established the consistent capabilities of the twinjet over long-haul transoceanic routes, leading to additional sales.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958033.htm?campaign_id=tbw |title=Boeing Roars Ahead |work=BusinessWeek |date=November 6, 2005 |accessdate=December 1, 2008[/tpl] By 1998, the 777 fleet had approached 900,000 flight hours.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=148[/tpl]  Boeing states that the 777 fleet has a dispatch reliability (rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues) above 99 percent.777 Reliability Data BoeingTrouble-plagued Dreamliner only 98% reliable, Boeing admits Boeinghttp://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/777family/pf/pf_background.page[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avbuyer.com/articles/detail.asp?Id=2363|title=Aircraft Reliability |last1=Wyndham |first1=David |date=October 2012|website=AvBuyer |publisher= World Aviation Communication Ltd |accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl]

===Initial derivatives===

After the original model, Boeing developed an increased gross weight variant of the 777-200 with greater range and payload capability.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=113[/tpl] Initially named 777-200IGW, the 777-200ER first flew on October 7, 1996, received FAA and JAA certification on January 17, 1997, and entered service with British Airways on February 9, 1997.Haenggi, Michael. "777 Triple Seven Revolution". Boeing Widebodies. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI, 2003. ISBN 0-7603-0842-X. Offering greater long-haul performance, the variant became the most widely ordered version of the aircraft through the early 2000s. On April 2, 1997, a Malaysia Airlines -200ER named "Super Ranger" broke the great circle "distance without landing" record for an airliner by flying eastward from Boeing Field, Seattle to Kuala Lumpur, a distance of [tpl]convert|10823|nmi|km[/tpl], in 21 hours and 23 minutes.
Following the introduction of the -200ER, Boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the airliner. On October 16, 1997, the 777-300 made its first flight.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/background.html |title=The Boeing 777 Program Background |work=Boeing |accessdate=June 6, 2009[/tpl]  At [tpl]convert|242.4|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, the -300 became the longest airliner yet produced (until the A340-600), and had a 20 percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=151[/tpl] The -300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the FAA and JAA on May 4, 1998,[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=125[/tpl] and entered service with launch customer Cathay Pacific on May 27, 1998.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=151–157[/tpl]
From the start of the development program, Boeing had considered building ultra-long-range variants.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=165[/tpl] Early plans centered on a 777-100X proposal,[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=165–167[/tpl] which would have been a shortened version of the -200 with reduced weight and increased range, similar to the 747SP.[tpl]cite web |last=Norris |first=Guy |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1996/05/15/16991/boeing-sets-decision-date-for-new-versions-of-777.html|title=Boeing sets decision date for new versions of 777|work=Flight International|date=May 15, 1996|accessdate=March 29, 2009[/tpl] However, the -100X would have carried fewer passengers than the -200 while having similar operating costs, leading to a higher cost per seat. By the late 1990s, design plans shifted to longer-range versions of existing models. A more powerful engine in the [tpl]convert|100000|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] and higher thrust class was required, leading to active discussions between Boeing and the engine manufacturers. General Electric offered to develop the GE90-115B engine, while Rolls-Royce proposed developing the Trent 8104 engine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jae/jae010213_2_n.shtml |date=February 13, 2001 |title=Aero-Engines – Rolls-Royce Trent |publisher=Jane's Transport Business News |accessdate=March 21, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325005849/http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jae/jae010213_2_n.shtml |archivedate= March 25, 2008[/tpl] In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, beating out rival proposals. As part of the deal with General Electric, Boeing agreed they would only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions.

===Longer-range models===

On February 29, 2000, Boeing launched its next-generation twinjet program,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/746327/ |title=Boeing launches stretch 777 jetliner |work=Deseret News |date=February 29, 2000 |accessdate=October 28, 2009[/tpl] initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development of the long-range models was slowed by the airline industry downturn, which lasted through the early 2000s. The first model to emerge from the program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France,[tpl]cite web |last=Song |first=Kyung |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20001005&slug=TTKK1QJ4T |title=Air France orders 10 777s |work=Seattle Times |date=October 5, 2000 |accessdate=September 15, 2009[/tpl] along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/2004/03/15/daily17.html?jst=b_ln_hl |title=Boeing's 777-300ER receives certification |work=Wichita Business Journal |last=Dinell |first=David |date=March 16, 2004 |accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl] The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, gaining orders as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets because of their lower operating costs.[tpl]cite web |last= Thomas |first= Geoffrey |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/demand-rises-for-fuel-saver-777/story-e6frg95x-1111116616439 |title= Boeing under pressure as demand rises for fuel-saver 777 |work=The Australian |date= June 13, 2008 |accessdate=June 20, 2008[/tpl]

In 2010, Boeing announced plans to increase 777 production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid-2011, and 8.3 per month by early 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/20/351122/boeing-unveils-another-increase-in-boeing-777-production.html |title=Boeing unveils another increase in Boeing 777 production |work=Air Transport Intelligence via Flightglobal.com |date= December 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |first=Lori |last=Ranson[/tpl] Complete assembly of each 777-300ER requires 49 days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=2012 |title=Boeing Begins Work on 1,000th 777 |date=November 7, 2011 |work=Boeing |accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl] In November 2011, Boeing began assembly of the 1,000th 777, a -300ER model for Emirates; the aircraft was rolled out in March 2012. In late 2011, the FAA assigned a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fsims.faa.gov/wdocs/fsb/b-787_fsb.pdf |title=Flight Standardization Board Report |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Federal Aviation Administration |accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl] The smaller 787 was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project.[tpl]harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|pp=32–35.[/tpl]  According to industry reports, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new product family, the Boeing Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.
By the late 2000s, the 777 was facing the possibility of increased competition from Airbus' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed variants of the 787, both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a [tpl]convert|5000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] maximum zero-fuel weight increase, equivalent to a higher payload of 20–25 passengers; its GE90-115B1 engines received a 1–2.5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher-altitude airports.  More design changes were targeted for late 2012, including possible extension of the wingspan,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/11/02/349052/world-airliners-order-trickle-continues-for-in-production.html |title= Order trickle continues for in-production widebodies |work=Flight International |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 2, 2010[/tpl] along with other major changes, including a composite wing, new powerplant, and different fuselage lengths.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/03/17/339599/boeing-looks-to-extend-777-wingspan-for-incremental-improvement.html |title= Boeing looks to extend 777 wingspan for incremental improvement package |author= Ostrower, Jon |work=Flight International |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 17, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/06/21/358550/paris-boeing-mulls-777-9x.html |title= PARIS: Boeing mulls 777-9X |author= Ostrower, Jon |work=Air Transport Intelligence via Flightglobal.com |date= June 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 4, 2011[/tpl] Emirates was reported as working closely with Boeing on the project, with the possibility of being the launch customer for new versions of the 777."Emirates may be launch customer for new Boeing 777".

In September 2011, Boeing released more details on proposed new 777 versions, collectively referred to as 777X and tentatively designated 777-8X and 777-9X. The 777-9X is to feature extended horizontal stabilizers compared to the 777-300ER and a fuselage stretch of [tpl]convert|7.0|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] to a total length of [tpl]convert|250|ft|11|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] to accommodate 407 passengers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-studies-ultra-long-range-777-8lx-concept-368176/ |title= Boeing studies ultra long-range 777-8LX concept |author= Ostrower, Jon |work=Air Transport Intelligence via Flightglobal.com |date= February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl] The 777-9X's planned length exceeds the [tpl]convert|250|ft|2|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] length of the 747-8, currently the world's longest airliner.

Because deliveries of Boeing's 777X are not expected to begin until 2020, Boeing faces the challenge of maintaining an efficient production line for its existing 777 models. With 380 777s on order as of the end of 2013, and no orders booked at the most recent air show, in Singapore in February 2014,  Boeing is trying to support a production rate of 100 aircraft per year on that line.  To stimulate additional orders and bridge the gap until 777X models roll off the assembly line, Boeing vice president of sales John Wojick has proposed pairing 777X sales with sales of current generation models, and providing opportunities for passenger airlines to sell their used 777 aircraft for conversion to freighter aircraft. The airlines could then purchase new 777 passenger aircraft.Ostrower, Jon. "Boeing plans new tactics to sell 777". Wall Street Journal, February 13, 2014.

===Fly-by-wire===

In designing the 777 as its first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models.[tpl]cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3126/is_n591_v50/ai_n28658541/ |title=Flying the Boeing 777 |work=Interavia Business & Technology |last=Ropelewski |first=Robert |date= June 1995 |accessdate=March 21, 2009[/tpl] The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls and overly stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot in command if deemed necessary.  The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.[tpl]Harvnb|Newhouse|2008|p=106[/tpl]

===Airframe and systems===

The wings on the 777 feature a supercritical airfoil design that is swept back at 31.6 degrees  and optimized for cruising at Mach 0.83 (revised upward after flight tests to Mach 0.84).[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=130[/tpl] The wings are designed with increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners, resulting in greater payload and range, improved takeoff performance, and a higher cruising altitude. The wings also serve as fuel storage, with longer-range models able to carry up to [tpl]convert|47890|gal|L[/tpl] of fuel. This capacity allows the 777-200LR to operate ultra-long-distance, trans-polar routes such as Toronto to Hong Kong.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morris|first=Doug|title=What determines the kind of aircraft that will be used for a particular route?|journal=enRoute|date=March 2012|url=http://www.enroute.aircanada.com/en/articles/what-determines-the-kind-of-aircraft-that-will-be-used-for-a-particular-route-1[/tpl] In 2013, a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777X, with a wider span and design features based on the 787's wings.
Large folding wingtips, [tpl]convert|21|ft|sigfig=3[/tpl] long, were offered when the 777 was first launched, to appeal to airlines who might use gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft, but no airline purchased this option.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.caa.govt.nz/aircraft/Type_Acceptance_Reps/Boeing_777.pdf |title=Type Acceptance Report – Boeing 777 |work=Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand |accessdate=December 1, 2008[/tpl] Folding wingtips reemerged as a design feature at the announcement of the upgraded 777X in 2013. Smaller folding wingtips of [tpl]convert|11|ft|sigfig=3[/tpl] in length will allow 777X models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s. These smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s, and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights.
The airframe incorporates the use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8X and 777-9X).[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=35[/tpl] Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=92[/tpl] and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=89[/tpl] The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|p=111[/tpl] The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of [tpl]convert|59490|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl], which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/03/28/205694/adp-to-revamp-runway-at-orly.html |title=ADP to revamp runway at Orly |last=Turner |first=Aimee |date=March 28, 2006 |work=Flight International |accessdate=April 2, 2009[/tpl] The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=66[/tpl] A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=60[/tpl]

===Interior===

The original 777 interior, also known as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger overhead bins, and indirect lighting. Seating options range from six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=32–33[/tpl] The 777's windows  were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure [tpl]convert|15|in|adj=on|sigfig=2[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|10|in|adj=on|sigfig=2[/tpl] in size (all models outside the 777-8X and 777-9X).[tpl]cite web |last=Wallace |first=James |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-190312953.html |title=Continental plans Dreamliner seats to be roomy, with a view |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2011[/tpl] The cabin also features "Flexibility Zones", which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, pneumatic, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, galleys, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements. Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non-airline use.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lufthansa-technik.com/applications/portal/lhtportal/lhtportal.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=Template7_8&requestednode=421&webcacheURL=TV_I/Media-Relations/Media-Archive/Archive-Press-Releases/Previous-Press-Releases/Press-Releases-2000/First_VIP_B777.xml |title=Lufthansa Technik turns out first customized VIP Boeing 777 |work=Lufthansa Technik |date=December 22, 2000 |accessdate=October 25, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090615231836/http://www.lufthansa-technik.com/applications/portal/lhtportal/lhtportal.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=Template7_8&requestednode=421&webcacheURL=TV_I/Media-Relations/Media-Archive/Archive-Press-Releases/Previous-Press-Releases/Press-Releases-2000/First_VIP_B777.xml|archivedate=2009-06-15  [/tpl] Boeing engineers designed a new hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=053lJ8sFTAYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The newest way to fly|first=Dawn|last=Stover|date=June 1994|accessdate=March 10, 2011|work=Popular Science|pages=78–79, 104[/tpl]
In 2003, Boeing introduced overhead crew rests as an option on the 777.[tpl]cite web |last=Wallace |first=James |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Aerospace-Notebook-Boeing-adds-places-for-crews-1106748.php |title=Boeing adds places for crews to snooze |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date= February 4, 2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2011[/tpl] Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=122[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=46, 112[/tpl] The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.
In 2011, Flight International reported that Boeing is considering replacing the Signature Interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787, as part of a move towards a "common cabin experience" across all Boeing platforms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/07/07/359264/boeing-eyes-common-cabin-experience-across-platforms.html |title=Boeing eyes 'common cabin experience' across platforms  |author=Kirby, Mark  |date=July 7, 2011 |work=Air Transport Intelligence via Flightglobal.com|accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl] With the launch of the 777X in 2013, Boeing confirmed that the aircraft would be receiving a new interior featuring 787 cabin elements and larger windows. Further details released in 2014 included re-sculpted cabin sidewalls for greater interior room, noise-dampening technology, and higher cabin humidity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-01/cabin-comfort-becomes-focus-as-boeing-maps-777-upgrade-for-2020s.html |title=Boeing Maps Boost in Cabin Comfort for Next 777|work=Bloomberg |first=Julie |last=Johnsson|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 1, 2014[/tpl]

==Variants==

Boeing uses two characteristics, fuselage length and range, to define their 777 models. Fuselage length affects the number of passengers and amount of cargo that can be carried; the 777-200 and derivatives are the base size, and the aircraft was stretched into the 777-300 in 1998. In terms of range, the aircraft has been categorized into three segments based on design criteria; these were initially defined as the following:
When referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (777) and the variant designator (-200 or -300) into a truncated form (e.g., "772" or "773"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jal.co.jp/en/5971/readme/ships_info.html |title=About our operating aircraft |work=Japan Airlines|accessdate=October 25, 2009[/tpl]). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aircraft type designator system adds a preceding manufacturer letter (e.g., "B772" or "B773"). Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may or may not append the range identifier (e.g., 777-300ER as "773ER",[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/air-nz-must-ask-shareholders/2007/09/11/1189276720074.html |title=Air NZ must ask shareholders |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |last=John |first=Danny |date=September 12, 2007[/tpl] "773B",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/GL03Cb06.html |title= Cathay Pacific puts its trust in Boeing |publisher=Asia Times Online |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |date=December 3, 2005[/tpl] "77W",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aircanada.com/en/about/fleet/77W.html |title= Air Canada – 777-300ER (77W)|work=Air Canada |accessdate=March 30, 2009[/tpl] or "B77W"). These notations may be found in aircraft manuals or airline timetables.

===777-200===

The 777-200 was the initial A-market model. The first -200 was delivered to United Airlines on May 15, 1995. With a maximum range of [tpl]convert|5235|nmi|km[/tpl],[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/pf/pf_200product.html |title=777-200/-200ER Technical Characteristics |work=Boeing |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009[/tpl] the -200 was chiefly aimed at U.S. domestic airline operators. Nine different -200 customers have taken delivery of 88 aircraft, with 85 in airline service as of July 2012."World Airliner Census". Flight International, August 28–September 3, 2012. The competing aircraft from Airbus is the A330-300.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80189598.html |title=Aerospace Notebook: Conner's best bet – Let it ride on the 777s but airlines aren't ready to commit to 200LR model |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |last=Wallace |first=James |date=November 19, 2001 |accessdate=May 8, 2011[/tpl]

===777-200ER===

The 777-200ER ("ER" for Extended Range), the B-market version of the -200, was originally known as the 777-200IGW for its increased gross weight.[tpl]Harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=112–113[/tpl] The -200ER features additional fuel capacity and an increased maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over the -200. Aimed at international airlines operating transatlantic routes, the -200ER's maximum range is [tpl]convert|7700|nmi|km[/tpl]. In addition to breaking the eastbound great circle "distance without landing" record, the -200ER also holds the record for the longest ETOPS-related emergency flight diversion (177 minutes under one engine), on a United Airlines flight carrying 255 passengers on March 17, 2003, over the Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/asw/categories/commercial/Still-Tops-for-ETOPS_2351.html |title=Still Tops for ETOPS |work=Air Safety Week |date=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/asw/categories/bga/Divert-Details_2255.html |title=Divert Details |work=Air Safety Week |date=March 24, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2009[/tpl]
The first -200ER was delivered to British Airways on February 6, 1997. Singapore Airlines, one of the type's largest customers, ordered over half of its -200ERs with reduced engine thrust specifications (de-rated) for use on medium-length routes.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.centreforaviation.com/analysis/sia-new-long-haul-low-cost-carrier-to-start-with-400-seat-b777s-plans-16-aircraft-fleet-within-five-58111 |title=SIA's new long-haul LCC to start with 400-seat B777s, plans 16-aircraft fleet within four years|publisher=CAPA Centre for Aviation|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/flying-with-us/ouraircraft/ |title=Our Fleet|work=Singapore Airlines|year=2012|accessdate=March 22, 2012[/tpl] The de-rated engines lower MTOW, which reduces the aircraft's purchase price and landing fees, and can be re-rated to full -200ER standard for long-haul operations. As of August 2013, -200ER deliveries to 33 different customers totaled 422.  As of July 2013, 418 examples of the -200ER were in airline service. The competing aircraft from Airbus was the A340-300.[tpl]cite web |last=Wall |first=Robert |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news/10315p03.xml |title=Boeing's Interest Focuses on 747 Advanced, Not 787-10 |work=Aviation Week & Space Technology |date=October 30, 2005 |accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl]

===777-300===

The stretched 777-300 was designed as an A-market replacement for 747-100s and 747-200s.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=151–152[/tpl] Compared to the older 747s, the stretched 777 has comparable passenger capacity and range, but burns one-third less fuel and has 40 percent lower maintenance costs. The -300 features a [tpl]convert|33.3|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] fuselage stretch over the baseline -200.  This allows seating for up to 550 passengers in a single class high-density configuration, an arrangement adopted for heavily trafficked Japanese routes.[tpl]Harvnb|Birtles|1998|p=67[/tpl] Because of the aircraft's length, the -300 is equipped with a tailskid and ground maneuvering cameras to aid pilots during taxi.[tpl]Harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=152–156[/tpl] The maximum range is [tpl]convert|6015|nmi|km[/tpl],[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/pf/pf_300product.html |title=777-300 Technical Characteristics |work=Boeing |accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl] allowing the -300 to operate trunk routes previously flown by older 747s.
After being certified simultaneously by the FAA and JAA, the first -300 was delivered to Cathay Pacific on May 21, 1998. Eight different -300 customers have taken delivery of 60 aircraft, and all were in airline service as of July 2012. However, following the introduction of the longer-range -300ER in 2004, all operators have selected the ER version of the base -300 model. The -300 has no direct Airbus rival, but the A340-600 has been offered in competition.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRtypen/FR777300.htm |title= Datafile: Boeing 777-300 |work=Flug Revue |year=2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080130005719/http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRtypen/FR777300.htm |archivedate= January 30, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRtypen/FR77730e.htm |title=Datafile: Boeing 777-300ER |work=Flug Revue |year=2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080129232450/http://www.flug-revue.rotor.com/FRtypen/FR77730e.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2008[/tpl]
