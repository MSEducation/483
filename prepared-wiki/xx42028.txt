The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 in Denver, Colorado.  The purpose of the event was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including Boxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Karate, Judo, and other styles.  In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1163248-royce-gracies-legacy-bjjs-relevance-on-the-decline-in-modern-mma |title=Royce Gracie's Legacy, BJJ's Relevance on the Decline in Modern MMA |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl]

==History==

===Early competition – early 1990s===

Art Davie proposed to John Milius and Rorion Gracie an eight-man single-elimination tournament called "War of the Worlds". The tournament was inspired by the Gracies in Action video-series produced by the Gracie family of Brazil which featured Gracie Jiu-Jitsu students defeating martial-arts masters of various disciplines such as karate, kung fu and kickboxing. The tournament would feature martial artists from different disciplines facing each other in no-holds-barred combat to determine the best martial art and would aim to replicate the excitement of the matches Davie had seen on the videos.[ref]
Gentry III, Clyde, No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution, Milo Books, 2003, paperback edition, ISBN 1-903854-30-X, pp. 38–39.[/ref] John Milius, a noted film director and screenwriter, as well as a Gracie student, agreed to act as the event's creative director. Davie drafted the business plan and twenty-eight investors contributed the initial capital to start WOW Promotions with the intent to develop the tournament into a television franchise.[ref]
Gentry III, Clyde, No Holds Barred: Evolution, Archon Publishing, 2001, 1st ed., ISBN 0-9711479-0-6, pages 24–29.[/ref]
In 1993 WOW Promotions sought a television partner and approached pay-per-view producers TVKO (HBO), SET (Showtime) and Campbell McLaren at the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Both TVKO and SET declined, but SEG–a pioneer in pay-per-view television which had produced such off-beat events as a gender tennis-match between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova–became WOW's partner in May 1993.[ref]

SEG contacted video and film art-director Jason Cusson to design the trademarked "Octagon", a signature piece for the event. Cusson remained the Production Designer through UFC 27. SEG devised the name for the show as The Ultimate Fighting Championship.[ref]

WOW Promotions and SEG produced the first event, later called UFC 1, at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on November 12, 1993. Art Davie functioned as the show's booker and matchmaker.[ref]

The television broadcast featured kickboxers Patrick Smith and Kevin Rosier, savate fighter Gerard Gordeau, karate expert Zane Frazier, shootfighter Ken Shamrock, sumo wrestler Teila Tuli, boxer Art Jimmerson and [tpl]convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt Royce Gracie—younger brother of UFC co-founder Rorion, whom Rorion hand-picked to represent his family in the competition. Royce Gracie's submission skills proved the most effective in the inaugural tournament, earning him the first ever UFC tournament championship [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAym2ZTfuuQ |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-09-23[/tpl] after submitting Jimmerson, Shamrock and Gordeau in succession.  The show proved extremely successful with 86,592 television subscribers on pay-per-view.
However, the promoters did not intend for the event to become a precursor to a series. "That show was only supposed to be a one-off", eventual UFC president Dana White said. "It did so well on pay-per-view they decided to do another, and another. Never in a million years did these guys think they were creating a sport."[ref]

With no weight classes, fighters often faced significantly larger or taller opponents. Keith "The Giant Killer" Hackney faced Emmanuel Yarborough at UFC 3 with a [tpl]convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] height and [tpl]convert|400|lb|kg[/tpl] weight disadvantage.[ref]

[/ref] Many martial artists believed that technique could overcome these size disadvantages, and that a skilled fighter could use an opponent's size and strength against him. With the [tpl]convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.
During this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock and Patrick Smith, the competitions also featured competitors such as Hall of Famer Dan Severn, Marco Ruas, Gary Goodridge, Don Frye, Kimo Leopoldo, Oleg Taktarov and Tank Abbott. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then ground and pound, kickboxing, boxing, and dirty boxing, which eventually melded into modern mixed martial arts.
In April 1995, following UFC 5 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.

====Emergence of stricter rules====

Although UFC used the tagline "There are no rules!" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and frowned on (but allowed) techniques such as hair pulling, headbutting, groin strikes and fish-hooking.
In fact, in a UFC 4 qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and Guy Mezger agreed not to pull hair—as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. Additionally, that same event saw a matchup between Keith Hackney and Joe Son in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.
The UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the UFC 5 broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.
UFC 5 also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called "The Superfight". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.
"The Superfight" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;[ref]

The "Superfight" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by UFC Brazil, the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time UFC Japan tournament featuring Japanese fighters). UFC 6 was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, Ken Shamrock.

===Controversy and reform – late 1990s===

The violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.[tpl]cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011[/tpl]
thumb|200px|left|Before reform, Senator John McCain prominently opposed the UFC. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. McCain himself led a campaign to ban UFC, calling it "human cockfighting," and sending letters to the governors of all fifty US states asking them to ban the event.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/id/46344|work=Slate.com|title=Fight Clubbed|first=David|last=Plotz|date =November 7, 1999|accessdate=2007-03-21[/tpl]
Thirty-six states enacted laws that banned "no-hold-barred" fighting, including New York, which enacted the ban on the eve of UFC 12, forcing a relocation of the event to Dothan, Alabama.Gentry III, Clyde, No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution, Milo Books, 2003, Paperback Edition, ISBN 1-903854-30-X, pages 106, 123 The UFC continued to air on DirecTV PPV, though its audience remained minuscule compared to the larger cable pay-per-view platforms of the era.
In response to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. UFC 12 saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14 gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.[tpl]cite news|title=UFC History|date=November 20, 2007|url=http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/ufc/ufchistory.htm|accessdate=2008-01-20[/tpl]
Led by UFC commissioner Jeff Blatnick and referee John McCarthy, the UFC continued to work with state athletic commissions.[tpl]cite web|author=10:51 |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/mma/post/_/id/14999/love-of-grappling-defined-jeff-blatnick |title=Love of grappling defined Jeff Blatnick - Mixed Martial Arts Blog - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19[/tpl] Blatnick, McCarthy and matchmaker Joe Silva created a manual of policies, procedures, codes of conduct and rules to help in getting the UFC sanctioned by the athletic commissions, many of which exist to this day. Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that was thought to be bloodthirsty and inhumane. By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact. California was set to become the first state in the U.S. to sign off on a set of codified rules that governed MMA. Soon after, New Jersey adopted the language.
As the UFC continued to work with the athletic commissions, events took place in smaller U.S. markets, including Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wyoming and Alabama. SEG could not secure home-video releases for UFC 23 through UFC 29. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000. Just two months later, the UFC held its first sanctioned event, UFC 28, under the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board's "Unified Rules".Trembow, Ivan. New Jersey Commission Corrects Mainstream UFC Stories. Ivan's Blog.
As the UFC's rules started to evolve, so too did its field of competitors. Notable UFC fighters to emerge in this era include Hall of Famers Mark Coleman, Randy Couture, Chuck Liddell, Matt Hughes and Tito Ortiz, as well as notables Vitor Belfort, Mark Kerr, Pedro Rizzo, Murilo Bustamante, Pat Miletich, Frank Shamrock, Mikey Burnett, Jeremy Horn, Pete Williams, Jens Pulver, Evan Tanner, Andrei Arlovski and Wanderlei Silva, among others.

===The Zuffa era – early 2000s===

Zuffa LLC bought UFC in 2000.
After the long battle to secure sanctioning, SEG stood on the brink of bankruptcy when Station Casinos executives Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta and their business partner Dana White approached them in 2000, with an offer to purchase the UFC. A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created Zuffa, LLC as the parent entity controlling the UFC.
"I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn't buying anything. I was paying $2 million and they were saying 'What are you getting?[tpl]' "[/tpl] Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to Fighter's Only magazine, recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. "And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's going to make this thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don't like it, they react to it.[tpl]' "[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmanews.com/news/82683|title=Lorenzo Fertitta Talks Buying UFC With Fighter's Only Mag|publisher=Fighter's Only|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl]
With ties to the Nevada State Athletic Commission (Lorenzo Fertitta was a former member of the NSAC), Zuffa secured sanctioning in Nevada in 2001. Shortly thereafter, the UFC returned to pay-per-view cable television with UFC 33 featuring three championship bouts.

====Struggle for survival and turnaround====

The UFC slowly, but steadily, rose in popularity after the Zuffa purchase, due partly to greater advertising,UFC Retrospective Series Part 3: The New Ownership corporate sponsorship, the return to cable pay-per-view and subsequent home video and DVD releases.
With larger live gates at casino venues like the Trump Taj Mahal and the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the UFC secured its first television deal with Fox Sports Net. The Best Damn Sports Show Period aired the first mixed martial arts match on American cable television in June 2002, as well as the main event showcasing Chuck Liddell vs. Vitor Belfort at UFC 37.5.[tpl]cite web|last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/2347/chuck-liddell-on-the-best-damn-sports-show-tonight.mma |title=Chuck Liddell on "The Best Damn Sports Show" Tonight |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-23[/tpl] Later, FSN would air highlight shows from the UFC, featuring one-hour blocks of the UFC's greatest bouts.
thumb|150px|right|Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock was instrumental in the UFC's turnaround into a mainstream sport. UFC 40 proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event sold out the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate over three times larger than the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously defected to professional wrestling in the WWE before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced "underground" in 1997.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-ufcs-pay-per-view.html |title=Mixed Martial Arts--- UFC's Pay-Per-View Buys Explode in 2006 |work=Ivansblog.com |last=Trembow |first=Ivan |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time.[tpl]cite web|last=Doyle |first=Dave |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dd-ufcforty051209 |title=UFC 40: Signs of life – UFC – Yahoo!

But, when I was standing in the Octagon at UFC 40, I remember standing there before the Ortiz/Shamrock fight and looking around.

Penn, Sean Sherk, Matt Serra, Ricco Rodriguez, Robbie Lawler, Frank Mir, Karo Parisyan and Nick Diaz.

====The Ultimate Fighter and mainstream emergence====

Faced with the prospect of folding, the UFC stepped outside the bounds of pay-per-view and made a foray into television. After being featured in a reality television series, American Casino,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmafacts.com/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&screenKey=cmpNews&show=forbes&s=MMA |title=Mixed Martial Arts |publisher=Mmafacts.com |accessdate=2010-09-23[/tpl] and seeing how well the series worked as a promotion vehicle, the Fertitta brothers developed the idea of the UFC having its own reality series.
thumb|200px|right|Logo of The Ultimate FighterTheir idea, The Ultimate Fighter (TUF)–a reality television show featuring up-and-coming MMA fighters in competition for a six-figure UFC contract, with fighters eliminated from competition via exhibition mixed martial arts matches–was pitched to several networks, each one rejecting the idea outright. Not until they approached Spike TV, with an offer to pay the $10 million production costs themselves, did they find an outlet.
In January 2005, Spike TV launched TUF in the timeslot following WWE Raw. The show became an instant success, culminating with a notable season finale brawl featuring finalists Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar going toe-to-toe for the right to earn the six-figure contract, an event that Dana White credits for saving the UFC.[tpl]cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-trigg091009&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Trigg gears up for one more run |work=Sports.Yahoo.com |date=September 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl]
On the heels of the Griffin/Bonnar finale, a second season of The Ultimate Fighter launched in August 2005, and two more seasons appeared in 2006. Spike and the UFC continued to create and air new seasons until the show moved to FX in 2012.UFC and Spike TV Announce Continued Partnership. UFC.com. March 22, 2006.http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/18/ultimate-fighter-canceled/
Following the success of The Ultimate Fighter, Spike also picked up UFC Unleashed, an hour-long weekly show featuring select fights from previous events. Spike also signed on to broadcast live UFC Fight Night, a series of fight events debuting in August 2005, and Countdown specials to promote upcoming UFC pay-per-view cards.
After a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC's new relationship with Fox, Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC, “The Ultimate Fighter season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/spike-tv-announces-partnership-with-the-ufc-has-ended-tuf-14-will-be-the-last-on-the-network |title= Spike TV Announces Partnership with the UFC Has Ended, TUF 14 Will Be the Last on the Network |work= MMAWeekly.com] |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl]
With the announcement of UFC's partnership with Fox in August 2011, The Ultimate Fighter which entered its 14th season in that September, has moved to the FX network and air on Friday nights starting with season 15 in the Spring of 2012.

For the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie—featuring Royce Gracie's first UFC fight in 11 years—and 775,000 buys for UFC 61 featuring the highly anticipated rematch between Ken Shamrock and Tito Ortiz, the coaches of The Ultimate Fighter 3.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-61-surpasses-30-million-in-ppv-sales-2 |title=UFC 61 SURPASSES $30 MILLION IN PPV SALES |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=September 6, 2006 |accessdate=2010-09-23[/tpl] The organization hit a milestone with UFC 66, pitting Ortiz in a rematch against Liddell with over 1 million buys.[tpl]cite web|last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/1857/report-ufc-66-falls-short-of-12-million-ppv-buys.mma |title=Report: UFC 66 Falls Short of 1.2 Million PPV ";Buys"; |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-23[/tpl]
The surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, former Executive Director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator McCain's campaign against no holds barred fighting, became a catalyst for the emergence of sanctioned mixed martial arts in the United States. Ratner continues to educate numerous athletic commissions[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/sports/othersports/24fight.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=A Boxing Regulator Changes Corners|first=John|last=Eligon|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2010[/tpl] to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that have yet to sanction the sport.
In December 2006, Zuffa acquired the northern California-based promotion World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) in order to stop the International Fight League (IFL) from making a deal with Versus (now NBC Sports Network). At the time, the UFC had an exclusive deal with Spike, so the purchase of the WEC allowed Zuffa to block the IFL from Versus without violating their contract.[tpl]cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-wec060509 |title=Brown-Faber rematch puts WEC at crossroads – UFC – Yahoo!

In December 2006, Zuffa also acquired their cross-town, Las Vegas rival World Fighting Alliance (WFA). In acquiring the WFA, they acquired the contracts of notable fighters including Quinton Jackson, Lyoto Machida and Martin Kampmann.
The sport's popularity was also noticed by the sports betting community as BodogLife.com, an online gambling site, stated in July 2007 that in 2007 UFC would surpass boxing for the first time in terms of betting revenues.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/mma/betting/prweb530718.htm|title=UFC set to surpass boxing in betting revenue|first=Justin|last=Goff|work=MMAbettingblog.com|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=2008-03-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080410032815/http://www.prweb.com/releases/mma/betting/prweb530718.htm|archivedate=April 10, 2008[/tpl] In fact, the UFC had already broken the pay-per-view industry's all-time records for a single year of business, generating over $222,766,000 in revenue in 2006, surpassing both WWE and boxing.[ref]

====Pride acquisition and integration====

Initial intentions were for both organizations to be run separately but aligned together with plans to co-promote cards featuring the champions and top contenders from both organizations. However, after purchasing Pride, Dana White felt that the Pride model was not sustainable[tpl]cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/623/dana-white-pride-is-a-mess/ |title=Dana White: "PRIDE is a Mess" |work=MMAFrenzy.com |date=June 26, 2007 |first=Kris |last=Karkoski |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] and the organization would likely fold with many former Pride fighters such as Antônio Rodrigo "Minotauro" Nogueira, Maurício "Shogun" Rua, Dan Henderson, Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipović, Wanderlei Silva and others already being realigned under the UFC brand.

On June 18, 2008, Lorenzo Fertitta accommodated the UFC's growth by announcing his resignation from Station Casinos in order to devote his energies to the international business development of Zuffa, particularly the UFC. The move proved to be pivotal, as Fertitta helped strike TV deals in China, France, Mexico and Germany as well as open alternative revenue streams with a new UFC video game and UFC action figures, among other projects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-fertitta072309 |title=UFC full speed ahead with Fertitta on board |last=Iole |first=Kevin |work=Sports.Yahoo.com |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl]

===UFC 100 – late 2000s-present===

Popularity took another major surge in 2009 with UFC 100 and the 10 events preceding it including UFC 90, 91, 92, 94 and 98. UFC 100 was a massive success garnering 1.7 million buys[tpl]cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ki-carwin090209 |title=Carwin's star rises as UFC 106 nears |work=Sports.Yahoo.com |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] under the drawing power of former NCAA wrestling champion and current WWE superstar Brock Lesnar and his rematch with former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir, Canadian superstar Georges St-Pierre going head-to-head with Brazilian knockout artist Thiago Alves, and Pride legend Dan Henderson opposing British middleweight Michael Bisping; rival coaches on The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom.

However, the momentum gradually began to pick up in the first quarter of 2010 after victories from defending champions Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva, as well as Lyoto Machida's first career defeat to "Shogun" Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. These fights segued into a very popular clash between former UFC Champions and rivals Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson—rival coaches on The Ultimate Fighter 10: Heavyweights—at UFC 114, featuring the UFC's first main event headlined by African-American fighters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/05/25/rampage-jackson-rashad-evans-and-the-politics-of-race-in-mma/ |title='Rampage' Jackson, Rashad Evans and Politics of Race in MMA |work=MMAFighting.com |date=May 25, 2010 |last=Fowlkes |first=Ben |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] The event scored over 1 million pay per view buys[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.watchkalibrun.com/2010/6/24/1535463/meltzer-ufc-114-surpasses-1 |title=Meltzer: UFC 114 Surpasses 1 Million PPV Buys |last=Becker |first=Nick |date=June 24, 2010 |work=WatchKalibRun.com |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] as Evans secured a unanimous decision victory.

====TRT====

On February 27, 2014 the Nevada State Athletic Commission banned the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT).

On October 28, 2010, Zuffa announced that its sister promotion, WEC would merge with the UFC. The WEC held its final card on December 16, 2010. As a result of the merger, the UFC absorbed WEC's bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight weight divisions and their respective fighters. The UFC also made the last WEC Featherweight and Bantamweight Champions, José Aldo and Dominic Cruz respectively, the inaugural UFC Champions of their new weight divisions.Hawryluk, Matt.

Under Zuffa's ownership, Strikeforce made minor changes, including adopting the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts in full, closing the promotion's men's weight classes below lightweight, and ceasing promotion of amateur undercard bouts. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.
The final Strikeforce show was Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.

====Fox partnership====

On August 18, 2011, The Ultimate Fighting Championship and Fox announced a seven-year broadcast deal through the Fox Sports subsidiary, effectively ending the UFC's Spike TV and Versus (now NBC Sports Network) partnership.  The deal includes four events on the main Fox network, 32 live Friday night fights per year on their cable network FX, 24 events following The Ultimate Fighter reality show and six separate Fight Night events.

The UFC struck a deal with Sony SIX to produce the episodes and subsequently air them as well. Currently, filming is set to begin during the summer of 2013, and air later that fall.[tpl]cite web|title='The Ultimate Fighter: India' official for 2013 debut|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/30593/the-ultimate-fighter-india-official-for-2013-debut.mma|publisher=MMA Junkie|accessdate=September 18, 2012[/tpl]

==Rules==

The current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board.Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006. The set of "Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard de facto set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.

===Rounds===

UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's "main event" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with UFC 138 on November 5, 2011, non-championship "main event" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth "sudden victory" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

===Video games===

In January 2007, Zuffa and video game developer/publisher THQ announced a license agreement giving THQ worldwide rights to develop titles under the UFC brand. The agreement gives THQ exclusive rights to current and next-generation consoles as well as to PC and handheld titles. Also included are "certain wireless rights" which were not detailed. The licensing agreement was set to expire in 2011, although it appeared to have been extended to 2017. On June 6, 2012, during the E3 Exhibition, THQ had announced that they will be giving the license of UFC Undisputed to EA. The move came about months after UFC Undisputed 3's release, which THQ felt did not make a profit for the company. UFC 4 will feature fighters from Strikeforce.
