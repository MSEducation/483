Snagglepuss is a Hanna-Barbera cartoon character created in 1959,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cartoonscrapbook.com/S/snagglepuss1961.htm | title=Cartoon Scrapbook[/tpl] Snagglepuss a pink anthropomorphic mountain lion sporting an upturned collar, shirt cuffs and a string tie. He is voiced by Daws Butler, and is best known for his famous catchphrase, "Heavens to Murgatroyd!", along with phrases such as "Exit, stage left!"  Snagglepuss was originally known as "Snaggletooth" (a pink lion precursor).Toonopedia, Snaggletooth and Snagglepuss.

==Summary==

Snagglepuss first appeared in several episodes of The Quick Draw McGraw Show and became a regular segment on The Yogi Bear Show, starring in a total of 32 episodes. (See the list of episodes.) He also appeared in other Hanna-Barbera series such as Yogi's Gang in 1973, as a co-host for Laff-A-Lympics in 1977 and 1978, Yogi's Treasure Hunt in 1985 and as a teenager on Yo Yogi! in 1991.
Snagglepuss lives in a cavern, which he constantly tries to make more habitable for himself. No matter what he does, however, he always winds up back where he started or worse off than he was before. In some episodes, Snagglepuss is chased by Major Minor (voiced by Don Messick), a tiny-sized hunter, whose chases seem similar to the ones which involve Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny (which was hardly a coincidence, since most of the scripts were created by Michael Maltese, one of Warner Bros. Cartoons' key writers in the '40s and '50s).
In his earliest roles, before getting his own cartoons, Snagglepuss was orange instead of pink, wore no collar or cuffs, and occasionally was called "Snaggletooth". Confusion reigns in part because his first appearance, Lamb Chopped (an early Quick Draw McGraw short), actually calls him Snagglepuss but has him refer to an unseen "Snaggletooth" as his brother. The brownish-orange proto-Snagglepuss also appeared with Doggie Daddy and his son Augie in a short entitled "Snagglepuss".

==Character==

Butler's voice characterization is reminiscent of the more soft-spoken aspect of Bert Lahr's broad-ranging characterizations, specifically the Cowardly Lion in the 1939 MGM movie The Wizard of Oz. (Coincidentally, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera headed the MGM cartoon studio on the Tom and Jerry anthology before opening Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1957.)
Snagglepuss has three signature catchphrases. Before dashing off (whether to escape or for some other reason), he exclaims "Exit, stage left!" (or stage right, and sometimes even up or down), a phrase used in theatrical stage directions. Snagglepuss typically appends the adverbial focus particle "... even" to synonyms (instead of the more commonly used "A; B, which tops concept A and/or includes but is not limited to concept A even" format). His most famous is his perpetual exclamation, "Heavens to Murgatroyd!" -  a line first uttered by Bert Lahr in the 1944 film Meet the People.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/heavens-to-murgatroyd.html|title=Heavens to Murgatroyd|last=Martin|first=Gary|date=1996â€“2009|accessdate=2009-08-22[/tpl]
When the character of Snagglepuss was used for a series of Kellogg's cereal television commercials in the 1960s, Lahr filed a lawsuit, claiming that the similarity of the Snagglepuss voice to his own might cause viewers to falsely conclude that Lahr was endorsing the product. As part of the settlement, the disclaimer "Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler" was required to appear on each commercial, thus making Butler one of the few voice artists to receive a screen credit in a TV commercial.
