CATEGORIES: Printing

A page printer is a computer printer – and a computer by itself – which processes and prints a whole page at a time (contrary to printers which print line for line, like e.g. line printers and dot-matrix printers). It is connected to one or more PCs, servers, mobile phones or other host computers. Page printers are often called “laser printers” – but even if virtual all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies do also exist.
The page printer was jointly developed (circa 1900) and patented in 1924 by Sterling Morton and Howard Krum..
