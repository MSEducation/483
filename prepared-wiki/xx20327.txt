Oakland [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|k|l|ə|n|d[/tpl], located in the U.S. state of California, is a major West Coast port city and the busiest port for San Francisco Bay and all of Northern California. It is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city in the state, and the 47th-largest city in the U.S. with a population at the 2010 U.S. Census of 390,724.[tpl]cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0653000| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Oakland city, California| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=May 1, 2013[/tpl] Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda County. It serves as a major transportation hub and trade center for the entire region and is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles ([tpl]convert|6|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only[/tpl]) east of San Francisco.
Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad.  It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile industry. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure.
A steady influx of immigrants during the 20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, have made Oakland one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. Oakland is known for its history of political activism, as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which include health care, dot-com companies and manufacturers of household products. The city is a transportation hub for the greater Bay Area, and its shipping port is the fifth busiest in the United States.
Oakland has a Mediterranean climate with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt, a large estuary centrally located east of Downtown, was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge. Jack London Square, named for the author and former resident, is a tourist destination on the Oakland waterfront. Little progress has been made in reducing the city's high crime rate; violent crime is primarily concentrated in certain neighborhoods, although property crime remains problematic throughout the city. Oakland is continually listed among the top cities in the United States for sustainability practices, including a No. 1 ranking for usage of electricity from renewable resources.  Significant portions of Oakland suffer from severe lead contamination.

==History==

===The Ohlone===

The earliest known inhabitants were the Huchiun tribe, who lived there for thousands of years.  The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone (a Miwok word meaning "western people").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ |title= Ohlone Tribal Regions Map |accessdate=April 15, 2007 |last=Milliken |first=Randall |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070813110544/http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/  |archivedate = August 13, 2007[/tpl] In Oakland, they were concentrated around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek, a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at Emeryville.

===Early history===

Conquistadors from New Spain claimed Oakland, and other Ohlone lands of the East Bay, along with the rest of California, for the king of Spain in 1772. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown deeded the East Bay area to Luis María Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |title=Oakland-california.co.tv |publisher=Oakland-california.co.tv |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]  Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz/History.asp |title=Oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz |publisher=Oaklandcaliforniarealestate.biz |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]
The Peralta ranch included a stand of oak trees that stretched from the land that is today Oakland's downtown area to the adjacent part of Alameda, then a peninsula. The Peraltas called the area encinal, a Spanish word that means "oak grove."  This was translated more loosely as "Oakland" in the subsequent naming of the town, as recounted by Horace Carpentier in his first address as mayor: "The chief ornament and attraction of this city consists, doubtless, in the magnificent grove of evergreen oaks which covers its present site and from which it takes both its former name of 'Encinal' and its present one of 'Oakland.'" [tpl]cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/oakhist.htm |title=Oakland's Early History, Edson F. Adams, 1932 |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |accessdate=2013-11-26[/tpl]
As part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican–American War, the Mexican government ceded [tpl]convert|525000|sqmi[/tpl]; 55%[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=26|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|publisher=ourdocuments.gov|accessdate=June 27, 2007[/tpl] of its pre-war territory (excluding Texas) to the US in exchange for $15 million.  The Treaty also provided for the safeguarding of the land and property of Mexican citizens.  This provision was regularly ignored by squatters and land speculators, some of whom began settling on the Peralta Ranch, particularly during the Gold Rush.  Before Congress created a Land Commission in 1851 to pursue a settlement of property claims, a group of three men---Horace Carpentier, Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon---backed at one point by a small army of some 200 men hired from San Francisco, began developing a small settlement on Peralta land initially called "Contra Costa" ("opposite shore", the Spanish name for the lands on the east side of the Bay) in the area that is now downtown Oakland.  Carpentier was elected to the California state legislature and got the Town of Oakland incorporated on May 4, 1852. By the time the Land Commission got around to confirming the Peraltas' claims in 1854, Oakland was quickly being further developed.  The Peraltas in the meantime had been persuaded to sell various parcels of their vast holdings.  In 1853, John Coffee "Jack" Hays, a famous Texas Ranger, was one of the first to establish residence in Oakland while performing his duties as sheriff of San Francisco.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texasranger.org/halloffame/Hays_John.htm |title=Texas Ranger Hays |publisher=Texasranger.org |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]
On March 25, 1854, Oakland was re-incorporated as the City of Oakland.  Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor.  His tenure did not last, however.  He was ousted in 1855 by an angry citizenry when it was discovered that he had acquired exclusive rights to the waterfront from the Town Board of Trustees in 1852.  Charles Campbell replaced him as Mayor on March 5, 1855.
The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today's Port of Oakland. The Long Wharf served as the terminus both for the Transcontinental Railroad and for local commuter trains of the Central (later, Southern) Pacific. The Central Pacific also established one of its largest rail yards and servicing facilities in West Oakland, which continued to be a major local employer under the Southern Pacific well into the 20th century. The principal depot of the Southern Pacific in Oakland was the 16th Street Station located at 16th and Wood, which is currently being restored as part of a redevelopment project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.welcomeaboard.com/ |title=See |publisher=Welcomeaboard.com |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]  In 1871, Cyrus and Susan Mills paid $5,000 for the Young Ladies' Seminary in Benicia, renamed it Mills College, and moved it to its current location in Oakland, adjacent to what is now Seminary Boulevard. In 1872, the town of Brooklyn was incorporated into Oakland. Brooklyn, a large municipality southeast of Lake Merritt, was part of what was then called the Brooklyn Township.
A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis "Borax" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System, the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit. In addition to its system of streetcars in the East Bay, the Key System also operated commuter trains to its own pier and ferry boats to San Francisco, in competition with the Southern Pacific. Upon completion of the Bay Bridge, both companies ran their commuter trains on the south side of the lower deck, directly to San Francisco. The Key System in its earliest years was actually in part a real estate venture, with the transit part serving to help open up new tracts for buyers. The Key System's investors (incorporated as the "Realty Syndicate") also established two large hotels in Oakland, one of which survives as the Claremont Resort. The other, which burned down in the early 1930s, was the Key Route Inn, at what is now West Grand and Broadway. From 1904 to 1929, the Realty Syndicate also operated a major amusement park in north Oakland called Idora Park.

===Early 1900s===

The original extent of Oakland, upon its incorporation, lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902, which created an island of nearby town Alameda. In 1906, its population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Concurrently, a strong City Beautiful movement, promoted by Mayor Frank Kanning Mott, was responsible for creating and preserving parks and monuments in Oakland, including major improvements to Lake Merritt and the construction of Oakland Civic Auditorium, which cost $1M in 1914. The Auditorium briefly served as an emergency ward and quarantine for some of the victims of the 1918 flu pandemic. The three waves of the pandemic killed more than 1,400, out of 216,000, Oakland residents.
By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous manufacturing industries, including metals, canneries, bakeries, internal combustion engines, automobiles, and shipbuilding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt7199q9d0/ |title=Photo collection: New or greatly enlarged industrial establishments of Oakland and East Bay cities. by Oakland (Calif.)

===1920s===

The 1920s were economic boom years in the United States as a whole, and in California in particular. Economic growth was fueled by the general post–World War I recovery, as well as oil discoveries in Los Angeles and, most notably, the widespread introduction of the automobile. In 1916, General Motors opened a major Chevrolet automobile factory in East Oakland, making cars and then trucks until 1963, when it was moved to Fremont in southern Alameda County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oaklandhistory.com/files/chev.html |title=Oakland History Room. 1917 promotional photograph of a day's output at the Chevrolet factory |publisher=Oaklandhistory.com |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl] Also in 1916,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lincolnhighwayassoc.org/ca/traveler/2001-09/highway_nostalgia.html |title=The Traveler: The Newsletter of the Lincoln Highway Association—California Chapter.

On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew, Paul Mantz, Harry Manning and Fred Noonan, flew the first leg of her attempt to circumnavigate the globe, from Oakland to Honolulu, Hawaii. That attempt ended in Hawaii when her Lockheed Electra 10E was severely damaged. Later in the year, Earhart began her second, ill-fated attempt with the unpublicized first leg of her proposed transcontinental flight mapped from Oakland to Miami, Florida.

===World War II===

During World War I, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Among these were the Kaiser Shipyards in nearby Richmond. The medical system devised for shipyard workers became the basis for the giant Kaiser Permanente HMO, which has a large medical center at MacArthur and Broadway, the first to be established by Kaiser. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships.
Valued at $100 million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. Sited at both a major rail terminus and an important sea port, Oakland was a natural location for food processing plants, whose preserved products fed domestic, foreign, and military consumers. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.[tpl]cite web|title=H.G.

G. Prince Company between 1925 and 1930. In 1943, the Oakland Tribune reported that the $100,000,000 canning industry in Oakland ranked second only to shipbuilding in value.[/tpl]
Prior to World War II, blacks constituted about 3% of Oakland's population. Aside from restrictive covenants pertaining to some properties in the hill neighborhoods (invalidated after 1948), Jim Crow laws mandating racial segregation did not exist in Oakland, and relations between the races were mostly harmonious. What segregation did exist was voluntary; blacks could, and did, live in all parts of the city.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/26/MNFUSA80E.DTL&hw=Betty+Reid+Soskin&sn=003&sc=552 | title=WWII meant opportunity for many women, oppression for others | first=Carolyne | last=Zinko | date=September 26, 2007 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl]
The war attracted tens of thousands of laborers from around the country, though most were poor whites and blacks from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas—sharecroppers and tenant farmers who had been recruited by Henry J. Kaiser to work in his shipyards. These immigrants from the Jim Crow South brought their racial attitudes with them, and the racial harmony that Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated. Southern whites expected deference from their black co-workers, and initially Southern blacks were conditioned to grant it.Arroyo, Cuahutémoc (Faculty Mentor: Professor Leon F. Litwack).

Accessed from Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University on August 19, 2007 As Southern blacks became aware of their more equal standing under California law, they began to reject subservient roles; the new immigrants prospered, though they were affected by rising racial discrimination and informal post-war neighborhood redlining.
Many Latinos, especially Mexican Americans from southwestern states like New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, came to Oakland to work in the many war time jobs as did many Mexican workers who came under the Bracero Program 5000 braceros.  Many worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, at its major rail yard in West Oakland (see traquero).  While some of the rail workers lived near the yard, most of the Mexican community was concentrated as it always had been since the early days of the Peralta ranch in the Fruitvale District.  Oakland experienced its own "zoot suit riots" in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of the one in Los Angeles.Eye from the Edge A Memoir of West Oakland, California Ruben LLmas

===Post-WWII (1940s and 1950s)===

In 1946 National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company, acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland's electric streetcar system.  NCL converted the Key System's electric streetcar fleet to diesel buses, tracks were removed from Oakland's streets, and the lower deck of the Bay Bridge was converted to automobile traffic, which reduced the passenger carrying capacity of the bridge.  Freeways were constructed, which partitioned the social and retail fabric of neighborhoods. In the 1948 federal case "United States v. National City Lines Inc.," the defendants were found guilty on a count of conspiring to monopolize the provision of parts and supplies to their subsidiary companies.  The companies were each fined $5,000, and the directors were each fined one dollar. The verdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951.UNITED STATES, v.

Soon after the war, with the disappearance of Oakland's shipbuilding industry and the decline of its automobile industry, jobs became scarce. Many of the poor blacks who had come to the city from the South decided to stay in Oakland, and longstanding black residents complained that the new Southern arrivals "tended towards public disorder."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |title=Jerry Brown’s No-Nonsense New Age for Oakland. |publisher=City Journal |date=Autumn 1999 |author=Heather Mac Donald |accessdate=August 8, 2008 |authorlink=Heather Mac Donald[/tpl]  The segregationist attitudes that some Southern migrants brought with them disrupted the racial harmony that Oaklanders had been accustomed to before the war. Many of the city's more affluent residents, both black and white, left the city after the war, moving to neighboring Alameda, Berkeley, Albany and El Cerrito to the north; to San Leandro, Hayward, Castro Valley and Fremont in Southern Alameda County; and to the newly developing East Bay suburbs, Orinda, Lafayette, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek and Concord. Between 1950 and 1960, about 100,000 white property owners moved out of Oakland—part of a nationwide phenomenon called white flight.Inside the Panther Revolution, Robyn Cean Spencer, Chapter 13, p. 302
By the end of World War II, blacks constituted about 12% of Oakland's population, and the years following the war saw this percentage rise. There was also an increase in racial tension. Starting in the late 1940s, the Oakland Police Department began recruiting white officers from the South to deal with the expanding black population and changing racial attitudes; many were openly racist, and their repressive police tactics exacerbated racial tensions.Insie the Panther Revolution, Robyn Cean Spencer, Chapter 13, p. 303, "...Much of the city's police force had been recruited from the Deep South, and police officers frequently held racist attitudes."

Beginning in the mid-1950s, much of West Oakland was destroyed, after then-Highway 17, now I-880 (or Nimitz Freeway) was built. Many homes and businesses were destroyed to build the Cypress Viaduct and the rest of the Nimitz Freeway. Also urban renewal caused the destruction of the area around Market and 7th streets to make way for the Acorn High Rise apartments. This urban renewal of West Oakland continued into the 1960s with the construction of BART and the Main Post Office Building at 1675 7th Street. Many families were displaced from West Oakland by the construction of the Nimitz Freeway and the urban renewal of West Oakland. The majority of these were African-American and Latino.  African Americans relocated to East Oakland as well especially the Elmhurst district and surrounding areas.

In 1960, Kaiser Corporation erected its headquarters at the former site of Holy Names University, at the corner of 20th and Harrison Streets. It was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as "the largest office tower west of Chicago"  up to that time.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FrMj_wenLdcC&pg=PA72&dq=%22tower+west+of+chicago%22 |title=The furniture of Sam Maloof |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=April 19, 2012|isbn=9780393730807|year=2001[/tpl] During this era, the oldest section of Oakland at the foot of Broadway, Jack London Square, was redeveloped into a hotel and outdoor retail district.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]  During the 1960s, the city was home to an innovative funk music scene that produced well-known bands like Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Cold Blood, Azteca, and The Headhunters.

By 1966, only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black.  Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, and police malfeasance against blacks was common.monthlyreview.org  The Black Panther Party was founded by students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale at Merritt College.Up Against the Wall, Curtis Austin, pp. 30–47
It was also during the 1960s that the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club began to grow into a formidable motorcycle gang and organized crime syndicate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/gangunit/gangs/motorcycle.html|title=Motorcycle gangs|work=US Department of Justice|accessdate=January 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/publications/org_crime.pdf|title=Organized crime in California |last=Lockyer|first=Bill|year=2003|work=California Department of Justice|accessdate=January 23, 2010[/tpl]  The Hells Angels clubhouse is still located on Oakland's Foothill Boulevard.
During the 1970s, Oakland began to experience serious problems with gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale operation of this kind.  Both violent crime and property crime increased during this period, and Oakland's murder rate rose to twice that of San Francisco or New York City.
In late 1973, the Symbionese Liberation Army assassinated Oakland's superintendent of schools, Dr. Marcus Foster, and badly wounded his deputy, Robert Blackburn. Two months later, two men were arrested and charged with the murder. Both received life sentences, though one was acquitted after an appeal and a retrial seven years later.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Fruitvale District was part of the Chicano Movement. In 1968 the Oakland Police murdered a young Chicano named Charles (Pinky) De Baca on 35th Avenue in East Oakland. A group called Latinos United for Justice organized to combat police brutality after Mr. De Baca's murder. Chicano Radical militants like the Chicano Revolutionary Party and the Brown Berets also organized and began doing work in the Fruitvale District to protect the Chicano and Latino Community from police brutality and had a free breakfast program in the Fruitvale area with the help of the Black Panthers. in July 26, 1970 the Fruitvale District held the Chicano Moratorium against Chicanos going to fight in the Vietnam war. La Clinica de La Raza was also formed on Fruitvale Avenue in 1970, by Chicano students in order to have a free Clinic for the Chicano and Latino Community in East Oakland. La Raza Unida Party also had a chapter in Oakland. The Chicano movement was also part of Oakland's Radical History in the 60s and 70s.

===1980s and 1990s===

Starting in the Late 1960s and continuing into the early 1980s, the number of Latinos, mostly of Mexican origin, began to increase in Oakland, especially in the Fruitvale district . This district is one of the oldest in Oakland, growing up around the old Peralta estate (now a city park). It always had a concentration of Latino residents, businesses and institutions, and increased immigration, continuing into the 21st century, has added greater numbers in Fruitvale and throughout East Oakland.
As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became a serious problem in Oakland.  Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden cities.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=iuCKT-Gz5GcC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=CRACK:+INNER+CITY+DECAY+IN+AMERICA#v=onepage&q=CRACK%3A%20INNER%20CITY%20DECAY%20IN%20AMERICA&f=false |title=Crack In America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice - Craig Reinarman, Harry Gene Levine - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2012-07-24|isbn=9780520202429|year=1997[/tpl]
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Oakland's black plurality reached its peak at approximately 47% of the overall population.  Oakland was the birthplace or home at one time of several rap acts, including MC Hammer, Digital Underground, Hieroglyphics (including Souls of Mischief and Del tha Funkee Homosapien), The Luniz, Tupac Shakur, and Too Short. Outside of the rap genre, artists such as the Pointer Sisters, En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day also emerged from Oakland.
On May 24, 1990, a pipe bomb placed underneath traveling eco-activist Judi Bari's car seat exploded, tearing through her backside and nearly killing her. The bomb was placed directly under the driver's seat, not in the back seat or luggage area as it presumably would have been if Bari had transported it knowingly. Immediately after the 1990 car bombing, while Bari was in Oakland's Highland Hospital, she and a friend were arrested on suspicion of knowingly transporting the bomb. The Alameda County district attorney later dropped the case for lack of evidence, and in 2004 the FBI and the City of Oakland agreed to a $4 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by Bari's estate, and her friend, over their false arrest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/01/DDG3HB2CFV1.DTL |title=Is the biographer of activist Judi Bari a tool of the right—or just a skeptical liberal? |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 1, 2005| first=Edward| last=Guthmann[/tpl]
On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm (see 1991 Oakland firestorm) swept down from the Berkeley Hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, and 150 people were injured, with nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. The economic losses have been estimated at $1.5 billion. The economic losses, in combination with injuries and loss of life, make this the worst urban firestorm in American history.  Many of the original homes were rebuilt on a much larger scale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/disasters/some-faults-revealed-firestorm-remain-uncorrected/nFR7N/ |title=Some faults revealed by firestorm remain uncorrected |publisher=www.ktvu.com |accessdate=2012-07-24[/tpl]
In late 1996, Oakland was the center of a controversy surrounding Ebonics (African American Vernacular English), an ethnolect the outgoing Oakland Unified School District board voted to recognize on December 18.The Notorious Ebonics Resolution of Oakland, California: Drake, Dan 1997Junk Science and the "Ebonics" Resolution: Is academia looking the other way?: Salvucci, Claudio R.—Evolution Publishing, June 1997 This was later dropped.
During the mid-1990s, Oakland experienced an improved economy compared to previous decades,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/02/16/SPECIAL6815.dtl |title=On the road to economic success, where we work |publisher=San Francisco Examiner |author= Edward Iwata, of the examiner staff |date=February 16, 1997[/tpl] with new downtown land development such as a $140 million state government center project, a $101 million city office building, and a 12-story office building for the University of California, Office of the President. The City Center redevelopment project was bought by Shorenstein Co., a San Francisco real estate firm. Office vacancies dropped to 11 percent from 16 percent in 1996.  Officials at the Port of Oakland and Oakland International Airport, began multimillion-dollar expansion plans to keep pace with rival shipping ports and airports on the West Coast.

====Loma Prieta earthquake====

The Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989, a rupture of the San Andreas fault that affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area.  The quake's surface wave measured 6.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, and many structures in Oakland were badly damaged. The double-decker portion of the freeway (Interstate 880) structure collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month. Oakland became the home of the emerging nonprofit preparedness movement in the aftermath of the earthquake when local agencies formed CARD (Collaborating Agencies Responding to Disasters) to address the unmet emergency readiness needs of the nonprofit and faith sectors.

===2000s===

After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.[tpl]cite news |last=Gammon |first=Robert |title=Inflating the Numbers, The Brown administration came very close on the 10K Plan. So why the grade inflation? |publisher=East Bay Express |date=January 3, 2007 |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/news/inflating_the_numbers/Content?oid=323334[/tpl] Since Brown's stated goal was to add 10,000 residents to downtown Oakland, it became known as the "10K" plan. It resulted in redevelopment projects in the Jack London District, where Brown purchased and later sold an industrial warehouse, which he used as a personal residence, and in the Lakeside Apartments District near Lake Merritt, where two infill projects were approved. The 10K plan touched the historic Old Oakland district, the Chinatown district, the Uptown district, and downtown.
The 10K plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification, which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Salazar |first=Alex |title=Designing a Socially Just Downtown |journal=National Housing Institute |issue=145 |year=Spring 2006 |url=http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/145/designingdowntown.html |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Additional controversy over development proposals arose from the weakening of the Bay Area and national economy in 2000, 2001, 2007, and the credit crunch and the recession of 2008.  These downturns resulted in lowered sales, rentals and occupancy of the new housing and slower growth and economic recovery than expected.

==Geography==

Oakland is on the east side of San Francisco Bay; in 1991 the City Hall tower was at [tpl]coord|37.805302|-122.272539|display=inline[/tpl] (NAD83). (The building still exists, but like the rest of the Bay Area it has shifted northwest perhaps 0.6 meter in the last twenty years.)
The United States Census Bureau says the city's total area is [tpl]convert|78.0|sqmi|km2[/tpl], including [tpl]convert|55.8|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of land and [tpl]convert|22.2|sqmi|km2[/tpl] (28.48 percent) of water.
Oakland's highest point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over [tpl]convert|1760|ft[/tpl] above sea level at about [tpl]coord|37.8786|-122.2241|display=inline[/tpl].

Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as "the flatlands" and "the hills", which until recent waves of gentrification have also been a reference to Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

===Neighborhoods===

Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The greater divisions in the city include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills.
East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most walkable city in the United States.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/19/BUUK1KCC67.DTL#ixzz1SfOLM9sW |title=S.F., Oakland in top 10 most walkable U.S. cities |author=Said, Carolyn |date=July 20, 2011 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl]
Lake Merritt, an urban estuary near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable features.Lake Merritt Institute. Retrieved April 12, 2011. It was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge in 1870.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lakemerrittinstitute.org/abt_lake_history.htm |title=A Brief History |work=Lake Merritt Institute |accessdate=August 24, 2011[/tpl] Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake.
The city of Piedmont, incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

===Climate and vegetation===

Based on data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |title=Relocation information: Oakland Facts |publisher=Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=July 13, 2011[/tpl] As published in 1993 by Rand McNally. Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are mild and damp. More specifically, it has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose, making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the Bay Bridge means that the Northern part of the city can experience cooling maritime fog. It is far enough inland, though, that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from Berkeley.
The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958.  During that time, the record high temperature was [tpl]convert|104|°F[/tpl] on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was [tpl]convert|24|°F[/tpl] on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with [tpl]convert|38.65|in|mm|0[/tpl] and the driest year was 1910 with [tpl]convert|12.02|in|mm|0[/tpl].  The most rainfall in one month was [tpl]convert|15.35|in|mm|0[/tpl] in January 1911.  The most rainfall in 24 hours was [tpl]convert|4.27|in|0|[/tpl] on February 12, 1904.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6332 |title=Oakland, California – Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl] Rainfall near the bayfront is only 23 inches per year, but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to 30 inches).
The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrone, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (even used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump 30 feet across can still be seen near Redwood Regional Park.  Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. Australian eucalyptus trees have been extensively planted in many areas.
The National Weather Service today has two official weather stations in Oakland: Oakland International Airport and the Oakland Museum (established 1970).

Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas fault caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989.  San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |title=Modeling surface creep on the Hayward fault using rate-and-state friction |first1=David |last1=Schmidt |first2=Roland |last2=Bürgmann |year=1999 |work=The Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |publisher=The Regents of the University of California |accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl]  In 1991, an urban conflagration, the Oakland Hills Fire, destroyed nearly 4,000 homes and killed twenty five people in the Oakland hills range; it was the worst urban firestorm in American history.Catastrophe: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time, Stephen J.

==="There is no there there"===

Oakland was written about by Gertrude Stein in her 1937 book Everybody's Autobiography: "There is no there there." Stein wrote the sentence upon learning that the neighborhood in which she had lived as a child had been torn down to make way for an industrial park; over time, the quote has been misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.[tpl]cite journal |last1=LeBeau |first1=Eleanor |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title=Sampling Oakland |journal=Art Papers |issue=Nov/Dec |page=68 |publisher=getthisgallery.com |url=http://getthisgallery.com/reviews/de_jesus.pdf |accessdate=June 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://oaklandlocal.com/article/here-where-gertrude-stein-quote-ends |title=Here is where the Gertrude Stein quote ends |author=Ward, Jennifer Inez |date=April 2, 2010 |publisher=Oakland Local |accessdate=June 12, 2011[/tpl]

Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.
The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland. The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations. BART's headquarters was located in a building above the Lake Merritt BART station until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic safety concerns.
The Alameda / Oakland Ferry operates ferry service from Jack London Square to Alameda, San Francisco, and Angel Island.
Oakland licenses taxi cabs, and has zoned cab stands in its downtown, including a bicycle pedi-cab service.

In addition, the Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005 and 2007. Several miles of bike lanes were created as a result of the plan, with more awaiting funding.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey, Oakland moved into 7th place in the nation by percentage of people that choose to commute by bike in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Linus Bike Commends Oakland After It Is Listed in Top 10 Commuter Bike Cities|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10128101.htm|publisher=PRWeb|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=15 November 2012[/tpl]

====Bridges, freeways, and tunnels====

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the MacArthur Maze freeway interchange: Interstate 580 (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward Hayward and eventually to the California Central Valley; Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to San Jose; and the Eastshore Freeway (Interstate 80/I-580) runs north, providing connections to Sacramento and San Rafael, respectively.
Interstate 980 (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into State Route 24 (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. State Route 13 begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the Montclair District before entering Berkeley. A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.
In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake caused the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck segment of the Nimitz Freeway to collapse, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. The east span of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15 m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span is currently being replaced, with a projected completion date of 2014.
Two underwater tunnels, the Webster and Posey Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the Park Street, Fruitvale, and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the Oakland Estuary.
In the hills, the Leimert Bridge crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The Caldecott Tunnel carries Highway 24 through the Berkeley Hills, connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

===Freight rail===

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and to a lesser extent by BNSF Railway (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).
Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the Western Pacific Railroad (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the Sacramento Northern Railroad (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

===Shipping===

As one of the three major ports on the West Coast of the United States, the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer,Initial Study: Intermodal Interface Demonstration Project, Port of Oakland, Oakland, California, Earth Metrics and Korve Engineerning, December 20, 1989 thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e. facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Utilities===

Water and sewage treatment are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Pacific Gas and Electric Company provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to Waste Management, Inc. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
