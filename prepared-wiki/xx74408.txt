==History==

The ferry system has its origins in the "Mosquito Fleet", a collection of small steamer lines serving the Puget Sound area during the later part of the nineteenth century and early part of the 20th century. By the beginning of the 1930s, two lines remained: the Puget Sound Navigation Company (known as the Black Ball Line) and the Kitsap County Transportation Company. A strike in 1935 forced the KCTC to close, leaving only the Black Ball Line.History of Washington State Ferry system, wsdot.com, retrieved March 15, 2008
Toward the end of the 1940s the Black Ball Line wanted to increase its fares, to compensate for increased wage demands from the ferry workers' unions, but the state refused to allow this, and so the Black Ball Line shut down. In 1951, the state bought nearly all of Black Ball's ferry assets for $5 million (Black Ball retained five vessels of its fleet).Washington State Ferries begins operations on June 1, 1951, HistoryLink.org, retrieved March 15, 2008 The state intended to run ferry service only until cross-sound bridges could be built, but these were never approved, and the Washington State Department of Transportation runs the system to this day.

==Fleet==

As of 2012, there are 22 ferries on Puget Sound operated by the state.Washington State Ferries - Our Fleet, wsdot.com, Retrieved November 4, 2012  The largest vessels in this fleet carry up to 2500 passengers and 202 vehicles.  They are painted in a distinctive white and green trim paint scheme, and feature double-ended open vehicle decks and bridges at each end so that they do not need to turn around.
The ferry fleet consists of the following vessels:

==Retired vessels==

Since the beginning of state-run ferry service in 1951, WSF has retired many vessels as they have become older, too expensive to operate or maintain, or have become too small to provide adequate ferry service. WSF owned passenger-only vessels between 1985 and 2009, but after discontinuing its two passenger-only routes in the 2000s, WSF has sold its passenger-only ferries to other operators. 
Below is a list of ferries that WSF has retired since 1951. Unless otherwise noted, all vessels introduced in 1951 were acquired from the Black Ball Line when the state took over the company's routes and ferryboats in Puget Sound.

==Routes==

Most Washington State Ferry routes are legally part of the state highway system,2004-2005 Official State Highway Map, Washington State Department of Transportation, retrieved March 15, 2008 frequently with no road portion on one end or the other.  
From October 1986 to September 9, 1989 and from April 23, 1990 to Sept. 21, 2003 a passenger-only service ran on the Seattle-Bremerton route.  It was shut down because of limited profitability and because of continued lawsuits of residents living on the waterway used by the ferry to prevent the high-speed ferries built for the run from running at their full speed.  The slower speed made the crossing time similar or equal to the auto ferry operating on the same route, making the passenger-only service redundant.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
The current passenger-only ferry route between Seattle and Vashon Island is designated State Route 339, with no road portion at either end. This route is no longer operated by Washington State Ferries, as responsibility was passed to the King County Marine Division in fall of 2009.

==Other ferries==

There are several other publicly operated, private, and passenger-only ferries in Washington state.
