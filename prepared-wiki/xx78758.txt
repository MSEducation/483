The Baptist Union of Poland (or Union of Christian Baptists) is an association of Baptist churches in the country of Poland.
Modern Baptist work began in Poland in 1844. The first Polish congregation was formed in the village of Zelow in 1872. Polish Baptists adopted the German Baptist Confession of 1847 as their own confession.
In 1922, the Union of Slavic Baptists in Poland was formed, and the Union of the Baptist Churches of the German Language was formed in 1928. The unions of German-speaking and Polish-speaking Baptists existed until World War II, when they were forced into a merger with other evangelical Christian bodies. After 1947, the Baptists emerged as a small separate body. In 2007 there were 85 churches with 6500 members in the Baptist Union. The Baptist Union of Poland is a member of the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. The Sabbath Day Christian Church is a Seventh Day Baptist body that exists independently of the Union.
The Biblical Theological Seminary in Wroc≈Çaw, now an interdenominational work, was started by the Baptist Union in 1990.
