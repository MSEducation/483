==Career==

===Discovery===

During the summer of 1989, Anderson went with friends to a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at BC Place in Vancouver, during which live video of her wearing a tightly-fitted Labatt's Beer t-shirt was shown on the stadium's huge video screen, causing an immense roar of approval from the crowd. As part of a PR event for the brewery, she was then escorted down to field level to wide applause. From that event, her photographer boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of his own called the Blue Zone Girl.[tpl]cite web|title=Pamela Anderson Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800332320/bio|publisher=Yahoo!

===Playboy magazine career===

In the aftermath of her sudden Vancouver celebrity, she appeared as the cover girl on Playboy magazine's October 1989 issue. At that point she decided to live in Los Angeles to further pursue her modeling career. Playboy subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centerfold photo. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery. Anderson has since appeared in Playboy several times in the 1990s and 2000s.
Anderson's Playboy career spans twenty-two years, including parts of four decades, (1989–2011), and she has appeared on more Playboy covers than anyone else.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/bally-gaming-launches-pamela-anderson-playboy-slot-148379|title=Bally Gaming Launches Pamela Anderson Playboy Slot|work=Casino City Times|date=February 14, 2005|accessdate=February 27, 2009[/tpl] She has also made appearances in the publication's newsstand specials.

She appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of Playboy.

==Causes==

===Animal rights===

One of Anderson's campaigns as a member of PETA has been against the use of fur. In 1999, Anderson received the first Linda McCartney Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the Stella McCartney boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating "What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable." She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=February 26, 2007[/tpl] In January 2006, Anderson requested that the Governor of Kentucky remove a bust of Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to boycott the Kentucky Derby because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
She has also campaigned against seal hunting in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the annual seal hunt but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a t-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline "Save the Seals" in the ad and urges the public to help end "Canada's annual seal slaughter." She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker POM. The "Pom Horrible Campaign"[tpl]cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=July 21, 2009[/tpl] has resulted in the company halting animal tests.
Anderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in Montreal, Canada on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, "In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas – is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical."

===AIDS, cannabis, and other activism===

In March 2005, Anderson became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics's MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by AIDS and HIV. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during events in Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens. Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the American Liver Foundation, and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser. She wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama urging the legalization of cannabis.Playboy magazine; February 2009; Page 112.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===

In addition to her fame from modelling and acting, Anderson has received a great deal of press attention for her well-publicized personal life. Her relationships have made headlines in gossip magazines for years.
Anderson married Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for 96 hours/4 days.http://www.people.com/people/pamela_anderson/biography/ They wed on a beach, with Anderson in a bikini. Anderson's mother did not know, and learned of the marriage from People magazine. During this time, she was known professionally as Pamela Anderson Lee. Together they have two sons, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee. Dylan Jagger Lee was named for Anderson's great grandfather, Dale Jagger Grosco who fought in World War II. The couple divorced in 1998. Although divorced, the couple reunited briefly upon Lee's release from prison but eventually split again in 2001. They reconciled and split again in 2008.http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20206681,00.html
In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted Hepatitis C from Lee (supposedly from sharing tattoo needles), and began writing a regular column for Jane magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern's radio show that she does not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pamelaanderson.com/news/news.asp?item=2056|title=Pamela Anderson Official Site and Fan Club – News Headlines Television Tabloids Magazines|publisher=|accessdate=February 1, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041029141238/www.pamelaanderson.com/news/news.asp?item=2056|archivedate=October 29, 2004[/tpl] but this was misconstrued and taken seriously by many websites and tabloids.
After the 1998 divorce, Anderson became engaged to the model Marcus Schenkenberg; they broke up in 2001. She then became engaged to the singer Kid Rock (Robert J. Ritchie); she broke up with him in 2003. On July 18, 2006, it was announced that she would marry Kid Rock on July 29, 2006, on a yacht near St Tropez, France. "Feels like I've been stuck in a time warp," said Anderson in her blog entry. "Not able to let go of MY family picture ... it's been sad and lonely and frustrating ... I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle. Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing." "I'm moving on," she declared. "I feel like I'm finally free ... I'm in love." There was extensive unconfirmed media speculation that the marriage was pregnancy-related, but the theory was based only on Anderson's representative's refusal to comment on the question.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pattayadailynews.com/shownews.php?IDNEWS=0000000731|title=Pamela Anderson Mum on Rumors of Pregnancy Motivating Kid Rock Marriage|work=Pattaya Daily News|archivedate=March 14, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314080129/http://www.pattayadailynews.com/shownews.php?IDNEWS=0000000731[/tpl]

===Sex tapes controversy===

A sex tape of Anderson and Tommy Lee on their honeymoon was stolen from their home in 1995 and made a huge stir on the Internet. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group. Ultimately, the Lees entered into a confidential settlement agreement with IEG. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its web sites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites.[tpl]cite web|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|title=Pamela Lee drops video case|url=http://news.cnet.com/Pamela-Lee-drops-video-case/2100-1023_3-205848.html?tag=mncol|work=CNET News|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=August 2, 2010|date=December 1, 1997[/tpl]
Another tape, which was made before the Tommy Lee tape, involving Anderson and musician Bret Michaels from Poison, was later announced, and an abridged version of less than 60 seconds appeared on the internet. Frames of the video first appeared in Penthouse magazine in March 1998. The tape was successfully blocked by Michaels, but a four-minute sex tape is still available on the Internet.

Newman House is a pop architecture building constructed in 2003 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, which features a large image of Anderson's face. Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muma/exhibitions/past/2005/pavilions.html |title=Pavilions for New Architecture, Monash University Museum of Art |publisher=Monash.edu.au |accessdate=August 2, 2010[/tpl]
