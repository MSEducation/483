==History==

KLAV ran a middle-of-the-road (MOR) format until the late 1970s. In early 1979, at the peak of the disco craze, the station endeared itself "Disco 1-2-3 KLAV". KLAV evolved into a Top 40 format in the early 1980. It played a lot of R&B/Urban music that rival Top 40 station, 98.5 KLUC, would not play at the time. KLAV was the first commercial station to play rap/hip-hop music in Las Vegas. In 1985 the station briefly switched to an easy-listening format and changed its call letters to KEZD but returned to its traditional KLAV name and time-brokered format by 1987. 
KLAV previously broadcast from atop the former Bob Stupak's Vegas World Hotel & Casino until its closure in 2000. The station broadcast in a few locations around the Las Vegas Valley but eventually settled down at its current West Sahara Avenue location.
