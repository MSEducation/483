Ulrich Wehling (born 8 July 1952 in Halle) is a retired German skier who won the nordic combined event in the Winter Olympics three consecutive times, in 1972, 1976, and 1980. Wehling was the first man to win three consecutive gold medals in the same event at Winter Olympics but not the first Olympian to win three Gold in a winter discipline as Gillis Grafström had won a figure skating title at the Summer Olympics 1920 before winning twice at the first two Winter Olympics.
At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, Wehling won two Nordic combined medals with a gold in 1974 and a bronze in 1978. Wehling also won the Nordic combined at the Holmenkollen ski festival three straight years (1975–1977). For his successes in the Nordic combined, he received the Holmenkollen medal in 1976.
Wehling is currently FIS Race Director for the Nordic combined, a role he also did for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007 in Sapporo. He now lives in Switzerland.
