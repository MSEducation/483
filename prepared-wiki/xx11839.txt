Wisconsin [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Wisconsin.ogg|w|ɪ|s|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|s|ə|n[/tpl] is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 23rd state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state comprises 72 counties.
Wisconsin's geography is diverse, with the Northern Highland and Western Upland along with a part of the Central Plain occupying the western part of the state and lowlands stretching to the shore of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin is second to Michigan in the length of its Great Lakes coastline.
Wisconsin is known as "America's Dairyland" because it is one of the nation's leading dairy producers, particularly famous for cheese. Manufacturing and tourism are also major contributors to the state's economy.

==Etymology==

The word Wisconsin originates from the name given to the Wisconsin River by one of the Algonquian-speaking American Indian groups living in the region at the time of European contact.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/wisconsin-name/ |title=Wisconsin's Name: Where it Came from and What it Means |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society[/tpl] French explorer Jacques Marquette was the first European to reach the Wisconsin River, arriving in 1673 and calling the river Meskousing in his journal.[tpl]Cite book | last = Marquette | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Marquette | year = 1673 | contribution = The Mississippi Voyage of Jolliet and Marquette, 1673 | contribution-url = http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-051/ | editor-last = Kellogg | editor-first = Louise P. | title = Early Narratives of the Northwest, 1634–1699 | place = New York | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | page = 235 | oclc = 31431651 [/tpl] This spelling was later corrupted to Ouisconsin by other French explorers, and over time this became the French name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands. English speakers anglicized the spelling to its modern form when they began to arrive in greater numbers during the early 19th century. The current spelling was made official by the legislature of Wisconsin Territory in 1845.[tpl]cite journal | last = Smith | first = Alice E. | title = Stephen H.

The Algonquian word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. Interpretations vary, but most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the Miami word Meskonsing, meaning "it lies red," a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the Wisconsin Dells.McCafferty, Michael. 2003. On Wisconsin: The Derivation and Referent of an Old Puzzle in American Placenames. Onoma 38: 39–56  Other theories include claims that the name originated from one of a variety of Ojibwa words meaning "red stone place," "where the waters gather," or "great rock."[ref][tpl]cite journal | last = Vogel | first = Virgil J. | title = Wisconsin's Name: A Linguistic Puzzle | journal = Wisconsin Magazine of History | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–186 | publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society | location = Madison, Wisconsin | year = 1965 | url = http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/u?/wmh,23263 | accessdate = July 24, 2008 [/tpl]

==History==

Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 12,000 years. The first people arrived around 10,000 BCE during the Wisconsin Glaciation. These early inhabitants, called Paleo-Indians, hunted now-extinct ice age animals exemplified by the Boaz mastodon, a prehistoric mastodon skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin.[tpl]Cite book | last=Theler | first=James | last2=Boszhardt | first2=Robert | title=Twelve Millennia: Archaeology of the Upper Mississippi River Valley | year=2003 |publisher=University of Iowa Press |location= Iowa City, Iowa |isbn=978-0-87745-847-0|page=59 [/tpl] After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE, people in the subsequent Archaic period lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering food from wild plants. Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the Woodland period between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. Toward the end of this period, Wisconsin was the heartland of the "Effigy Mound culture", which built thousands of animal-shaped mounds across the landscape.[tpl]Cite book | last=Birmingham | first=Robert | last2=Eisenberg | first2=Leslie| title=Indian Mounds of Wisconsin | year=2000 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location= Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-16870-4 |pages=100–110 [/tpl] Later, between 1000 and 1500 CE, the Mississippian and Oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at Aztalan in southeast Wisconsin.Birmingham 2000, p.152–156 The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern Ioway and Ho-Chunk tribes who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menominee at the time of European contact.Birmingham 2000, p.165–167 Other American Indian groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the Ojibwa, Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and Pottawatomie, who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700.[tpl]cite book |last=Boatman | first=John |editor-first=Donald| editor-last=Fixico |title=An Anthology of Western Great Lakes Indian History |publisher= University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee |year=1987  |chapter=Historical Overview of the Wisconsin Area: From Early Years to the French, British, and Americans |oclc=18188646[/tpl]
The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer Jean Nicolet. He canoed west from Georgian Bay through the Great Lakes in 1634, and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near Green Bay at Red Banks.[tpl]cite web | title = Jean Nicolet | url = http://www.uwgb.edu/wisfrench/library/articles/nicolet.htm | author = Rodesch, Gerrold C. | year = 1984 | publisher = University of Wisconsin–Green Bay | accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] Pierre Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers visited Green Bay again in 1654–1666 and Chequamegon Bay in 1659–1660, where they traded for fur with local American Indians.[tpl]cite web | title = Turning Points in Wisconsin History: Arrival of the First Europeans | url = http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-006/?action=more_essay | publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society | accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] In 1673, Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first to record a journey on the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway all the way to the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien.[tpl]cite journal |last=Jaenen |first=Cornelius |year=1973 |title=French colonial attitudes and the exploration of Jolliet and Marquette |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=300–310 [/tpl] Frenchmen like Nicholas Perrot continued to ply the fur trade across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before Great Britain won control of the region following the French and Indian War in 1763. Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with Charles de Langlade in 1764, now settled in Wisconsin permanently rather than returning to British-controlled Canada.[tpl]cite web | title = Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Langlade, Charles Michel | url = http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel | publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society | accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl]
Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the American Revolutionary War. However, the British remained in control until after the War of 1812, the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area.[tpl]cite book |title=Wisconsin: A History |last=Nesbit |first=Robert  |year=1973 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=978-0-299-06370-2 |pages=62–64|title=Wisconsin : a history [/tpl] Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining. The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the U.S. and Europe to the lead deposits located at Mineral Point, Wisconsin, Dodgeville, Wisconsin, and nearby areas. Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug and earned the nickname "badgers," leading to Wisconsin's identity as the "Badger State."[tpl]cite web | title=Badger Nickname | url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/trads/nickname.html | publisher=University of Wisconsin | accessdate=March 14, 2010 [/tpl] The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population. The Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832 led to the forced removal of American Indians from most parts of the state.[tpl]cite book |last=Nesbit |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-299-06370-2 |pages=95–97|title=Wisconsin : a history[/tpl] Following these conflicts, Wisconsin Territory was organized in 1836. Continued white settlement led to statehood in 1848.
Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern abolitionism. The debate became especially intense in 1854 after Joshua Glover, a runaway slave from Missouri, was captured in Racine. Glover was taken into custody under the Federal Fugitive Slave Law, but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada.  In a trial stemming from the incident, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional.[tpl]cite book |title= Leading Events of Wisconsin History |last=Legler |first=Henry |year=1898 |publisher=Sentinel |location= Milwaukee |isbn= |pages= 226–229 | url=http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/wireader/WER1124.html | chapter = Rescue of Joshua Glover, a Runaway Slave | accessdate = March 13, 2010 [/tpl] The Republican Party, founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in Ripon, Wisconsin, grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events.[tpl]cite book |last=Nesbit |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-299-06370-2 |pages=238–239|title=Wisconsin : a history [/tpl] During the Civil War, around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the Union.[tpl]cite web | title = Turning Points in Wisconsin History: The Iron Brigade, Old Abe and Military Affairs | url = http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-023/?action=more_essay | publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society | accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl]
Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like J.I. Case & Company in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.[tpl]cite book |last=Nesbit |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-299-06370-2 |page=273 |title=Wisconsin : a history[/tpl] Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Wausau. These economic activities had dire environmental consequences. By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.[tpl]cite book |last=Nesbit |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-299-06370-2 |pages=281, 309|title=Wisconsin : a history [/tpl] These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.
Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin, helped the state build a reputation as "America's Dairyland."[tpl]cite book |title= The Progressive Era, 1893–1914 | series=History of Wisconsin |volume=4 | first=John | last=Buenker | publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin | location=Madison | year=1998 | editor-first=William Fletcher | editor-last=Thompson |isbn=978-0-87020-303-9 | pages =  25, 40–41, 62[/tpl] Meanwhile, conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped reestablish the state's forests during the early 20th century,[tpl]cite web | title = Turning Points in Wisconsin History: The Modern Environmental Movement | url = http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-048/?action=more_essay | publisher = Wisconsin Historical Society | accessdate=March 13, 2010[/tpl] paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe. Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and toolmaking, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U.S. states in total product value by 1910.[tpl]cite book |title= The Progressive Era, 1893–1914 | series=History of Wisconsin |volume=4 | first=John | last=Buenker | publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin | location=Madison | year=1998 | editor-first=William Fletcher | editor-last=Thompson |isbn=978-0-87020-303-9 | pages =  80–81[/tpl]
The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of progressive politics championed by Robert M. La Follette. Between 1901 and 1914, Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation's first comprehensive statewide primary election system,[tpl]cite book |title=The American direct primary: party institutionalization and transformation in the North |last=Ware |first=Alan |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=978-0-521-81492-8 |page=118 [/tpl] the first effective workplace injury compensation law,[tpl]cite web | last= Ranney | first= Joseph | title = Wisconsin's Legal History: Law and the Progressive Era, Part 3: Reforming the Workplace | url=http://www.wisbar.org/AM/TemplateRedirect.cfm?template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=35854 | accessdate = March 13, 2010 [/tpl] and the first state income tax,[tpl]cite journal |last=Stark |first=John |year=1987 |title=The Establishment of Wisconsin's Income Tax |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=27–45 [/tpl] making taxation proportional to actual earnings.

Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the anti-communist crusades of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the Sterling Hall bombing in August 1970. The state became a leader in welfare reform under Republican Governor Tommy Thompson during the 1990s.[tpl]cite web | title =Tommy Thompson: Human Services Reformer | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122179&page=1 | date=September 4, 2004 | accessdate = March 13, 2010 [/tpl] The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a service economy based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism.
Two U.S. Navy battleships, BB-9 and BB-64, were named for the state.

==Geography==

Wisconsin is bordered by the Montreal River; Lake Superior and Michigan to the north; by Lake Michigan to the east; by Illinois to the south; and by Iowa to the southwest and Minnesota to the northwest. A border dispute with Michigan was settled by two cases, both Wisconsin v. Michigan, in 1934 and 1935. The state's boundaries include the Mississippi River and St. Croix River in the west, and the Menominee River in the northeast.
With its location between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the Lake Superior Lowland occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the Northern Highland has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the [tpl]convert|1500000|acre|km2[/tpl] Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state's highest point, Timms Hill. In the middle of the state, the Central Plain has some unique sandstone formations like the Dells of the Wisconsin River in addition to rich farmland. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin's largest cities.
The ridges include the Niagara Escarpment that stretches from New York, the Black River Escarpment and the Magnesian Escarpment.[ref]

The bedrock of the Niagara Escarpment is dolomite, while the two shorter ridges have limestone bedrock.
In the southwest, the Western Upland is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland, including many bluffs on the Mississippi River. This region is part of the Driftless Area, which also includes portions of Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota. This area was not covered by glaciers during the most recent ice age, the Wisconsin Glaciation.
Overall, 46% of Wisconsin's land area is covered by forest. Langlade County has a soil rarely found outside of the county called Antigo Silt Loam.
Areas under the management of the National Park Service include the following:[tpl]cite web | title = Wisconsin | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = July 17, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/wi[/tpl]
There is one national forest managed by the U.S. Forest Service in Wisconsin, Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.
Wisconsin has sister-state relationships with the Germany's Hesse, Japan's Chiba Prefecture, Mexico's Jalisco, China's Heilongjiang, and Nicaragua.[tpl]cite web|url=http://international.wi.gov/SisterStates.html|title=Sister-States and Cities|accessdate=March 16, 2007|date=March 20, 2006|publisher=International Wisconsin[/tpl]

===Climate===

The southern third of Wisconsin is classified as hot summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa) and the colder northern portion is classified as warm summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). The highest temperature ever recorded in the state was in the Wisconsin Dells, on July 13, 1936, where it reached 114 °F (46 °C). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Wisconsin was in the village of Couderay, where it reached −55 °F (−48 °C) on both February 2 and 4, 1996. Wisconsin also receives a large amount of regular snowfall averaging around 40 inches in the southern portions with up to 160 inches annually in the Lake Superior snowbelt each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwex.edu/sco/stateclimate.html|title=Climate of Wisconsin|accessdate=March 16, 2007|last=Benedetti|first=Michael|publisher=The University of Wisconsin–Extension[/tpl]

Since its founding, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous. Following the period of French fur traders, the next wave of settlers were miners, many of whom were Cornish, who settled the southwestern area of the state. The next wave was dominated by "Yankees," migrants of English descent from New England and upstate New York; in the early years of statehood, they dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics and education. Between 1850 and 1900, large numbers of European immigrants followed them, including Germans, Scandinavians (the largest group being Norwegian), and smaller groups of Belgians, Dutch, Swiss, Finns, Irish, Poles, Italians, and others. In the 20th century, large numbers of Mexicans and African Americans came, settling mainly in Milwaukee; and after end of the Vietnam War came an influx of Hmongs.
According to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the population was:
In the same year, 5.9% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55000.html |title=Wisconsin QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012[/tpl]

The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state. Although Germans settled throughout the state, the largest concentration was in Milwaukee. Norwegians settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west. Small colonies of Belgians, Swiss, Finns and other groups settled in their particular areas, with Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants settling primarily in urban areas.Miller, Frank H., "The Polanders in Wisconsin". Parkman Club Publications No. 10. Milwaukee, Wis.: Parkman Club, 1896. Retrieved January 29, 2008. African Americans came to Milwaukee, especially from 1940 on. Menominee County is the only county in the eastern United States with an American Indian majority.
86% of Wisconsin's African-American population live in four cities: Milwaukee, Racine, Beloit, Kenosha, with Milwaukee home to nearly three-fourths of the state's black Americans. In the Great Lakes region, only Detroit and Cleveland have a higher percentage of African-American residents.
33% of Wisconsin's Asian population is Hmong, with significant communities in Milwaukee, Wausau, Green Bay, Sheboygan, Appleton, Madison, La Crosse, Eau Claire, Oshkosh, and Manitowoc.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.apl.wisc.edu/publications/HmongChartbook.pdf |format=PDF|title= Wisconsin's Hmong Population|accessdate=April 26, 2010 |publisher= University of Wisconsin–Madison Applied Population Laboratory[/tpl]

==Government==

The Wisconsin Blue Book is the primary published reference about the government and politics of the state, documenting the organization of the state’s three branches of government. Published every two years with updated information, copies are available by contacting state legislators.
Wisconsin's Constitution outlines the structure and function of state government. Wisconsin's government is organized into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.

===Executive===

The executive branch is headed by the governor. The current governor, Scott Walker, assumed office on January 3, 2011. In addition to the governor, the executive branch includes five other elected constitutional officers: Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, and State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

===Legislative===

The Wisconsin State Legislature is Wisconsin's legislative branch. The Legislature is a bicameral body consisting of the Assembly and the Senate.

===Judicial===

Wisconsin's court system has four levels: municipal courts, circuit courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court.  Municipal courts typically handle cases involving local ordinance matters. The circuit courts are Wisconsin's trial courts, they have original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within the state. Challenges to circuit court rulings are heard by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, consisting of sixteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. As the state's highest appellate court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court may hear both appeals from lower courts and original actions. In addition to deciding cases, the Supreme Court is responsible for administering the state's court system and regulating the practice of law in Wisconsin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wicourts.gov/courts/overview/overview.htm |title=Wisconsin Court System – court system overview |publisher=Wicourts.gov |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl]

===Federal===

In the United State Senate Wisconsin is represented by Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin. Wisconsin is divided into eight congressional districts.

===Taxes===

Wisconsin collects personal income taxes (based on five income brackets) which range from 4.6% to 7.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 5.0%. Fifty-nine counties have an additional sales/use tax of 0.5%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/esd/cotax07.html|title=County Sales Tax Distribution-2007|accessdate=March 24, 2007|date=March 6, 2007|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Revenue[/tpl] Milwaukee County and four surrounding counties have an additional temporary 0.1% tax that helps fund the Miller Park baseball stadium, which was completed in 2001.
The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real property tax, or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. In order to provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.
Wisconsin does not assess a tax on intangible property. Wisconsin does not collect inheritance taxes. Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's estate tax was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/faqs/ise/estate.html#ret3 |title=Wisconsin Department of Revenue |publisher=Revenue.wi.gov |accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl]
There are no toll roads in Wisconsin; highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by motor fuel tax revenues, and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund. Non-highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments (municipalities or counties).

==Politics==

During the period of the Civil War, Wisconsin was a Republican state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, although ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition. Through the first half of the 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived Progressive Party. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and Democrats. Republican Senator Joe McCarthy was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.; prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Congressman David Obey.[tpl]cite book|last=Conant|first=James K.|title=Wisconsin Politics and Government: America's Laboratory of Democracy|date=March 1, 2006|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-1548-7|chapter=1[/tpl]
The most famous controversy in the state's political history dealt with foreign language teaching in schools. This was fought out in the Bennett Law campaign of 1890, when the Germans switched to the Democratic Party because of the Republican Party's support of the Bennett Law, which led to a major victory for the Democrats.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The cities of Wisconsin have been active in increasing the availability of legislative information on the internet, thereby providing for greater government transparency. Currently three of the five most populous cities in Wisconsin provide their constituents with internet-based access of all public records directly from the cities’ databases. Wisconsin cities started to make this a priority after Milwaukee began doing so, on their page, in 2001. One such city, Madison, has been named the Number 1 digital city by the Center for Digital Government in consecutive years.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In recent decades, Wisconsin has become a Democratic-leaning state at the presidential level; it has voted for Democratic candidates in each of the last seven presidential elections. The last Republican to carry the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984.  In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney chose Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, a native of Janesville, as his running mate against incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Despite Ryan's presence on the Republican ticket, Obama still carried Wisconsin by a margin of 53% to 46%.
At the statewide level, Wisconsin is competitive, with control regularly alternating between the two parties. The 2010 elections saw a huge Republican resurgence in Wisconsin. Republicans took control of the governor's office and both houses of the state legislature. Republican Ron Johnson defeated Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Russ Feingold, and Republicans took two previously Democratic-held House seats, creating a 5–3 Republican majority House delegation.
On February 14, 2011, the Wisconsin State Capitol erupted with protests when the Legislature took up a bill that would end most collective bargaining rights for state employees, except for wages, to address the $3.6 bil. deficit. The protests attracted tens of thousands of people each day,[tpl]when|date=November 2011[/tpl] and garnered international attention.
The Assembly passed the bill 53–42 on March 10 after the State Senate passed it the night before, and sent it to the Governor for his signature.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/10/wisconsin.budget/index.html?hpt=T1&iref=BN1 |title=Wisconsin Assembly passes bill to curb collective bargaining |publisher=CNN |date=March 10, 2011[/tpl] In response to the bill, enough signatures were gathered to force a recall election against Governor Walker. Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee and Walker's 2010 opponent, won the Democratic primary and faced Walker again. Walker won the election by 53% to 46% and became the first governor in United States history to retain his seat after a recall election.

===Lawmakers in Wisconsin===

The last election in which Wisconsin supported a Republican Presidential candidate was in 1984. However, both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections were close, with Wisconsin receiving heavy doses of national advertising because it was a "swing", or pivot, state. Al Gore carried the presidential vote in 2000 by 5,700 votes, and John Kerry won Wisconsin in 2004 by 11,000 votes. However, in 2008, Barack Obama carried the state by 381,000 votes and with 56%. Republicans had a stronghold in the Fox Valley, but elected a Democrat, Steve Kagen, of Appleton, for the 8th Congressional District in 2006.  However, Kagen survived only two terms and was replaced by Republican Reid Ribble in the Republican Party's sweep of Wisconsin in November 2010, the first time the Republican Party has taken back both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship in the same election.  Republicans have held Waukesha County. The City of Milwaukee heads the list of Wisconsin's Democratic strongholds, which also includes Madison and the state's Native American reservations. Wisconsin's largest Congressional district, the 7th, had voted Democratic since 1969. Its representative, David Obey, chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400300 |title=David Obey, former U.S. Representative |publisher=GovTrack.us |accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] However, Obey retired and the once Democratic seat was overtaken by Republican Sean Duffy in November 2010.
In 2006, Democrats gained in a national sweep of opposition to the Bush administration, and the Iraq War. The retiring GOP 8th District Congressman, Mark Green, of Green Bay, ran against the incumbent Governor Jim Doyle. Green lost by 8% statewide, making Doyle the first Democratic governor to be re-elected in 32 years. The Republicans lost control of the state Senate. Although Democrats gained eight seats in the state Assembly, Republicans retained a five-vote majority in that house. In 2008, Democrats regained control of the State Assembly by a 52–46 margin, marking the first time since 1987 that the governor and state legislature were both Democratic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]  However, Republicans won both chambers of the legislature and the governorship in 2010, the first time all three changed partisan control in the same election. In November 2012, Tammy Baldwin became the first openly gay senator to be elected into office in the nation.Wisconsin's Baldwin becomes first openly gay senator retrieved November 13, 2012
