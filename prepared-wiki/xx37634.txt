==History==

Air Florida was based at Miami International Airport. It was formed in 1971 by a Miami native, Eli Timoner and was organized by company president Ted Griffin, a former marketing director of Eastern Airlines. It started operations in 1972.[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl] Initial aircraft included the Boeing 707 jetliner and later transitioning to the Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop. The airline began operations as an intrastate air carrier flying wholly within Florida but subsequently began service to domestic and international destinations outside of the state.  With this expansion, Air Florida's fleet grew to include Boeing 727, Boeing 737, Douglas DC-9 and Douglas DC-10 jetliners.airliners.net, all Air Florida aircraft photos[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl]
Ed Acker, formerly CEO of Braniff International Airways, led an acquisition of Air Florida in 1975 and expanded the airline into the interstate market following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.[tpl]cite book |last= Petzinger |first= Thomas |title= Hard Landing: The Epic Contest For Power and Profits That Plunged the Airlines into Chaos |publisher= Random House |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-0-307-77449-1[/tpl] In addition to Air Florida having a large presence in the Northeast-to-Florida market during the 1970s and 1980s, the airline also expanded internationally and served various points in the Caribbean and Central America, as well as a number of European destinations including Amsterdam, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Shannon and Zurich.departedflights.com; Air Florida route maps[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl] The European services were primarily flown with Douglas DC-10-30  aircraft, although British Island Airways provided connecting passenger service with their British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets for Air Florida on some intra-European route segments with an example being London-Amsterdam .departedflights.com, Air Florida system timetables Air Florida was well known for its attractive flight attendants and, on international flights, four-star cuisine.[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl] In 1981, shortly before the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Acker left Air Florida to become the Chairman, CEO and President of Pan American World Airways.[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl]
Air Florida tried to buy out Western Airlines during the 1980s, to increase its presence in the West and begin flights to Mexico and western Canada. The negotiations with Western ended up with Air Florida owning 16 percent of the California-based company.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Western was later absorbed by Delta Air Lines.[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl]
On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into Washington, DC's 14th Street Bridge and fell into the Potomac River shortly after taking off. A total of 70 passengers, 4 crew, and 4 motorists on the bridge were killed. The crash of the Boeing 737-200 was due to an anti-icing system being left off, which caused an inaccurately high engine pressure ratio (EPR) indication at an extremely low power setting, and the crew's failure to either abort the takeoff or apply maximum engine power. The crash prompted modifications to Air Florida's pilot training regarding anti-ice systems. The FAA also required revised aircraft de-icing procedures at airports.[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2012[/tpl]
The crash of Flight 90, coupled with Air Florida's high financial leverage and reliance on foreign currency trading for profits, led the company to declare bankruptcy and cease operations on July 3, 1984, despite an effort by new head Donald Lloyd-Jones (an alumnus of American Airlines) to save the company. When operations ceased, Air Florida had over 18 months of unprocessed credit card ticket purchases and dozens of flight crews idle at home because management had failed to renew leases on all DC-10-30 aircraft. Midway Airlines acquired most of the assets of Air Florida for $53 million while Air Florida was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[tpl]cite news|author=AP|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E6DE1F38F936A2575BC0A963948260|title=Midway Jets Sale|publisher=New York Times|date=1985-08-15|accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl]

==Air Florida Commuter==

Air Florida Commuter was not an airline, but a system of affiliated commuter and regional air carriers that fed traffic into Air Florida's hubs. In an arrangement commonly known as code-sharing, each airline painted their aircraft in Air Florida colors and their flights were listed in reservations systems as Air Florida flights. Air Miami became the first affiliate in 1980, and over a dozen other airlines became part of the system, including: Marco Island Airways, Florida Airlines, Key Air, Southern International, Skyway Airlines, North American Airlines, National Commuter Airlines, Gull Air, Pompano, Finair, Slocum, Atlantic Gulf and others. As Air Florida became financially strapped, the commuter system was dismantled in early 1984. Air Florida Commuter. Sunshineskies.com (2010-12-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.
