The  “Bolivarian Revolution” refers to a leftist social movement and political process in Venezuela led by late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, the founder of the Fifth Republic Movement (founded the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007).  The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after Simón Bolívar, an early 19th-century Venezuelan and Latin American revolutionary leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" seeks to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism - popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption - in Venezuela. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a socialist perspective.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
On his 57th birthday, while announcing that he was being treated for cancer, Chavez announced that he had changed the slogan of the Bolivarian Revolution from “Motherland, socialism, or death” to “Socialist motherland and victory, we will live, and we will come out victorious.”[tpl]cite journal|last=Aponte-Moreno|first=Marco|author2=Lance Lattig|title=Chavez: Rhetoric Made in Havana|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/ch%C3%A1vez-rhetoric-made-havana|accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl]

==Background: Bolivarianism==

Simón Bolívar has cast a long shadow over Venezuela's history.
Chavez as a military cadet was "a celebrant of the Bolivarian passion story".Enrique Krauze, "The Shah of Venezuela",  The New Republic, 1 April 2009
Chávez relied upon the ideas of Bolívar, and on Bolívar as a popular symbol, later in his military career as he put together his MBR-200 movement which would become a vehicle for his 1992 coup-attempt.

==Policies==

Chavismo policies include nationalization, social welfare programs (Bolivarian Missions), and opposition to neoliberalism (particularly the policies of the IMF and the World Bank). According to Hugo Chávez, Venezuelan socialism accepts private property,[tpl]cite news|last=Sivaramakrishnan|first=Arvind|title=Hugo Chávez: Death of a socialist|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/hugo-chvez-death-of-a-socialist/article4481169.ece|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=6 March 2013[/tpl] but this socialism seeks to promote social property too.[tpl]cite news|last=Salmerón|first=Víctor|title=Plan Chávez prevé crear 30 mil empresas de propiedad social|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/economia/120613/plan-chavez-preve-crear-30-mil-empresas-de-propiedad-social|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=13 June 2012|language=Spanish[/tpl] Chavismo also support participatory democracy[tpl]cite news|title=La democracia participativa es un concepto chavista|url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/nacionales/democracia-participativa-es-un-concepto-chavista/|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Correo del Orinoco|date=16 November 2013|language=Spanish[/tpl] and workplace democracy.[tpl]cite news|last=Albrecht|first=Hermann|title=Chavez Calls on Workers to Push for Workplace Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4478|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=Venezuelanalysis.com|date=29 May 2009[/tpl] In January 2007, Chávez proposed to build the communal state, whose main idea is to build self-government institutions like communal councils, communes, and communal cities.[tpl]cite web|last=Azzellini|first=Dario|title=The Communal State: Communal Councils, Communes, and Workplace Democracy|url=https://nacla.org/article/communal-state-communal-councils-communes-and-workplace-democracy|publisher=North American Congress on Latin America|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]

==Internationalism==

The "Bolivarian Revolution" under Chávez also refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called "oil diplomacy", which provided cheap oil to poor neighbouring nations. Chávez regularly portrayed his movement's objectives as being in intractable conflict with neocolonialism and neoliberalism.
