Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is an edible  flowering plant in the family of Amaranthaceae. It is native to central and southwestern Asia. It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), which grows to a height of up to 30 cm. Spinach may survive over winter in temperate regions.  The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular-based, very variable in size from about 2–30 cm long and 1–15 cm broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm diameter, maturing into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm across containing several seeds.
Common spinach, Spinacia oleracea, was long considered to be in the Chenopodiaceae family, but in 2003, the Chenopodiaceae family was combined with the Amaranthaceae family under the family name 'Amaranthaceae' in the order Caryophyllales. Within the Amaranthaceae family, Amaranthoideae and Chenopodioideae are now subfamilies, for the amaranths and the chenopods, respectively.

==Etymology==

The English word "spinach" dates to the late 14th century, and is from espinache (Fr. épinard), of uncertain origin. The traditional view derives it from O.Prov. espinarc, which perhaps is via Catalan espinac, from Andalusian Arabic asbinakh (اسبيناخ), from Arabic es-sabaanikh (السبانخ), from Persian اسپاناخ aspanakh, meaning roughly "green hand",Douglas Harper, Online Etymological Dictionary s.v. spinach. (WWW: Accessed 03/07/2010). http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spinach but the multiplicity of forms makes the theory doubtful.[tpl]OED|spinach[/tpl]

==History==

Spinach is thought to have originated in ancient Persia (modern Iran and neighboring countries). Arab traders carried spinach into India, and then the plant was introduced into ancient China, where it was known as "Persian vegetable" (bōsī cài; 波斯菜; present:菠菜). The earliest available record of the spinach plant was recorded in Chinese, stating it was introduced into China via Nepal (probably in 647 AD).Victor R. Boswell, "Garden Peas and Spinach from the Middle East". Reprint of "Our Vegetable Travelers" National Geographic Magazine, Vol 96:2 (Aug 1949). (WWW: Aggie Horticulture. Accessed 03/07/2010).

In AD 827, the Saracens introduced spinach to Sicily.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The first written evidence of spinach in the Mediterranean was recorded in three 10th-century works: the medical work by al-Razi (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Wahshiya and the other by Qustus al-Rumi. Spinach became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in Spain by the latter part of the 12th century, where the great Arab agronomist Ibn al-'Awwam called it the "captain of leafy greens". Spinach was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Hajjaj.Clifford A. Wright.

The prickly-seeded form of spinach was known in Germany by no later than the 13th century, though the smooth-seeded form was not described until 1552. (The smooth-seeded form is used in modern commercial production.)
Spinach first appeared in England and France in the 14th century, probably via Spain, and it gained quick popularity because it appeared in early spring, when other vegetables were scarce and when Lenten dietary restrictions discouraged consumption of other foods. Spinach is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, The Forme of Cury (1390), where it is referred to as spinnedge and/or spynoches.Jacques Rolland and Carol Sherman, "Spinach".

Accessed 03/07/2010). http://www.canadianliving.com/glossary/spinach.php Smooth-seeded spinach was described in 1552.
In 1533, Catherine de' Medici became queen of France; she so fancied spinach, she insisted it be served at every meal. To this day, dishes made with spinach are known as "Florentine", reflecting Catherine's birth in Florence.Spinach, The George Mateljan Foundation

===Nutrition===

Spinach has a high nutritional value and is extremely rich in antioxidants, especially when fresh, steamed, or quickly boiled. It is a rich source of vitamin A (and especially high in lutein), vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, magnesium, manganese, folate, betaine, iron, vitamin B2, calcium, potassium, vitamin B6, folic acid, copper, protein, phosphorus, zinc, niacin, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids. Recently, opioid peptides called rubiscolins have also been found in spinach.
Polyglutamyl folate (vitamin B9 or folic acid) is a vital constituent of cells, and spinach is a good source of folic acid. Boiling spinach can more than halve the level of folate left in the spinach, but microwaving does not affect folate content.[tpl]cite book|author=G. F. M.

====Iron====

Spinach, along with other green leafy vegetables,Wt_Rank is considered to be rich in iron. For example, the United States Department of Agriculture states that a 180-g serving of boiled spinach contains [tpl]nowrap|6.43 mg[/tpl] of iron, whereas a 170-g ground hamburger patty contains at most [tpl]nowrap|4.42 mg[/tpl].U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2005. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 18. Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page, http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp However, spinach contains iron absorption-inhibiting substances, including high levels of oxalate, which can bind to the iron to form ferrous oxalate and render much of the iron in spinach unusable by the body.http://helios.hampshire.edu/~nlNS/mompdfs/oxalicacid.pdf In addition to preventing absorption and use, high levels of oxalates remove iron from the body.[tpl]Cite book| title = Nutrition and diet therapy| year = 1997| pages = 229| isbn = 978-0-8151-9273-2| last1 = Williams| first1 =  Sue Rodwell| last2 =  Long     | first2 =  Sara [/tpl] But some studies have found that the addition of oxalic acid to the diet may improve iron absorption in rats over a diet with spinach without additional oxalic acid.http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/114/3/526.pdf

====Calcium====

Spinach also has a high calcium content. However, the oxalate content in spinach also binds with calcium, decreasing its absorption. Calcium and zinc also limit iron absorption.[tpl]Cite book| title = Nutrition| url = http://books.google.com/?id=46o0PzPI07YC&printsec=frontcover| year = 2003| pages = 474| isbn = 978076370765| last1 = Insel | first1 = By Paul M.| last2 = Elaine Turner | first2 = R.| last3 = Ross | first3 = Don| accessdate = 2009-04-15 [/tpl] The calcium in spinach is the least bioavailable of calcium sources.[tpl]Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=il8rmEAZoW8C&printsec=frontcover | title = Calcium in human health| year = 2006| author = Heaney, Robert Proulx| pages = 135| isbn = 978-1-59259-961-5| accessdate = 2009-04-15 [/tpl] By way of comparison, the human body can absorb about half of the calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in spinach.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Types of spinach===

A distinction can be made between older varieties of spinach and more modern ones. Older varieties tend to bolt too early in warm conditions. Newer varieties tend to grow more rapidly, but have less of an inclination to run up to seed. The older varieties have narrower leaves and tend to have a stronger and more bitter taste. Most newer varieties have broader leaves and round seeds.
The three basic types of spinach are:

===Production, marketing and storage===

Spinach is sold loose, bunched, packaged fresh in bags, canned, or frozen. Fresh spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050323124809.htm | title=Storage Time And Temperature Effects Nutrients In Spinach | accessdate = 2008-07-05[/tpl] While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, spinach will lose most of its folate and carotenoid content, so for longer storage, it is blanched and frozen, cooked and frozen, or canned. Storage in the freezer can be for up to eight months.
The Environmental Working Group reported spinach is one of the dozen most heavily pesticide-contaminated produce products.EWG's Shopper's Guide to Pesticides hello
The most common pesticides found on spinach are permethrin, dimethoate, and DDT.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] Spinach is high in cadmium contamination.  An FDA study found more in boiled spinach in the early 90's (0.125 mg/kg) than in the 320 other foods studied.http://www.yogurtforever.org/download/tds1byel.pdf (Previously at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~acrobat/ tds1byel.pdf  ?)
Spinach is packaged in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged spinach is exposed to radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that may be on the leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to sanitize spinach is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four other carotenoids in packaged spinach following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged spinach to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and the health benefits of irradiating packed spinach to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the loss of nutrients.Nutrient Retention of Safer Salads Explored | Environmental Working Group

==In popular culture==

The cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man is portrayed as having a strong affinity for spinach, becoming physically stronger after consuming it. The commonly accepted version of events states this portrayal was based on faulty calculations of the iron content.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/dec/08/ec-segar-popeye-google-doodle|title=E.C. Segar, Popeye's creator, celebrated with a Google doodle|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|date=8 December 2009|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl] In the version, German scientist Emil von Wolff misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach's iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been, and this faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s. This caused the popular misconception that spinach is high in iron that makes the body stronger.[tpl]cite book |title=The Truth about Food |last=Fullerton-Smith |first=Jill |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=224 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xx_FMVnrxWAC&pg=PA224&dq=spinach+does+not+have+high+iron&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2Pk_T6-_MMqW2QW-guGXCA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=spinach%20does%20not%20have%20high%20iron&f=false |accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl]
Criminologist Mike Sutton wrote an article in the Internet Journal of Criminology, claiming the Popeye and iron link is just another long-standing myth, and spinach was chosen and promoted in Popeye for its vitamin A content alone.[ref]
