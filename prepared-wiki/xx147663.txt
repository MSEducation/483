West Bank Premier League is one of the two top divisions of the Palestinian Football Federation (PFA). The other is the Gaza Strip League. Palestinian clubs have a rich history stretching back to the early 1930s, but most teams folded due to the political turmoil that ensued. The league has existed in the West Bank since 1977 but due to the difficulties associated with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and internal feuding within the Palestinian Football Federation only seven seasons have been played in their entirety. Over the years, the format of the league has taken many different shapes. The league has been uninterrupted since 2008.
The 2010–11 season marked the creation of the first professional league in the territories and saw high profile signings for many clubs. Most notably Fadi Lafi (Hilal Al-Quds), Hernán Madrid (Wadi Al-Nes), and many Arab-Israelis who played for teams in the second and third tier of Israeli football.
The original format of the WBPL consisted of 12 teams playing each other twice over 22 matchdays, the bottom two clubs are relegated to the second division and the team with the most points are crowned champions.http://www.kooora.com/default.aspx?c=4943 Markaz Shabab Al-Am'ari won the inaugural season beating out Hilal Al-Quds on goal differential.
The 2011–12 included only 10 teams but the PFA have announced that four teams will be promoted from the First Division returning the league to its traditional 12-team format. The PFA also altered the rules on player eligibility banning the use of foreign players but letting teams have an unlimited amount of Arab Israeli citizens in their squads.
