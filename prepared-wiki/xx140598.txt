[[Zorrozaurre]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Bilbao

Zorrozaurre (in Basque, Zorrotzaurre) is an artificial peninsula located within the Deusto district of Bilbao, Spain. It was formed during the 1950s and the 1960s, when a canal was built to facilitate navigation in the estuary of Bilbao. The project was stopped in 1968 with 400 meters left to finish, forming the current peninsula. The area reached its heyday during this decade, with many industries moving there. However, during the industrial crisis of the 1980s that struck the city, many industries were forced to shut down or relocate, and only a handful of them survived to this day.
A plan has been approved to renew the neighborhood, the project will be designed by British Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid.
