CATEGORIES: Kings of Egypt in Herodotus

Sesostris (Greek: Σέσωστρις) was the name of a king of ancient Egypt who, according to Herodotus, led a military expedition into parts of Europe.

==Account of Herodotus==

In Herodotus' Histories there appears a story told by Egyptian priests about a Pharaoh Sesostris, who once led an army northward overland to Asia Minor, then fought his way westward until he crossed into Europe, where he defeated the Scythians and Thracians (possibly in modern Romania and Bulgaria). Sesostris then returned home, leaving colonists behind at the river Phasis in Colchis. Herodotus cautioned the reader that much of this story came second hand via Egyptian priests, but also noted that the Colchians were commonly known to be Egyptian colonists."For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others."  Herodotus Histories 2.104
According to Diodorus Siculus (who calls him Sesoösis), and Strabo, he conquered the whole world, even Scythia and Ethiopia, divided Egypt into administrative districts or nomes, was a great law-giver, and introduced a caste system into Egypt and the worship of Serapis. Herodotus also relates that when Sesostris defeated an army without much resistance he erected a pillar in their capital with a vagina on it to symbolize the fact that the army fought like women.Herodotus Histories 2.102
Herodotus describes Sesostris as the father of the blind king Pheron, who was less warlike than his father.

==Modern research==

Sesostris has been considered a compound of Senusret III of the Twelfth Dynasty, Seti I and Ramesses II of the Nineteenth Dynasty. In Manetho, however, a pharaoh called Sesostris occupied the same position as the known pharaoh Senusret III of the Twelfth Dynasty, and his name is now usually viewed as a corruption of Senwosret.Silverman, David P.  Ancient Egypt Oxford University Press (5 Jun 2003) ISBN 978-0-19-521952-4 p. 29 The 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica states "So far as is known no Egyptian king penetrated a day's journey beyond the Euphrates or into Asia Minor, or touched the continent of Europe". The images of Sesostris carved in stone in Ionia which Herodotus said he had seen "Most of the memorial pillars which King Sesostris erected in conquered countries have disappeared, but I have seen some myself in Palestine with the inscription I mentioned and the drawing of a woman's genitals.  In Ionia also there are two images of Sesostris cut on rock, one on the road from Ephesos to Phocaea, the other between Sardis and Smyrna; in each case the carved figure is nearly seven feet high and represents a man with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left, and the rest of his equipment to match - partly Egyptian partly Ethiopian." Herodotus II.106 is likely to be identified with the Luwian inscriptions of Karabel Pass, now known to have been carved by Tarkasnawa, king of the Arzawan rump state of Mira.http://www.hittitemonuments.com/karabel/ The kings of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties were the greatest conquerors[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] that Egypt ever produced, and their records are clear on the limits of Egyptian expansion.
