[[Stratopause]]

CATEGORIES: Atmosphere, Atmosphere of Earth

The stratopause (formerly Mesopeak) is the level of the atmosphere which is the boundary between two layers, stratosphere and the mesosphere. In the stratosphere the temperature increases with altitude, and the stratopause is the region where a maximum in the temperature occurs.
This occurs not only on Earth, but on other planets with an atmosphere as well.
On Earth, the stratopause is [tpl]convert|50|to(-)|55|km|mi[/tpl] high above the Earth's surface. The atmospheric pressure is around 1/1000 of the pressure at sea level. The temperature in the stratopause is -15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit).
