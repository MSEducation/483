Epirus [tpl]IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|p|aɪr|ə|s[/tpl] is a geographical and historical region in southeastern Europe, shared between Greece and Albania. It lies between the Pindus Mountains and the Ionian Sea, stretching from the Bay of Vlorë and the Acroceraunian mountains in the north to the Ambracian Gulf and the ruined Roman city of Nicopolis in the south.[tpl]harvnb|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|loc="Epirus", p. 527[/tpl]. It is currently divided between the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece and the counties of Gjirokastër, Vlorë, and Berat in southern Albania. The largest city in Epirus is Ioannina, seat of the region of Epirus, with Gjirokastër the largest city in the Albanian part of Epirus.
A rugged and mountainous region, Epirus was the north-west area of ancient Greece. It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians, and home to the sanctuary of Dodona, the oldest ancient Greek oracle, and the most prestigious one after Delphi. Unified into a single state in 370 BC by the Aeacidae dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose campaigns against Rome are the origin of the term "Pyrrhic victory". Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Empire along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the Byzantine Empire. Following the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade, Epirus became the center of the Despotate of Epirus, one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. Conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, Epirus became semi-independent during the rule of Ali Pasha in the early 19th century, but the Ottomans re-asserted their control in 1821. Following the Balkan Wars and World War I, southern Epirus became part of Greece, while northern Epirus became part of the newly created state of Albania.

==Name and etymology==

The name Epirus is derived from the [tpl]lang-el|Ἤπειρος[/tpl], Ḗpeiros (Doric: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἄπειρος[/tpl], Ápeiros), meaning "mainland" or terra firma.[tpl]harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=ἤπειρ-ος[/tpl]. It is thought to come from an Indo-European root [tpl]Unicode|*apero-[/tpl] 'coast',[tpl]harvnb|Babiniotis|1998[/tpl]. and was originally applied to the mainland opposite Corfu and the Ionian islands.[tpl]harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=22[/tpl]. The local name was stamped on the coinage of the unified Epirote commonwealth: ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἀπειρωτᾶν[/tpl] Āpeirōtân, Attic: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἠπειρωτῶν[/tpl] Ēpeirōtôn, i.e. "of the Epirotes", see image right). The Albanian name for the region is Epiri, deriving from the Greek.

==Boundaries and definitions==

The historical region of Epirus is generally regarded as extending from the northern end of the Ceraunian mountains (modern Llogara in Albania), located just south of the Bay of Aulon (modern Vlorë), to the Ambracian Gulf (or Gulf of Arta) in Greece.Strabo. Geography, 7.7.5. The northern boundary of ancient Epirus is alternatively given as the mouth of the Aoös (or Vjosë) river, immediately to the north of the Bay of Vlorë.[tpl]harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=92[/tpl]: "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of the river Aous (Vijosë)." (Map) Epirus's eastern boundary is defined by the Pindus Mountains, that form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. To the west, Epirus faces the Ionian Sea. The island of Corfu is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.
The definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The region of Epirus in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, the counties of Gjirokastër, Vlorë, and Berat extend well beyond the northern and northeastern boundaries of classical Epirus.

==Geography and ecology==

Epirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region. It is largely made up of the Pindus Mountains, a series of parallel limestone ridges that are a continuation of the Dinaric Alps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/190156/Epirus|title=Epirus|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Bahr|Johnston|Bloomfield|1997|p=389[/tpl]. The Pindus mountains form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly to the east. The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture. Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2637m at Mount Smolikas, the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include Tymfi (2496 at Mount Gamila), Lygkos (2249m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, Gramos (2523m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2356m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1976m) in the southwest, Mitsikeli near Ioannina (1810m), Mourgana (1806m) and Nemercke/Aeoropos (2485m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the Ceraunian Mountains (2000m) near Himara in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.
Significant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near Arta and Preveza, in the Acheron plain between Paramythia and Fanari, between Igoumenitsa and Sagiada, and also near Saranda. The Zagori area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.
The main river flowing through Epirus is the Vjosë (Aoös in Greek), which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the Bay of Vlorë in Albania. Other important rivers include the Acheron river, famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the Necromanteion, the Arachthos river, crossed by the historic Bridge of Arta, the Louros, the Thyamis or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjosë flowing through the Vikos Gorge. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the Vikos–Aoös National Park, known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is Lake Pamvotis, on whose shores lies the city of Ioannina, the region's largest and traditionally most important city.
The climate of Epirus is Mediterranean along the coast and Alpine in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as bears, wolves, foxes, deer and lynxes.

==History==

===Early History===

Epirus has been occupied since at least Neolithic times by seafarers along the coast and by hunters and shepherds in the interior who brought with them the Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large tumuli containing shaft graves, similar to the Mycenaean tombs, indicating an ancestral link between Epirus and the Mycenaean civilization. A number of Mycenaean remains have been found in Epirus,[tpl]harvnb|Tandy|2001|p=4[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|McHenry|2003|loc=p. 527: "Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer's Odyssey."[/tpl] especially at the most important ancient religious sites in the region, the Necromanteion (Oracle of the Dead) on the Acheron river, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona.
In the Middle Bronze Age, Epirus was inhabited by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle in the rest of Greece.[tpl]harvnb|Borza|1992|pp=62, 78, 98[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Minahan|2002|p=578[/tpl]. Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated.[tpl]harvnb|Hammond|1986|p=77[/tpl]: "The original home of the Hellenes was 'Hellas', the area round Dodona in Epirus, according to Aristotle. In the Iliad it was the home of Achilles' Hellenes."Aristotle. Meteorologica, 1.14: "Rather we must take the cause of all these changes to be that, just as winter occurs in the seasons of the year, so in determined periods there comes a great winter of a great year and with it excess of rain. But this excess does not always occur in the same place. The deluge in the time of Deucalion, for instance, took place chiefly in the Greek world and in it especially about ancient Hellas, the country about Dodona and the Achelous, a river which has often changed its course. Here the Selli dwelt and those who were formerly called Graeci and now Hellenes." According to linguist V. I. Georgiev, Epirus was part of the Proto-Greek linguistic area. By the early 1st millennium BC, all fourteen Epirote tribes including the Chaonians in northwestern Epirus, the Molossians in the centre and the Thesprotians in the south, were speakers of a strong west Greek dialect.[tpl]harvnb|Hammond|1998[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=104[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|pp=430, 434[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=284[/tpl].

===Epirus in the Classical period===

Unlike most other Greeks of this time, who lived in or around city-states, the inhabitants of Epirus lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of the poleis of southern Greece.[tpl]harvnb|Hammond|1967[/tpl]. Their region lay on the periphery of the Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples to the north. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona – regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.
The Epirotes, speakers of a Northwest Greek dialect, different from the Dorian of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy, seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some classical writers. The 5th-century BC Athenian historian Thucydides describes them as "barbarians" in his History of the Peloponnesian War,Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.8. as does Strabo in his Geography.Strabo. Geography, 7.7.1. Other writers, such as Herodotus,Herodotus. Histories, 6.127. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Roman Antiquities, 20.10 (19.11). Pausanias,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.11.7–1.12.2. and Eutropius,Eutropius. Abridgment of Roman History (Historiae Romanae Breviarium), 2.11.13. describe them as Greeks. Similarly, Epirote tribes/states are included in the Argive and Epidaurian lists of the Greek Thearodokoi (hosts of sacred envoys).[tpl]harvnb|Brock|Hodkinson|2002|loc=J. K. Davies, "A Wholly Non-Aristotelian Universe: The Molossians as Ethnos, State and Monarchy", pp. 234–258[/tpl]. Plutarch mentions an interesting element of Epirote folklore regarding Achilles: In his biography of King Pyrrhus, he claims that Achilles "had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos" (meaning unspeakable, unspeakably great, in Homeric Greek).[tpl]harvnb|Cameron|2004|p=141[/tpl]: "As for Aspestos, Achilles was honored in Epirus under that name, and the patronymic Ἀσπετίδης is found in a fragmentary poem found on papyrus."cf. Athenian secretary: Aspetos, son of Demostratos from Kytheros c. 340 BC.
Beginning in 370 BC, the Molossian Aeacidae dynasty built a centralized state in Epirus and began expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes. The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of Macedon, in part against the common threat of Illyrian raids,[tpl]harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Edward M. Anson, "Why Study Ancient Macedonia and What this Companion is About", p. 5[/tpl]. and in 359 BC the Molossian princess Olympias, niece of Arybbas of Epirus, married King Philip II of Macedon. She was to become the mother of Alexander the Great.
On the death of Arybbas, Alexander of Epirus succeeded to the throne and the title King of Epirus in 334 BC. He invaded Italy, but was killed in battle by the Romans in 331 BC. Aeacides of Epirus, who succeeded Alexander, espoused the cause of Olympias against Cassander, but was dethroned in 313 BC. His son Pyrrhus came to throne in 295 BC, and for six years fought against the Romans and Carthaginians in southern Italy and Sicily. The high cost of his victories against the Romans gave Epirus a new, but brief, importance, as well as a lasting contribution to the Greek language with the concept of a "Pyrrhic victory". Pyrrhus nonetheless brought great prosperity to Epirus, building the great theater of Dodona and a new suburb at Ambracia (now modern Arta), which made his capital.
The Aeacid dynasty ended in 232 BC, but Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament, or synedrion. However, it was faced with the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars against Macedon. The League steered an uneasy neutral course in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the Third Macedonian War (171 BC–168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome. The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved.

===Roman and Byzantine rule===

The Roman conquest marked the end of Epirus' political independence. In 146 BC, Epirus became part of the province of Roman Macedonia, receiving the name Epirus vetus ("Old Epirus"), to distinguish it from Epirus nova ("New Epirus") to the north. Its coastal regions grew wealthy from the Roman coastal trade routes, and the construction of the Via Egnatia provided a further boost to prosperity.
When the Roman Empire was divided in two in 395 AD, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (subsequently the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire), ruled from Constantinople. The city of Ioannina was likely founded in the 6th century AD.[tpl]harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1006[/tpl]. In the Early Middle Ages, Slavic tribes are believed to have settled in the region, though the extent of such settlement is unclear.[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 128[/tpl]. These tribes are believed to have been completely hellenized by the eve of the 13th century, if not before.[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 129[/tpl]. Parts of Epirus came under the First Bulgarian Empire in the 9th and 10th centuries, but Byzantine control in the region was completely re-asserted following the destruction of the First Bulgarian Empire by Basil II. An Aromanian presence in Epirus is first mentioned in the late 11th century. Jewish communities are attested throughout the medieval period in Arta and Ioannina.
When Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Michael Angelos Komnenos Doukas seized Aetolia and Epirus and established an independent state known as the Despotate of Epirus with Arta as its capital.[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 132[/tpl]. Epirus, and the city of Ioannina in particular, became a haven for Greek refugees from Constantinople for most of the century. The Despotate of Epirus ruled over Epirus and western Greece as far south as Nafpaktos and the Gulf of Corinth, much of southern Albania (including Durazzo), Thessaly, and the western portion of Greek Macedonia, extending its rule briefly over central Macedonia and most of Thrace following the aggressive expansionism of Theodore Komnenos Doukas who established the Empire of Thessalonica in 1224.[tpl]harvnb|Nicol|1984|loc="Introduction", pp. 4–5[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 133[/tpl]. During this time, the definition of Epirus came to encompass the entire coastal region from the Ambracian Gulf to Dyrrachium (modern-day Durrës, in Albania) and the hinterland to the west up to the highest peaks of the Pindus mountain range. Some of the most important cities in Epirus, such as Gjirokastër (Argyrokastron), were founded during this period. In 1337, Epirus was once again brought under Byzantine imperial rule.
In 1348, taking advantage of the civil war in Constantinople between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, the Serbian King Stefan Uroš IV Dušan conquered Epirus, with a number of Albanian mercenaries assisting him.[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 135[/tpl]. It is during this time that an Albanian presence in Epirus is first mentioned.[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 134[/tpl]. The Byzantine authorities in Constantinople soon re-established a measure of control by making the Despotate of Epirus a vassal state, but meanwhile Albanian clans invaded, seized most of the region, and founded two local, short-lived entities, centered in Arta (1358–1416) and Gjirokastër (1386–1411) by the Losha and Zenebishi clans, respectively. Only the city of Ioannina remained under Greek control during this time. Although Albanian clans gained control of most of the region of Epirus by 1366-7, they didn't replace any Greek or Serbian central authority in the region but remained divided in clans.[tpl]harvnb|Fine|1994|pp=348–351[/tpl]. Ioannina became a center of Greek resistance, and the Greeks of Ioannina offered power to three foreign rulers during this time, beginning with Thomas II Preljubović (1367–1384), followed by Esau de' Buondelmonti (1385–1411), and finally Carlo I Tocco (1411–1429).[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|Klusáková|2007|loc=Brendan Osswald, "The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus", p. 136[/tpl]. The latter finally succeeded in ending the rule of the Albanian clans and unifying Epirus. But internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which proceeded with the capture of Ioannina in 1430, Arta in 1449, Angelokastro in 1460, and finally Vonitsa in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was the end of Frankish rule in mainland Greece.
