It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in deserts and adjacent mountains and dry valleys. This is a thickly branching shrub reaching heights from one to four meters. The thin stems are covered in narrow, hairy leaves and flower in large inflorescences of staminate and pistillate flowers. The staminate flowers have translucent white corollas and the pistillate flowers are rounded, fruit-bearing structures. The fruit is an achene with a single whorl of several papery wings.
