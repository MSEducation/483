American News Company was a magazine, newspaper, book, (and comic book) distribution company founded in 1864"Patrick Farrelly," The Publishers' Weekly (April 30, 1904). by Sinclair Tousey,"DEATH OF SINCLAIR TOUSEY, MANY WHO FOUNDED AMERICAN NEWSsic, 'New York Times (June 17, 1887)."Record of Current Events", The American Monthly Review of Reviews'' (August 1910), pp 162–165. which dominated the distribution market in the 1940s and 1950s. The company's abrupt 1957 demise caused a huge shakeup in the publishing industry, forcing many comic book publishers and small magazine publishers out of business.

==Background==

American News functioned both as a national distributor and as a local periodical wholesaler. Headed by Henry Garfinkle, the company had over 300 branches and employed several thousand employees. During the middle of the century, American News stood as the largest book wholesaler in the world, dominating the industry. It also had a near stranglehold on the distribution of magazines and newspaper within the United States market, dominating that industry as well. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it had more than 5400 stockholders."PERIODICAL DISTRIBS. v. AMERICAN NEWS CO.," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (October 15, 1968). Headquartered in New Jersey, American News also had offices in the Park Place[tpl]dn|date=October 2013[/tpl] section of Manhattan.The Park Place buildings were designed by female architect Fay Kellogg.

Comic book clients of American News included Atlas Comics, Dell Comics, and Toby Press. 
Many magazines distributed in the 1940s were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. This change was largely the work of distributors such as American News, who refused to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable.[tpl]cite book | first=Michael | last=Ashley |authorlink= Mike Ashley (writer)| title=The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3 1946–1955| publisher=Contemporary Books, Inc| location=Chicago | year=1976|isbn=0-8092-7842-1 | page = 88[/tpl] Science fiction magazines distributed by American News included If, Imagination, Imaginative Tales, and Space Science Fiction Magazine.

==Demise==

The mammoth company's abrupt demise in June 1957 has been a source of speculation for decades. One theory is that a speculator became aware that a bookkeeping peculiarity in American News' accounts could allow a large profit from liquidating the company. He acquired control, and proceeded to sell off the assets, ultimately winding the company up.Michael Ashley, Transformations, pp. 191. This theory was summarized in a 1960 lawsuit:
An alternative (but somewhat similar explanation) for the company's demise has been offered by comic book historian and author Gerard Jones. The company in 1956...

==Repercussions==

The effect on the American magazine market was catastrophic. Many magazines had to switch to one of the independent distributors, who were able to set their own conditions for taking on new business.  This often forced the magazines to change from a digest size to a larger format, and to become monthly rather than bimonthly or quarterly. Many magazines could not afford to make these changes, both of which required either high circulation or a strong advertising base, and many magazines folded as a result. 
An example of a company that the change in distributor had a drastic impact on is Atlas Comics, which was forced to switch distribution to Independent News, owned by National Periodical Publications, owner of Atlas' rival, DC Comics. Because of this, Atlas was constrained as to its publishing output for the next decade (including the early years of its successor, Marvel Comics)."Stan the Man & Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas," Comic Book Artist (2).
