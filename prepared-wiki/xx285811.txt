==Style and Influences==

All of Daniel's work fits into the overarching project he calls the "The Holy K movement" (a satirical play on the Kellogg’s brand cereal). The process involves migrating organically from city to city and creating a work for a selected individual, known in his project as a 'Disciple'. Arango says that structured travel is the inspirational source for his work and broadens the scope of his influence.http://www.curbsandstoops.com/daniel-arango-higher-power-holy/#more-8462, Maria Anderson, "Daniel Arango : The Higher Power of the Holy K", http://www.curbsandstoops.com/, 9 Oct. 2011, retrieved 26 Sept. 2013.http://www.thegentlemanblogger.com/2012/08/holy-k-by-daniel-arango.html#.ULiZco6Ae_c, Matthew Zorpas, "Holy K by Daniel Arango", http://www.thegentlemanblogger.com/, 4 Aug. 2012, retrieved 26 Sept. 2013.http://studio-irresistible.com/creation-book/index.php?post/features/news-amp%3B-moove/Daniel-Arango-s-Holy-K-Box, l'équipe irresistible, "DANIEL ARANGO'S HOLY K BOX", http://studio-irresistible.com, 26 Apr. 2012, retrieved 26 Sept. 2013. 
Twelve Apostles is a large-scale drawing made with inkjet on canvas to create a complexly layered scene, juxtaposing modern images against not only historical and contemporary building facades, but the medium of tapestries as well. The influence of architectonics is also integral to the finished work. Arango values structure and intends for it to be a "departure point from which a freer imagining of form and structure may be conjured."http://www.curbsandstoops.com/featured-artist-daniel-arango, "Featured Artist x Daniel Arango", http://www.curbsandstoops.com, 27 April, 2011, retrieved 26 Sept. 2013. He has cited his Catholic upbringing as the source for his interest in religion, as well as being influenced by Aubrey Beardsley and the Art Nouveau movement and Belgian artist Wim Delvoye, whose work also explores the dynamics of the visceral workings of biological consumption.
Airport Security Checkpoint employs Persian motifs to explore the initiation process by which he names "Followers" (art collaborators). Although the work is in black and white, Arango states that it is left monochromatic for the viewer, speaking to the disparity of what modern viewers see and what original artwork was (classical buildings, frescoes, sculpture etc. were vividly colored), and how this change over time mythologizes art (cf. Ruin value).
Daniel also has produced a number of short video pieces documenting his process and experience. His work has been featured in the book Petite Mort: Recollections of a Queer Public. The book was conceived as an "atlas of queer affection" and assembles contributions from an intergenerational group of gay men in New York. The book itself was intended to "remind us that public sex is not exclusively about a personal pursuit of pleasure" and in fact contain the "seeds of historical social and political action". Arango's work was an AutoCAD drawing titled "Summer Day on a Lower East Side Fire Escape".
