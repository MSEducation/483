Elly Annie Schneider (July 23, 1914 – September 6, 2004) was an actress who played one of the Munchkin villagers in The Wizard of Oz (1939).
Born in Stolpen, Germany, she moved to the United States in 1925 to join her 3 little-person siblings. She was 39 inches (99 cm) tall and weighed 46 pounds (21 kg).
The four siblings--Harry, Gracie, Daisy, and Tiny--were among the little people who welcomed Dorothy to Munchkinland in a 10-minute scene in The Wizard of Oz. They also appeared in Sailors, Beware, a 1927 Laurel and Hardy short, and the cult classic Freaks in 1932, and performed with the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus and the Christiana Brothers Circus.
