==Biography==

===Early life===

Aldrin was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey,"To the moon and beyond", The Record (Bergen County), July 20, 2009. Retrieved July 20, 2009. The source is indicative of the confusion regarding his birthplace. He is described in the article's first paragraph as having been "born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey", while a more detailed second paragraph on "The Early Years" states that he was "born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. on January 20, 1930, in the Glen Ridge wing of Montclair Hospital".[tpl]cite book | last = Hansen | first = James R. | title = First Man: The Life of Neil A.

The nickname "Buzz" originated in childhood: the younger of his two elder sisters (Fay Ann) mispronounced "brother" as "buzzer", and this was shortened to Buzz.

===Military career===

Buzz Aldrin graduated third in his class at West Point in 1951, with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres and shot down two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 aircraft. He once flew a F117 on a experimental flight at Groom Lake.   The June 8, 1953, issue of Life magazine featured gun camera photos taken by Aldrin of one of the Soviet pilots ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[tpl]cite book|author=Time Inc |title=LIFE |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EcEAAAAMBAJ |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |date=June 8, 1953 |publisher=Time Inc |issn=00243019 |page=29[/tpl]
Subsequent to the war, Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and next was an aide to the dean of faculty at the United States Air Force Academy, which had recently begun operations in 1955. He flew F-100 Super Sabres as a flight commander at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, in the 22d Fighter Squadron. In 1963 Aldrin earned a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Buzz Aldrin's Official NASA Biography His graduate thesis was "Line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous",DSpace@MIT : Line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous. Dspace.mit.edu. Retrieved November 8, 2012. the dedication of which read, "In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country’s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!" On completion of his doctorate, he was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles before his selection as an astronaut. His initial application to join the astronaut corps was rejected on the basis of having never been a test pilot; that prerequisite was lifted when he re-applied and was accepted into the third astronaut class.

===NASA career===

Aldrin was selected as part of the third group of NASA astronauts selected in October 1963. Because test pilot experience was no longer a requirement, this was the first selection for which he was eligible. After the deaths of the original Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, Aldrin and Jim Lovell were promoted to back-up crew for the mission. The main objective of the revised mission (Gemini 9A) was to rendezvous and dock with a target vehicle, but when this failed, Aldrin improvised an effective exercise for the craft to rendezvous with a co-ordinate in space. He was confirmed as pilot on Gemini 12, the last Gemini mission and the last chance to prove methods for extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Aldrin set a record for EVA, demonstrating that astronauts could work outside spacecraft.
On July 21, 1969, he became the second astronaut to walk on the Moon, keeping his record total EVA time until that was surpassed on Apollo 14. Aldrin's first words on the Moon were "Beautiful view.  Magnificent desolation."[tpl]cite AV media| publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration| editor-last = Teague| editor-first = Kipp | last3 = Aldrin | first3= Buzz| date= July 21, 1969| title = Apollo 11 – Buzz Aldrin Descends Ladder to Lunar Surface | url =http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11v_1094228.mpg|accessdate=December 22, 2013|format= MPEG-1|at= 48 seconds | quote=Beautiful view.

Aldrin, a Presbyterian, was the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. After landing on the Moon, he radioed Earth: "I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way."  He took communion on the surface of the Moon, but he kept it secret because of a lawsuit brought by atheist activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8.[tpl]Citation | last = Chaikin | first = Andrew | title = A Man on the Moon | page = 204[/tpl] Aldrin, a church elder, used a home communion kit given to him, and recited words used by his pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, the Rev.

Later Aldrin commented on the event: "Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion.
Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind – be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists."

===Retirement===

After leaving NASA, Aldrin was assigned as the Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In March 1972, Aldrin retired from active duty after 21 years of service, and returned to the Air Force in a managerial role, but his career was blighted by personal problems. His autobiographies Return to Earth, published in 1973, and Magnificent Desolation, published in June 2009, both provide accounts of his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years following his NASA career.[tpl]cite book | last = Aldrin | first = Buzz | title = Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon | publisher = Harmony | year = 2009[/tpl] His life improved considerably when he recognized and sought treatment for his problems. Since retiring from NASA, he has continued to promote space exploration, including producing a computer strategy game called Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (1993).  To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video, "Rocket Experience", with proceeds from video and song sales to benefit Aldrin's non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.Buzz Aldrin and Snoop Dogg reach for the stars with Rocket Experience, The Times, June 25, 2009 In 1995, he made a featured appearance in the Charlton Heston, Mickey Rooney, and Deborah Winters film America: A Call to Greatness, directed by Warren Chaney.America Movie Biographies.

He referred to a "Phobos monolith" in a July 22, 2009, interview with C-SPAN: "We should go boldly where man has not gone before. Fly by the comets, visit asteroids, visit the moon of Mars. There's a monolith there. A very unusual structure on this potato shaped object that goes around Mars once in seven hours. When people find out about that they're going to say 'Who put that there? Who put that there?' The universe put it there. If you choose, God put it there…"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDIXvpjnRws&eurl=http%3A%2F%2F|title=Buzz Aldrin Reveals Existence of Monolith on Mars Moon|publisher=C-SPAN|date=July 22, 2009[/tpl]
Aldrin has voiced parody versions of himself in two of Matt Groening's animated series: The Simpsons episode "Deep Space Homer", in which he accompanies Homer Simpson on a trip into space as part of NASA's plan to improve its public appearance, and the Futurama episode "Cold Warriors".
In 2011 Aldrin appeared as himself in the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, where he explains to Optimus Prime and the Autobots that the Apollo 11 mission also discovered a Cybertronian ship on the moon whose existence was concealed from the public. In 2012, he made a cameo appearance in Japanese drama film Space Brothers.
Aldrin also lent his voice talents to the 2012 video game Mass Effect 3, playing a stargazer who appears in the game's final scene.

===Aldrin cycler===

In 1985, Aldrin proposed the existence of a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler.Aldrin, E. E., "Cyclic Trajectory Concepts," SAIC presentation to the Interplanetary Rapid Transit Study Meeting, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, October 1985.[tpl]cite journal|author=Byrnes, D. V., Longuski, J. M., and Aldrin, B.|title=Cycler Orbit Between Earth and Mars|journal= Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|volume= 30|issue=3|year=1993|pages=334–336|doi=10.2514/3.25519|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/james.m.longuski.1/JournalArticles/1993/CyclerOrbitbetweenEarthandMars.pdf[/tpl] A spacecraft traveling on an Aldrin cycler trajectory would pass near the planets Earth and Mars on a regular (cyclic) basis. The Aldrin cycler is an example of a Mars cycler.  He was also instrumental in the idea of training of astronauts underwater in order to better prepare them for the intricate space walks and duties of maintenance while in space.

===Bart Sibrel incident===

On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space.  When he arrived, Apollo Conspiracy proponent Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were faked, insisting that Aldrin and others had lied about walking on the Moon. After a brief confrontation Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw. The police determined that Aldrin was provoked and no charges were filed.[tpl]cite news | title = Ex-astronaut escapes assault charge | publisher = BBC News | date = September 21, 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2272321.stm | accessdate = July 7, 2012[/tpl]  Aldrin dedicates a chapter to this incident in his autobiography Magnificent Desolation.[ref]

==Views==

===Criticism of NASA's 2003 return-to-moon objectives===

In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing NASA's objectives.[tpl]cite web | last = Aldrin | first = Buzz | title = Fly Me To L1 | work = The New York Times | date = December 5, 2003 | url = http://buzzaldrin.com/space-vision/rocket_science/l1-gateport/ | accessdate = November 14, 2009[/tpl] In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a spacecraft "limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was "more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs".

===Support of a manned mission to Mars===

In June 2013, Aldrin wrote an opinion published in The New York Times supporting a manned mission to Mars and views the moon "not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species."[tpl]cite news |last=Aldrin |first=Buzz |title=The Call of Mars |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/global/buzz-aldrin-the-call-of-mars.html |date=June 13, 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=June 17, 2013 [/tpl]

===Climate change===

In 2009, Aldrin commented on climate change by saying: "I think the climate has been changing for billions of years. If it's warming now, it may cool off later. I'm not in favor of just taking short-term isolated situations and depleting our resources to keep our climate just the way it is today. I'm not necessarily of the school that we are causing it all, I think the world is causing it."[tpl]cite web | last = Aldrin | first = Buzz | title = Buzz Aldrin calls for manned flight to Mars to overcome global problems | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = July 3, 2009 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/5734525/Buzz-Aldrin-calls-for-manned-flight-to-Mars-to-overcome-global-problems.html | accessdate = January 7, 2011[/tpl]

==Books==

Books co-authored by Aldrin include Return to Earth (1973), Men From Earth (1989), Reaching for the Moon (2005), Look to the Stars (2009) and Magnificent Desolation (2009). He has also co-authored with John Barnes the science fiction novels Encounter with Tiber (1996) and The Return (2000). His book Mission to Mars was published in May 2013.

==Personal life==

Aldrin has been married three times: to Joan Archer, the mother of his three children, James Aldrin, Janice Aldrin, and Andrew Aldrin; to Beverly Zile; and to Lois Driggs Cannon from whom he is recently divorced. He has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter, Jan.

==Detached adapter panel sighting==

In 2005, while being interviewed for a documentary titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer that they saw an unidentified flying object. Aldrin told David Morrison, a NASA Astrobiology Institute Senior Scientist, that the documentary cut the crew's conclusion that they were probably seeing one of four detached spacecraft adapter panels. Their S-IVB upper stage was [tpl]convert|6000|mi[/tpl] away, but the four panels were jettisoned before the S-IVB made its separation maneuver so they would closely follow the Apollo 11 spacecraft until its first midcourse correction.[tpl]cite web| url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_MissionOpReport.pdf| title=Apollo 11 Mission Op Report| format=PDF|work=NASA[/tpl] When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting.
