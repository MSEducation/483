The Eggishorn is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, located north of Fiesch in the Swiss canton of Valais. A cable car station is located on a secondary summit named Fiescherhorli (2,893 m), 500 metres south of the main peak.
The Eggishorn lies within the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region, which has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. On its northern flank is the Aletsch Glacier. From the summit the view extends also to the Lepontine and Pennine Alps (Dom, Matterhorn, Weisshorn).
