Judy-Lynn del Rey née Benjamin (January 26, 1943 – February 20, 1986 at age {{#expr:(1986)-(1943)-((2)Born with dwarfism, she was a fan and regular attendee at science fiction conventions and worked her way up the publishing ladder, starting with work at the science fiction magazine Galaxy.
Judy-Lynn was friends with Lester del Rey and married him after the death of his third wife.[tpl]cite book | last = del Rey | first = Lester | authorlink = Lester del Rey | coauthors = Frederik Pohl | title = War and Space | publisher = NESFA Press | year = 2009 | location = Framingham, MA | pages = 12–13 | isbn = 978-1-886778-76-4[/tpl]  After moving to Ballantine Books, she revitalized the publisher's once-prominent science fiction line there, and soon after brought in Lester to edit Del Rey's fantasy line. With their success, she was given her own imprint, called Del Rey Books. She also edited an original science fiction anthology series, Stellar.  As an editor, she was known for her rapport with authors and she had a beloved reputation. (Philip K. Dick called her a "master craftsman" and "the best editor I've ever worked with", and Isaac Asimov described her as "incredibly intelligent, quick-witted, hard-driving" and "generally recognised (especially by me) as one of the top editors in the business".[tpl]cite book | last = Asimov | first = Isaac | authorlink = Isaac Asimov | title = The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories | publisher = Victor Gollancz | location = London | year = 2000 | origyear = First published 1976 by Doubleday | page = 4 | isbn = 1-85798-932-5[/tpl])  She was also instrumental in obtaining the rights to publish novels based on George Lucas's then un-released movie Star Wars, which would earn Ballantine/Del Rey several million dollars.
She suffered a brain hemorrhage in October 1985 and died several months later.  In 1986, she was posthumously awarded the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor, but Lester del Rey declined the award in her name, saying that she would have objected to the award being given to her just because she had recently died.
