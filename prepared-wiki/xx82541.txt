Timnath-heres or Timnath-serah ([tpl]lang-he|תמנת חרס[/tpl]) was the town given to Joshua in the Bible. He requested it and the people gave it to him "at the order of the Lord". He built up the town and lived in it. ([tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|19:49-50|HE[/tpl]) On his death, he was buried there. ([tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|24:30|HE[/tpl]) Jewish tradition also places the tomb of Caleb there.

==Etymology==

In [tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|19:49-50|HE[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|24:30|HE[/tpl], the town is called Timnath-serah, whereas in [tpl]Bibleverse||Judges|2:9|HE[/tpl] it is mentioned as Timnath-heres.
The name Timnath-serah signifies in Hebrew an "extra portion" or "portion of abundance". Similarly, the name Timnath-heres means "portion of the sun".http://www.ancientsandals.com/overviews/timnath-serah.htm. In the book of Joshua Chapter 24, verse 30; it is written in thirteen different published editions of the Old Testament as Timnath-Heres or some variation of it where the second word begins with an 'h', or 'H' and ends in 's', either with or without the intermediate dash. The inversion of "serah" to make "heres", as sometimes means sun, as in Job 9:7; some Jews observe, the name signifies the figure of the sun, the Jews say was put on his monument, in commemoration of the miracle of the sun standing still for him. http://bible.cc/judges/2-9.htm
