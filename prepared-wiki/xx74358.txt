===Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition===

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition, developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games, is the third game in the Midnight Club series. It is also the first game in the series to feature licensed vehicles and allow players to customize their cars and bikes with performance and visual upgrades. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on April 11, 2005, and later ported to the PlayStation Portable in June of that same year. The three cities featured are San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit. The name derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles. The PlayStation Portable port was developed by Rockstar Leeds.

===Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix===

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix is a revised version of the original MC3. This edition has an extra map of Tokyo updated from Midnight Club 2 which adds new missions to the game. Along with that come several new cars, new races, new battle maps, rims, vinyls, hydraulics, body kits, and music.

===Midnight Club: Los Angeles===

Midnight Club: Los Angeles is the 2008 addition to the Midnight Club lineup. It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 20, 2008 in North America and October 24, 2008 in Europe. As the name suggests, the game is based in Los Angeles, featuring Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Hollywood Hills, San Fernando Valley, Downtown L.A., and most recently South Central. The designers used real street maps in developing the game. The game features online play and downloadable content. Licensed cars and bikes return, including new models and brands such as Ford and Mazda, which were absent in Midnight Club 3.

====Midnight Club: L.A. Remix====

Midnight Club: L.A. Remix is the portable adaption of Midnight Club: Los Angeles for the PlayStation Portable. The port is developed by Rockstar London with Rockstar San Diego. The game features the map of Los Angeles used in Midnight Club II rather than the map used in the console versions of Los Angeles. The game also features the city of Tokyo, using the map from Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix.

====Midnight Club: L.A. Complete Edition====

Midnight Club: Los Angeles - Complete Edition is the same game as Midnight Club LA, but with all expansion packs included, such as the South Central downloadable content pack which adds new vehicles, races, missions, music and adds 33% more map (South Central L.A.) to the south of L.A., hence the name South Central.

==Name origin==

The two kanji letters that act as a subtitle, [tpl]nihongo2|湾岸[/tpl], are translated as wangan, meaning "bayshore". This was taken from the name of the Tokyo to Yokohama route of the Shuto Expressway. The game was said to be named after the real life hashiriya gang, known as the Mid Night Club, who used the same route on a regular basis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
The name could also be confused with Wangan Midnight, a Japanese manga series which has been adapted into several arcade games (see Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune). Wangan Midnight is often written as "[tpl]nihongo2|湾岸[/tpl] Midnight".
