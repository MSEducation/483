==History==

The toponym is from the Old English tāna feld, meaning "open land where young shoots grow", or possibly "open land of a man called Tana".[tpl]Citation | contribution = Tanfield  | year = 2010  | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names  | editor-last = Watts | editor-first = Victor  | volume =   | page =  | place =   | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | id =|isbn=978 0 521 16855 7 [/tpl]  The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Tanefeld. The manor was owned by Thorkil at the time of the Norman invasion, but were afterwards granted to Count Alan of Brittany.[tpl]OpenDomesday|OS=SE2679|name=west-tanfield|display=West Tanfield|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl] The manor was held by Hugh, son of Gernegan thereafter and his heirs until at least 1243. One of these heirs, a woman named Avis had married Robert Marmion and held the manor in 1287. The Marmion family held the manor until 1387 when it passed to the next line of descent to the wife of Sir Henry Fitz Hugh. The Fitz Hugh family held the manor until 1513 when the direct line ended and it passed to another branch family, the Parr's. The Parr's held the manor until the death of William Parr, Marquess of Northampton in 1571. William was also the brother of Catherine Parr, Queen consort to Henry VIII. The manor was passed back to the Crown at that time before being granted in 1572 to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. The manor was inherited by his son Thomas, Earl of Exeter and thence his son William. Having no surviving son, the manor of Tanfield passed to his second daughter whose second marriage was to Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin and 1st Earl of Ailesbury and who held the manor in 1676 and was passed down the line of descent until 1738. It became the possession of Thomas Bruce Brudenell, who succeeded to the title as well. It remained with the family until 1886.[tpl]cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890 |pages=808–810|year=1890 |publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn= 1-86150-299-0|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64772|title=Parishes: West Tanfield |author=William Page (editor)|authorlink=William Henry Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1914 |work=Victoria County History.
