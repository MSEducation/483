The Football Association of Wales ([tpl]lang-cy|Cymdeithas Bêl-droed Cymru[/tpl]) (FAW) is the governing body of association football in Wales. It is a member of FIFA, UEFA and the IFAB. 
Established in 1876, it is the third-oldest national association in the world, and is one of the four associations (along with the (English) Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Irish Football Association and FIFA) that make up the International Football Association Board, responsible for the Laws of the Game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.faw.org.uk/AboutFaw.ink |title=About FAW - Football Association of Wales |publisher=Football Association of Wales |year=2007|accessdate=4 April 2012 [/tpl] These four are also the constituent countries within the United Kingdom.

==History==

Provisionally known as the "Cambrian Football Association", the FAW was founded at a meeting held on 2 February 1876 at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Wrexham, initially to formalise the arrangements for the forthcoming match against Scotland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/welsh_football/index.htm#y1876|title=1876 Kenrick's Challenge|work=The Story of Welsh Football |publisher=Wrexham County Borough Council|accessdate=23 March 2010[/tpl]
In May 1876, a further meeting was called, this time in the ballroom of the identically named Wynnstay Arms Hotel in Ruabon where the name was agreed as the "Football Association of Wales" and the constitution was drawn up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/leisure_tourism/welsh_wizards/kickoff.htm|title=Who was the inspiration behind Wales' first football team?|work=The Story of Welsh Football|publisher=Wrexham County Borough Council|accessdate=23 March 2010[/tpl] The arguments and discussions continued so long that the local policeman came in to call time. "Sadly we have no record of the words actually used by the police constable as he stood sternly surveying the scene in the Wynnstay Arms, Ruabon, on that May night in 1876; but what they amounted to was that even if the gentlemen were busy forming the Football Association of Wales it was past closing time so would they mind forming it somewhere else… "100 Years of Welsh Soccer - The Official History of The Football Association of Wales. Peter Corrigan, 1976.  
Fortunately, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn was in attendance; as the local JP (and also the sitting Member of Parliament), he went next door, opened the Court, extended the hotel's licensing hours, thus enabling the meeting to continue. The meeting ended with Llewelyn Kenrick appointed as the first chairman and honorary secretary[tpl]cite book |title=Who's Who of Welsh International Soccer Players |last1=Davies |first1=Gareth |last2=Garland |first2=Ian |year=1991 |publisher=Bridge Books |isbn=1-872424-11-2|pages=119–120[/tpl] with John Hawley Edwards as first treasurer.[tpl]cite book |title=Who's Who of Welsh International Soccer Players |last1= |first1= |year= |publisher= |isbn= |page=53[/tpl]

In 1897, when the FAW secretary was charged with fraud, Kenrick returned to guide the association through the crisis. He made the final break a few months later over the minor issue of the allocation of gate money to Welsh Cup semi-finalists and finalists.

==Responsibilities==

The FAW is responsible for the administration of football in Wales, running the six international teams - namely the "A", "Under 21", "Under 19", "Under 17", "Women's", "Women's Under 19", Women's Under 17 and Semi-Professional.
The FAW is also responsible for all disciplinary actions against players in teams associated with the FAW. This includes Welsh teams playing within the English football pyramid, superseding the English FA disciplinary system with the exception of Cardiff City and Swansea City A.F.C..

==Structure==

The FAW is based at Neptune Court, Vanguard Way, Cardiff.
It is governed by a council including nineteen councillors who are either elected, or appointed every three years.
In 2012 chief executive Jonathan Ford claimed the FAW had an income of £14 million, funded from FIFA, UEFA, grants, sponsorship and TV revenue. All finances were spent on the further development of the game.
In April 2013 Dragon Park, the Wales National Football Development Centre, was opened in Newport.
