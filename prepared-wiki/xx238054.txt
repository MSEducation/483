==History==

Fresolimumab was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) and was one of a pair of candidate drugs that were identified for the treatment of the fatal condition scleroderma. CAT chose to co-develop the two drugs metelimumab (CAT-192) and fresolimumab with Genzyme. During early development, around 2004, CAT decided to drop development of metelimumab in favour of fresolimumab.http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cat-may-abandon-skin-drug-after-trial-results-disappoint-569445.html
In February 2011 Sanofi-Aventis agreed to buy Genzyme for US$ 20.1 billion.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12477750
