==History==

After graduating high school, TJ Hermiston backpacked for six-month throughout South-East Asia.Sligl, B, Work It, The Story, Hush Magazine, 2011 During his travels he got in touch with his best friend Graeme Barker, and told him about his amazing experiences. Graeme decided to accompany TJ, joining his friend for the final two months of the trip. Their experiences along their travels had been life changing and the two men wanted to share it with others.
In March 2004 TJ Hermiston and Graeme Barker gathered their savings and launched Beach Travellers. To promote their company, the two founders drove across Canada for three months, stopping at Canadian universities to set up information booths. This was executed again the following year.Sutherland, Hannah, Blazing Travel Trails, Peach Arch News, 2011
By 2005 TJ Hermiston and Graeme Baker had stirred up enough interest to take six clients on a tour to Thailand. The trip was very successful and from that year forward the clientele doubled.
