Vermont Yankee is an electricity generating nuclear power plant, located in the town of Vernon, Vermont, in the northeastern United States. It generates 620 megawatts (MWe) of electricity at full power. The plant was designed by General Electric, and is a boiling water reactor (BWR).  Entergy, the present owner, has scheduled the plant to cease operations in late 2014. The plant began commercial operations in 1972 under different ownership. In 2008, the plant provided 71.8% of all electricity generated within Vermont, which amounted to 35% of the entire electricity consumed in the state. The plant is on the Connecticut River, upstream of the Vernon, Vermont Hydroelectric Dam. The Connecticut River reservoir pool created by the Vernon dam is drawn upon by Vermont Yankee for its cooling water.
The plant's initial 30-year operating license was scheduled to expire in March 2012; the license was extended for 20 years by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in March 2011.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]   Vermont Yankee's continued operations was complicated by the Vermont state legislature's enactment of a law providing the state legislature authority to determine the continued operation of the plant, in addition to the federal government. Entergy requested a new state certificate of public good (CPG), but the Vermont legislature voted in February 2010 against allowing renewed permission to operate.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] In January 2012, Entergy won a court case, invalidating the state's veto power on continued operations. On August 28, 2013, Entergy announced that economic factors, notably the lower cost of electricity provided by competing natural gas-fired power plants, had led Entergy to cease operations and schedule the decommissioning of the plant in the fourth quarter of 2014.
There have been many anti-nuclear protests about Vermont Yankee since the 1970s, including large protests following the Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 and on the date of the original operating license expiry in March 2012.

==Cooling water==

Vermont Yankee uses the Connecticut River as its source of cooling water for its two major water systems: the circulating water system and the service water system. The circulating water system removes heat from the power generation process of the plant by cooling the plant's main condenser.  The service water system cools both safety and non-safety related auxiliary components in the nuclear facility and the turbine facility of the plant, and additionally absorbs decay heat from the reactor's cooling systems in emergencies or in times when the reactor is shutdown.
For the circulating water system, water is withdrawn from the pool above the Vernon Dam and pumped to the condenser by the circulating water pumps. It is discharged downstream of the intake structure after cooling the condenser. Two mechanical-draft cooling towers reduce the thermal discharge of the plant to the river. The circulating water system at Vermont Yankee can operate in a variety of different configurations. It is controlled by large gates in the discharge structure which can direct some or all water to the cooling towers before it is discharged to the river depending on the gate position. There is also a recirculation line, also controlled by gates in the discharge structure, that can redirect some or all of the water cooled by the cooling towers back to the intake structure instead of being discharged into the river. Completely closed-cycle cooling with no discharge is possible using the cooling towers and recirculation line. Recirculation is only used during the hottest times of the year between Mid-July and Mid-September. During the cooler months, the cooling towers are not used at all. Due to the energy used to operate the mechanical fans in the cooling towers and booster pumps that pump the water to the top of the towers, use of the cooling towers reduces the plant's net electrical output.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The plant's safety and non-safety auxiliaries are cooled by either the service water system or the emergency auxiliary cooling system. The service water system draws from the plant's main intake structure, and after cooling the plant's heat exchangers, discharges water into the discharge structure where it joins water from the main circulating water system and either flows to the cooling towers or is discharged into the river. The emergency auxiliary cooling system is an alternate heat discharge system for the plant's safety-related auxiliaries in the event the service water system is unavailable or if the Vernon Pool is unavailable due to dam failure or other reasons. The ACS utilizes cell 2-1 of cooling tower 2 as its heat sink. That one cell is of more robust construction than the rest of the cooling tower and is seismic-rated. Its neighboring cell, 2-2, while it does not perform the safety function, is also built safety-rated to protect cell 2-1 from damage in the event of a collapse of the rest of the cooling tower due to earthquake or other force. The emergency auxiliary cooling system is the safety-related cooling system for licensing purposes and cooling tower cell 2-1 is the safety-related ultimate heat sink. The service water system would normally provide all safety-related cooling, but its pumps, piping, and heat exchangers are not built to safety or seismic standards.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Ownership and operational license==

On July 31, 2002, Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC (EVY) purchased Vermont Yankee from Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation (VYNPC) for $180 million. Entergy received the reactor complex, nuclear fuel, inventories, and related real estate. The liability to decommission the plant, as well as related decommissioning trust funds of approximately $310 million, was also transferred to Entergy. The acquisition included a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) under which three of the former owners will buy a portion of the electricity produced by the reactor at a cost of approximately 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
Vermont Yankee employs approximately 600 people including the employees that work out of the corporate location on Old Ferry Road in Brattleboro, VT.[tpl]cite news | author = Cosgrove, Brian, a spokesman for Entergy |title = Entergy is vital to future of state | work = The Burlington Free Press | date = July 1, 2008[/tpl]
As a result of an NRC approved Extended Power Uprate (EPU), Vermont Yankee achieved its new rated power of 1,912 MWth (120% of its original licensed thermal power of 1,593 MWth) on May 6, 2006. The power increase was carried out in steps to allow collection of data on the reactor's steam dryer at various power levels, in accordance with the NRC imposed power ascension test plan.
In 1978, the Vermont Yankee reactor was the subject of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., an important United States Supreme Court administrative law case which ruled that courts cannot impose procedures upon the NRC as this exceeds their power of judicial review.

==Spent fuel==

Vermont Yankee's spent fuel pool is nearing capacity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Since there is no projected date for operations start for the national long-term nuclear waste storage facility at the nuclear waste at  Yucca Mountain Repository, Entergy Nuclear obtained approval[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] for dry-cask storage[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/dry-cask-storage.html |title=NRC Dry-Cask Storage |publisher=Nrc.gov |date=March 29, 2012 [/tpl] to avoid exceeding the pool's licensed capacity; this allows for continued operations to store additional spent fuel, beyond the original operating license term, ending in 2012. In lieu of relocation of spent fuel to an operating national nuclear waste repository, some of the spent fuel has been transferred to "dry-storage" casks on site; most of the spent fuel continues to be stored in the spent fuel pool.
Vermont Yankee began the first stage of its dry-cask storage program in May 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] The first [tpl]convert|97|ST[/tpl] fully loaded cask was accidentally dropped onto the refueling floor from a height of about [tpl]convert|4|in[/tpl], after being raised from the spent fuel pool. The accident was attributed to failure of a relay in the [tpl]convert|110|ST[/tpl]-rated overhead crane. (The crane reportedly was tested in 1975 for only about 70% of the weight of a fully loaded cask.)[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] In August 2008, Vermont Yankee successfully completed the first stage of its dry-storage program with the transfer of the fifth cask from the reactor building to a storage pad located above the 500-year floodplain of the Connecticut River.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] A large specially designed cask-moving machine transports casks to the pad. Each cask contains 68 spent fuel assemblies.

==Closure/extension planning==

Entergy Vermont Yankee applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license extension of 20 years on January 27, 2006.[ref]
