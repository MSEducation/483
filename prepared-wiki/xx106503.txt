An EMD GP15AC is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between November and December 1982. This locomotive differs from the otherwise identical EMD GP15-1 due to Missouri Pacific specifying new AR10 AC alternators instead of rebuilt D32 DC generators. The only external difference between the GP15AC and the GP15-1 is a straight side sill (shared with the EMD GP15T) not related to the transmission difference.
30 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads, with four units built for Venezuela's IAFFE.
