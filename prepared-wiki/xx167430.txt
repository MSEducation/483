Rare Meat is a 2005 compilation CD of rare and unreleased material by the Meat Puppets, spanning approximately 1990-2000. It was compiled by user "nathang78" from the Meat Puppets Yahoo Message Board, and posted on founding band member Derrick Bostrom's Meat Puppets blog on July 1st, 2007.>http://derrickbostrom.com/rare-meat-a-fans-compilation/
Bostrum praised the compilation:
"I’ve long toyed with the idea of putting together a “lost album” of sorts, all the various promotional tracks and b-sides released during our Polygram days, but never collected anywhere, and for the most part no longer in print. If there were anyone left at that label with a clue, I wouldn’t need to take such a project on myself, it’d get an official release. Now, thanks to Meat Puppets Yahoo Message Board member “nathang78,” I don’t have to do a damned thing; he’s done it for me. His “Rare Meat” compilation includes all the tracks from the Polygram days and as many others as he can find, including stuff from the “Classic Meat” album, the “Keats Rides A Harley” comp, and the much-desired “You Love Me” EP, offered as a giveaway back during Curt’s first attempt to reform the band eight years ago."
