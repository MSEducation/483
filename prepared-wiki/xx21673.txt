In heat transfer analysis, thermal diffusivity (usually denoted α but a, κ,[tpl]cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Richard B. Hetnarski, M. Reza Eslami ; edited by G.M.L.|title=Thermal Stresses - Advanced Theory and Applications|year=2009|publisher=Springer Netherlands|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-9247-3|pages=170|edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl] [tpl]reference necessary|text=k|date=December 2011[/tpl], and D are also used) is the thermal conductivity divided by density and specific heat capacity at constant pressure.[tpl]CRC90|page=2-65[/tpl] It measures the ability of a material to conduct thermal energy relative to its ability to store thermal energy. It has the SI unit of m²/s. The formula is:
where
As seen in the heat equation,
thermal diffusivity is the ratio of the time derivative of temperature to its curvature, quantifying the rate at which temperature concavity is "smoothed out". In a sense, thermal diffusivity is the measure of thermal inertia.[tpl]cite book|last=Venkanna|first=B.K.|title=Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IIIVHRirRgEC&pg=PA38|accessdate=1 December 2011|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-203-4031-2|page=38[/tpl] In a substance with high thermal diffusivity, heat moves rapidly through it because the substance conducts heat quickly relative to its volumetric heat capacity or 'thermal bulk'.
Thermal diffusivity is often measured with the flash method.NETZSCH-Gerätebau, Germany It involves heating a strip or cylindrical sample with a short energy pulse at one end and analyzing the temperature change (reduction in amplitude and phase shift of the pulse) a short distance away.[tpl]cite conference|last=Thermitus|first=M.-A.|editor= Gaal, Daniela S.; Gaal, Peter S.
