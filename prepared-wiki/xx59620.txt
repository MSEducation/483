The U of S subsequently obtained a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits that it obtained after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land (this land has since been itself annexed into the city). The U of S leased a site to the [[Correctional Service of Canada]] north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Drive.<ref>

In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the "green belt" offered by the university led to these plans being dropped.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] The city has refrained from indicating any residential development plans for the newer land holdings in the northeast, allowing another green belt to be created separating the new communities of Evergreen and Aspen Ridge from other parts of the city.
