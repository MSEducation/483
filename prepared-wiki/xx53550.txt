After a European tour in March and April 1991, long-standing keyboardist Harvey Bainbridge chose to leave the group. Female singer Bridget Wishart would also end her association with the group in September. The group would go on to operate as a three piece of guitarist Dave Brock, bassist Alan Davey and drummer Richard Chadwick, making heavy use of sequencers, synthesisers and computers, both in the studio and live.
The album was recorded in 1992 at Brock's own Earth Studios, produced with Paul Cobbold. "Mask of the Morning" re-uses the lyrics from "Mirror of Illusion" from the 1970 debut album Hawkwind. "Rites of Netherworld" is a brief keyboard piece based on Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.
The group undertook a 23 date UK tour in April and May to promote the album, appearing behind a curtain on which the lightshow was projected.[tpl]cite web| first = Steve| last = Youles| title = Gig and Set Lists 1992| url = http://www.starfarer.net/gigs1992.html| work  = Starfarer's hawkwind Page| publisher = self-published| accessdate  = 2009-08-20[/tpl] An all-nighter at the Brixton Academy on 15 August, when they were joined on-stage by Salt Tank, was amateur video recorded and released as Brixton Academy 15.8.92.
