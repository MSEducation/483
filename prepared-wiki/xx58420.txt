[[List of IATA-indexed railway stations]]

CATEGORIES: Geocodes, Lists of railway stations, Lists of abbreviations

This is a List of IATA-indexed railway stations, which are assigned codes by the IATA, similar to IATA airport codes. Such railway stations are typically used in air-rail alliances or code sharing agreements (commonly known as "Rail Fly") between airlines and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed and checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip.

==Airports==

Rail lines at airports include:
(AIRail Service with Deutsche Bahn). 

==Railway station codes==

The IATA codes for railway stations begin with Q, X or Z, except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city. A change connection between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride or bus transfer is usually needed then.[tpl]Clarify|date=August 2012[/tpl]
