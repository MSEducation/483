Degüello is the sixth studio album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top, released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). "Degüello" means "beheading" or, idiomatically, "no quarter" (as in "no surrender to be given or accepted--a fight to the death") in Spanish and was the title of a Moorish-origin bugle call used by the Mexican Army at the Battle of the Alamo, Texas, in 1836.
Degüello was produced by Bill Ham and engineered by Bob Ludwig and recorded and mixed by Terry Manning.
