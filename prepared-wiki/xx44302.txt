[[Chroma subsampling]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video technology, Image compression

Chroma subsampling is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance.[ref]

It is used in many video encoding schemes — both analog and digital — and also in JPEG encoding.

==Rationale==

Because of storage and transmission limitations, there is always a desire to reduce (or compress) the signal. Since the human visual system is much more sensitive to variations in brightness than color, a video system can be optimized by devoting more bandwidth to the luma component (usually denoted Y'), than to the color difference components Cb and Cr. In compressed images, for example, the 4:2:2 Y'CbCr scheme requires two-thirds the bandwidth of (4:4:4) R'G'B'. This reduction results in almost no visual difference as perceived by the viewer for photographs, although images produced digitally containing harsh lines and saturated colors will have significant artifacts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==How subsampling works==

Because the human visual system is less sensitive to the position and motion of color than luminance,[ref]
