USCGC ''Gallatin'' (WHEC-721) is a U.S. Coast Guard Hamilton-class high endurance cutter based out of Charleston, South Carolina. Built at Avondale Shipyards near New Orleans, Louisiana, Gallatin was named for Albert Gallatin, the fourth and longest serving United States Secretary of the Treasury.  Gallatin completed its final patrol 11 December 2013 and will be decommissioned in 2014 before being transferred to the Nigerian Navy.[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Coast Guard cutter returns from final patrol|url=http://www.charleston.af.mil/news/sthttp://www.navytimes.com/article/20131211/NEWS03/312110021/Coast-Guard-cutter-Gallitan-returns-from-final-patrolory.asp?id=123374545|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Navy Times|date=11 December 2013|agency=Assocaited Press[/tpl]
Design
Gallantin is designed as a high endurance cutter. Her crossing range of 9,600 nautical miles (17,800 km) at 20 knots (40 km/h), and 80-foot (24 m) flight deck, capable of handling both Coast Guard and Navy helicopters, make the Gallatin an ideal platform for extended patrol missions. Her missions include enforcement of all U.S. maritime laws and treaties, fisheries conservation, marine pollution response, defense readiness, and search and rescue. Gallantin was one of the first naval vessels built with a combined diesel and gas turbine propulsion plant. Gallantin’s engineering plant includes two 3,500 horsepower (2,600 kW) diesel engines, and two 18,000 horsepower (13,000 kW) gas turbines, which can achieve a top speed of 28 knots (52 km/h). Two 13-foot (4 m) diameter controllable pitch propellers, combined with a retractable and rotatable bow propulsion unit, give Gallatin high maneuverability.
Gallantin’s capabilities are enhanced by advanced air search and surface search radars including the AN/SPS-73 digital surface radar system that incorporates a state of the art computerized collision avoidance system. Gallantin uses the Shipboard Command and Control System (SCCS) which uses a network of computers including large screen displays and a dedicated satellite network for communications. A closed circuit TV system enable's the Commanding Officer to monitor flight deck operations, machinery conditions, towing, damage control, and related activities from the bridge.
