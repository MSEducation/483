Old German Shepherd Dog ([tpl]lang-de|Altdeutscher Schäferhund[/tpl]) is a controversial predicate for the long-hair variation of the German Shepherd Dog ([tpl]lang-de|Langstockhaariger Deutscher Schäferhund[/tpl]), which is not as an own breed recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Nonetheless are there efforts to  establish this variety as a separated breed.

==History==

Under the Society for the German Shepherd Dog the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd was not accepted for a long time. This changed in 2009.Die wichtigsten Beschlüsse der Bundesversammlung vom 6.-7. Juni in Kassel. In: SV-Zeitung. Juli 2009. S. 437–438. In 2010 the long-haired variation was accepted once again.FCI-Standard N°166 - German Shepherd Dog (doc) "Double coat & long and harsher outer coat" Before that, Breeders of the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd had founded their own Kennel Clubs and had called the long-haired hair variation the "Old German Shepherd". 
Some old German landraces of cattle dogs are also called Altdeutscher Schäferhund (Old German Shepherd Dog). To avoid confusion, all of these races are now summarized under the generic term Altdeutsche Hütehunde (Old German Herding Dogs).

==Appearance==

Most of them appear similar to the long-haired variation of the modern German Shepherd, although with slightly different colouring patterns. The coat may be any length and can be shaggy, smooth or wiry. The colours may be black, brown, grey or tan. They are generally the same height as a typical German Shepherd: [tpl]convert|55|and|65|cm|in[/tpl] at the withers.  They weigh between [tpl]convert|22|and|40|kg|lb[/tpl] but are known to have been larger.[tpl]cite book |last=Willis |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |coauthors=Bennett, Janet |title=The German Shepherd Dog: A Genetic History|year=1992 |publisher=Maxwell Macmillan International|isbn=0-87605-175-1[/tpl]
