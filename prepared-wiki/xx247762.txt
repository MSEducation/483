It is not possible for a regular matchstick graph to have degree greater than four.[ref]

The smallest 3-regular matchstick graph without triangles (girth ≥ 4) has 20 vertices, as proved by Kurz and Mazzuoccolo.[ref]

Furthermore, they exhibit the smallest known example of a 3-regular matchstick graph of girth 5 (180 vertices).

==Computational complexity==

It is NP-hard to test whether a given undirected planar graph can be realized as a matchstick graph.[ref]

==Combinatorial enumeration==

The numbers of distinct (nonisomorphic) matchstick graphs are known for 1, 2, 3, ... up to nine edges; they are:
