On 29 June 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from the State of Florida at Tallahassee, Florida, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 20 July 1917 as USS Roamer (SP-1047) with Ensign T. R. Hodges, USNRF, in command.
Assigned to the 8th Naval District, Roamer carried out patrol duties for the rest of World War I.
Roamer was decommissioned on 28 January 1919. She was stricken from the Navy List on 17 June 1919 and sold to Frank A. Egan of New Rochelle, New York, on 19 July 1919.
