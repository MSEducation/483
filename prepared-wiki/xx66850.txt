[[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]]

CATEGORIES: Airports in Mumbai

Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) [tpl]Airport codes|BOM|VABB[/tpl], formerly Sahar International Airport, is the primary international airport in Mumbai, India, and is named after the 17th century Maratha emperor, Chhatrapati Shivaji. The Airport's IATA code – "BOM", is derived from Bombay, Mumbai's former name.
Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport is second busiest airport in India and was ranked 48th busiest airport in world by Airports Council International in 2013.http://www.panynj.gov/airports/pdf-traffic/ATR2013.pdf. Aci.aero (2014-04-10). Retrieved on 2014-04-10. The airport has five operating terminals spread over an operational area of [tpl]convert|1160|ha[/tpl]. In 2011, the airport was ranked the third-best in the world in the 25–40 million passengers category by Airports Council International.  It is situated in the suburb of Santa Cruz and the Sahar neighbourhood of Andheri suburb in the pincode area of 400099.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-codes.com/pin-codes/international-airport-pin-code-mumbai-400099 |title=CSIA pin code |publisher=India Codes |accessdate=21 September 2012[/tpl] Mumbai International Airport Limited, a consortium of GVK Industries Ltd, Airports Company South Africa and Bidvest,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bidvest.co.za/ |title=Bidvest.co.za |publisher=Bidvest.co.za |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] was appointed to carry out the modernisation of Mumbai Airport in February 2006.

==History==

The Juhu Aerodrome functioned as Mumbai's sole airport until 1942. Due to operational constraints imposed by its low-level location and proximity to the Arabian Sea coastline making it vulnerable during the monsoon season, a move further inland became necessary.
RAF Santacruz was set up in 1942. It was a bigger airfield than Juhu and was home to several RAF squadrons during World War II from 1942 to 1947.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Stations-S.htm |title=RAF Santacruz |publisher= rafweb.org |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011[/tpl] The Airport covered an area of about [tpl]convert|1160|ha[/tpl] and initially had three runways.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/greater_bombay/communication.html |title=Transport by Air |publisher= Maharashtra State Gazetteers |year= 1987 |accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl] The apron existed on the south side of runway 09/27, and the area, referred to today as the "Old Airport", houses, among others, maintenance hangars of Air India, Air Works India and MIAL's General Aviation Terminal.
By 1946, when the RAF began the process of handing over the airfield to the Director General of Civil Aviation for Civil operations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1946/oct/30/airfield-santa-cruz |title=Airfield, Santacruz |publisher= Hansard |date=30 October 1946 |accessdate=17 September 2011[/tpl] two old abandoned hangars of the Royal Air Force had been converted into a terminal for passenger traffic. One hangar was used as a domestic terminal and the other for international traffic. It had counters for customs and immigration checks on either side and a lounge in the centre. Air India handled its passengers in its own terminal adjoining the two hangars. In its first year, it handled six civilian services a day.
Traffic at the airport increased after Karachi was partitioned to Pakistan and as many as 40 daily internal and foreign services operated by 1949, prompting the Indian Government to develop the airport, equipping the airport with a night landing system comprising a Radio range and a modernised flare path lighting system[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%200920.html |title=Santacruz to be developed|work=Flight Global |date=19 May 1949 |accessdate=17 September 2011 [/tpl] Construction of a new passenger terminal and apron began in 1950 and was commissioned in 1958,. Named after the neighbourhood in which it stood and initially under the aegis of the Public Works Department, the new airport was subsequently run by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. After a major fire gutted the Santa Cruz terminal in 1979, a temporary departure extension or "Gulf Terminal" became functional in October that year.
With the dawning of the Jumbo Jet era in the 1970s, Santacruz, despite several extensions, began suffering from insufficient operational capacity. The Tata committee, set up in 1967 to examine the issues concerning the airport, had recommended the construction of a new international terminal to meet the requirements of traffic in the seventies. The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone. The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI), which was set up in 1972, started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic, to be completed by 1981. Accordingly construction of the new International terminal at Sahar to the north-east of Santacruz was taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 110 million.
Designed by Aéroports de Paris and opened in January 1981, Terminal 2 was built in three modular phases as 2-A, 2-B, and 2-C. Each module had a capacity of 2.5 million passengers. This terminal had an area of [tpl]convert|120000|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The original terminal was a convex shaped single concourse building with 14 Code E contact stands. The greater T2 apron also provided a further 15 Code D/E and 6 Code C remote stands. This gave a total of 35 stands on the existing apron.
AAI had been considering the modernization of Mumbai airport in 1996 although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in 2003. By then, Mumbai and Delhi airports were handling 38% of the country's aircraft movement and generating one third of all revenues earned by AAI. At that time, Mumbai airport handled 13.3 million passengers, 60% of which were domestic travellers. The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day than it was originally designed for. The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May 2004 with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was announced in January 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=115.111.81.83:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/233/2007-05-01_RekhaJain.pdf |title=Airport Privatization in India: Lessons from the Bidding Process in Delhi and Mumbai |author= Rekha Jain, G. Raghuram, Rachna Gangwar |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=7 January 2014[/tpl]
The GVK led consortium won the bid to manage and operate CSIA. To accomplish this task, Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL), a Joint Venture between the consortium (74%) and the Airports Authority of India (26%) was formed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gvk.com/ourbusiness/airports/csiamumbai.aspx |title=GVK website, CSIA |publisher=gvk.com |accessdate=19 January 2012[/tpl] Since then, MIAL has made several improvements in the aesthetics, design and passenger conveniences at CSIA.

==Structure==

The airport consists of two passenger terminals: Terminal 1 at Santacruz for domestic flights and Terminal 2 at Sahar for international flights. These terminals use the same airside facilities but are physically separated on the cityside, requiring a 15–20-minute (airside) drive between them. MIAL operates coach shuttle services between the domestic and international terminals for transit passengers. Over the past few years, the older Terminal 2 was demolished and a newer terminal has been partially completed and opened to traffic. Work is in progress on the other part of this new terminal and it is due to be completed in 2015 which is when it will be used for both international and domestic airlines.

===Runways===

Mumbai has two intersecting runways. Both runways have been upgraded to Code F, which means they can accommodate larger aircraft like the Airbus A380."Common Agreement Document of the A380 Airport Compatibility Group Version 2.1" page 8, European Civil Aviation Conference, December 2002. Retrieved: 4 December 2012. Following a presentation in March 2011 by UK’s air traffic service provider NATS on how the capacity of the airport can be increased, MIAL set a target of 48 aircraft movements an hour in an effort to reduce congestion at the airport. Both runways were operated simultaneously especially during peak hours to try and attain this target.[tpl]cite news|title= Mumbai airport aims high; sets eyes on 48 flights per hour by next year |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mumbai-airport-aims-high;-sets-eyes-on-48-flights-per-hour-by-next-year/760775/0 |work=Indian Express |date= 11 March 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl] MIAL scrapped simultaneous Cross-runway flight operations in mid-2013 after it found that single runway operations were more effective for increasing Aircraft movements per hour. Runway 14/32 is now used only when the main runway is unavailable due to maintenance or other reasons.[tpl]cite news|title= Mumbai shifts to single runway to boost flight capacity |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Mumbai-shifts-to-single-runway-to-boost-flight-capacity/articleshow/21967759.cms |work=The Times of India |date= 22 August 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2013[/tpl] The construction of new rapid exit taxiways helped in increasing flight handling capacity from 32 movements per hour to 44 in 2012.[tpl]cite news|title= 19 more flight slots for city airport this winter |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/SectorsAviation/19-more-flight-slots-for-city-airport-this-winter/Article1-947419.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |date= 20 October 2012 |accessdate= 24 October 2012[/tpl]
The existing [tpl]convert|72|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall ATC tower, erected in 1996, stands close to the secondary runway and is a notified obstruction in the aircraft path. Hence, some carriers such as Singapore Airlines, Saudi Airlines and Continental Airlines avoid using the secondary runway and cancel or reschedule their flights into Mumbai when the main runway is unusable.[tpl]cite news|title= City’s new ATC tower misses July deadline |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-17/mumbai/32281597_1_new-tower-current-tower-atc-tower|work=Times of India |date= 17 June 2012 |accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl]
Further issues with utilising 14/32 are:
Parallel runway
MIAL was considering constructing a second parallel runway as part of its master plan. However, the construction of this runway would necessitate a large-scale relocation of either Air-India's hangars and maintenance facilities or the airport's flight kitchens and the Sahar police station, among others, depending on its alignment. The parallel runway remains an active part of the expansion plan but in the meantime the cross runways are being upgraded as much as possible.

==Expansion==

In October 2006, MIAL unveiled the master plan[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csia.in/masterplan.asp |title=Master plan |publisher=Csia.in |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] for CSIA, which has been designed to expand and upgrade the infrastructure to cater for 40 million passengers per year and one million metric tonnes of cargo per year by 2010.[tpl]cite news|author= 3:58PM |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/mumbai-airports-22bn-makeover/story-e6frgaho-1225845361584 |title=Mumbai Airport's $2.2bn makeover |publisher=The Australian |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2010[/tpl] The separate international and domestic terminals will be merged into one terminal building at the current international building and the current domestic terminal will be converted to a dedicated cargo terminal. The new terminal will have a floor area of [tpl]convert|450000|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl].CSIA | Know Your Airport | Master Plan MIAL has also incorporated a parallel runway as part of the master plan but there are some obstructions to this part of the which includes land acquisition and rehabilitation of slums as well as relocation of a number of airport facilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/chhatrapati/ |title=Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, Maharashtra |publisher=Airport Technology |accessdate=27 July 2010[/tpl] The graphic design and ambientation of the airport has mainly been created by Argentinan design studio Steinbranding. Landscape improvements were designed by Design Cell, a firm specialising in landscape architecture.
The implementation will be undertaken in two stages:
New taxiways have been developed to reduce the runway occupancy time by aircraft after landing. The airport has five rapid exit taxiways. By 2013, 11 rapid exit taxiways will be constructed. MIAL is undertaking the installation of a centralised data system which will provide information about domestic as well as international flights to all display devices at both terminals instead of just one or the other as at present. There are plans to extend the scope of the system to the air traffic control (ATC) and apron control areas, the airport website and even to leading hotel chains. A centralised call centre to provide flight details is also envisaged.
A Wi-Fi service is available free of charge throughout the airport.

===Project facts===

===Air Traffic Control Tower===

India's tallest Air Traffic Control Tower with a height of [tpl]convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] stands in a section of the parking area opposite terminal 1B. The triangular three-dimensional structure with soft vertices that won the Hong Kong Building Information Modeling (BIM) Award for the year 2009, has six storeys commencing from [tpl]convert|62.1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jssl.in/index.php?page=project&cid=2&sid=19&pid=323 |title=MIAL ATC Tower|publisher= JSW Severfield Structures Limited |accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl]
The tower was inaugurated on 18 October 2013[tpl]cite news|title=Tallest in India, new ATC tower to boost Mumbai air traffic |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/tallest-in-india-new-atc-tower-to-boost-mumbai-air-traffic-113101800908_1.html |work=Business Standard|date=18 October 2013 |accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl] and took over operations on 1 January 2014.[tpl]cite news|title=Air Traffic Control shifts to new tower |url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Air-Traffic-Control-shifts-to-new-tower/articleshow/28200313.cms |work=Mumbai Mirror|date=1 January 2014|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl]
From the new tower, air traffic controllers are able to see five miles beyond the thresholds of both runways. The tower and its associated technical block and mechanical plant building covers 2,884 square metres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arup.com/Projects/ATC_Tower.aspx/ |title=Air Traffic Control Tower, Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|publisher= Arup |accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl]
The cost of the fully equipped tower is estimated at [tpl]INR[/tpl] 4 billion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-11/news/29532224_1_new-tower-atc-tower-tallest-structure |title=Mumbai's new ATC Tower scales futuristic heights |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-25/mumbai/38008917_1_new-atc-tower-atc-officials-secondary-runway |title=New ATC tower to be inaugurated by October |work=The Times of India |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl]
The previous ATC tower began functioning in 1999 and was built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at an overall project cost of about [tpl]INR[/tpl] 2.80 billion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/work-on-new-atc-tower-to-begin-soon/440951/0 |title=Work on new ATC tower to begin soon |work=The Indian Express |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl] Many airlines such as Singapore International Airlines, Saudi Airways, Qantas and United avoid landing at Mumbai airport when the secondary runway is in use as the old tower is not in compliance with ICAO Standards. The tower penetrates runway 14/32’s transitional obstacle limitation surfaces by over 50 metres (for instrument approaches).

The old tower will be demolished in late 2014 and the taxiway will be completed.

===Sahar Elevated Access Road===

Despite the fact that T2 is located in Sahar close to Mumbai’s arterial Western Express Highway, passengers travelling to the terminal had a harrowing road traffic experience. The impending shift of all domestic air traffic to T2 would worsen the situation during the daytime and evening peak traffic hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lntecc.com/homepage/documents/Concord_jan11.pdf |title=Flying in to the Airport forecourt |publisher=ECC Concord |date= January 2011|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]
In order to avoid these traffic bottlenecks, a dedicated, direct elevated corridor was envisaged. This elevated corridor, also called the Sahar Elevated Access Road, runs roughly east-west between the Western Express Highway near Hanuman Mandir to the airport’s forecourt bypassing the crowded Chakala, Sahar Road and Jog flyover areas of Andheri (east). MIAL is contributing a major share of the project cost.
The [tpl]INR[/tpl] 2.87 billion project, commissioned in January 2008, had been delayed due to issues in shifting Project-affected persons (PAPs) to resettlement colonies in Kurla and Oshiwara. The road was constructed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Demolition-of-350-houses-paves-the-way-for-elevated-road-at-Sahar/Article1-776835.aspx |title= Demolition of 350 houses paves the way for elevated road at Sahar |publisher=DNA |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl]
On the WEH end, the project comprises 1,050 metres of elevated road, a 98-metre long tunnel with ramps measuring 261 metres, three vehicular underpasses each of 48, 22 & 30 metres and a 641-metre long 6 lane road at Grade. A 48-metre long pedestrian cum 2 wheeler underpass on the WEH was also built as part of the plan. The airport end of the elevated road has four ramps totally measuring 2,200 metres to connect to the arrivals and departure sections of the airport forecourt. The road has been operational from Valentine's Day, 2014.

===Challenges===

====Slum relocations====

The Airport's expansion plans, however, have been repeatedly thwarted by slums encroaching onto the airport area.[tpl]cite news|last=Pinglay |first=Prachi |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7195357.stm |title=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |publisher=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2010[/tpl] According to a report submitted by GVK to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the airport's total operating area covers [tpl]convert|936|acre|km2[/tpl] of which actual encroached land is [tpl]convert|262|acre|km2[/tpl] against a government estimate of [tpl]convert|147|acre|km2[/tpl]. Land subject to legal proceedings covers an area of [tpl]convert|34|acre|m2[/tpl]. Approximately 308 acres of airport land is encroached upon by about 85,000 hutments housing a population of around 400,000 persons,
In 2007, MIAL awarded the airport slum rehabilitation project, the largest urban rehabilitation scheme in the country, to Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL). The project entailed shifting people living on 276 acres of encroached airport land to enable airport expansion. As part of the deal, HDIL was expected to build and provide eligible slumdwellers free housing on its own land within a radius of 2 km from the airport within seven years. In return, HDIL was to get a couple of crore square feet of land in the form of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR). However, less than 500 of the 85,000 slum families were relocated to new houses and in February 2013, MIAL terminated its agreement HDIL following a decision taken by the MIAL board.[tpl]cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/05/29/hdil-earnings-idINDEE94S0BE20130529 |title=Mumbai Airport cancels HDIL slum redevelopment pact|publisher=Reuters|date=29 May 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl] citing non-completion of the project on time.
According to MMRDA, these 500 families were the ones moved to facilitate the Sahar Elevated Access Road. None of the encroached 276 acres has been freed up partly because 40% to 50% of the slumdwellers on airport land were ineligible for rehabilitation. The state had extended the cut-off date for these slum residents from January 1995 to January 2000. This meant that only the slumdwellers residing at the spot prior to 2000 are eligible for free housing under the project.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-12/mumbai/31679535_1_airport-land-hdil-slum-families |title=5 year on, 'not an inch' of airport land freed|work=The Times of India|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]
In August 2012, the State Government admitted its inability to clear encroachments and excluded nearly 200 acres of encroached land from the modernization and expansion plans for the airport. Hence, only 104 acres of the encroached land required for aeronautical purposes will be cleared.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-11/mumbai/33152635_1_airport-land-clear-encroachments-airport-expansion |title=200 acres to be excluded for airport expansion|work=The Times of India|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]

====Statue Relocation====

A 17-month delay in the relocation of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, whose location fell in the footprint of the new common user terminal, cost [tpl]INR[/tpl] 250 million, according to a consultation paper by the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_delay-in-shivaji-statue-relocation-cost-rs25-crore_1754304|title=Delay in Shivaji statue relocation cost Rs25 crore|publisher=Daily News & Analysis |date=20 October 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl] The report stated that although the statue area was scheduled to be handed over for construction by 31 March 2010, the State Government kept delaying the sanction to move the statue because the Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Janata Party, the main Opposition parties in the Maharashtra State assembly and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena held protests against the shifting of the statue. MIAL doesn't have the right to hurt our sentiment on Shivaji Maharaj just because they are developing the airport, stated MNS MLA Bala Nandgaonkar, "We will not allow the statue to be shifted."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mns-joins-stir-over-shivaji-statue/644920/0 |title=MNS joins stir over Shivaji statue|work=The Indian Express|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]
MIAL had proposed to construct a grand memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji on the Western Express Highway near the airport. In addition, it proposed to relocate the statue to a garden near the airport and undertake beautification. The proposals failed to deter the protesters. The change of government in the state further delayed the decision making process.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/politics-over-shivaji-statue-delays-mumbai-airport-expansion-111062500010_1.html |title=Politics over Shivaji statue delays Mumbai airport expansion|work=Business Standard|date=25 June 2011|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl] The delay in approval affected work on approximately 50,000 square feet of land and has led to delay in project completion. The Statue was relocated on 27 August 2011 and the area was handed over for construction.

==Terminals, airlines and destinations==

The airport consists of four terminals:

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 comprises three adjacent structures, designated 1A, 1B and 1C.

===New Terminal 2===

Larsen & Toubro was awarded the contract to construct the new Terminal 2 which was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM). The terminal covers a land area of 210,000 square metres and will replace the existing International Terminal (part of which has already been demolished). The entire project was estimated to cost [tpl]INRConvert|98|b[/tpl] and employ over 12,000 workers.CSIA press release
The X-shaped terminal has a total floor area of 450,000 square metres across four floors and will eventually handle both domestic and international passengers. It will include new taxiways and apron areas for aircraft parking designed to cater to 40 million passengers annually.[tpl]cite web|title=http://www.csia.in/knowyourairport/masterplan.aspx|url=http://www.csia.in/knowyourairport/masterplan.aspx|work=CSIA|publisher=CSIA[/tpl]
The iconic structure will have boarding gates on two piers extending southwards from a central processing building featuring a 42-metre high roof employing over 20,000 metric tonnes of fabricated steel covering 30 acres.Geodesic Techniques
