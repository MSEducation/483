==Content==

The song is about girls who use drugs and are sexually promiscuous in high school and college, but later grow up to be more conservative, suburban housewives when they decide it will be to their advantage. The lyrics allude to having a threesome and being busted for possession in the earlier part of the song, and describes the subjects' lives later on as "blonde, bland, middle-class Republican lives".

==Music video==

The video for the song features the story of a blond wild child who grows up to become a Volvo-driving soccer mom just like the song describes. In the video, scenes from her "checkered" past are cut with scenes from her present life as a housewife to highlight the differences between the two.
