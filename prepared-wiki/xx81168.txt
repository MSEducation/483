CATEGORIES: MUD servers

SMAUG (Simulated Medieval Adventure Multi-User Game) is a Merc and DikuMUD derived MUD server.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mk.ucant.org/info/classification_muds.html |title=A Classification of MUDs, by Martin Keegan[/tpl]  Its name is a backronym inspired by the dragon Smaug found in J. R. R. Tolkien's fiction. The project was started in May 1994 by Derek Snider and in July 1994, Realms of Despair, was opened to the public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.bbs.majorbbs/msg/33d0c2ad222e977f?dmode=source&hl=en |title=Bulletin board announcement for the opening of Realms of Despair[/tpl][tpl]Cite newsgroup|id=16701KIQBNSQNQJMQEV@cml.com|newsgroup=alt.bbs.majorbbs|title=Realms of Despair[/tpl]  In December 1996 the SMAUG source code was publicly released due to an earlier leak of the code and some areas.
SmaugFUSS (Fixed Up SMAUG Source) is an ongoing project dedicated to finding and eliminating as many of the bugs in the stock SMAUG source code as possible in order to provide a cleaner and more stable base for new admins wanting to run a SMAUG MUD.
SMAUG has served as a base for the development of several other MUDs.
