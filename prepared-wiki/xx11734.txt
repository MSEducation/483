Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin ([tpl]lang-rus|Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин|p=vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪr vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪt͡ɕ ˈputʲɪn|a=Ru-Vladimir_Vladimirovich_Putin.ogg[/tpl], born 7 October 1952) has been the President of Russia since 7 May 2012. He previously served as President from 2000 to 2008, and as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. During his last term as Prime Minister, he was also the Chairman of the United Russia political party.
For 16 years Putin served as an officer in the KGB, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before he retired to enter politics in his native Saint Petersburg in 1991. He moved to Moscow in 1996 and joined President Boris Yeltsin's administration where he rose quickly, becoming Acting President on 31 December 1999 when Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly. Putin won the subsequent 2000 presidential election and was re-elected in 2004. Because of constitutionally mandated term limits, Putin was ineligible to run for a third consecutive presidential term in 2008. Dmitry Medvedev won the 2008 presidential election and appointed Putin as Prime Minister, beginning a period of so-called "tandemocracy".[tpl]cite journal|last=Hale|first=Henry E.|author2=Timothy J.

==Ancestry, early life and education==

Putin was born on 7 October 1952, in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (modern day Saint Petersburg, Russia),[tpl]Wayback |df=yes|url=http://premier.gov.ru/eng/premier/biography.html |title=Biography at the Russia's Prime Minister web site |date=20100514164020 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl], in Russian to parents Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova; 1911–1998). His mother was a factory worker, and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, where he served in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s, and later served on the front lines in the demolition battalion of the NKVD during World War II[tpl]cite book|title=First Person|author=Vladimir Putin, Nataliya Gevorkyan, Natalya Timakova, Andrei Kolesnikov|others=trans.

Two elder brothers, Viktor and Albert, were born in the mid-1930s; Albert died within a few months of birth, while Viktor succumbed to diphtheria during the siege of Leningrad in World War II.  Vladimir Putin's paternal grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich Putin (1879–1965), was a chef who at one time or another cooked for Vladimir Lenin, Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, and on several occasions for Joseph Stalin.  [tpl]harv|Sakwa|2008|p=2[/tpl] Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared at the war front. 
The ancestry of Vladimir Putin has been described as a mystery with no records surviving of any ancestors of any people with the surname "Putin" beyond his grandfather Spiridon Ivanovich.  His autobiography, Ot Pervogo Litsa (English: In the First Person), which is based on Putin's interviews, speaks of humble beginnings, including early years in a communal apartment, shared by several families, in Leningrad.
thumb|Putin with his mother, Maria Ivanovna, in July 1958On 1 September 1960, he started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, just across from his house. By fifth grade he was one of a few in a class of more than 45 pupils who was not yet a member of the Pioneers, largely because of his rowdy behavior. In sixth grade he started taking sport seriously in the form of sambo and then judo. In his youth, Putin was eager to emulate the intelligence officer characters played on the Soviet screen by actors such as Vyacheslav Tikhonov and Georgiy Zhzhonov.[tpl]cite web|url=http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/2637.html|title=Prime Minister|publisher=Russia.rin.ru|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]

While at university he had to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and remained a member until the party was dissolved in December 1991.Владимир Путин. От Первого Лица. Chapter 6 Also at the University he met Anatoly Sobchak who later played an important role in Putin's career. Anatoly Sobchak was at the time an Assistant Professor and lectured Putin's class on Business Law (khozyaystvennoye pravo).[tpl]cite book|last=Pribylovsky|first=Vladimir|title=Власть-2010 (60 биографий)|year=2010|publisher=Panorama|isbn=978-5-94420-038-9|pages=132–139|url=http://scilla.ru/works/knigi/vlast2010.pdf|authorlink=Vladimir Pribylovsky|location=Moscow|language=Russian|chapter=Valdimir Putin[/tpl]

==KGB career==

Putin joined the KGB in 1975 upon graduation, and underwent a year's training at the 401st KGB school in Okhta, Leningrad. He then went on to work briefly in the Second Chief Directorate (counter-intelligence) before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where among his duties was the monitoring of foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad.[tpl]harv|Sakwa|2008|pp=8–9[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=David|last=Hoffman|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/putin.htm|title=Putin's Career Rooted in Russia's KGB|work=The Washington Post|date=30 January 2000[/tpl]
From 1985 to 1990, the KGB stationed Putin in Dresden, East Germany.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/09/europe/EU_GEN_Germany_Russia.php|title=Putin set to visit Dresden, the place of his work as a KGB spy, to tend relations with Germany|work=International Herald Tribune|date=9 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] During that time, Putin was assigned to Directorate S, the illegal intelligence-gathering unit (the KGB's classification for agents who used falsified identities) where he was given cover as a translator and interpreter.[tpl]cite book|last=Gessen|first=Masha|title=The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin|year=2012|publisher=Riverhead|location=New York City, New York|isbn=1594488428|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=9781594488429|edition=1st|accessdate=3 March 2014|page=60[/tpl] One of Putin's jobs was to coordinate efforts with the Stasi to track down and recruit foreigners in Dresden, usually those who were enrolled at the Dresden University of Technology, in the hopes of sending them undercover in the United States. Despite this, Putin biographer Masha Gessen disputes the "KGB Spymaster" image that has been built around him and instead says that Dresden was essentially a backwater job that Putin himself resented:
 Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB.  Former agents estimate they spent three-quarters of their time writing reports. Putin's biggest success in his stay in Dresden appears to have been in...contacting a U.S. Army Sergeant, who sold them an unclassified Manual for 800 marks. 
Following the collapse of the communist East German government, Putin was recalled to the Soviet Union and returned to Leningrad, where in June 1991 he assumed a position with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov. In his new position, Putin maintained surveillance on the student body and kept an eye out for recruits. It was during his stint at the university that Putin grew reacquainted with his former professor Anatoly Sobchak, then mayor of Leningrad.[tpl]cite book|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|title=Putin : Russia's Choice|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9780415407656|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DJcixDNh_m4C|edition=2nd|accessdate=11 June 2012|page=10[/tpl]
Putin resigned from the active state security services with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991 (with some attempts to resign made earlier), on the second day of the KGB-supported abortive putsch against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.R. Sakwa Putin: Russia's Choice, pp. 10–11 Putin later explained his decision: "As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on", though he also noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with "the
organs".R. Sakwa Putin: Russia's Choice, p. 11

==Political career==

===Saint Petersburg administration (1990–1996)===

In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. Then, on 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments.[tpl]Wayback |date=20070221044544 |url=http://kvs.spb.ru/en/ |title= [/tpl]  That Committee headed by Putin also registered business ventures.
Less than one year later, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council, and the investigators concluded that Putin had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million, in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=1124|title=Uproar at Honor For Putin|last=Kovalev|first=Vladimir|date=23 July 2004|work=The Saint Petersburg Times[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/putin.htm|title=Putin's Career Rooted in Russia's KGB|last=Hoffman|first=David|date=30 January 2000|work=The Washington Post[/tpl] Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996.[tpl]Wayback |date=20070927010325 |url=http://www.rusnet.nl/news/2003/05/19/print/report03.shtml |title=Putin's Name Surfaces in German Probe [/tpl] by Catherine BeltonWalsh, Nick Paton (29 February 2004).

===Early Moscow career (1996–1999)===

In 1996, Mayor Anatoly Sobchak lost his bid for reelection in Saint Petersburg. Putin was called to Moscow and in June 1996 became a Deputy Chief of the [tpl]ill-WD|Presidential Property Management Department|Q4476368[/tpl] headed by Pavel Borodin. He occupied this position until March 1997. During his tenure Putin was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and Communist Party to the Russian Federation.
On 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of Presidential Staff, which he remained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor on this position was Alexei Kudrin and the successor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and Putin's associates.
On 27 June 1997, at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, guided by rector Vladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in economics, titled "The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zavtra.ru/cgi/veil/data/zavtra/00/338/32.html|title=ПУТИН — КАНДИДАТ НАУК|date=24 May 2000|publisher=zavtra.ru|language=Russian[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] This exemplified the custom in Russia for a rising young official to write a scholarly work in midcareer.Gustafson, Thane.  Wheel of Fortune: The Battle for Oil and Power in Russia, p. 246 (Harvard University Press, 2012). When Putin later became president, the dissertation became a target of plagiarism accusations by fellows at the Brookings Institution; though the allegedly plagiarised study was referenced,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-78-3a.cfm|title=It All Boils Down to Plagiarism|publisher=Cdi.org|date=31 March 2006|accessdate=2 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.com/pda/doc.asp?id=662935|title=The President as Candidate|authors=Maxim Shishkin, Dmitry Butrin; Mikhail Shevchuk|newspaper=Kommersant|accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl] the Brookings fellows felt sure it constituted plagiarism albeit perhaps not "intentional". The dissertation committee denied the accusations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/mar/24/20060324-104106-9971r/?page=all |date= 24 March 2006 |title= Researchers peg Putin as plagiarist over thesis |work= Washington Times |accessdate= 5 March 2014 [/tpl]
On 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of Presidential Staff for regions, replacing Viktoriya Mitina; and, on 15 July, was appointed Head of the Commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of power of regions and the federal center attached to the President, replacing Sergey Shakhray. After Putin's appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during Shakhray's term as the Head of the Commission there were 46 agreements signed.The Half-Decay Products (in Russian) by Oleg Odnokolenko. Itogi, #47(545), 2 January 2007. Later, after becoming president, Putin canceled all those agreements.
On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin head of the FSB (one of the successor agencies to the KGB), the position Putin occupied until August 1999. He became a permanent member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation on 1 October 1998 and its Secretary on 29 March 1999.

===First Premiership (1999)===

On 9 August 1999, Vladimir Putin was appointed one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers, and later on that day was appointed acting Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Boris Yeltsin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/415278.stm|title=Text of Yeltsin's speech in English|accessdate=31 May 2007|date=9 August 1999|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Still later on that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.Yeltsin redraws political map BBC, 10 August 1999
On 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as Prime Minister with 233 votes in favour (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/422001.stm |title=Yeltsin's man wins approval |publisher=BBC News |date=16 August 1999 |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth PM in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet being determined by the presidential administration.Richard Sakwa Putin: Russia's choice, 2008. p. 20.
Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Putin's law-and-order image and his unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War, soon combined to raise Putin's popularity and allowed him to overtake all rivals.
While not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed Unity Party,[tpl]Wayback |df=yes|url=http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity |title=Political groups and parties: Unity |date=20010702200941 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 Duma elections, and in turn he was supported by it.

===Acting Presidency (1999–2000)===

On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the Constitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
The first Presidential Decree that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled "On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family".УКАЗ от 31 декабря 1999 г. № 1763 О ГАРАНТИЯХ ПРЕЗИДЕНТУ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ, ПРЕКРАТИВШЕМУ ИСПОЛНЕНИЕ СВОИХ ПОЛНОМОЧИЙ, И ЧЛЕНАМ ЕГО СЕМЬИ.

While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin's resignation resulted in the Presidential elections being held within three months, on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.History of Presidential Elections in Russia: Infographics RIAN

===First Presidential term (2000–2004)===

The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for his alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster.Spectre of Kursk haunts Putin, BBC News, 12 August 2001 That criticism was largely because it was several days before he returned from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin apparently won a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand-bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support – and alignment with – his government.Putin: Russia's Choice, By Richard Sakwa, (Routledge, 2008) page 143-150Playing Russian Roulette: Putin in search of good governance, by Andre Mommen, in Good Governance in the Era of Global Neoliberalism: Conflict and Depolitisation in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa, By Jolle Demmers, Alex E. Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom (Routledge, 2004)  A new group of business magnates, such as Gennady Timchenko, Vladimir Yakunin, Yury Kovalchuk, Sergey Chemezov, with close personal ties to Putin, also emerged.
Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the death of some 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis would severely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president was enjoying record public approval ratings – 83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.Moscow siege leaves dark memories, BBC News, 16 December 2002
A few months before elections, Putin fired Prime Minister Kasyanov's cabinet and appointed Mikhail Fradkov to his place. Sergey Ivanov became the first civilian in Russia to take the Defense Minister position.
In 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya adopting a new constitution which declares the Republic as a part of Russia.

The continued criminal prosecution of Russia's then richest man, President of YUKOS company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. The government said that Khodorkovsky was corrupting a large segment of the Duma to prevent tax code changes such as taxes on windfall profits and closing offshore tax evasion vehicles. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft.How to Steal Legally The Moscow Times, 15 February 2008 (issue 3843, page 8).

Putin was criticized in the West and also by Russian liberals for what many observers considered a wide-scale crackdown on media freedom in Russia. On 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building. The death of Politkovskaya triggered an outcry in Western media, with accusations that, at best, Putin has failed to protect the country's new independent media.[tpl]cite news|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/joan_smith/article1822204.ece |title=Putin's Russia failed to protect this brave woman – Joan Smith |work=The Independent |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |location=London[/tpl]Anna Politkovskaya, Prominent Russian Journalist, Putin Critic and Human Rights Activist, Murdered in Moscow, Democracy Now When asked about the Politkovskaya murder in his interview with the German TV channel ARD, Putin said that her murder brings much more harm to the Russian authorities than her writing.Answers on questions asked during interview to ARD TV channel (Germany), Dresden, 10 October 2006 By 2012 the performers of the murder were arrested and named Boris Berezovsky and Akhmed Zakayev as a possible clients.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c142/354859.html |title=The accused of murder of Anna Politkovskaya name possible clients |language=ru |agency=Information Telegraph Agency of Russia |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl]

In his last days in office Putin was reported to have taken a series of steps to re-align the regional bureaucracy to make the governors report to the prime minister rather than the president.Будущий премьер Путин намерен лично контролировать губернаторов NEWSru.com 30 April 2008.Губернаторов начальник.

Putin's office explained that "the changes... bear a refining nature and do not affect the essential positions of the system. The key role in estimating the effectiveness of activity of regional authority still belongs to President of the Russian Federation."

===Second Premiership (2008–2012)===

Putin was barred from a third term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. On 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, maintaining his political dominance.Putin Is Approved as Prime Minister
The Great Recession hit the Russian economy especially hard, interrupting the flow of cheap Western credit and investments. This coincided with tension in relationships with the EU and the US following the 2008 South Ossetia war, in which Russia defeated NATO ally Georgia.
However, the large financial reserves, accumulated in the Stabilization Fund of Russia in the previous period of high oil prices, alongside the strong management helped the country to cope with the crisis and resume economic growth since mid-2009. The Russian government's anti-crisis measures have been praised by the World Bank, which said in its Russia Economic Report from November 2008: "prudent fiscal management and substantial financial reserves have protected Russia from deeper consequences of this external shock. The government's policy response so far—swift, comprehensive, and coordinated—has helped limit the impact."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/RUSSIANFEDERATIONEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20888536~menuPK:2445695~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:305600,00.html|title=Russian Economic Reports|publisher=World Bank|date=10 November 2009|accessdate=2 March 2010[/tpl]

At the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the Presidency in 2012, an offer which Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was all but assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming Prime Minister at the end of his presidential term.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15045816|title=Russia's Putin set to return as president in 2012|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] During the 2012 presidential campaign, Putin published 7 articles to present his vision for the future.[tpl]cite web|author= Paul Bummer|url=http://neprussia.ru/news/maximum/1170 |title=7 статей и джек-пот: Путин завершил серию публикаций |publisher=Neprussia.ru |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl]

===Third Presidential term (2012–present)===

On 4 March 2012, Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential elections in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote. While efforts to make the elections transparent were publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote was criticized by the Russian opposition and by international observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for procedural irregularities.[tpl]cite web|title=Russia’s presidential election marked by unequal campaign conditions, active citizens’ engagement, international observers say|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/88661|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe[/tpl]

==Domestic policies==

Putin's domestic policies, especially early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree putting the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

In July 2000, according to a law proposed by him and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia, Putin gained the right to dismiss heads of the 89 federal subjects (there are presently several fewer federal subjects in Russia than there were in 2000).

Russia's nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased 6 fold, climbing from 22nd to 10th largest in the world. In 2007, Russia's GDP exceeded that of Russian SFSR in 1990, meaning it overcame the devastating consequences of the 1998 financial crisis and preceding recession in the 1990s.

A central concept in Putin's economic thinking was the creation of so-called National champions, vertically integrated companies in strategic sectors that are expected not only to seek profit, but also to "advance the interests of the nation".

A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay all of the Soviet Union's debts by 2005. Payments from the fuel and energy sector accounted for nearly half of the federal budget's revenues.

In the decade following 2000, energy in Russia helped transform the country, especially oil and gas energy.  This transformation promoted Russia's well-being and international influence, and the country was frequently described in the media as an energy superpower. Putin oversaw growing taxation of oil and gas exports which helped finance the budget, while the oil industry of Russia, production, and exports all significantly grew.
Putin sought to increase Russia's share of the European energy market by building submerged gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine and other countries which were often seen as non-reliable transit partners by Russia, especially following Russia-Ukraine gas disputes of the late 2000s (decade). Russia also undermined the rival pipeline project Nabucco by buying the Turkmen gas and redirecting it into Russian pipelines.
On the other hand Russia diversified its export markets by building the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline to the markets of China, Japan and Korea, as well as the Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok gas pipeline in the Russian Far East. Russia has also recently built several major oil and gas refineries, plants and ports.  Additionally, Putin has presided over construction of major hydropower plants, such as the Bureya Dam and the Boguchany Dam, as well as the restoration of the nuclear industry of Russia, with some 1 trillion rubles ($42.7 billion) allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015.Russia builds nuclear power stations all over the world at amur.kp.ru A large number of nuclear power stations and units are currently being constructed by the state corporation Rosatom in Russia and abroad.

While from the early 2000s (decade) Russia started pumping more money into its military and defence industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale Russian military reform began, aimed to modernize Russian Armed Forces and made them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried by Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov during Medvedev's Presidency, under supervision of both Putin, as the Head of Government, and Medvedev, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces.
Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million; reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres; creating a professional NCO corps; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formations; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system; reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.[tpl]cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081017/117787642.html |title=Military reform to change army structure.

The Russian Space Forces were replaced on 1 December 2011 with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.

Washington regarded Russia as obstructionist regarding Syria and Iran.  In turn, those nations have looked to Russia (and China) for protection against the United States.Shuster, Simon. "The World According to Putin," Time 16 Sep 2013, pp 30–35: "In the U.N. Security Council, Russia and China have also been working in tandem, with an almost identical record of vetoes of Western resolutions in recent years, like the ones that blocked additional sanctions on Syria and Iran."
Europe needs Russian oil, but worries about interference in the affairs of Eastern Europe.  Russia remains angry over the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe.  Central Asia sees Moscow as a former overlord, which is too powerful to ignore, even as countries assist American involvement in Afghanistan.
In Asia, India has moved from a close ally of the Soviet Union to a partner of the United States with strong nuclear and commercial ties.  Japan and Russia remain at odds over the ownership of the Kurile islands; this dispute has hindered cooperation for decades. China has moved from a client state of Russia in the 1950s, to a bitter antagonist in the 1960s and 1970s, to a situation where its economic powerhouse sees Russia as a source of raw materials, as well as an ally in the United Nations.Shuster, Simon.

===Relations with NATO and its member nations===

Under Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When Putin first became President, the relations were cautious. After the 9/11 attacks when Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror, the opportunity for partnership appeared.America's Failed (Bi-Partisan) Russia Policy by Stephen F. Cohen, Huffington Post However, the U.S. responded by further expansion of NATO to Russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Since 2003, when Russia did not support the Iraq War and when Putin became ever more distant from the West in his internal and external policies, the relations continued to deteriorate. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became anti-Putin. In an interview with Michael Stürmer, Putin was quoted saying that there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of Kosovo, the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked.[tpl]cite book|last=Stuermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Stürmer|title=Putin and the Rise of Russia|year=2008|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297855101|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E6UsAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 June 2012|pages=55, 57 & 192[/tpl] In Putin's view, concessions on one of these questions on the Western side might be met with concessions from Russia on another.

Subsequently, under Medvedev's presidency, Iran-Russia relations were uneven: Russia did not fulfill the contract of selling to Iran the S-300, one of the most potent anti-aircraft missile systems currently existing. However, Russian specialists completed the construction of Iran and the Middle East's first civilian nuclear power facility, the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, and Russia has continuously opposed the imposition of economic sanctions on Iran by the U.S. and the EU, as well as warning against a military attack on Iran. Putin was quoted as describing Iran as a "partner", though he expressed concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.

===Relations with post-Soviet states===

A series of the so-called color revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticised the Rose and Orange Revolution, according to him: "If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict".Polish head rejects Putin attack, BBC News (24 December 2004)
A number of economic disputes erupted between Russia and some neighbours, such as the Russian import ban of Georgian wine. And in some cases, such as the Russia–Ukraine gas disputes, the economic conflicts affected other European countries, for example when a January 2009 gas dispute with Ukraine led state-controlled Russian company Gazprom to halt its deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine,Q&A: Russia-Ukraine gas row, BBC News (20 January 2009). which left a number of European states, to which Ukraine transits Russian gas, to have serious shortages of natural gas in January 2009.

===Speeches abroad===

One of the most important and widely publicized speeches of Putin made abroad was made on 10 February 2007 on the Munich Conference on Security Policy, and hence became known as the Munich speech. It was dubbed by the press to be "the turning point of the Russian foreign policy", and western observers called it the most tough speech from a leader of Russia since the time of the Cold War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nr2.ru/policy/104025.html |title=СМИ: мюнхенская речь Путина – поворотная точка во внешней политике РФ |publisher=Nr2.ru |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl] The speech was also seen as been made by Putin to openly assert the new (old) role of Russia in the international politics, the role close to that of the Soviet Union and the return to which role is seen as one of the achievements of Putin's Presidency.
In the Munich speech Putin called for upholding the principle "security for everyone is security for all", criticized the policies of the United States and NATO, condemned the unipolar model of international relations as flawed and lacking moral basis, condemned the "hypocrisy" of countries trying to teach democracy to Russia, condemned the domination of hard power and enforcement by the U.S. norms and laws to other countries bypassing international law and substitution of the United Nations by NATO or the EU. Putin also called for a stop to the militarization of space and questioned the plans to deploy American missile defense in Europe as threatening strategic nuclear balance and spurring a new arms race. He also claimed that the countries dubbed as rogue states by the West were not going to be capable of threatening Europe or the U.S. with ballistic missiles in the foreseeable future. His speech was criticized by some attendant delegates at the conference, including former NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer who called it "disappointing and not helpful."

===Outdoor speeches===

Notable Putin's outdoor speeches include his addresses during the Victory Day Moscow Military Parades one every 9 May in the years between 2000 and 2007. Under Putin's presidency and premiership, the old Soviet tradition of 9 May Parades, which had been in decline in 1990s, was gradually restored in full grandeur. Since the 2008 Moscow Victory Day Parade the armoured fighting vehicles resumed regular taking part in the Red Square parades. Putin often used the Victory Day occasion to discuss Russia's military development and Russia's security and foreign affairs. For example, he said on 9 May 2007 that "threats are not becoming fewer but are only transforming and changing their appearance. These new threats, just as under the Third Reich, show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world."Speech at the Military Parade Celebrating the 62nd Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, Red Square, Moscow, 9 May 2007.

He compared the political situation at the moment (when fears were spread in the Russian society that 2011–2012 Russian protests could instigate a color revolution directed from abroad) with the First Fatherland War of 1812, reminding that its 200th anniversary and the anniversary of the Battle of Borodino would be celebrated in 2012.Putin cited Lermontov's poem Borodino and ended the speech with Vyacheslav Molotov's famous Great Patriotic War slogan "The Victory Shall Be Ours!" ("Победа будет за нами!").
On the post-election celebration rally, while making an acceptance speech, Putin was for the first time ever seen with tears in his eyes (later he explained that "it was windy"). He said to a 110,000-strong audience: "I told you we would win and we won!"‘We Won in Fair and Open Fight' – Putin RIAN[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.setyoufreenews.com/2012/03/04/we-won-teary-eyed-putin-proclaims-victory/ |title='We won!'
