[[E2-E4]]

CATEGORIES: 1984 albums, Techno albums

E2-E4, released in 1984, is the first solo recording album by Ash Ra Tempel / Ashra guitarist, Manuel Göttsching. The album consists of a minimalistic hour-long progressive electronic track that is subdivided into single tracks according to the stage of the song. The second half of the record is notable for Göttsching's guitar playing. The album is named after the most popular opening chess move, 1. e2-e4 (expressed in long algebraic notation). A noteworthy pun on 'E2-E4' exists because the guitar is tuned from E2 (the low string) to E4 (the high string).
