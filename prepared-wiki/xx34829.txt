==Environment==

===Geology===

Barrington Tops is part of the Mount Royal Range, a spur of the Great Dividing Range. Barrington Tops is a plateau between two of the large peaks in the range, The park is believed to be an extinct volcano and the mountain ranges are made up of a mixture of sedimentary rocks with a granite top. Erosion has weathered the granite and rounded granite boulders can be seen in some areas of the park. Estimates put the age of the rock at 300 to 400 million years, well before Australia separated from Gondwana.

===Climate===

The climate varies from temperate on the lower altitudes to subalpine at highest elevations. A record low of [tpl]Convert|-17|°C|°F|0|lk=on[/tpl] has been registered at [tpl]Convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above mean sea level..Zoete, T.

===Flora===

The ecology of the national park varies from subtropical rainforests in the gullies to subalpine and alpine regions on the mountain peaks. Snow usually falls on the mountain peaks every year and occasionally snows enough to close roads. Rainfall can exceed [tpl]Convert|1500|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] per annum.
A large variety of plants and animals reside in the park and the steepness of the terrain ensures that they are not disturbed by humans. Plant life includes a large variety of eucalypt trees including Snow Gums, subtropical and temperate rainforest trees like Antarctic Beech, tree ferns, a large variety of mosses and ferns and a wide range of edible plants such as the native raspberry, the native cherry and the Lilli Pilli.

===Fauna===

The remoteness and inaccessibility of a large part of the park has allowed some of the more sensitive animals to remain largely undisturbed. A large number of fauna have been catalogued in the park including some that were previously thought to be extinct. Some of the more common animals include: Barking and Sooty Owls, Eastern Grey Kangaroos, frogs, pademelons, cockatoos, rosellas, kookaburras, bats and Echidnas.  It supports a globally important population of Rufous Scrub-birds, as well as Flame Robins, Pale-yellow Robins, Paradise Riflebirds, Green Catbirds, Regent Bowerbirds and Australian Logrunners.
Animals such as quolls, native rats and Platypus are reclusive but may be seen. Not all of the animals in the park are desirable; introduced species such as feral horses and feral cats are being removed.

==History==

The traditional owners of the area are the indigenous people of Australia, known as Australian Aborigines, and include the Gringai clan (southern valleys), the Wonnarua people (western country), and the Worimi people and Birpai (the eastern side).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHeritage.aspx?id=N0002 |title=Aboriginal associations with the park area |work=Barrington Tops National Park |publisher=NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service |accessdate=13 May 2012 [/tpl]

===National Park and World Heritage Area===

In 1969 the area between Mount Barrington, Mount Royal and the Gloucester Tops was declared the Barrington Tops National Park. In 1982 it was listed as a World Heritage Area and subsequently a Wilderness Area. Some of the rivers flowing through the Barrington range have been classed as wild rivers meaning they are exceptionally pure and unpolluted. The highest peak is Brumlow Top which rises to a height of [tpl]Convert|1586|m|ft|0[/tpl].

===Aircraft crashes===

A number of aircraft have crashed in and around the Barrington Tops, Aeroplane Hill being named after one of the crashes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010|reason=Aircraft hill?[/tpl] The altitude, frequent fog & cloud, storms and cold weather (causing icing) make this area potentially hazardous to aircraft. One article refers to "The Devil's Triangle".

===Barrington Guest House===

The Barrington Guest House was built from 1925 on the upper Williams River near Barrington Tops by Norman T. McLeod, licensee of the Royal Hotel in Dungog, using timber cut and milled from the property. It stands on land consisting of [tpl]Convert|10.5|ha|acre[/tpl] of forest surrounded by National and State Parks and was officially opened in 1930 by Dr Sir Earle Page MHR, then Leader of the Country Party and former Treasurer of Australia and later Prime Minister of Australia.
The guest house was a popular venue for people to stay in the park, until it burned down in a fire at 11pm on 24 September 2006 due to an electrical fault.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20471584-5006784,00.html |title=Fire destroys historic guesthouse |work=The Australian |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2007-01-11[/tpl] It was undergoing modernisation under new ownership at the time of the fire. There are plans to rebuild.
