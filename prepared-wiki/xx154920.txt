The mission of Sojourners is “to articulate the biblical call to social justice, inspiring hope and building a movement to transform individuals, communities, the church, and the world.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.mission |title=Sojourners : About Us |publisher=Sojo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25[/tpl]
