==Creation and conception==

Masashi Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's intelligent but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.[tpl]cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|page=344|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2[/tpl]

==Reception==

Shikamaru has ranked highly in the Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top ten and reaching fourth place in one poll. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Shikamaru was in ninth place, behind Sasori and ahead of Hinata. Merchandise based on Shikamaru has also been released, including action figures, key chains, and patches in both his Part I and Part II appearance.
Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as "the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X" due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair.[tpl]cite web|url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/827/827297p1.html|title=Naruto: "The Battle Begins: Naruto vs. Sasuke" Review|publisher=IGN|author=White, Charles|date=2008-10-15|accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl] Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as "an unlikely hero" one of the highlights of the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the "great moment" in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/848/848534p1.html|title=IGN: "The Promise That Could Not Be Kept" Review|publisher=IGN|author=White, Charles|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl] Mania.com celebrated his "sheer intellect", calling him "one of the most fascinating characters in the series" and "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mania.com/naruto-box-set-04-also-wspecial-edition_article_79366.html|title=Naruto Box Set 04 (also w/special edition) |publisher=Mania.com|author=Rich, Justin|date=2007-10-04|accessdate=2008-11-05[/tpl] Another reviewer noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was "one of the better fights involving the supporting players".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mania.com/naruto-unleashed-set-31_article_80276.html|title=Naruto Unleashed Set 3:1 |publisher=Mania.com|author=Moure, Dani|date=2008-04-21|accessdate=2008-11-05[/tpl]
