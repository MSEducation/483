Yolo Country, officially the Country of Yolo, is a county located in the Sacramento Valley, in the northern portion of the U.S. state of California, bordered by the counties of Sacramento, Solano, Napa, Lake, Colusa, and Sutter. The city of Woodland is its county seat, though Davis is its largest city.
As of the 2010 United States Census, Yolo County had a population of 200,849. Much of Yolo County remains a relatively rural agricultural region.

===Overview===

Yolo is a strongly Democratic county in Presidential and congressional elections. The last Republican Presidential candidate to win a majority in the county was Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, which is the longest drought for Republicans in any California county. However, some Republican Governors have carried Yolo county since then (Ronald Reagan in 1966, George Deukmejian in 1986 and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2003 and 2006).
Yolo County is split between California's 3rd and 6th congressional districts, represented by [tpl]Representative|cacd|3[/tpl] and [tpl]Representative|cacd|6[/tpl], respectively.[tpl]Cite GovTrack|CA|3|accessdate=February 28, 2013[/tpl] In the state legislature, Yolo is in the 2nd and 8th Assembly districts, which are held by Republican Jim Nielsen and Democrat Mariko Yamada, respectively, and the 5th Senate district, which is held by Democrat Lois Wolk.
In November 2008, Yolo was one of just three counties in California's interior in which voters rejected Proposition 8 to ban gay marriage. Yolo voters rejected Proposition 8 by 58.4 percent to 41.6 percent. The other interior counties in which Proposition 8 failed to receive a majority of votes were Alpine County and Mono County.County-by-County Map, California Propositions: The Los Angeles Times
