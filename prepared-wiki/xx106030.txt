The Nation of Yahweh is a predominantly African American group that is the most controversial offshoot of the Black Hebrew Israelites line of thought. It has often been labeled as a hate group and was founded in 1979 in Miami by Hulon Mitchell Jr., who went by the name Yahweh ben Yahweh. Its goal is to return African Americans, whom they see as the original Israelites, to Israel. The group departs from mainstream Christianity and Judaism by accepting Yahweh ben Yahweh as the Son of God. In this way, its beliefs are unique and distinct from that of other known Black Hebrew Israelite groups.[tpl]cite book |title= The New Religious Movements Experience in America |last=Gallagher |first=Eugene V. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location= |isbn=0-313-32807-2 |page=149 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=811 |title=Rebirth of A Nation |accessdate=2008-01-20 |format= |work= |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center [/tpl]  The group has engendered controversy due to legal issues of its founder and has also faced accusations of being a black supremacist cult by the Southern Poverty Law Center[ref]
