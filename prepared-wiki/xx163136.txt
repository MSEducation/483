The Whitney Museum of American Art original building is a collection of three 1838 rowhouses located at 8-12 West 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and MacDougal Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. In 1914, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street adjacent to her own MacDougal Alley studio. The club was intended to be a place where young artists could exhibit their works.
In 1929, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected Whitney's offer of a gift of new artworks that she had collected, Whitney established the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1931 she had architect Auguste L. Noel of the firm of Noel & Miller convert the three row houses at 8-12 West 8th Street into a gallery and residence for herself, and then, in 1936, into the museum's first home.  In 1954, the museum moved uptown to new quarters – eventually settling in 1966 at 945 Madison Avenue at East 75th Street – and the building, with the addition of #14 West 8th Street, an Italianate house built in 1853-54, became the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.
The building is located within the Greenwich Village Historic District, established in 1969 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: Whitney Museum of American Art / New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture|702 KB[/tpl]|author=Avis Berman|date=December 2, 1991|publisher=National Park Service|postscript=[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying 26 photos, exterior and interipr, from 1906-1991|10.1 MB[/tpl]
