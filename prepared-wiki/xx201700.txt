CATEGORIES: Prva HNL seasons, 2008–09 domestic association football leagues, 2008–09 in Croatian football

The 2008–09 Prva HNL (officially known as the T-Com Prva HNL for sponsorship reasons) season was the 18th since its establishment. It started on 27 July 2008 and ended on 31 May 2009. Dinamo Zagreb were the defending champions, having won their twelfth championship title the previous season, and they defended the title again, after a win against Slaven Belupo on 17 May 2009.

==Promotion and relegation==

Međimurje were automatically relegated to Druga HNL as they finished last in the previous season, while Croatia Sesvete were automatically promoted from Druga HNL after winning the 2007–08 title. In a two-legged playoff between Inter Zaprešić and Hrvatski dragovoljac, the former kept their Prva HNL status by beating Hrvatski dragovoljac with 2–0 on aggregate (2–0, 0–0).

==League expansion==

In June 2007 Igor Štimac, president of Association of Prva HNL clubs, proposed a future expansion of Prva HNL from 12 to 16 clubs, starting from 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/37327/liga-16-nogometu-donosi-400-mil-kn|title='Liga 16' nogometu donosi 400 mil. kn|trans_title=League of 16 brings 400 million kuna to football|language=Croatian|publisher=Nacional (weekly)|author=Berislav Jelinić|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=10 July 2012|archivedate=10 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/693FXbmyj[/tpl] However, although a majority of club representatives supported that proposal, no strict agreement or final decision was made. On HNS meeting in late August 2007 it was decided to postpone the decision for late 2007 or even 2008 and that the expansion would not be possible before the 2009–10 season.Liga 16 (zasad) stopirana [tpl]hr icon[/tpl]
For more than a year nothing explicit was stated on that matter. Finally, on a regular HNS meeting in February 2009 HNS Secretary Zorislav Srebrić stated that club licensing would decide whether the 2009–10 season would feature 12 or 16 teams. Theoretically, if only 15 teams obtained Prva HNL license, league would have featured 12 teams. The deadline for submitting the license was 1 May 2009.Licenciranje odlučuje o Ligi 16 [tpl]hr icon[/tpl] On 8 May 2009 HNS declared that all 19 clubs that applied for the license were awarded with it and would be in possibility to enter the league in 2009–10, now expanded to 16 clubs.Njih 15, stadiona sedam [tpl]hr icon[/tpl] Also, on 26 May 2009 HNS received official confirmations from all 19 clubs in which they expressed their will to compete in next year's Prva HNL, what means that none of the clubs would withdraw from the league.Svi žele u Prvu HNL [tpl]hr icon[/tpl] However, despite their guarantee to compete in Prva HNL, Slavonac eventually withdrew although they finished fourth and earned direct access to Prva HNL 2009–10. Their place was taken by Međimurje while sixth-placed Hrvatski dragovoljac competed in a relegation play-offs.Međimurci direktno, Slavonac odustao [tpl]hr icon[/tpl]

==Stadiums and locations==

After the death of Hrvoje Ćustić during a game played at Zadar's Stanovi Stadium in March 2008, it was decided that the stadia for the 2008–09 season would have to pass a closer inspection to be deemed fit for first-league football. Since only 9 stadia managed to meet the requirements and obtain first-league license from the Croatian Football Federation, it was announced in May 2008 that some of the teams (Cibalia, Croatia Sesvete, Zadar and NK Zagreb) would have to share stadia and temporarily play their home games at other venues.Zagreb u Maksimiru, Zadar na Šubićevcu [tpl]hr icon[/tpl] Just before Round 1 kicked off, Cibalia managed to bring their stadium to standard, and in August, just before round 5, Zadar secured the licence to play their games at Stanovi Stadium.Zadar se vraća kući [tpl]hr icon[/tpl]

===Relegation play-off===

Due to the expansion of Prva HNL to 16 clubs in the 2009–10 season, four clubs from Druga HNL 2008–09 were automatically promoted. Those should have been top four clubs, but since Slavonac withdrew their direct access spot was taken by fifth-placed Međimurje. Therefore, the 12th placed Croatia Sesvete played a two-legged relegation play-off against the 6th placed team of Druga HNL, Hrvatski dragovoljac. Croatia Sesvete won 2–1 on aggregate and thereby earned a spot in the 2009–10 season.

==Results==

The schedule consisted of three rounds. During the first two rounds, each team played each other once home and away for a total of 22 matches. The pairings of the third round were then set according to the standings after the first two rounds, giving every team a third game against each opponent for a total of 33 games per team.
