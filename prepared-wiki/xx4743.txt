Tracy Lauren Marrow (born February 16, 1958), better known by his stage name Ice-T, is an American rapper, singer and actor. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, and moved to the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles when he was in the 8th grade. Tracy "Ice-T" Marrow's music career started with the band of the singing group, The Precious Few of Crenshaw High School. Tracy and his group opened the show, dancing to a live band. The singers were Thomas Barnes, Ronald Robinson and Lapekas Mayfield.
After graduating from high school, he served in the United States Army for four years. He began his career as a rapper in the 1980s and was signed to Sire Records in 1987, when he released his debut album Rhyme Pays, the first hip-hop album to carry an explicit content sticker. The next year, he founded the record label Rhyme $yndicate Records (named after his collective of fellow hip-hop artists called the 'Rhyme $yndicate') and released another album, Power.
He co-founded the metal band Body Count, which he introduced in his 1991 album O.G.: Original Gangster. Body Count released its self-titled debut album in 1992. Ice-T encountered controversy over his track "Cop Killer", which was perceived to glamorize killing police officers. Ice-T asked to be released from his contract with Warner Bros. Records, and his next solo album, Home Invasion, was released later in February 1993 through Priority Records. Body Count's next album was released in 1994, and Ice-T released two more albums in the late 1990s. Since 2000, he has portrayed NYPD Detective Odafin Tutuola on the NBC police drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

==Early life==

Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow, son of Solomon and Alice Marrow,[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=5–13 |chapter=Cold as Ice [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/ice-t/bio/154286|title=Ice-T Biography|accessdate=2007-09-22 |publisher=TVGuide.com[/tpl] in Newark, New Jersey. As a child, his family moved to upscale Summit, New Jersey. Solomon was an African American, and Alice was Creole. For decades, Solomon worked as a conveyor belt mechanic at the Rapistan Conveyor Company. The first time race played a major part in Tracy's life was at the age of 7, when he became aware of the racism leveled by his white friends toward children, and that he escaped similar treatment because they thought that Marrow was white because of his lighter skin. Relating this incident to his mother, she told him "Honey, people are stupid"; her advice and this incident taught Marrow to control the way the negativity of others affected him.
His mother died of a heart attack when Tracy was in third grade. Solomon raised Tracy while he was a single father for four years, with help from a housekeeper. Tracy's first experience with an illegal activity occurred after a bicycle that Solomon "bought" him for Christmas was stolen. After Tracy told his father, Solomon shrugged, "Well, then, you ain't got no bike." Tracy stole parts from bicycles and assembled "three or four weird-looking, brightly painted bikes" from the parts; his father either did not notice, or never acknowledged this. When Tracy was 12 years old, Solomon died of a heart attack.[tpl]cite book|author=Ice-T|coauthors=Sigmund, Heidi|title=The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a F*ck?|year=1994|publisher=Pan Books|isbn=0-330-33629-0[/tpl] For many years, AllMusic.com has stated that his parents "died in an auto accident",[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ice-t-p89063/biography |title=Ice-T |publisher=AllMusic |date=1958-02-16 |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl] but Ice-T has stated that it was actually he who had been in a brutal auto accident and that was decades later.
Following his father's death, Tracy lived with a nearby aunt briefly, and was sent to live with his other aunt and her husband in View Park-Windsor Hills, an upper middle-class black neighborhood by South Los Angeles.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=17–29 |chapter=Cold as Ice [/tpl] While his cousin Earl was preparing to leave for college, Tracy shared a room with him. Earl was a fan of rock music and listened to only the local rock stations; sharing a room with him spurred Tracy's interest in heavy metal music.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=127–140 |chapter=Freedom of Speech [/tpl]

===Gangs, criminal life and the Army===

Marrow attended Palms Junior High, which was predominately made up of white students, and included black students bused in from South Central. After graduating, he attended Crenshaw High School, which was almost entirely made up of black students.[tpl]cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-04-24/entertainment/ca-2445_1_rap-wizard|title=The Hard Cold Rap of Ice-T|work=Los Angeles Times|page=Calendar 89 | date=1988-04-24[/tpl] Marrow stood out from most of his friends because he did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use drugs. During high school, gangs began to intensify in the Los Angeles school system. Students who belonged to the Bloods and Crips gangs attended Crenshaw, and fought in the school's halls. Tracy, while never an actual gang member, was more affiliated with the Crips, and began reading the novels of Iceberg Slim, which he memorized and recited to his friends, who enjoyed hearing the excerpts and told him, "Yo, kick some more of that by Ice, T," and the handle stuck. Marrow and other Crips wrote and performed "Crip Rhymes", long before the advent of hip hop and recorded rapping.
At the age of 17, Tracy received the Social Security death-benefit money for the death of his father to rent an apartment for $90 a month.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=30–43 |chapter=Cold As Ice [/tpl] Marrow sold cannabis and stole car stereos for money, but was not making enough money to support his girlfriend and daughter, leading him to join the United States Army for the financial benefits; he served for four years in the 25th Infantry Division.  Marrow was in a group that was jailed for the theft of an infantry rug. While awaiting trial, he received a $2,500 bonus check.  He then decided to escape from the jail and desert his Army duties, yet he returned a month later after the rug had been returned. He received an Article 15 and subsequently completed Advanced Infantry Training.
Marrow became interested in hip hop music while serving in the Army. During this period, he heard Sugar Hill Gang's newly released single "Rapper's Delight," which inspired him to perform his own raps over the instrumentals of this and other early hip-hop records. The music, however, did not fit his lyrics or form of delivery, which ultimately led Marrow to develop his own personalized skills as a rapper.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=49–56 |chapter=Nightmare Walking [/tpl]
As a squad leader at Schofield Barracks, in Hawaii Marrow met a pimp named Mac in Hawaii, where prostitution was not a heavily prosecuted crime. Because Mac admired that Marrow could quote Iceberg Slim, he taught Marrow how to pimp. Marrow was also able to purchase stereo equipment cheaply in Hawaii, including two Technics turntables, a mixer, and large speakers.  Once equipped, he then began to learn turntablism and rapping.
Towards the end of his time in the Army, Marrow learned from his commanding officer that he could receive an Honorable discharge because he was a single father, so he left four months ahead of schedule.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Flanagan |first=Emma |title=Ice-T addresses group, provides inspiration |url=http://www.dailytargum.com/2.4985/1.1514326-1.1514326 |work=The Daily Targum |publisher=Rutgers University |date=2004-02-23 |accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl]
During an episode of the Adam Carolla Podcast that aired on June 6, 2012, Marrow claimed that after being discharged from the Army, he began a career as a bank robber. Using combat skills allegedly acquired in Ranger School, Marrow claimed he and some associates began conducting take-over bank robberies, "...like the film Heat." Marrow then elaborated, explaining, "Only punks go for the drawer, we gotta go for the safe." Although Marrow may have been using some artistic license in describing his bank robbing exploits, he also stated he was glad the United States justice system has a statute of limitations, which had likely expired when Marrow admitted to his involvement in multiple Class 1 Felonies in the early- to mid-1970s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/?powerpress_pinw=11124-podcast |title=Blubrry PowerPress Player |publisher=Adamcarolla.com |accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl]

==Music career==

===Early career===

After leaving the Army, Marrow wanted to stay away from gang life and violence and instead make a name for himself as a disc jockey. As a tribute to Iceberg Slim, Marrow adopted the stage name Ice-T. While performing as a DJ at parties, he received more attention as a rapper, which led Marrow to pursue a career as a rapper. After breaking up with his girlfriend Caitlin Boyd, he returned to a life of crime and robbed jewelry stores with his high school friends.  Marrow's raps later described how he and his friends pretended to be customers to gain access before smashing the display glass with baby sledgehammers.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=57–69 |chapter=Nightmare Walking [/tpl]
One of Marrow's friends, Sean E. Sean, was arrested for possession of not only cannabis, which Sean sold, but also material stolen by Marrow. Sean took the blame and served two years in prison. Marrow stated that he owed a gratitude to Sean because his prison time allowed Marrow to pursue a career as a rapper. Concurrently, Marrow wound up in a car accident and was hospitalized as a John Doe because he did not carry any form of identification due to his criminal activities.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=78–83 |chapter=Nightmare Walking [/tpl] After being discharged from the hospital, he decided to abandon the criminal lifestyle and pursue a professional career rapping. Two weeks after being released from the hospital, he won an open mic competition judged by Kurtis Blow.

===Professional career===

In 1982, Marrow met producer William Strong from Saturn Records, who recorded his first single, "Cold Wind Madness", also known as "The Coldest Rap", which became an underground success, becoming popular even though radio stations did not play it due to the song's hardcore lyrics.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=70–77 |chapter=Nightmare Walking [/tpl] Marrow appeared as a featured rapper on "Reckless", a single by DJ Chris "The Glove" Taylor, and recorded the songs "You Don't Quit" and "Dog'n the Wax" with Unknown DJ, who provided a sound for the songs.
Marrow received further inspiration as an artist from Schoolly D's gangsta rap single "P.S.K. What Does It Mean?", which Marrow heard in a club. Marrow enjoyed the single's sound and delivery, as well as its vague references to gang life, although the real life gang, Park Side Killers, was not named in the song.[tpl]cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=89–112 |chapter=Nightmare Walking [/tpl]
Marrow decided to adopt Schoolly D's style, and wrote the lyrics to his first gangsta rap song, "6 in the Mornin'", in his Hollywood apartment, and created a minimal beat with a Roland TR-808. Marrow compared the sound of the song, which was recorded as a B-Side on the single "Dog'n The Wax", to that of the Beastie Boys. The single was released in 1986, and Marrow learned that "6 in the Mornin'" was more popular in clubs than its A-side, leading Marrow to rap about Los Angeles gang life, which Marrow described more explicitly than any previous rapper. He intentionally did not represent any particular gang, and wore a mixture of red and blue clothing and shoes to avoid antagonizing gang-affiliated listeners, who debated his true affiliation.
Ice-T finally landed a deal with a major label Sire Records. When label founder and president Seymour Stein heard his demo, he said, "He sounds like Bob Dylan."[ref]Coleman,
Brian, Check The Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies. New York: Villiard/Random House, 2007. pp. 238.[/ref] Shortly after, he released his debut album Rhyme Pays in 1987 supported by DJ Evil E, DJ Aladdin and producer Afrika Islam, who helped create the mainly party-oriented sound. The record wound up being certified gold by the RIAA. That same year, he recorded the title theme song for Dennis Hopper's Colors, a film about inner-city gang life in Los Angeles. His next album Power was released in 1988, under his own label Rhyme Syndicate, and it was a more assured and impressive record, earning him strong reviews and his second gold record. Released in 1989, The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say established his popularity by matching excellent abrasive music with narrative and commentative lyrics.[tpl]cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p89063|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Ice-T: Biography|publisher=allmusic|year=2000|accessdate=July 8, 2008[/tpl]
In 1991, he released his album O.G. Original Gangster, which is regarded as one of the albums that defined gangsta rap.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] On OG, he introduced his heavy metal band Body Count in a track of the same name. Ice-T toured with Body Count on the first annual Lollapalooza concert tour in 1991, gaining him appeal among middle-class teenagers and fans of alternative music genres. The album Body Count was released in March 1992. For his appearance on the heavily collaborative track "Back on the Block", a composition by jazz musician Quincy Jones that "attempted to bring together black musical styles from jazz to soul to funk to rap", Ice-T won a Grammy Award for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, an award shared by others who worked on the track including Jones and fellow jazz musician Ray Charles.[tpl]cite news|last=Pareles |first=Jon |title=Grammys Turn Into Quincy Jones Show |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9173EF932A15751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times |date=1991-02-23 |accessdate=2008-07-02[/tpl]
Controversy later surrounded Body Count over its song "Cop Killer". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the National Rifle Association and various police advocacy groups.[tpl]cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=COVER STORY : 'Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining.' : A Q & A with Ice-T about rock, race and the 'Cop Killer' furor|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/entertainment/ca-4406_1_cop-killer|accessdate=2 January 2014|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 19, 1992[/tpl] Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T's upcoming album Home Invasion because of the controversy surrounding "Cop Killer". Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips "...they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that." In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of Cop Killer, the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: "The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer."  
When Ice split amicably with Sire/Warner Bros. Records after a dispute over the artwork of the album Home Invasion, he reactivated Rhyme Syndicate and formed a deal with Priority Records for distribution. Priority released Home Invasion in the spring of 1993.[tpl]cite news|last=Pareles |first=Jon |title=Ice-T's Latest Gangster-Rap Caper Finds Him Alone and on His Own |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DD1331F93AA15750C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times |date=1993-03-29 |accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl] The album peaked at #9 on Billboard magazine's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and at #14 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p89063|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Charts and Awards for Ice-T |accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] spawning several singles including "Gotta Lotta Love", "I Ain't New To This" and "99 Problems" – which would later inspire Jay-Z to record a version with new lyrics in 2003. 
Ice-T had also collaborated with certain other heavy metal bands during this time period. For the film Judgment Night, he did a duet with Slayer on the track "Disorder".[tpl]cite web|last=Ruhlmann |first=William |title=Judgment Night > Overview |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r189710|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |work=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-07-02[/tpl] In 1995, Ice-T made a guest performance on Forbidden by Black Sabbath. Another album of his, VI - Return of the Real came out in 1996, followed by The Seventh Deadly Sin in 1999.[tpl]cite news|last=Freydkin |first=Donna |title=No thaw for rapper Ice T |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9910/27/ice.t/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=1999-10-27 |accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl]
His first rap album since 1999, Gangsta Rap, was released on October 31, 2006. The album's cover, which "shows Ice-T lying on his back in bed with his ravishing wife's ample posterior in full view and one of her legs coyly draped over his private parts," was considered to be too suggestive for most retailers, many of which were reluctant to stock the album.[tpl]cite news |title=Page Six: STORES HOT OVER ICE-T COVER |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10182006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |work=New York Post |date=2006-10-18 |accessdate=2007-09-22 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Some reviews of the album were unenthusiastic, as many had hoped for a return to the political raps of Ice-T's most successful albums.
Ice-T appears in the film Gift. One of the last scenes includes Ice-T and Body Count playing with Jane's Addiction in a version of the Sly and the Family Stone song "Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey."
Besides fronting his own band and rap projects, Ice-T has also collaborated with other hard rock and metal bands, such as Icepick, Motörhead, Slayer, Pro-Pain, and Six Feet Under. He has also covered songs by hardcore punk bands such as The Exploited, Jello Biafra, and Black Flag. Ice-T made an appearance at Insane Clown Posse's Gathering of the Juggalos (2008 edition).[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080730072142/http://www.juggalogathering.com/home.php?page_id=main_stage |title=2008 Gathering of the Juggalos - Other Main Stage Performers |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] Ice-T was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2008.asp |title=7th Annual IMA Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] His 2012 film Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap features a who's who of underground and mainstream rappers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2009-12-12T07_58_44-08_00 |title=PodOmatic | Best Free Podcasts |publisher=Conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl]
In November 2011, Ice-T announced via Twitter that he was in the process of collecting beats for his next LP which was expected sometime during 2012, but as of July 2013, the album has not been released.

===Acting and non-reality television===

Ice-T's first film appearances were in the motion pictures, Breakin' (1984), and its sequel, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (1985). These films were released before Ice-T released his first LP, although he appears on the soundtrack to Breakin[tpl]`[/tpl].  He has since stated he considers the films and his own performance in them to be "wack".The Ice Opinion, page 96, St Martin's Press, New York, 1994
In 1991, he embarked on a serious acting career, portraying police detective Scotty Appleton in Mario Van Peebles' feature film New Jack City, gang leader Odessa (alongside Denzel Washington and John Lithgow) in Ricochet (1991), gang leader King James in Trespass (1992), followed by a notable lead role performance in Surviving the Game (1994), in addition to many supporting roles, such as J-Bone in Johnny Mnemonic (1995), and the marsupial mutant T-Saint in Tank Girl (1995). Marrow was also interviewed in the Brent Owens documentary Pimps Up, Ho's Down,[tpl]cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Jason |title=Ice-T > Biography |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:34312~T1 |work=Allmovie |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-07-02[/tpl] in which he claims to have had an extensive pimping background before getting into rap.  He is quoted as saying "once you max something out, it ain't no fun no more.  I couldn't really get no farther."  He goes on to explain his pimping experience gave him the ability to get into new businesses.  "I can't act, I really can't act, I ain't no rapper, it's all game.  I'm just working these niggas."  Later he raps at the Players Ball.
In 1993, Marrow along with other rappers and the three Yo! MTV Raps hosts Ed Lover, Doctor Dre and Fab 5 Freddy starred in the comedy Who's the Man?, directed by Ted Demme. In this movie, Marrow is a drug dealer who gets really frustrated when someone calls him by his real name, "Chauncey," rather than his street name, "Nighttrain."
In 1995, Marrow had a recurring role as vengeful drug dealer Danny Cort on the television series New York Undercover, co-created by Dick Wolf.  His work on the series earned him the 1996 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.  In 1997, Marrow co-created the short-lived series Players, produced by Wolf.  This was followed by a role as pimp Seymour "Kingston" Stockton in Exiled: A Law & Order Movie (1998). These collaborations led Wolf to add Marrow to the cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.  Since 2000 he has portrayed Odafin "Fin" Tutuola, a former undercover narcotics officer transferred to the Special Victims Unit.  In 2002, the NAACP awarded Marrow with a second Image Award, again for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, for his work on Law & Order: SVU.

Ice-T made an appearance on the comedy television series Chappelle's Show as himself presenting the award for "Player Hater of the Year" at the "Player-Haters Ball", a parody of his own appearance at the Players Ball. He was dubbed the "Original Player Hater."

On October 20, 2006, Ice-T's Rap School aired and was a reality television show on VH1. It was a spin-off of the British reality show Gene Simmons' Rock School, which also aired on VH1. In Rap School, rapper/actor Ice-T teaches eight teens from York Preparatory School in New York called the "York Prep Crew" ("Y.P. Crew" for short). Each week, Ice-T gives them assignments and they compete for an imitation gold chain with a microphone on it. On the season finale on November 17, 2006, the group performed as an opening act for Public Enemy.
On June 12, 2011, E! reality show Ice Loves Coco debuted.  The show is mostly about his relationship with his wife of ten years, Nicole "Coco" Austin.

==Style and influence==

Marrow cites writer Iceberg Slim and rapper Schoolly D as influences, with Iceberg Slim's novels guiding his skills as a lyricist. Marrow's favorite heavy rock acts are Edgar Winter, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Marrow's hip hop albums helped shape the gangsta rap style, with music journalist tracing works of artists such as Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., Eminem and N.W.A to "6 in the Mornin'".
His love of rock music led Marrow to use electric guitar in the instrumentation of his hip hop albums in order to provide his songs with edge and power, and to make his raps harder; he used the fusion of rock and hip hop of Rick Rubin-produced acts like Beastie Boys, Run-DMC and LL Cool J, which featured rock samples in their songs. His work with Body Count, whose 1992 debut album Marrow described as a "rock album with a rap mentality",[tpl]cite book |last=Dellamora |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Postmodern Apocalypse: Theory and Cultural Practice at the End |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1995 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-8122-1558-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=251 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] is described as paving the way for the success of rap rock fusions by bands like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit; however, Marrow states that the band's style does not fuse the two genres, and is solely a rock band. He is also a fan of the British singer Phil Collins; Collins claimed he was "incredibly flattered" when he learned this.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269213/Phil-Collins-People-used-think-I-musical-evil-Now-Im-cool.html | title= 'People used to think I was musical evil.

==Personal life==

In 1976, Marrow's girlfriend Adrienne gave birth to their daughter, LeTesha, and they attended high school while raising the child. LeTesha later gave her parents two grandchildren. Later in 1984, while filming Breakin', Marrow met Darlene Ortiz, who had been at the club in which the film was being shot, and the two began a relationship; Ortiz was featured on the covers of Rhyme Pays and Power. Marrow and Ortiz had a son, Ice Tracy Marrow, in 1992. On December 31, 2001, Marrow married swimsuit model Nicole "Coco Marie" Austin. In celebration of their 10th wedding anniversary, the couple renewed their wedding vows on June 4, 2011. They own a condominium in North Bergen, New Jersey,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15500221/ |title=Ice-T turns from cop-killing talk to posing nude - today > entertainment - Music - TODAY.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl]Fusfeld, Adam (January 20, 2012).

==Activism==

During the popularity of Public Enemy, Ice-T was closely associated with the band and his recordings of the time showed a similar political viewpoint.  He was referred to as "The Soldier of the Highest Degree" in the booklet for Fear of a Black Planet and mentioned on the track Leave this off your fu.  He also collaborated with fellow anti-censorship campaigner Jello Biafra on his album The Iceberg/Freedom Of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!.
On June 5, 2008, Ice-T jokingly stated that he would be voting for John McCain in the 2008 American elections. Ice-T also speculated that his past affiliation with Body Count could hurt Barack Obama's chances if he endorsed him, so he'd choose instead to ruin John McCain's campaign by saying he supported him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/06/05/ice-t-add-mccain-to-my-body-count/ |title=Ice T - Add McCain to My Body Count |publisher=TMZ.com |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Feuds==

===LL Cool J===

Ice-T had a non-publicized feud with LL Cool J in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Apparently, this was instigated by LL's claim to be "the baddest rapper in the history of rap itself".[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/im-bad-lyrics-ll-cool-j.html |title=LL Cool J - I'm Bad Lyrics |publisher=MetroLyrics |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] Ice-T recorded disses against LL on his 1988 album Power. On the album was the track, "I'm Your Pusher", in which a rap music addict declines to buy an LL Cool J record. The album also contains the posse rap track, "The Syndicate", which took aim at LL's lyrical ability, claiming  that rapping about oneself so frequently was a "first grade topic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-syndicate-lyrics-ice-t.html |title=Ice T - The Syndicate Lyrics |publisher=MetroLyrics |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] The song also mocked the song's hook "I'm Bad", which identified it as an LL diss specifically.  In the book Check the Technique: Linear Notes for the Hip-Hop Junkies, Ice-T said that the song "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." was also intended as a diss to LL Cool J, by making a crude song to contrast with the love songs that LL was making at the time.Brian Coleman, Check the Technique: Linear Notes for the Hip-Hop Junkies, page 247, Villard Books, New York, 2007
On LL's response, To da Break of Dawn in 1990, he dissed Kool Moe Dee (Whose feud with LL was far more publicized) as well as MC Hammer. He then devoted the third verse of the song to dissing Ice-T, mocking his rap ability ("take your rhymes around the corner to rap rehab"), his background ("before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief"), and his style ("a brother with a perm deserves to get burned"). He also suggested that the success of Power was due to the appearance of Ice-T's girlfriend Darlene on the album cover. Ice-T appeared to have ignored the insults and he had also defended LL Cool J after his arrest in the song "Freedom of Speech".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/ll+cool+j/to+da+break+of+dawn_20084664.html |title=To Da Break Of Dawn Lyrics - LL Cool J |publisher=Lyricsfreak.com |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl]
In August 2012, Ice-T said that the rivalry was "never serious" and that he needed a nemesis to create "an exciting dispute".[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.hiphoprx.com/2012/08/20/ice-t-speaks-on-hip-hop-beef-with-ll-cool-j/ |title=Ice-T Speaks On Hip Hop Beef With LL Cool J |publisher=Hiphoprx.com |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl]

===Soulja Boy Tell 'Em===

In June 2008, on DJ Cisco's Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T criticized DeAndre Cortez "Soulja Boy Tell 'Em" Way for "killing hip hop" and his song "Crank That" for being "garbage" compared to the works of other hip-hop artists such as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube. One of the comments in the exchange was when Ice-T told Way to "eat a dick".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7135/title.ice-t-tells-soulja-boy-to-eat-a-dick|title=Ice-T Tells Soulja Boy To Eat A Dick|first=Andreas|last=Hale|work=Hip Hop DX|date=2008-06-17[/tpl] The two then traded numerous videos back and forth over the Internet. These videos included a cartoon and video of Ice-T dancing on Way's behalf and an apology, but reiteration of his feelings that Way's music "sucks", on Ice-T's behalf.[tpl]cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589961/20080625/soulja_boy_tellem.jhtml |title=Soulja Boy Tell'em Talks About New Album, Battle With Ice-T |publisher=MTV.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] Rapper Kanye West defended Way by arguing that the younger artist created a new, original work for hip hop, thus keeping the authentic meaning of the music, even though it is not creative or talented.[tpl]cite news|last=Upmalis|first=Jordan|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/06/23/ice-t-vs-soulja-boy-tellem-video-blog-beef-heats-up-kanye-weighs-in|title=Ice-T vs. Soulja Boy Tell'em Video Blog Beef Heats Up; Kanye Weighs In|work=MTV News|date=2008-06-23[/tpl]
