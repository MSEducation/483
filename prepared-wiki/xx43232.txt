[[Vision (spirituality)]]

CATEGORIES: Religious behaviour and experience, Revelation

A vision is something seen in a dream, trance, or religious ecstasy, especially a supernatural appearance that conveys a revelation.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vision Visions generally have more clarity than dreams, but traditionally fewer psychological connotations. Visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality.Ferrer, J.N. Toward a participatory vision of human spirituality. ReVision 24(2): 15. 2001. Prophecy is often associated with visions. 
Entheogens (such as peyote) have traditionally assisted in the generation of visions among diverse cultures, as well as in modern western culture, although this is a very controversial topic.

==Examples of visions==

Visions are listed in approximately chronological order whenever possible, although some dates may be in dispute.

==Neuroscience==

Modern neuroscience provides theories of some hallucinations, illusions, out of body experiences, and altered states of consciousness which have been suggested as explanations of some visionary experiences, and in some cases can be used to artificially induce similar experiences.  However other neuroscientists such as Eben Alexander have argued that some visionary experiences are of real metaphysical entities and that the brain is used to perceive them as it perceives all other entities.
