==Description==

French naturalist Nicolas Baudin carried a few corms of this banana from Southeast Asia, depositing them at a botanical garden on the Caribbean island of Martinique. In 1835, French botanist Jean François Pouyat carried Baudin's fruit from Martinique to Jamaica.[tpl]cite book|author=Dan Koeppel|others=|title=Banana: the fate of the fruit that changed the world|publisher=Hudson Street Press|year=2008|isbn=1-4295-9325-3|pages=33[/tpl]
The 1923 musical hit "Yes, We Have No Bananas" is said to have been inspired by a shortage of the "Big Mike" bananas, which began with the infestation of Panama disease early in the 20th century.[tpl] cite web | url = http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-06/can-fruit-be-saved | title = Can This Fruit Be Saved? | first = Dan | last = Koeppel | publisher = Popsci.com | date = 19 June 2005 | accessdate = 2008-06-22 [/tpl]
By 1960, the major importers of Gros Michel bananas were nearly bankrupt, and had waited to deal with the financial and environmental crisis. The Cavendish was cultivated so consumers would still be able to obtain bananas.
The international name of this banana variety is ‘Gros Michel’ (Musa acuminata AAA). This variety was once the dominant export banana to Europe and North America, grown in South America and Africa. In the 1950s, Panama disease, a wilt caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, wiped out vast tracts of ‘Gros Michel’ plantations in South America and Africa, but the cultivar survived in Thailand. 
After the banana catastrophe, South American and African plantations switched to the resistant Cavendish banana subgroup (another Musa acuminata AAA). The clone ‘Dwarf Cavendish’, today’s food banana in the west, has a different flavour, a different morphology (‘Gros Michel’ is slimmer), and unlike ‘Gros Michel,’ they do not turn fully yellow in tropical lowlands. A ‘Gros Michel’ can reach 7 m tall, while a ‘Dwarf Cavendish’ only reaches about 2 m. A Malaysian variety within the Cavendish subgroup sometimes found in Thailand is ‘Gluay hom kiao’.
The original 'Gros Michel' variety is a top export for producing countries in Malaysia and Thailand, with the grade A bananas being exported to Japan, and increasingly to China.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The Honduras Foundation for Agricultural Research cultivates several varieties of the Gros Michel.  They have succeeded in producing a few seeds by hand-pollinating the flowers with pollen from diploid, seeded bananas.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF9/977.html|title=Battling for Bananas|accessdate=2008-06-02|publisher=Alaska Science Forum|year=1990|author=Carla Helfferich[/tpl]
