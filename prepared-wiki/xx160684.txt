[[February 31]]

CATEGORIES: Placeholder names, February

February 31, with regard to the modern Western (revised Gregorian) calendar, is an imaginary date. It is sometimes used for example purposes, to make it clear regardless of context that the information being presented is artificial and not real data.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://feb31.com|title=You are invited...| work=Feb31.com| accessdate=2010-02-27[/tpl] February 30 is sometimes used in the same manner, although there are other calendars that legitimately use February 30.
In this respect, these "dates" are similar to other clearly fictional data used for a similar purpose, such as the 12th of Never or "John Q. Public".
