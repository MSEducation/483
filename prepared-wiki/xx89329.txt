Kvik Halden FK is a Norwegian Football club, founded on 19 June 1906.
The club plays in the Norwegian Second Division from 2011. In 2010 it contested a playoff to win promotion, and succeeded by beating Eik-Tønsberg 5–1 on aggregate.
In 1997, a merger between the two Halden-based clubs FK Kvik and Halden FK resulted in the formation of Kvik Halden FK. Long before the merger, FK Kvik was informally known as Kvik Halden anyway, to avoid confusion with the other FK Kvik from Trondheim. FK Kvik was the older and better of the two, but Halden FK had a rather large base of young players. The merger was controversial, and has been criticized by some who claim that the result of the merger was that FK Kvik simply took over Halden FK.
Kvik Halden's only claim to fame came in 1918, when the club (then FK Kvik) won the Norwegian Cup, beating SK Brann in the final. FK Kvik played two other Cup Finals, in 1915 and 1922, but lost both, both times to Odd Grenland. 
After World War II the team has never played in the highest football division. Prior to World War II, Kvik had several players on the national team and was in the very top of Norwegian football.
