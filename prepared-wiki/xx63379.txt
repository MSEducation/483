[[Biosystems engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Biological engineering, Health sciences

The case in EUROPE:
Biosystems Engineering is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological, environmental and agricultural sciences. It represents an evolution of the Agricultural Engineering discipline applied to all living organisms not including biomedical applications. Therefore, Biosystems Engineering is â€˜the branch of engineering that applies engineering sciences to solve problems involving biological systems (according to Erabee Network)
The case in USA:
Biosystems Engineering (see also Biological Systems Engineering) is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological, environmental and agricultural sciences. It represents an evolution of the Agricultural Engineering discipline applied to all living organisms (but generally not including biomedical applications, which is the realm of biomedical engineering).
In many institutions in USA, Biosystems Engineering is synonymous with Biological Engineering.  In some institutions, Biosystems Engineering is considered a broader term which includes Biological Engineering and Agricultural Engineering also and Agricultural Engineering).
Typical programmatic areas include: production of bioenergy; development of biosensors; environmental and ecological engineering; controlled-environment agriculture; food processing and food safety; agricultural engineering (machinery, irrigation, storage), water quality, water quantity, and water recycle (including measurements of pathogens, chemicals, and other contaminants).
