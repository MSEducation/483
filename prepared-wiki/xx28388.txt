Kalgoorlie, now known as Kalgoorlie-Boulder after Kalgoorlie and Boulder joined, is a city in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia, Australia, and is located [tpl]convert|595|km|mi|0[/tpl] east-northeast of Perth at the end of the Great Eastern Highway. The town was founded in 1893 during the Yilgarn-Goldfields gold rush, and is located close to the so-called "Golden Mile".
According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 31,107,[tpl]Census 2006 AUS|id=5080|name=Kalgoorlie/Boulder (WA) (Statistical District)|accessdate=2 April 2008|quick=on[/tpl] making it the largest urban centre in the Goldfields-Esperance region and the fifth-largest in Western Australia.
The name Kalgoorlie is derived from the Wangai word Karlkurla, meaning "place of the silky pears".[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

==History==

In January 1893, prospectors Patrick (Paddy) Hannan, Tom Flanagan, and Dan O'Shea were travelling to Mount Youle when one of their horses cast a shoe. During the halt in their journey, the men noticed signs of gold in the area, and decided to stay put. On 17 June 1893, Hannan filed a Reward Claim, leading to hundreds of men swarming to the area in search of gold and Kalgoorlie, originally called Hannan's, was born.Raymond Radclyffe, Wealth and Wildcats, Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian (1898, reprinted 2004), p.15.
The population of the town was 2,018 (1516 males and 502 females) in 1898.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33153441 |title=Population of Western Australia |newspaper=Western Mail |location=Perth, Western Australia |date=22 April 1898 |accessdate=28 May 2012 |page=23 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The mining of gold, along with other metals such as nickel, has been a major industry in Kalgoorlie ever since, and today employs about one-quarter of Kalgoorlie's workforce and generates a significant proportion of its income. The concentrated area of large gold mines surrounding the original Hannan find is often referred to as the Golden Mile, and is considered by some to be the richest square mile of earth on the planet. The town's population was about 30,000 people in 1903 and began to grow into nearby Boulder.
In 1901 the population of Kalgoorlie was 4,793 (3087 males and 1706 females) which increased to 6,790 (3904 males and 2886 females).[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32674332 |title=West Australia|newspaper=Kalgoorlie Western Argus |location=Western Australia |date=9 June 1903 |accessdate=27 March 2014 |page=32 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The narrow gauge Government railway line reached Kalgoorlie in 1896, and the main named railway service from Perth was the overnight sleeper train The Westland which ran until the 1970s. In 1917, a standard gauge railway line was completed, connecting Kalgoorlie to the city of Port Augusta, South Australia across [tpl]convert|2000|km|mi|0[/tpl] of desert, and consequently the rest of the eastern states. The standardisation of the railway connecting Perth (which changed route from the narrow gauge route) in 1968 completed the Sydney-Perth railway, making it possible for rail travel from Perth to Sydney—and the Indian Pacific rail service commenced soon after. During the 1890s, the Goldfields area boomed as a whole, with an area population exceeding 200,000, mainly prospectors. The area gained a notorious reputation for being a wild west with bandits and prostitutes. This rapid increase in population and claims of neglect by the state government in Perth led to the proposition of the new state of Auralia but with the sudden diaspora after the Gold Rush these plans fell through.
Places, famous or infamous, that Kalgoorlie is noted for include its water pipeline, designed by C. Y. O'Connor and bringing in fresh water from Mundaring Weir near Perth, its Hay Street brothels, its two-up school, the goldfields railway loopline, the Kalgoorlie Town Hall, the Paddy Hannan statue/drinking fountain, the Super Pit and Mount Charlotte lookout. Its main street is Hannan Street, named after the town's founder. One of the infamous brothels also serves as a museum and is a major national attraction.
Kalgoorlie and the surrounding district was serviced by an extensive collection of suburban railways and tramways, providing for both passenger and freight traffic.Railways and roads of Kalgoorlie Singleton, C.C. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March/April 1954 pp33-36/40-44

==Mining==

Since 1992, Kalgoorlie has been home to the Diggers & Dealers conference, held annually in August. It is Australia's premier international mining conference.Diggers and Dealers 2010 – The Song Remains The Same ABC Rural, author: Babs McHugh , published: 2 August 2010, accessed: 26 October 2010
It is also home to the Australian Prospectors & Miners' Hall of Fame.

===The Super Pit===

The Super Pit is an open-cut gold mine approximately [tpl]convert|3.6|km|mi|1[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|1.6|km|mi|1[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|512|m|ft|0[/tpl] deep.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www1.superpit.com.au/pages/faqs.asp|author=Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines|title= The Super Pit – Frequently Asked Questions|year=2007|accessdate=2 April 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080312123226/http://www1.superpit.com.au/pages/faqs.asp  |archivedate = 12 March 2008[/tpl] It was created by Alan Bond, who bought up a number of old mine leases in order to get the land area needed for the Super Pit. Every now and again the digging reveals an old shaft containing abandoned equipment and vehicles from the earlier mines.
The mine operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and a visitor centre overlooks it. The mine blasts at 1:00 pm every day, unless winds would carry dust over the town. Each of the massive trucks carries 225 tonnes of rock and the round trip takes about 35 minutes, most of that time being the slow uphill haul. Employees must live in Kalgoorlie; it is not a fly-in fly-out operation. The mine is expected to be productive until about 2029.

Known as the home of the Super Pit, it is one of Kalgoorlie-Boulder's historical suburbs featuring many buildings and landmarks dating as far back as 1882. It was once the central business district for the Town of Boulder, but since amalgamation with Kalgoorlie, it is now more of a historical local centre. Boulder has its own post office, town hall and many hotels along its main thoroughfare, Burt Street. A significant refurbishment has been commenced as part of the 'Royalties for Regions' initiative.
A new housing suburb located next to the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport which was recently expanded and is enjoying healthy growth in property values.
This area derives its name from the golf course that once occupied the area. It was released to provide affordable property to a growing population in Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Fairways features a private primary school, church, caravan park and small business.
Adeline was originally constructed around 1970 by the State Housing Commission. The suburb was built on the "Radburn" concept, with houses facing away from the street and common pathways linking homes. The area has been plagued by antisocial problems. In 2003, a significant urban renewal project, including the renaming of the suburb to Golden Grove and re-aligning of homes was commenced. The project has seen some success but has yet to fully eliminate antisocial problems within the area.[tpl]Cite news|work=Department of Housing and Works|title=Launch of the new Golden Grove project, Kalgoorlie |url=http://www.dhw.wa.gov.au/news/news_mr_auto.cfm?item=337 |accessdate=17 February 2008|date=5 March 2003[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

Located in Kalgoorlie's far north. Hannans was the first suburb to have its own independent shopping centre ("Hannans Boulevard") which includes a Coles Supermarket. The area also has a primary school and an 18 hole golf course. The original course was not formally grassed but was recently refurbished.
