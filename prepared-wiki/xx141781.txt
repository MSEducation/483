==History==

CKOM began broadcasting at 1340 kHz on June 8, 1951 with an output of 250 watts and its offices were based out of the historic Empire Hotel. By 1960, it has increased its strength to 10,000 watts and was broadcasting full time at a frequency of 1250 kHz.
In 1985, the channel was sold to Rawlco Communications and changed frequencies to 650 kHz. The station was programmed in a Hot Hits/Top 40 format.Decision CRTC 85-127
In 1998, the station switched to a news/talk format.  The station was branded as 'NTR', and for a brief period of time changed its callsign to CINT before returning to the original callsign CKOM.  During this time, the CKOM callsign belonged to the FM station at 102.1 now known as Rock 102 FM.
In September 2006, the station changed its on-air brand to become 'News Talk 650'.
CKOM is part of a two station network along with CJME in Regina.  The two stations broadcast an identical program schedule, with the exception of local morning shows and some weekend programming.
In late 2008, the station added the CKOM call letters back to its on-air brand, becoming known as 'News Talk 650 CKOM'.
