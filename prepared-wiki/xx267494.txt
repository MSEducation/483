"Weak" is a song by English singer-songwriter Melanie C from her fifth studio album The Sea. It was released as the second single from the album on 6 November 2011. The song was written by Chisholm, Ina Wroldsen and Jez Ashurt and produced by Andy Chatterley.

==Background and composition==

"Weak" was a contrast from the previous dance-pop single "Think About It". "Weak" was described a stirring pop ballad that emotionally covered the range of emotions faced when you break up with a loved one. Reviews of the single were positive, "Entertainment Focus" stated "Weak is one of the highlights from The Sea and finds Melanie on fine vocal form. A slow-building beat backs Melanie’s distinctive vocals as she sings about being too weak to leave a relationship that is no good for her. The bridge is very powerful with Melanie’s vocals sending shivers down your spine as she lets rip".http://www.entertainment-focus.com/music-release/melanie-c-weak The single was placed on the BBC Radio 2 "A-list Radio Playlist". Melanie C performed the song on The Sea – Live tour.
