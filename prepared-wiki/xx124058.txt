==History==

The history of ICC-La Salle dates back to the establishment of a parochial school within the responsibility of the Parish of the Immaculate Conception, which was established in 1789.  The school was established by the Recollect parish priest, Fr. Constancio Arsenio, with the first classes being the Cartilla, the Misterio, the Trisagio'', and the Novena.
In 1929, as the Jesuit priests replaced the Recollects, Fr. Gabriel Font SJ formally established the Immaculate Conception School.  Its first teachers were Mr. Juan Fuentes and his sister, Cirila and thirty students registered.  In 1935, the government officially recognized the school's elementary program.
In 1939, the priests of the Society of St. Columban took over the administration from the Jesuits.  Fr. Peter Fallon became the first Director of the Immaculate Conception School and that year witnessed the first graduation.
In 1941, the Columban Sisters were invited by Bishop James Hayes and the Columban Fathers to administer the school.  The sisters then opened the high school department. However, World War II broke out and classes had to be discontinued and the old convent, which was used as a school building was converted into a Japanese headquarters.
After the war, classes were resumed and enrollment increased.  For the first time, lay faculty members were employed and more Columban Sisters arrived.  In 1948, the High School Department held its first Commencement Exercises and in June of that year, Mother Mary Theopane opened the college department with an enrollment of eighteen students.
In 1987, at the request of the Columban Sisters, Most Rev. Federico Escaler, S.J., D.D. became the President of Immaculate Conception College.  In 1990, the De La Salle Brothers agreed to assist in the academic supervision of the school with Br. Martin Simpson FSC, as consultant.  He was named President in 1993.

===Turnover to the De La Salle Brothers===

On May 17, 1994, the Columban Sisters formally turned over the College to the De La Salle Brothers.  Dr. Emma Villaseran served as the acting President until March 31, 1995 under Br. Benildo Feliciano FSC, who was Chairman of the Board of Trustees. On April 1, 1995, Dr. Villaseran, assumed the position as President.
In 1995 the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) accredited the College and was designated by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education in Region X.History of ICC-La Salle
