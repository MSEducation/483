[[Anatopia]]

CATEGORIES: Squats, Activism

Anatopia was a land squat in Papenburg, Germany. The site was squatted July 4 1991 and evicted January 7 1995 after a long struggle. It was on a location where the Daimler-Benz automobile company (Mercedes-Benz) intended to build a test track (12 km long, 3 km wide) and became the focus of anti-Mercedes protests throughout Germany. The squatters lived a vegan lifestyle, eating communally every night.http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no5/world_mercedes.htm Anatopia article from Do or Die magazine
