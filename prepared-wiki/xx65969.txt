==Background==

In 1999, the Hong Kong government announced the intention to develop the Cyberport which would help local businesses capitalize on the rapid growth of the Internet. Cyberport was intended as a place where the development of information technology and multimedia would be nurtured so that the demands of these industries could be met in the future. It was also hoped that this development would help the HKSAR's economy rebound after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Three private and wholly owned companies, namely, Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings Limited, Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited and Hong Kong Cyberport (Ancillary Development) Limited (collectively referred to as the “Cyberport Companies”) have been set up under the Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) to oversee the implementation of the project.
The Cyberport also houses one incubation facility for ICT startups called Entrepreneurship Centre providing office space, financial aid package,training, micro fund and network access to the investment community. Incubatees and micro fund grantees have varied degrees of success.
