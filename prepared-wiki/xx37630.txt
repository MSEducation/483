The [tpl]nihongo|Japanese Cultural Festival|文化祭|bunkasai[/tpl] is an annual event held by most schools in Japan, from Nursery schools to universities at which their students display their artistic achievements.[tpl]cite book|last=Rohlen|first=Thomas P.|title=Japan's High Schools|publisher=University of California Press|year=1983|pages=162|isbn=978-0-520-04863-8|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=8Pqcd4qFAZ4C&pg=PA162|accessdate=2009-01-28[/tpl] People who want to enter the school themselves or who are interested in the school may come to see what the schoolwork and atmosphere are like. Parents may also want to see what kind of work their children have been doing. The festivals are usually open to the public, especially at high schools and universities.

==Definition==

According to the curriculum guidelines of the Ministry of Education, cultural festivals are part of special activities and are defined as "events which aim to use the results of everyday learning to heighten motivation".[tpl]ja icon[/tpl]小学校学習指導要領 第4章 特別活動(Curriculum guideline of Elementary School Chapter 4: Special activity)[tpl]ja icon[/tpl]中学校学習指導要領 第4章 特別活動(Curriculum guideline of Lower Secondary School Chapter 4: Special activity)[tpl]ja icon[/tpl]高等学校学習指導要領　第4章　特別活動(Curriculum guideline of High school Chapter 4: Special activity)
The Cultural Festivals are parts of regular lessons in elementary schools, junior high schools and high schools, so the students are obligated to attend for graduation. In universities, the cultural festivals are placed as extracurricular activity, so attendance is not required.
Traditionally, most schools hold Bunkasai on or around Culture Day (November 3), a national holiday.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/japanese/school.html | title=School life  学校生活 | work=A Taste of Languages at School (ATLAS) | publisher=University College London | accessdate=2011-11-02[/tpl] Normally it is held on a Saturday or Sunday sometimes even both.

==Name==

"The Cultural Festival" (Bunkasai) and "The University Festival" (Daigaku-sai) are common nouns in Japanese, so particular names of cultural festivals depend on each school. For example, the festival at the University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus is named Komaba-sai.

The Cultural Festivals of junior high schools and high schools are sometimes named differently:

==Function==

Festivals are held to display the students' learning, but many people visit a festival as a recreational diversion. Alumni often take the opportunity to visit schools they once attended. Food is served, and often classrooms or gymnasiums are transformed into temporary restaurants or cafés.  Dances, concerts and plays may be performed by individual volunteers or by various school clubs, such as the dance club, the orchestra club, the band club and the drama club.
The Cultural Festivals are intended to be a fun event, but it is also the only opportunity each year for students to see what life is like in other schools.  It is also intended to enrich people's lives by increasing social interaction and fostering community ties.
Cultural festivals are frequently depicted in anime and manga.
