An accurate death toll has never been determined because local records were destroyed in the fire. Between 1,200 and 2,500 people are thought to have lost their lives.

The fire jumped across the Peshtigo River and burned on both sides of the inlet town.[tpl]cite web | last = Hipke | first = Deana C. | title = The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871 | url = http://www.peshtigofire.info/gallery/burntmap.htm | accessdate = 2013-01-26[/tpl] Survivors reported that the firestorm generated a fire whirl (described as a tornado) that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water.  Some drowned while others succumbed to hypothermia in the frigid river. The Green Island Light was kept lit during the day because of the obscuring smoke, but the three-masted schooner George L. Newman was wrecked offshore; the crew was rescued without loss.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/michigan/green-island/keepers.htm|title=Green Island Lighthouse|publisher=Terry Pepper|accessdate=2010-11-26[/tpl]
The fire was so intense it jumped several miles over the waters of Green Bay and burned parts of the Door Peninsula. In Robinsonville (now Champion) on the Door Peninsula, Sister Adele Brise and other nuns, farmers, and families fled to a local chapel for protection. There they participated in prayers and devotions to the Virgin Mary. Although the chapel was surrounded by flames, it survived."Shrine escaped devastation of Peshtigo Fire", The Compass, February 17, 2011.

==Comet theory==

One speculation, first suggested in 1883, is that the occurrence of the Peshtigo and Chicago fires on the same day was not just a coincidence, but that all the major fires that occurred in Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin on that day were caused by the impact of fragments from Comet Biela. This theory was revived in a 1985 book[tpl]cite book | title=Mrs. O'Leary's Comet: Cosmic Causes of the Great Chicago Fire | publisher=Academy Chicago Publishers | author=Waskin, Mel | year=1985 | isbn=0897331818[/tpl] and investigated in a 2004 paper to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.[tpl]cite web | url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMPDC04_865/PV2004_1419.pdf | title=Did Biela’s Comet Cause The Chicago And Midwest Fires? | publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics | year=2004 | accessdate=May 31, 2012 | author=Wood, Robert M. | format=PDF[/tpl] Scientists with expertise in the area argue that meteorites cannot ignite a fire as they are cold to the touch when they reach the Earth's surface, and there are no credible reports of any fire anywhere having been started by a meteorite.[ref]
