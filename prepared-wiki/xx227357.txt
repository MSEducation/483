After Aussiecon Two in Melbourne, Australia, was selected as the World Science Fiction Convention to be held in 1985, the WSFS Business Meeting directed that a written ballot election be held to select a NASFiC site for that year. In a three-way race, Austin (393 votes) easily bested Detroit, Michigan (132 votes) and Columbus, Ohio (69 votes) as well as a single write-in vote for Highmore, South Dakota.[tpl]cite web |first=George |last=Flynn |publisher=NESFA |title=NASFiC Site Selection |url=http://www.nesfa.org/fanzines/NASFICVotingAddendum.html |accessdate=September 25, 2009[/tpl]
