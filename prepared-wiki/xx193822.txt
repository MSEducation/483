William "Billy" Grimshaw (30 April 1892 in Burnley - 1968) was a footballer who played as an outside right in The Football League in the 1910s and 1920s.[tpl]Cite book |title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939 |first=Michael |last=Joyce |publisher=Soccerdata |year=2004 |isbn=1-899468-67-6 [/tpl]
Grimshaw began his career with his hometown club Burnley but was unable to force his way into the side and was released. He had a spell playing non-league football at Colne before signing for Bradford City in 1913, remaining with the side up until the outbreak of the First World War. 
At the end of the war in 1919 he joined Cardiff City and played in their first ever season in the Football League during the 1920â€“21 season. 
He scored one of Cardiff's goals on the day of their first ever Football League victory, a 3-0 win over Stockport County on 4 September 1920.[tpl]cite web|title=The Roaring Twenties|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1920-1947-724302.aspx|publisher=Cardiff City Official Site|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=17 November 2004[/tpl] Following the arrival of Jimmy Gill in 1920 he was moved to outside right and was a virtual ever present for the next three years before losing his place to Denis Lawson. 
He was sold to Sunderland, making 70 appearances for the club before retiring and becoming a licensee in Bradford.
