[[Little Sisters]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of the British Virgin Islands

The Little Sisters is an informal name for a group of some of the smaller islands of the British Virgin Islands, south of Tortola and southwest of Virgin Gorda. These islands are also called the Southern Islands.
Also included in the group are several smaller rocky outcroppings.
The closest thing to a formal endorsement of the term occurs in the Labour Code, 2010Statute No 4 of 2010 (a British Virgin Islands statute) which includes a reference and statutory definition for the "Sister Islands", which the Code defines as meaning 'the islands of the Virgin Islands other than Tortola'.The definition appears in section 3.  The only time the term is used in section 70, which exempts employees on other islands from needing a doctor's certificate to validate a sick day.
