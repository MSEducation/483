Born in Amsterdam, North-Holland, Witschge started his professional career with local AFC Ajax, being an undisputed starter at the age of 20 and a crucial element of the team that won the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup. During three seasons, he shared teams with his sibling Richard.
Witschge joined French side AS Saint-Étienne in July 1989 but, unsettled, returned home in January 1991 with Feyenoord, helping the Rotterdam side win three Dutch Cups, one Supercup and the 1992–93 Eredivisie.
After one weak final year with Feyenoord – 13 games, no goals – the 30-year-old moved to FC Utrecht, retiring in 1999 after one season with Saudi Arabia's Ittihad FC. In 2001 Witschge took up coaching, being named assistant of Marco van Basten and John van 't Schip at the national team in 2004.
