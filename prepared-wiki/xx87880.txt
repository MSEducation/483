According to the Hebrew Bible, Keturah or Ketura ([tpl]Hebrew Name|קְטוּרָה|Ktura|Qəṭûrā|"Incense"[/tpl]) was the woman whom Abraham, the patriarch of the Ishmaelites and Israelites, married after the death of his wife, Sarah. Keturah bore Abraham six sons, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.[tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|25:1-6|HE[/tpl]  The spelling of the sons' names varies as can be seen in 1st century CE Historian Flavius Josephus, who mentions Keturah and her sons in Antiquities of the Jews 1.238.
Keturah is referred to at different times as either Abraham's wife in Genesis 25:1[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025:1&version=KJV |title=Genesis 25:1 KJV - Then again Abraham took a wife, and her |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24[/tpl] or Abraham's concubine in 1 Chronicles 1:32.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%201:32&version=KJV |title=1 Chronicles 1:32 KJV - Now the sons of Keturah, Abraham's |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24[/tpl] While Abraham left everything to Isaac, he made grants to his sons by his concubine during his lifetime, and sent them east away from Isaac.Gen.25:5-6,NAB He died at the age of 175.[tpl]bibleverse||Gen|25:7|HE[/tpl] Keturah's six sons represent Arabian tribes south and east of Canaan.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Some, but not all, Jewish philosophers identify Keturah with Hagar, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death,"The Return of Hagar", commentary on Parshat Chayei Sarah, Chabad Lubavitch."Who Was Ketura?", Bar-Ilan University's Parashat Hashavua Study Center, 2003."Parshat Chayei Sarah", Torah Insights, Orthodox Union, 2002. and that Hagar's change of name to Keturah (a reference to incense used in worship) was symbolic of the pleasantness of her teshuvah (repentance) from her sinfulness during her exile.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=umq4Q47OfT8C&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=keturah+teshuvah&source=bl&ots=CWfSB3nKWd&sig=Mn0XfMUXx_Whe9eOeL4YXCxhBTI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2tm5T9rVIKiuiQLq8tiMBw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=keturah%20teshuvah&f=false | title="Sh'ma B'ni...": A Treasury of Stories and Lessons from the Weekly Parashah | author=Efrati, Binyamin | pages=25–26 | year=2005 | publisher=Feldheim Publishers | isbn=1-58330-807-5[/tpl]  This interpretation is set forth in the MidrashBereshit Rabbah 61:4. and is supported by Rashi,[tpl]cite book | author=Harris, Maurice | title=The Talmud Midrashim and Kabbala | publisher=M.

Adherents of the Bahá'í Faith believe their founder, Bahá'u'lláh, to have been a descendant of both Keturah and Sarah.[tpl]cite book |last=Hatcher |first=W.S. |last2=Martin |first2=J.D. |year= 1998 |title=The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |page=131 |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, IL |isbn= 0-87743-264-3 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=IZmkG1ASirgC [/tpl]
In the eighteenth century, some writers believed that Keturah was the ancestor of African peoples, thereby explaining the similarities between some African and Jewish customs.  Olaudah Equiano cites John Gill's claim to this effect in his Interesting Narrative.The interesting narrative and other writings, Olaudah Equiano (selected by Vincent Carretta), p. 44
Reb Yakov Leib HaKohain states (as part of Donmeh West teaching) that the children of Keturah moved Eastwards and were ancestors to the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Shinto, which then should be counted as Abrahamic religions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.donmeh-west.com/razriel.shtml |title="Commentary on Rabbi Azriel of Gerona's 12th Century |publisher=Donmeh West |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24[/tpl]
