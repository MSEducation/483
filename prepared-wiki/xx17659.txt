==Geographical distribution==

The current coelacanth range remains primarily around the eastern African coast, although the Latimeria menadoensis was discovered off the coast of Indonesia. Coelacanths have been found in the waters of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Comoros, and Indonesia. Most Latimeria chalumnae specimens that have been caught have been captured around the islands of Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros Archipelago, Indian Ocean. Though there have been cases of L. chalumnae being caught elsewhere, amino acid sequencing has shown there is no big difference between these exceptions and the ones found around Comore and Anjouan. Even though these few may be considered strays, there have been several reports of coelacanths being caught off of the coast of Madagascar. This leads scientists to believe that the endemic range of Latimeria chalumnae coelacanths stretches down the eastern coast of Africa from the Comoros Islands, past the western coast of Madagascar, to the South African coastline. The geographical range of the Indonesia coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis, is believed to be off the coast of Manado Tua Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia in the Celebes Sea. The key components that keep coelacanths in these areas are food and temperature restrictions.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1988NW.....75..149F |title=Habitat requirements of the living coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae at grande comore, Indian Ocean |last1=Fricke |first1=H. |last2=Plante |first2=R. |volume=75 |year=1988 |pages=149–51 |journal=Naturwissenschaften |doi=10.1007/BF00405310 |issue=3[/tpl]

==Ecology==

During the daytime, coelacanths rest in caves anywhere from 100 to 500 meters deep while others migrate to deeper waters. By resting in cooler waters (below 120 meters) during the daytime, coelacanths reduce metabolic costs. By drifting toward reefs and feeding at night, they save vital energy. Staying in caves during the day also saves energy because they do not have to waste energy fighting the currents.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02028843 |title=Coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae aggregates in caves: First observations on their resting habitat and social behavior |year=1991 |last1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Schauer |first2=Jürgen |last3=Hissmann |first3=Karen |last4=Kasang |first4=Lutz |last5=Plante |first5=Raphael |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=281–6[/tpl]
Because coelacanths hide in caves during the daytime, the Anjouan island and Grande Comore provide ideal habitats for them. The steeply eroded underwater volcanic slopes covered in sand also house an obscure system of caves and crevices, allowing the coelacanths a place to stay during the daylight hours. These crevices support a large benthic fish population that can sustain coelacanth populations.
Coelacanths are nocturnal piscivores who feed mainly on benthic fish populations. By floating along the lava cliffs, presumably, they feed on whatever fish they encounter.
Coelacanths are fairly peaceful creatures when dealing with other coelacanths. They remain calm, even while in a crowded cave. They do avoid body contact, however, withdrawing immediately if contact is made with another coelacanth. When approached by foreign, potential predators (e.g. a submersible), they react with panic flight reactions. Coelacanths are most likely prey to large deep-water predators. Shark bite marks have been seen on coelacanths and sharks are very common in areas inhabited by coelacanths. Electrophoresis testing of 14 coelacanth enzymes has shown that there is little genetic diversity between coelacanth populations. Among the fish that have been caught, there have been about equal numbers of males and females. Population estimates range from 210 individuals per population, all the way to 500 individuals per population.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.97060.x |jstor=2387536 |title=Population Monitoring of the Coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) |year=2008 |last1=Hissmann |first1=Karen |last2=Fricke |first2=Hans |last3=Schauer |first3=Jürgen |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=759–65[/tpl] Because coelacanths have individual color markings, scientists think that coelacanths are able to recognize other coelacanths via electric communication.

==Life history==

Coelacanths are ovoviviparous, meaning that the mother retains the eggs within her body while the embryos develop within them, with a gestation period of more than a year. Typically, the females are larger than the males, and their scales and folds of skin around the cloaca differ. The male coelacanth does not have distinct copulatory organs, just a cloaca. The cloaca has a urogential papilla that is surrounded by erectile caruncles[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]. It is hypothesized that the cloaca turns itself inside out to serve as a copulatory organ. The eggs of the coelacanth are very large and have only a thin layer of membrane protecting them. The embryos hatch within the mother and eventually the mother gives live birth. Young coelacanths look very similar to adult coelacanths. The main differences include an external yolk sac, larger eyes relative to their body size, and a more pronounced downward slope of the body. The yolk sac of the juvenile coelacanth is broad and comes out from below the pelvic fins. The scales and the fins of the juvenile coelacanth are completely matured. The young coelacanth does lack odontodes, which it gains during maturation.

==Conservation==

Because little is known about the coelacanth, the conservation status is difficult to characterize. According to Fricke et al. (1995), there should be some stress put on the importance of conserving this species. From 1988 to 1994, Fricke counted some 60 individuals on each dive. In 1995 that number dropped to 40. Even though this could be a result of natural population fluctuation, it also could be a result of overfishing. Coelacanths usually are caught when local fishermen are fishing for oilfish. Fishermen sometimes snag a coelacanth instead of an oilfish because they traditionally fish at night, when oilfish (and coelacanths) feed. Before scientists became interested in coelacanths, they were thrown back into the water if caught. Now that there is an interest in them, fishermen trade them in to scientists or other officials once they have been caught. Before the 1980s, this was a problem for coelacanth populations. In the 1980s, international aid gave fiberglass boats to the local fishermen, which resulted in fishing out of coelacanth territories into more fish-productive waters. Since then, most of the motors on the boats have broken down so the local fishermen are now back in the coelacanth territory, putting the species at risk again.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=1995Natur.374..314F |title=Yet more danger for coelacanths |last1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Hissmann |first2=Karen |last3=Schauer |first3=Jürgen |last4=Plante |first4=Raphael |volume=374 |year=1995 |pages=314–5 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/374314a0 |pmid=7885468 |issue=6520[/tpl]
Different methods to minimize the number of coelacanths caught include moving fishers away from the shore, using different laxatives and malarial salves to reduce the quantity of oilfish needed, using coelacanth models to simulate live specimens, and increasing awareness of the need to protect the species. In 1987 the Coelacanth Conservation Council was established to help protect and encourage population growth of coelacanths.
In 2002, the South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme was launched to help further the studies and conservation of the coelacanth. The South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme focuses on biodiversity conservation, evolutionary biology, capacity building, and public understanding. The South African government committed to spending R10 million on the program.[tpl]cite press release |title=South Africa announces plans for Coelacanth Programme |publisher=Science in Africa |date=February 2002 |url=http://scienceinafrica.com/south-africa-announces-plans-coelacanth-programme |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme |publisher=African Conservation Foundation |url=http://www.wildnetafrica.org/explorer/item/south-african-coelacanth-conservation-and-genome-resource-programme?category_id=2545[/tpl]

==Human consumption==

Coelacanths are considered a poor source of food for humans and likely most other fish-eating animals. Coelacanth flesh has high amounts of oil, urea, wax esters, and other compounds that are difficult to digest and can cause diarrhea. Where the coelacanth is more common, local fishermen avoid it because of its potential to sicken consumers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3029/know-any-good-recipes-for-endangered-prehistoric-fish-plus |title=Know any good recipes for endangered prehistoric fish?
