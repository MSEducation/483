Pierre Célor (1902, Tulle, Corrèze - 1957) was a member of the French Communist Party from 1923, becoming one of the four secretaries of its Central Committee in 1929, beside Maurice Thorez and Henri Barbé.  However, he fell into disgrace after the Comintern and in 1942 he joined the Parti populaire français (PPF) of Jacques Doriot.
