Thlaspi arvense (common name field penny-cress) is a foetid Eurasian plant having round flat pods; naturalized throughout North America. It is also related to the Lepidium species in the cabbage family.

==Edible uses==

The field pennycress has a bitter taste; it is usually parboiled to remove the bitter taste. This is mostly used in salads, sometimes in sandwich spreads. It is said to have a distinctive flavour.

==Use as a source of biodiesel==

Pennycress is being developed as an oilseed crop for production of renewable fuels.Arvegenix LLC websitehttp://www.Arvegenix.com/pennycress-products.htmlField pennycress shows feedstock potentialhttp://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/4520/field-pennycress-shows-feedstock-potential/ The species can be planted in the fall, will germinate and form a vegetative mass which can overwinter. In the spring, the oil-rich seed can be harvested and used as a biodiesel feedstock. 

==Research==

Pennycress is related to the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Researchers have begun studying the genetics of pennycress in order to improve its potential use as a biofuel crop. For example, the transcriptome of pennycress has been sequenced. De novo assembly of the pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) transcriptome provides tools for the development of a winter cover crop and biodiesel feedstock.
