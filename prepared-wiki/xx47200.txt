==History==

Seeking a domestic aircraft manufacturer, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940sRishikesha T. Krishnan. "Where core competence soars". Businessline. Chennai: October 1, 2003. p. 1 and '50s,OECD Territorial Reviews Madrid, Spain. p. 157/264 OECD Publishing. 2007. but it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.Timeline Embraer Historical Center (Official site)
The company's first product was a turboprop transport, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.

===Early growth===

The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing license production contracts.Embraer history Embraer Historical Center (Official site)  The company increased its product line; it sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] by 1985 a regional airliner had debuted, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.The Embraer EMB120 Brasilia airliners.net Aimed at the export market, this plane marked the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.

===License-built Pipers===

In 1974 the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.Aircraft History: EMB 710 Carioca Embraer History Center Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil & Latin America.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]  But by 1978 most of the parts and components were being sourced locally. Between 1974 and 2000 nearly 2500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.

===Privatization===

Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning, Embraer began a privatization process alongside many other state-controlled companies during the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso.[ref]Brazil on Road Peddling State-Owned Enterprises; Edition

This privatization effort saw Embraer sold on December 7, 1994,Scielo: Os efeitos da privatização sobre o desempenho econômico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas (Portuguese) and helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy. The company continued to win government contracts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

===Product line expansion: military, regional & executive===

In the mid-1990s the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes than the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing. Larger regional airliners with 70-110 seats and smaller business jets soon followed. Today the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.

====Military transport====

On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work actually began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force."Portugal interested in Brazilian military cargo plane". BBC Monitoring European, February 1, 2010.

===Government subsidy controversy===

Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization decided Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999-2000, and that Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
