==History==

The music video for the "Lawyers in Love" took the title phrase and created a series of visual images surrounding it, especially themed on the Cold War.  Browne played at least two or three parts, one as a yuppie-ish lawyer and one as an ordinary man sitting in a catatonic state in front of a television, unable to assimilate the world's events.
Some analysts[tpl]Who|date=July 2010[/tpl] later saw "Lawyers in Love" as an evolving "bridge" between Browne's personal works and his 1980s political works. Others[tpl]Who|date=July 2010[/tpl] saw it as dry commentary on American social mores and somewhat of a scathing critique of the conservativism and materialism of the Ronald Reagan era, something that had been present in Browne's work as far back as "Take It Easy".
Christopher Connelly, in reviewing the album for Rolling Stone in 1983, paid extra attention to the title track, writing that "in 'Lawyers in Love,' God's interplanetary travelers discover Americans 'waiting for World War III,' shoveling down fast food in front of the television. All told, it's an unusually whimsical lyric from a man not noted for his sense of humor." As for the music, Connelly called the song "Browne's headiest track to date: a solid keyboard-and-guitar attack flavored by a chanting falsetto figure, a church-organ swell, sha-la-la backup vocals, even an old-fashioned modulation out of the middle eight."Connelly, Christopher. Rolling Stone Review of Lawyers in Love. September 29, 1983.
"As probing (and hysterical) a dissection of cold-war politics in the Reagan era as the mainstream will allow," Jimmy Guterman wrote of the song in Rolling Stone in 1986.Guterman, Jimmy. Rolling Stone Review of Lives in the Balance. April 10, 1986. Accessed July 13, 2012.
