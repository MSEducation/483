==Name Change and Restructuring==

In October 2013, the association changed its name from NARM to the Music Business Association, also folding in digitalmusic.org, the association's web-based arm. According to the association's president, Jim Donio, the change was made because "more segments of the business than ever before now play an active role in the commerce side of the business, so the name ‘National Association of Recording Merchandisers’ no longer reflected everyone who can participate in the organization... for the first time in the organization’s history, the ‘M’ stands for music.”
Along with the name change, the association announced a new structure based around six sectors: Digital, Information Technology, Physical, Knowledge, Artists, Management, Touring, and Legal & Business Affairs. Each sector is represented by a pair of co-chairs and broken down further into Workgroups, each with its own chair or co-chairs. All Music Biz members and affiliate partners are allowed to participate in the Workgroups.[tpl]cite web|title=Sectors|url=http://musicbiz.org/sectors/|work=Music Business Association website|publisher=Music Business Association|accessdate=10 October 2013[/tpl] This structure was designed to allow members to focus on the areas that are most relevant to their business functions and needs.[tpl]cite web|last=Hollabaugh|first=Lorie|title=Name Change, Restructure for NARM and digitalmusic.org|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2013/10/name-change-restructure-for-narm-and-digitalmusic-org/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Musicrow+%28MusicRow%29|work=Music Row|publisher=Sherod Robertson|accessdate=10 October 2013[/tpl]
