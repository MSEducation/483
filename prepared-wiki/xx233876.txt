[[Characters of Parks and Recreation]]

CATEGORIES: Parks and Recreation characters, Lists of sitcom television characters, Lists of American television series characters

The primary characters of the American television comedy series Parks and Recreation are the employees of the parks department of Pawnee, a fictional Indiana town. The protagonist is Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy parks director as well as serving on city council, and the rest of the ensemble cast consists of her friends and co-workers, including nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), parks director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), and parks department employees Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), and Donna Meagle (Retta).
While most of the main cast have been with the series since it debuted in April 2009, actors Rob Lowe and Adam Scott joined the cast late in the second season portraying Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt, two state auditors who later take jobs in Pawnee. Paul Schneider was a permanent cast member during the first two seasons as city planner Mark Brendanawicz, but he departed at the end of season two. The majority of Parks and Recreation episodes are set in Pawnee, and most of the recurring and supporting characters are friends of the main characters or residents of the town.
Several guest stars have made appearances on the show, including Louis C.K., John Larroquette, Justin Theroux and Parker Posey. Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife, played his character's ex-wife Tammy Swanson, and Poehler's former husband Will Arnett made an appearance as a man on a blind date with Leslie. Several of Poehler's past colleagues on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live have appeared on Parks and Recreation, including Fred Armisen, Will Forte and Andy Samberg.

She always speaks in a deadpan and uninterested tone of voice, often making dry comments or mocking those around her, and expresses little interest in her job.[tpl]cite news |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |title=A walk in the 'Parks' with Amy Poehler |date=April 8, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/04/a-walk-in-the-parks-with-amy-poehler.html |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ujvATxue |archivedate=December 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Parks and Recreation, 'The Possum': Leslie's task force |date=March 12, 2010 |work=The Star-Ledger |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_the_possu.html |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xCkfxTKL |archivedate=March 15, 2011[/tpl] Nevertheless, she secretly has a deep appreciation for Leslie Knope.[tpl]cite news |last=Busis |first=Hillary |title='Parks and Recreation': I now pronounce you man and... wait, seriously? |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/04/15/parks-and-recreation-april-andy-wedding/ |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ze9bHkSd |archivedate=June 17, 2011[/tpl] In contrast to April's personality, her parents are extremely positive and enthusiastic people.[tpl]cite news |last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: They Got 93 Meetings But Ron Ain't Done |work=New York |date=April 30, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/parks_and_recreation_recap_93.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVRG1hkm |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Parks and Recreation, '94 Meetings': Ron Swanson's nightmare |work=The Star-Ledger |date=April 30, 2010 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/04/parks_and_recreation_94_meetin.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVRJ9aII |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl] At the start of the show, April was dating the bisexual Derek and, by extension, his boyfriend Ben.[tpl]cite news |last=Christianson |first=Emily |work=Los Angeles Times |title="Parks and Recreation": Worth a second look |date=September 18, 2009 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/09/parks-and-recreation-a-penguin-wedding-leads-to-gay-marriage-debate-in-pawnee.html |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBg900zo |archivedate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] They eventually broke up, and April harbored a crush on Andy Dwyer for most of the second season.[tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title='Parks and Recreation' - 'Freddy Spaghetti': The show must go wrong? |publisher=HitFix |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/parks-and-recreation-freddy-spaghetti-the-show-must-go-wrong |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zQLypbrx |archivedate=June 13, 2011[/tpl] They started dating in the third season and, after a very short period, were married during an impromptu ceremony in the episode "Andy and April's Fancy Party".

She is put in charge as the deputy director of the animal control part of Parks and Recreation.  With Ann's help, she applies and is accepted into veterinary school.

===Andy Dwyer===

Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) is a goofy and dim-witted but lovable slacker who works as a shoeshiner at Pawnee city hall, and later works for Leslie in the Parks Department. He was dating Ann at the start of the show and, prior to the events of the first episode, he falls into a construction pit and breaks both his legs. This inadvertently caused Ann to meet Leslie after Ann attends a city hall meeting to demand the pit be filled in. Ann broke up with Andy after learning he faked the severity of his injuries so she would pamper him. The unemployed and homeless Andy initially lives in the pit, but became more self-sufficient when Leslie gets him the shoeshiner job.[tpl]cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |work=The A.V.

Andy is the lead singer and guitarist for his band, Mouse Rat. Andy was originally only meant to appear in the first season, but the Parks and Recreation producers liked Chris Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make him a regular cast member.

===Ben Wyatt===

Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) is Leslie's husband. He joined the show in the penultimate second season episode "The Master Plan" as an Indiana state auditor, but eventually took a job at Pawnee working for Chris.  When he was 18, Ben was elected mayor of his Minnesota hometown, but was impeached after two months because he had no government experience and bankrupted the town.[tpl]cite news |last=VanDerWerff |first=Todd |title=Parks and Recreation: "The Master Plan" |work=The A.V.

At the start of the show, Ben contrasted Chris' cheery personality by bluntly describing the need for economic cuts in Pawnee, which caused conflicts between Leslie and Ben. While Ben never previously established roots in a town due to the constant traveling from his job, Ben gradually came to develop a love of Pawnee, which coincided with his developing romantic interest in Leslie herself. The two start dating in the episode "Road Trip", despite Chris' strict policy forbidding workplace romances. When he learns Leslie is running for office in the episode "I am Leslie Knope" they break up for fear of jeopardizing Leslie's chance of winning the election in the event they could get caught and create a scandal. However, they decide to get back together in "Smallest Park".

===Jerry Gergich===

Garry "Jerry"/"Larry" Gergich (Jim O'Heir) is a parks and recreation department employee who is regularly mocked and taunted by his fellow co-workers.

He is teased so badly that, after falling and dislocating his shoulder in the episode "Park Safety", he falsely claimed he was robbed just so his co-workers would not make fun of him.[tpl]cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: "Park Safety" |work=The A.V.

In an episode of season 4 during Leslie's trial for the relationship she had with Ben, Jerry reveals his real first name, Garry, while under oath. He then goes on to explain that he was accidentally called Jerry by a high-ranking employee of the city and thought it was rude to correct him. It was also revealed that he has a Leap Day birthday and is 64/16 years old. In contrast to his awkwardness at work, Jerry leads an idyllic family life with his gorgeous wife, Gayle (played by Christie Brinkley), and their children, as shown when he hosts a holiday party in the Season 5 episode "Ron and Diane". In season six, his coworkers take to permanently calling him Larry instead of Jerry. In a flash forward sequence in the season six finale, Jerry is shown working for Leslie at her new job three years in the future, with Leslie now calling him Terry.

When Leslie had everyone bring a potential date for single Ann Perkins to a Valentine's Day dance, April (who doesn't like Ann) brought Orin; Leslie proceeded to insult Orin and then told him she meant every word of it, before lambasting April for bringing someone that unpleasant and unlikable to a romantic dance. This marked the first time someone on the show directly let Orin know they didn't like him. When he applied for the job of Animal Control director in Season 5, his resume contained one word: his name, in regular font. Leslie told him to go away, and after April asked him what qualified him to work in animal control, and he responded, "I studied zoology in college. And I can control animals with my mind", to which Leslie tells him to leave.  He briefly appeared in the Season 6 episode 'Ann and Chris' dressed up as the Easter Bunny at Ann and Chris' going away party.

===Tammy Swanson (Tammy I)===

Tammy Swanson (Patricia Clarkson) is the first ex-wife of Ron Swanson. Ron has been married to two women named Tammy, and he hates both of them.  Ron explains that Tammy had been present throughout most of his young life: she delivered him as a baby, was his teacher, and she even took his virginity. Tammy returns as an IRS agent who arrives at the end of the third season (although she is not shown to the audience until the fourth season premiere) to audit Ron. Both Ron and his second wife named Tammy panic at the news of her arrival, and Ron attempts to flee before deciding to return to face her. Leslie then enlists Ron's eccentric mother (also named Tammy) in a drinking contest to drive Tammy I away once and for all. Since Tammy I's claim she was auditing Ron was a lie designed to let her search for his hidden gold, she ends up leaving with nothing, as Ron had deliberately put a tiny amount of gold out as a decoy, and was happy to sacrifice it in order to get rid of Tammy I.

===Tammy Swanson (Tammy II)===

Tammy Swanson (Megan Mullally) is the second ex-wife of Ron Swanson; Ron has been married to two women named Tammy, and he hates both of them. Tammy is a manipulative woman who uses sex as a weapon, and she constantly tries to make Ron miserable. However, the two maintain a strong sexual attraction to each other.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Ron and Tammy" Review |publisher=IGN |date=November 6, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/104/1042755p1.html |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBn3H7LM |archivedate=February 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Parks and Recreation, "Ron and Tammy": Megan Mullally guests |work=The Star-Ledger |date=November 5, 2009 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/11/parks_and_recreation_ron_and_t.html |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vv4jn0Kp |archivedate=January 22, 2011[/tpl]  Tammy is director of the Pawnee Library, which is widely considered a horrible place by Leslie Knope and the parks department employees. Tammy is introduced in "Ron and Tammy", when she approached Leslie in a friendly way under the guise that she wants to talk to Ron and work out her differences with him. Secretly, she was scheming for Ron to give her a lot Leslie wanted to turn into a park, so she can instead turn it into a library branch. Once she and Ron reconnected, the two fight loudly, but quickly began having sex and briefly reunited. Ron eventually realized he was being manipulated and, with Leslie's help, resisted Tammy's efforts. Tammy returns in "Ron & Tammy: Part Two", where she went on a date with Tom to make Ron jealous. Tammy and Ron ended up having a night of drunken sex and mayhem, which ended with the two of them getting re-married. However, when Tom tried to intervene and Tammy brutally beat him up, Ron remembered how horrible Tammy was and ended their marriage again.[tpl]cite news |last=Meslow |first=Scott |title='Parks and Recreation': Return of the Sex-Crazed Librarian Ex-Wife |work=The Atlantic |date=February 11, 2011 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2011/02/parks-and-recreation-return-of-the-sex-crazed-librarian-ex-wife/71096/ |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zUErlrt7 |archivedate=June 16, 2011[/tpl] Tammy briefly appeared in the third season finale, "Li'l Sebastian", where she and Ron learned together that Ron's first wife, "Tammy I", had arrived in town, which made Tammy flee in terror. In Season 5, Tammy turned up during "Ron and Diane" with plans to seduce Ron at the woodworking show where he was getting an award, leading to much pain for Leslie when she painfully made sure Tammy never got near Ron (Diane was wrongly more worried about Leslie's friendship with Ron than Tammy's behavior, and Tammy ended up locking Leslie in the trunk of her own car and taking off in it), but in the end it all worked out: Diane was aware Tammy was psychotic and said if the cops let her go she would happily pummel her, and Ron pressed charges against his criminal ex.
Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Michael Schur conceived the idea for "Ron and Tammy", and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea.

===Tamara Swanson (Tammy Zero)===

Tamara "Tammy" Swanson (Paula Pell) is Ron's mother. She shares many personality traits with both Tammy I and Tammy II and utterly dominates Ron when present.  She first appeared in the episode "Ron & Tammys". She lives on the farm Ron grew up on, and has an entire room devoted to guns.

===Wendy Haverford===

Wendy Haverford (Jama Williamson) started the season as the wife of Tom Haverford, although it is later revealed to be a green card marriage that amicably ends in a divorce. Wendy came to Pawnee from Ottawa, Canada and married Tom so she could remain in the country.[tpl]cite news |last=Fog |first=Henning |title="Parks and Recreation" recap: Dirty little secrets |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 9, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/09/parks-and-recreation-recap-dirty-little-secrets/ |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBjUksE7 |archivedate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] Introduced in the first season finale "Rock Band", Wendy is an attractive, outgoing and wealthy pediatric surgeon, and the other characters are surprised she is married to Tom, who often brags about her attractiveness. Although Tom outwardly claims he is fine with the divorce, he secretly harbors romantic feelings for Wendy and wishes for the marriage to continue. When the parks department employees hold a contest in "Practice Date" about who can find out the biggest secret about the others, Ron learns about the green card marriage, but he keeps it a secret at Tom's request.
The divorce proceedings begin in "Tom's Divorce", and Tom continued to pretend he is alright with the arrangement. However, when Ron asked Tom whether he could ask Wendy out after the divorce, Tom was secretly heartbroken, despite giving Ron his blessing.[tpl]cite news |last=Gonzalez |first=Sandra |title="Parks and Recreation" recap: "Tom's Divorce" makes us love the show more |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 4, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/12/04/parks-and-recreation-recap-toms-divorce-makes-us-love-the-show-more/ |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wDI5veL1 |archivedate=February 2, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: "The Fourth Floor" |work=The A.V.

===Diane Lewis===

Diane Elizabeth Lewis (Lucy Lawless) was introduced in the third episode of Season 5, "How a Bill Becomes a Law".  She is a junior high school principal and a single mother of two young girls, Ivy (Sadie Salizar) and Zoe (Rylan Lee).  Ron Swanson meets her when he goes to fix a pothole in front of her house (since the Department of Streets had been ignoring her complaints, Ron decided to simply take the matter into his own hands).  Diane is far from Ron's usual "type". She's not named "Tammy" and she has two small girls.  Ron is not good with children, or more specifically, with little girls (Ron had previously taken teenage and pre-teen boys camping to teach them survival skills, and also coached a basketball team).  After he fixes the pothole, Diane's girls put makeup on Ron and Andy's faces (Ron had taken Andy with him to help fix the pothole), and have a little girl's tea party with them, which Ron tolerates surprisingly well.  Ron really likes Diane and in episode 5 of season 5 ("Halloween Surprise") begins a dating relationship with her, deciding that dealing with a single mother and her girls might help him to expand his life experience.  Diane, in return, in the episode "Ron and Diane", shows an impressive level of patience and understanding at Tammy II's psychotic attempts to ruin her relationship with Ron. In a private conversation with Leslie, Diane admits that she feels more threatened by Leslie than by Tammy II, as she feels that Leslie knows Ron in a way that she never can. When she confesses this fear to Ron, he assures her that, while Leslie is a loyal friend and colleague, he could never have any romantic feelings towards her. Then, to prove his commitment to Diane, he reveals to her his Duke Silver identity (a night club saxophone player, something even Leslie didn't know), and he plays Diane a song, naming her as his "duchess". In the same episode, Leslie decides that Diane is a good guardian of Ron's well-being and a shield against the disruptive antics of Tammy II. Later, during the episode "Women in Garbage", Ron is babysitting her daughters in the office with Ann, and accidentally allows them to lock themselves in his office with the contents of Ann's medical bag. The girls cut each other's hair before Ron and Ann can stop them, which destroys their hairstyles. Ron and Ann are horrified by this, and when Ron considers Diane's potential reaction, he blurts out to Ann that he has fallen in love with Diane (a statement he immediately tries to take back). Diane, however, is understanding of the accident, saying that it was just kids being kids. She tells him that she is touched by how much he cared, and that she loves him. Ron sheepishly admits that he loves her as well.  It is implied at the end of the fifth season that Diane may be pregnant. However in the beginning of the first episode of the sixth season, Diane confirms her pregnancy and Ron proposes marriage to which she accepts under one condition: that the wedding is as plain as possible. With that in mind, the two head up to the fourth floor with Leslie and April in tow. Leslie is asked to be the matron of honour and April appoints herself as Ron's 'Best Man'. The two are married in an extremely fast paced wedding filmed on April's phone and with highlighter pens acting as a bouquet. Later on in the episode where Leslie, Ron, April and Andy are in London, it is revealed that Diane suggested tagging along to make the trip hers and Ron's honeymoon, however her morning sickness meant she couldn't go and Ron had to take plenty of photos for her.

==Elected officials and city employees==

===Bill Dexhart===

Bill Dexhart (Kevin Symons) is a Pawnee councilman who regularly participates in outrageous sex scandals with multiple partners. His character was inspired by South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford and his 2009 scandal, in which he admitted to a long-time extramarital affair with an Argentinian woman. Dexhart first appeared in "Practice Date", when he publicly admitted to having participated in a foursome in a Brazil cave under the guise of building houses for the underprivileged. Dexhart was featured prominently in "Christmas Scandal", which began with Leslie portraying him in a satirical holiday skit in which he discussed his an affair with multiple women that resulted in a love child. Unbeknownst to Leslie, Dexhart turned out to be involved in a sexual arrangement very similar to that one: four-way sex in a hospital room where he has just overseen the birth of his love child. When he confronted her about it, members of the media took pictures of Leslie and Dexhart together and speculated that the two of them were having an affair. Dexhart refused to deny the allegations, and even went so far as to confirm them, because the fictional affair was less scandalous than his actual sexual discretions. As proof of the affair, he claimed Leslie had a mole on her right buttock, but she publicly proved him wrong by dropping her pants on live television and revealing there is no mole. In Season 5 he was something of a swing vote for Leslie on the City Council because he was less likely to fully support her than Howser, but also less likely to thoughtlessly oppose her than either Milton or Jamm. That has changed during the recall campaign against Leslie in Season 6, as Dexhart has cheerfully joined Jamm in blocking any initiatives by her and making it clear they both hope she is booted from office.

He constantly talks extremely loudly, speaking at screaming levels even when asked to talk quietly, and works as a ranger because he cannot hold down a job that involves working indoors due to his inability to control the volume of his voice. Carl appeared in "Park Safety", in which Jerry claimed to be mugged in Ramsett Park, which fell under Carl's territory. Leslie launched efforts to make the parks safer and had Carl take them on a tour of the area; he showed Leslie, Tom and Jerry around on a mobile cart that had been attacked and urinated upon by raccoons.[tpl]cite news |last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation Recap: The Schlemiel and the Schlemazel |work=New York |date=March 22, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_recap_the_2.html |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xCl9JLXh |archivedate=March 15, 2011[/tpl] Carl eventually discovered that Jerry was not mugged at all, but accidentally fell into a creek by himself. Angry that Leslie blamed Carl's security measures for the mugging, he threatened to reveal the truth on Joan Callamezzo's morning news show, Pawnee Today.

George Williams (Biff Yeager) works in the Public Works Department, first seen in the season three episode Jerry's Painting, although he was referred to as "Lenny". In Li'l Sebastian, he worked as a maintenance worker for Li'l Sebastian's funeral, as witnessed Ben and Leslie kissing. To keep him from revealing their secret, Ben and Leslie give him a $50 spa gift certificate. He reappears in The Trial of Leslie Knope, where it is revealed he is a NASCAR enthusiast. He testifies against Leslie and provides the key evidence against her.http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/parks-and-recreation-season-four-episode-nine/

===Douglass Howser===

Councilman Howser (Yvans Jourdain) is a Pawnee councilman who repeatedly encounters Leslie in embarrassing or awkward situations around city hall, during which time Leslie nevertheless tries to discuss politics with him.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "94 Meetings" Review |publisher=IGN |date=April 30, 2010 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1086828p1.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVRQHDhb |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl] For example, in "94 Meetings", Leslie ran into Councilman Howser in the men's bathroom, which she entered while following Ron Swanson and trying to discuss something with him. Afterward, Leslie awkwardly blurted to Howser, "Councilman Howser. I saw your penis." That being said, he is depicted as by far the most rational Council member (besides Leslie) and has consistently supported her proposals and plans since she was elected.

===Hugh Trumple===

Hugh Trumple (Eric Pierpoint) is chief of the Pawnee police department.

The chief agreed to Leslie's request that he release him to Leslie's custody. Ben feared Leslie cashing in this favor meant the chief would not agree to provide security for the upcoming harvest festival, but Chief Trumple agreed to do so anyway out of his respect for Leslie, telling Ben he will always do favors for Leslie because she is the kind of person who uses those favors to help people. The chief reappeared in the episode "Eagleton", where he arrested Leslie when she refused to apologize after getting in a fight with Lindsay Carlisle Shay, her rival from the neighboring city of Eagleton.  Trumple retired as police chief in Season 4.

===Jeremy Jamm===

An orthodontist by day, Jamm (Jon Glaser) is a member of the Pawnee City Council, and has made himself Leslie's major nemesis. After fighting with Leslie over the use of her private bathroom for her office, he becomes a continual thorn in Leslie's side for any proposal she makes. His catch phrase, "you just got Jammed," is used whenever he one-ups Leslie or any other adversary. He failed to turn Lot 42 into a new Paunch Burger restaurant when Leslie won over the city planning committee and got the Pawnee Commons park project approved, leading to him getting drunk and temporarily ruining Ben and Leslie's impromptu on-site wedding (after he was punched by Ron Swanson, both of them were thrown in jail but Ron was quickly released while Jamm was left to sober up in his cell, and the wedding took place at City Hall). He then sued Ron and it looked he would win, but Tom, Andy and April threatened a similarly bogus lawsuit that Jamm knew he would lose, so both sides backed off. When Leslie is under political pressure to resign, Jamm complicates Leslie's role on the council by teaming up with councilman Dexhart and voting down any proposal Leslie has, to spite her. When Donna Meagle accidentally sends a sexually suggestive tweet from the department Twitter, Jamm uses this as an opportunity to hold public hearings that put Leslie's ethics into question. After he holds a series of hearings to drag out Leslie's ordeal, Leslie publicly stands up to Jamm and says that she's going to get back to work as a councilwoman and won't attend any more of the hearings. In the season six finale, Jamm is shown at the Pawnee/Eagleton unity concert leading a secession effort.

===Fielding Milton===

Milton is the longest-serving Pawnee Councilman, having been elected in 1948 as a Dixiecrat largely due to his commitment to de-integrating Major League Baseball, as well as a plan to re-open a former WWII Japanese-American Internment Camp in Pawnee and get it back up to speed. He is generally senile except on matters of racism and sexism, where his memory seems to be intact (he was able to calculate when Leslie Knope's next menstrual period would start during "Women in Garbage"), and he has generally—though not always—been on the other side of Leslie's initiatives.

He later appears briefly in the fifth season, at the local sperm bank when he tells Ann and Leslie (Who were there because Ann was trying to have a baby) that he and his friends were regular donors.

===Ken Hotate===

Ken Hotate (Jonathan Joss) is the leader of Pawnee's local Wamapoke Native American tribe. He also runs a casino in the city. He appeared in "Harvest Festival", where he asked Leslie to relocate her festival because it was taking place on the sacred burial grounds of the Battle of Indian Hill, where his ancestors were killed in a seven-day battle. When Leslie insisted there was nowhere she could move the festival without being offensive due to Pawnee's extremely bloody history, Ken threatened to place a curse on the festival. He knew the curse to be fake, but believed it would frighten people enough to ruin the festival,[tpl]cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: "Harvest Festival" |work=The A.V.

Ken's efforts proved successful, as the local media learned about the curse and reported on it so extensively that the festival was nearly ruined. Leslie and Ken came to a compromise after Leslie agreed to place a Wamapoke history exhibit by the entrance of the festival, and Ken lifted the fake curse during a phony ceremony, where he said nonsense chants including "Doobee doobee do". Although Ken enjoyed giving Leslie some tsuris at this point, later on its shown he fully respects her; when Leslie desperately plants Wamapoke artifacts on the Lots 42 site after Councilman Jamm and the Pawnee Restaurant Association henchwoman have broken an agreement to leave the site alone until a city meeting, Ken first accepts Leslie's apology and then bluntly threatens reprisals unless the agreement is reinstated, which a cowardly Jamm quickly agrees to do. Jonathan Joss previously voiced John Redcorn in the animated television series King of the Hill, which was co-created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels.

===Kyle===

Kyle (Andy Forrest) is a government employee and regular customer at Andy's shoeshine stand. He is routinely mocked and laughed at, not only by Andy but others at city hall as well, even Jerry Gergich, who himself is usually scorned by his co-workers.[tpl]cite news |last=Daglas |first=Andy |title=Parks and Recreation: "Camping" |publisher=ChicagoNow |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/vast-wasteland/2011/03/parks-and-recreation-camping.html |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zfegRKFo |archivedate=June 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Daglas |first=Andy |title=Parks and Recreation: "Soulmates" |publisher=ChicagoNow |date=April 22, 2011 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/vast-wasteland/2011/04/parks-and-recreation-soulmates.html |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zfenYrRO |archivedate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] For example, in the episode "Camping", Kyle told Andy that his identity had been stolen, and Andy reacted by laughing hysterically.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Camping" Review |publisher=IGN |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/115/1157642p1.html |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zffDHrXW |archivedate=June 23, 2011[/tpl] Andy and April have also stolen money from Kyle's wallet and ejected him from the shoeshine chair (but not before Andy poured Pepto-Bismol on Kyle's shoes).

===Mayor Gunderson===

Mayor Gunderson is the mayor of Pawnee and, although he has been mentioned in multiple episodes of Parks and Recreation, he has yet to make an actual appearance on the show. He was first mentioned in "Christmas Scandal", when the parks and recreation department held a satirical holiday skit full of inside jokes about Pawnee, and April declared, "That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus." The mayor and his dog played a major part in the episode "The Possum", when Mayor Gunderson's assistant ordered the parks department to capture an opossum that bit Rufus on a Pawnee golf course.[tpl]cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: "The Possum" |work=The A.V.

For the funeral scene in the third season finale "Li'l Sebastian", Michael Schur said the writing staff considered killing off Mayor Gunderson, but they instead went with miniature horse Li'l Sebastian because it was decided having an animal die would be more appropriate and less morbid. Amy Poehler has stated she would love Bill Murray to play Mayor Gunderson and, during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, jokingly announced she would pay him $250 if he played the role.[tpl]cite web |last=Prudom |first=Laura |title=PaleyFest 2011: The 'Parks and Recreation' Cast Talk Romance, Charlie Sheen and the Return of Tammy |publisher=TV Squad |date=March 10, 2011 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/10/paleyfest-2011-parks-and-recreation/ |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zhzNPBV3 |archivedate=June 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Busis |first=Hillary |title='Parks and Recreation': Amy Poehler announces that she wants Bill Murray to play the mayor of Pawnee |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 17, 2011 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/03/17/parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-bill-murray/ |accessdate=June 28, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6036F6yrc |archivedate=July 9, 2011[/tpl]

===Paul Iaresco===

Paul Iaresco (Phil Reeves) is the Pawnee city manager, which makes him supervisor of all the departments and staff in city hall. He was first introduced in "Canvassing", when he asked Ron to fast-track Leslie's plans to convert a construction pit into a park. This inadvertently led to a disastrous public forum, where most attendees forcefully opposed the project. Paul appeared in several other Parks and Recreation episodes, including "The Master Plan", where he announced the pending arrival of state auditors Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger due to Pawnee's crippling budget problems. In "Camping", Paul held a press conference to commend Leslie for her successful relaunch of the city's harvest festival. During the conference, he suffered a massive heart attack and accidentally clutched Leslie's breast as he fell to the ground; one newspaper's story about the incident read, "Knope Grope is Last Hope!" Paul took a leave of absence after an octuple bypass, and Chris Traeger took over as interim city manager.

===Scott Braddock===

Scott Braddock (guest star H. Jon Benjamin) is a high-strung Pawnee city attorney who becomes extremely nervous about anything that could lead to a lawsuit. He appeared in "Kaboom", where Leslie accidentally injured Andy by arranging for a bulldozer to fill in a giant pit, unaware that Andy was inside it. He became hospitalized, and Scott encouraged Leslie not to apologize or admit fault in the incident because it would risk Pawnee getting sued. Scott constantly admonished Leslie when she tries to apologize, at one point shouting, "No miming!" when she made a motion indicating how badly she feels. Andy did file a lawsuit with the hopes of winning enough money to impress his ex-girlfriend Ann, but it ended with a settlement that resulted in the pit getting filled in.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Kaboom" Review |publisher=IGN |date=October 23, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/103/1038098p1.html |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBl23O0e |archivedate=February 1, 2011[/tpl]

===William and Elizabeth===

William (Johnny Sneed) and Elizabeth (Antonia Raftu) first approached Leslie in the third season finale, Li'l Sebastian, about Leslie potentially running for city council. After she agrees, in season four, they start working on her campaign, as her advisors. In Citizen Knope, Leslie gives a Christmas ornament with "Knope 2012" written on it, to William as a present, and attempts to give Elizabeth a Knope 2012 menorah because she thinks but is not sure Elizabeth is Jewish (she isn't). When Leslie and Ben turn themselves in, and Ben resigns after Leslie's trial, William and Elizabeth inform her that she is polling at 1%, and they will no longer advisor her on her campaign.http://www.starpulse.com/news/Kris_King/2011/12/09/parks_and_recreation_citizen_knope_re William and Elizabeth make their final appearance in The Comeback Kid, as they tell Leslie that they are looking for other potential candidates.

===Craig Middlebrooks===

Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner) is the former office manager of Eagleton's parks department, the equivalent of Donna's position in Pawnee. In the episode "Doppelgangers", he and other Eagleton employees were brought in to Pawnee's offices after the Pawnee-Eagleton city merger. A flamboyant homosexual, he at first seemed to be the polar opposite to Donna's more laid-back personality (with layoffs imminent, Donna actually suggested to Leslie that Craig should have her job because he was much more passionate). The two of them bonded over their mutual love of the TV series Scandal. Craig is the one former Eagleton employee not laid off after the merger, being placed by Leslie in a "maybe" column along with Jerry; he continues to work at the Pawnee offices under the title of "Associate Administrator". The overdramatic Craig often raises his voice to the point of shouting, and frequently blows things out of proportion, although he proves to be a highly efficient employee who's familiar with city politics and a strong negotiator.

==Members of the media==

===Crazy Ira and The Douche===

Crazy Ira and Howard "The Douche" Tuttleman (Matt Besser and Nick Kroll) are two shock jocks of a morning zoo-style Pawnee radio program. They serve primarily as a parody of those types of radio shows, especially in a small-town market like Pawnee. The show prominently features fart jokes and "your mom" insults, as well as constant sound effects from their sound man "China Joe",[tpl]cite news |last=Poniewozik |first=James |author-link=James Poniewozik |title=Parks and Recreation Watch: Escape from Ice Town |date=February 18, 2011 |work=Time |url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/02/18/parks-and-recreation-watch-escape-from-ice-town/ |accessdate=February 20, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zjS1LrGl |archivedate=June 26, 2011[/tpl] who hates his job. Crazy Ira and The Douche are widely admired in Pawnee, especially by Tom Haverford, and are considered much better than their rival radio show, "Tubby Tony and The Papaya" (who never appear on-screen). They first appeared on "Media Blitz" when, during an interview with Leslie and Tom about the upcoming harvest festival, they revealed their true motive was to lambast Ben for his failed tenure as a city mayor during his teen years. The interview proved disastrous for Ben, who was so socially awkward he could barely talk, and it led to other Pawnee media taking on the story and nearly ruining the harvest festival. The Douche reappeared in "The Fight", when he went on a date with Ann to the Snakehole Lounge bar. This came at a time when Ann was regularly going on a string of dates with random, underachieving men, and the date with The Douche led to a major argument between Ann and Leslie because Ann was supposed to be preparing for a job interview Leslie had arranged for her.[tpl]cite news |last=Keller |first=Joel |title='Parks and Recreation' Season 3, Episodes 13 and 14 Recap |date=May 13, 2011 |publisher=TV Squad |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/05/13/parks-and-recreation-season-3-episodes-13-and-14-recap/ |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zhzurGwE |archivedate=June 25, 2011[/tpl] Later, on his radio show, The Douche dismissed both Ann and Leslie as likely lesbians.[tpl]cite web |last=Sundermann |first=Eric |title='Parks and Recreation' Recap: The Fight/Road Trip |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=May 13, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Parks_and_Recreation_Recap_The_FightRoad_Trip/7793614 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcEba9ms |archivedate=June 21, 2011[/tpl]

Although Perd only asked simple questions, the nervous Ben had a complete meltdown, which ended with him angrily referring to Perd Hapley as "Turd Crapley".[tpl]cite web |last=Keller |first=Joel |title='Parks and Recreation' Season 3, Episode 5 Recap |publisher=TV Squad |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/02/18/parks-and-recreation-season-3-episode-5-recap/ |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcQ57Gqx |archivedate=June 21, 2011[/tpl] Perd interviewed Leslie and porn star Brandi Maxxxx in "Jerry's Painting" to discuss whether a painting featuring Leslie nude can be considered art.[tpl]cite news |last=Keller |first=Joel |title='Parks and Recreation' Season 3, Episode 11 Recap |publisher=TV Squad |date=April 29, 2011 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/04/29/parks-and-recreation-season-3-episode-11-recap/ |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcScIBUC |archivedate=June 21, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Review: 'Parks and Recreation' - 'Jerry's Painting': Centaur of attention |publisher=HitFix |date=April 28, 2011 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/parks-and-recreation-jerrys-painting-centaur-of-attention |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcSiYfZW |archivedate=June 21, 2011[/tpl] In his younger days on Pawnee TV, Perd was a film critic who famously gave E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial only 1 and 1/2 stars because "it's a good story, but it's just not believable".
Jackson was originally expected to appear only in one Parks and Recreation episode, during which his character was seen only on a television screen. He returned for subsequent episodes, however, because the writing staff enjoyed his performance and liked writing jokes for him.

===Shauna Malwae-Tweep===

Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) is a reporter with the local newspaper, The Pawnee Journal. Shauna meets Leslie Knope in "The Reporter", when she was assigned to write a story about the parks department's efforts to turn a construction pit into a park. When the interviews went badly, Leslie asked Mark Brendanawicz for help dealing with Shauna, and Mark ended up sleeping with her.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "The Reporter" Review |publisher=IGN |date=April 4, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/976/976198p1.html |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ujzdKyOG |archivedate=December 4, 2010[/tpl] Mark told Shauna he does not believe the park will ever be built. Later, Shauna agreed not to publish the story since she and Mark are in a relationship and it would be a conflict. When Mark says he cannot commit to a relationship, however, she goes ahead with the story. Shauna returned in "The Possum", where she interviewed Andy Dwyer for a story about his successful capture of an opossum that had bitten Mayor Gunderson's dog.[tpl]cite news |last=Gonzalez |first=Sandra |title='Parks and Recreation' recap: Andy Dwyer, I would tackle an opossum for you |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 12, 2010 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/03/12/parks-and-recreation-recap-andy-dwyer-i-would-tackle-an-opossum-for-you/ |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xCkaz9iM |archivedate=March 15, 2011[/tpl] During that interview, Andy made Shauna feel awkward by openly discussing her having previously slept with Mark. During scenes cut from the episode "The Master Plan", Shauna and Andy flirted with each other, but he ultimately rejected her due to his feelings for April, prompting her to declare, "I can't even land the shoeshine guy." Michael Schur said of the character, "She's just unlucky in love." Shauna also appears in "Time Capsule", where she initially started writing a story about Leslie's plans for a Pawnee time capsule. However, after Kelly Larson handcuffed himself to a pipe when she did not include the Twilight novel in the capsule, Shauna wrote that story instead, with the headline, "Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams".[tpl]cite news |last=Busis |first=Hillary |title='Parks and Recreation': Let's hear it for Pawnee, the town for weirdos who care |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/02/04/parks-and-recreation-season-3-episode-3/ |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zcevqueq |archivedate=June 21, 2011[/tpl] Shauna also appeared in "Media Blitz" as one of the many reporters who wrote about Ben Wyatt's past as a failed teen mayor.[tpl]cite news |last=Meslow |first=Scott |title='Parks and Recreation': (Awkward) Love Is in the Air |work=The Atlantic |date=February 18, 2011 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/parks-and-recreation-awkward-love-is-in-the-air/71261/ |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zXJ819o0 |archivedate=June 18, 2011[/tpl]
Shauna is increasingly shown throughout the show to have a particularly messy personal life. The season six episode "Galentine's Day" revealed that she had recently ended a relationship with a married man, and that she found out in college that her family was actually her father's secret second family.

===Kim Terlando===

Kim is an obnoxious, untalented tabloid reporter working at the local rag "Pawnee Sun" who made her only appearance to date in Season 5's "Correspondents Lunch". Leslie was eager to perform a great skit at the event, but Kim (whose paper has been suspiciously capable of finding and printing embarrassing information about Leslie) ends up delivering all of Leslie's jokes. Unfortunately for Kim, Leslie and Donna find proof that Kim has illegally hacked into Leslie's e-mails, when Leslie sends a bait message about "midichlorians" in the soil near the Pawnee Commons project. Kim asks a question about the "news" only to have Leslie bluntly tell her that the substance in question is from Star Wars: Episode I and she's just revealed that she's broken the law. Kim tries to act dismissive, but gets scared out of the room by Donna.

===Brandi Maxxxx===

Brandi Maxxxx (Mara Marini) is a pornography star who has appeared in more than 200 adult films, despite having been in the business only one year.[tpl]cite episode |title=Jerry's Painting |series=Parks and Recreation |serieslink=Parks and Recreation |credits=Retta |network=NBC |airdate=April 28, 2011 |season=3 |number=11 |time=12:53–13:01[/tpl] She appeared in "Jerry's Painting" as a guest on the news show Ya Heard? With Perd!, where host Perd Hapley was interviewing Leslie Knope about a painting she appeared nude in. Brandi was also brought on as a guest and, to Leslie's chagrin, compared Leslie's painting to pornography and defended them both. She claimed anyone should be allowed to have sex anywhere they wanted, and falsely believed Leslie felt the same way.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Jerry's Painting" Review |publisher=IGN |date=April 28, 2011 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/116/1163891p1.html |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/603G7Hsp1 |archivedate=July 9, 2011[/tpl] When Leslie quoted United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Potter Stewart's famous claim that he cannot define pornography but "I know it when I see it", Brandi was asked to define it and she replied, "For me, it's when the penis goes in." Brandi also invited Leslie to appear in her next film. Tom tried to flirt with Brandi, but his efforts were ruined when she recognized him as the basis of a baby-like cherub in the painting. In the (4X17) episode "Campaign Shake Up", Brandi Maxxxx is also running for the City Council election, in third place in polls with 8% of the vote behind Bobby Newport's 45% and second place Leslie Knope with 30%.

===Chris===

Chris (guest star Will Arnett) is a MRI technologist at the hospital where Ann Perkins works. Ann sets Chris up on a blind date in "The Set Up", which went extremely poorly. Chris openly acted rude to Leslie during the dinner, criticizing Leslie's alma mater of Indiana University and expressing disappointment that she only works in regular parks rather than amusement parks. Upon learning Leslie has never had an MRI, Chris insisted on immediately taking her to the hospital and giving her one, to which she reluctantly agreed. His inappropriate behavior continued at the hospital, where he made creepy comments about her "industrial-sized" womb during the MRI and made unsubtle comments about expecting to have sex with her later, including asking whether she is having her period. They parted on bad terms, with Chris angry that Leslie refused to have sex with him after the date.
At the time, Arnett was the real-life husband of Amy Poehler, who plays Leslie. It was not Poehler who arranged for him to be on the show, but rather Michael Schur, who is a good friend of Arnett and felt he would be a good fit for the character.[tpl]Cite news |last=Dos Santos |first=Kristin |work=E!

===Jessica Wicks===

Jessica Wicks (Susan Yeagley) is a Miss Pawnee beauty pageant winner who became the younger trophy wife of the elderly but wealthy Nick Newport, Sr. Speaking with a slight Southern accent, Jessica is a superficial woman who cares deeply about her own physical appearance and tries hard to charm others around her.[tpl]cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: "94 Meetings" |work=The A.V. Club |date=April 29, 2010 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/94-meetings,40647/ |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVRN5SfO |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl] She won the Miss Pawnee contest in 1994 primarily based on her looks; her talent during the pageant was packing a suitcase. This was most likely intended by the writers to be an homage to the 1975 beauty pageant film "Smile", where Miss Imperial Valley packed a suitcase as her talent. Jessica first appeared in "Beauty Pageant" as a Miss Pawnee panel judge along with Leslie and Tom. When Tom voted for the beautiful Trish Ianetta but Leslie pushed for a smarter but less attractive contestant, the superficial Jessica sided with Tom. She reappeared in "94 Meetings", where she organized a birthday party for Nick Newport, Sr. by completely renovating and tearing down portions of the historic Turnbill Mansion. Leslie unsuccessfully tried to stop her, while Tom simply flirted with her, acknowledging she was a gold digger but calling himself a "gold digger digger". Jessica sang a horribly out-of-key song for her husband with an accompanist on the harp. Her husband, Nick Newport, Sr. dies in Bus Tour, making her a widow. She takes over the family business, "Sweetums," making Ben the new Director of Charitable projects.

===Kelly Larson===

Kelly Larson (guest star Will Forte, who starred on Saturday Night Live with Amy Poehler)[tpl]cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |publisher=HitFix |title='Parks and Recreation': Early thoughts on Season 3 |date=December 7, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/parks-and-recreation-early-thoughts-on-season-3 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zQNc42Vu |archivedate=June 13, 2011[/tpl] is a Pawnee resident who advocated for Leslie to include the Twilight novel in a time capsule she was organizing. Appearing in "Time Capsule", Kelly is obsessed with Twilight and knows every detail about the books, the film series and Twilight author Stephenie Meyer. When Kelly visited Leslie's office to advocate for the novel, she politely refused, and Kelly responded by handcuffing himself to a pipe in her office, promising to stay there until she agrees.[tpl]cite news |last=Sundermann |first=Eric |title='Parks and Recreation' Recap: Time Capsule |work=New York Post |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/movies/news/n46870.htm |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6036J9MV0 |archivedate=July 9, 2011[/tpl] He spent three days in the office, where he got Tom interested in Twilight and held book discussions with Tom and Donna. Finally, Leslie revealed she knows Kelly's true motivations: he had recently gone through a divorce and was trying to impress his teenage daughter, who loves Twilight. Although sympathetic, Leslie cannot agree to Kelly's request or she would have to accept demands from all Pawnee residents. As a compromise, she held a public meeting where she listened to all demands. Ultimately, when the citizens could not agree on anything, Leslie submitted a video tape of that very meeting, which she believed symbolizes the spirit and passion of Pawnee.

===Lawrence===

Lawrence (Eric Edelstein) is a Pawnee resident who has criticized the parks and recreation department's plans at public forums, which embodied a recurring Parks and Recreation theme that only citizens opposed to projects bother to attend town meetings.[tpl]cite video | people=Schur, Michael|date=2009|title=Parks and Recreation: Season One: "Canvassing" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=Universal Studios Home Entertainment[/tpl]  He first appeared in "Canvassing" at a forum Leslie held to raise support for her proposed park project.  Lawrence only complained about the loud music his neighbor Andy played.  Andy said in an interview with the documentary crew "Lawrence lives with his uh grandmother, which is pretty awesome.  He takes care of her, I guess.  But whatever, he's a douchebag."  He complained that Andy's music was "loud, . . . abusive, and was waking up his birds," causing Lawrence to admit that he had ". . . nice, pretty, expensive birds . . ."  Lawrence was also the one who pointed out in the same meeting that April Ludgate had been planted by Leslie as a supporter for the park, having recognized her since she was at his door the day before.  He ended the night by telling Leslie, "Hey park lady, you suck," to which she proudly replied, "Hear that? He called me park lady."  The line was originally meant to be said by someone else, but Michael Schur said it was given to Lawrence because the Parks and Recreation crew liked Edelstein so much.  Lawrence reappeared in "Boys' Club", where he angrily stole Andy's radio while Andy was bathing himself in a children's pool in the back yard.  This prompted Andy to chase Lawrence through the street naked while using crutches.[tpl]cite news |last=Fowler |first=Matt |title=Parks and Recreation: "Boys' Club" Review |publisher=IGN |date=May 1, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/978/978748p1.html |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vM1SNVEb |archivedate=December 29, 2010[/tpl]  Lawrence also appeared in a scene that was deleted from "Ron and Tammy", but included in the second season DVD, in which he mocked Andy's new city hall job as a shoeshiner by giving him dozens of soiled shoes to clean.[tpl]Cite video|title  =Parks & Recreation: Season Two |medium  =Film (DVD)|publisher=Universal Studios Home Entertainment|time=Deleted Scenes: Ron and Tammy[/tpl]

===Marcia Langman===

Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) is a conservative activist with the Pawnee organization, the Society for Family Stability Foundation.[tpl]cite news |last=Meslow |first=Scott |title='Parks and Recreation': 'Twilight', Time Capsules, and David Lee Roth |work=The Atlantic |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/parks-and-recreation-twilight-time-capsules-and-david-lee-roth/70751/ |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6036Jejyq |archivedate=July 9, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |title="Parks and Recreation" and Amy Poehler |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=September 17, 2009 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-monitor17-2009sep17,0,2687196.story |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wBgJ8X1n |archivedate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] She often serves as an antagonist to Leslie by objecting to her plans and arguing against issues she considers offensive. Marcia uses fear-mongering tactics and often expresses racist and homophobic sentiments. In her first appearance, "Pawnee Zoo", she objected to Leslie's marriage of two male penguins during a publicity stunt for the zoo. Offended by what she perceived as a public show of support for same-sex marriage, Marcia demanded Leslie's resignation and appeared on the morning news program Pawnee Today to debate the matter with Leslie. She next appeared in "Time Capsule", where Marcia objected to a proposal to include the Twilight novel in a Pawnee time capsule, claiming it included offensive sexual content and went against Christian values. Marcia reappeared in "Jerry's Painting", where she demanded the destruction of a painting that depicted Leslie as a bare-chested centaur Greek goddess.[tpl]cite news |last=Porter |first=Rick |title='Parks and Recreation': Leslie Knope, warrior princess |publisher=Zap2it |date=April 28, 2011 |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/04/parks-and-recreation-leslie-knope-warrior-princess.html |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zZbivupR |archivedate=June 19, 2011[/tpl] Condemning it as "government-funded animal porn", she took the matter to the city arts commission, which agreed to destroy it because they do not want to offend anybody. Marcia planned to publicly burn the painting, but Leslie had it switched with a decoy painting and kept the original herself. She initially blocked Leslie's sensible plan to teach safe sexual practices to senior citizens in Season 5, citing city laws that banned anything other than promoting abstinence (which had always only been applied to teenagers) but Leslie ignored the laws and proudly accepted a censure for doing so. One of Marcia's odd personality quirks is that she seems completely unaware of her husband's homosexuality.

===The Newport family===

The Newport family are the owners of the Sweetums candy manufacturer in Pawnee and one of the city's richest and most prominent families. The company has operated and thrived in the city for years, as indicated in the episode "Sweetums", where Leslie screened 30-year-old video footage of a then-young Nick Newport, Sr. discussing how corn syrup was used to fatten cattle at farms. By the time of Parks and Recreation, Nick Newport, Sr. (Christopher Murray) is an elderly man in a wheelchair so senile he can barely speak, and the company is run by his son Nick Newport, Jr. (Gary Weeks), who himself appears in Sweetums commercials along with his two children, Dakota (Harley Graham) and Denver (Ryan Hartwig). In "Sweetums", the company formed a partnership with the city hall to run the concessions stands in Pawnee parks, and Nick Newport, Jr. unveiled their new, supposedly-healthy energy bars Nutriyums. He promotes the energy bars through commercials that use similar propagandistic techniques as the commercials of real-life corn refiners: they feature warm images of Nick Newport, Jr. with his dog Shoelace insisting corn syrup is "fine in moderation".[tpl]cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Kona |title=Review: "Parks and Recreation" -- "Sweetums" |publisher=TV Squad |date= February 5, 2010 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/02/05/review-parks-and-recreation-sweetums-recap |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wMPF0VBH |archivedate=February 8, 2011[/tpl] Ann and Leslie held public forums to inform people the energy bars are not actually healthy, but the citizenry of Pawnee ultimately rejected their arguments and were won over by the charisma of Nick Newport, Jr. and his family, particularly when Denver announced they should look under their seats for free Sweetums candy. Nick Newport, Sr. appeared in the episode "94 Meetings", where his young and attractive gold digger wife Jessica Wicks held his 85th birthday party at the Turnbill Mansion. Jessica made major alterations to the historic mansion, and Leslie unsuccessfully tried to intervene to stop her. 

====Bobby Newport====

Paul Rudd plays Bobby Newport, Leslie's chief opponent in her fourth season campaign for City Council. Bobby would appear to be the second son of Nick Newport, Sr., who paid $250,000 to his campaign manager (Jennifer Barkley) in order to get Bobby elected. Bobby Newport is superficially charming, but extremely naive and unintelligent (to the point where, at times, he appears to be mentally handicapped), and has gotten everything he ever wanted in life either by fiat or by whining/pleading for those things.  When Leslie puts together a viral video that makes him look pathetic and stupid (in lieu of a nasty attack ad she ultimately refused to air), Bobby has a meeting where he complains she hurt his feelings, then asks her to drop out of the election and simply hand the office to him. He also tells Leslie he'll give her an invitation to his victory party, and even offers to let her do the job for him once he's elected; Leslie tells him that's not going to happen, and that he needs to know his stuff or she'll destroy him when they have a debate. During that debate, Bobby first appears to be in the lead by saying short quips rather than longer speeches, but Leslie eventually attacks his character and wins the debate. Afterwards, Bobby asks her if she would like to come to his house for a party.  Later, he spends much of the campaign away from Pawnee, and gets involved in a sex scandal while vacationing in Majorca. He comes to think of Leslie as a really awesome lady, tells reporters people who don't vote for him should definitely vote for her, and then says on TV that he's very relieved he lost the election to her.

===Trish Ianetta===

Trish Ianetta (April Marie Eden) is an attractive young woman who won the title Miss Pawnee in "Beauty Pageant". She gave unintelligent answers during the pageant and displayed no actual talent: during her talent portion, she did a baton twirling act that involved simply moving the baton around without twirling it. In describing herself, she says, "I've been on YouTube. I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there." Trish has been compared to Caitlin Upton, the 2007 Miss South Carolina Teen USA who made an incoherent response during the Miss Teen USA 2007 pageant. Based solely on her physical attractiveness, Trish was favored by the panel of judges, which included Tom Haverford and Jessica Wicks. Only Leslie objected to Trish and unsuccessfully argued for Susan, an intelligent and talented contestant who was less pretty. Trish made another appearance in "The Master Plan", where she was among the girls Tom tried to flirt with during a night at the Snakehole Lounge bar.

===Greg Pikitis===

Greg Pikitis, a teenage boy living in Pawnee, Indiana, is Leslie's mortal enemy. His first appearance is in "Greg Pikitis," where he has a very important role. He is convicted of crimes that Leslie tries to prove him guilty of, but he refuses to admit. Finally, Leslie hunts him down and he is sent to juvenile prison. His second appearance is in "Prom" in season 6, where he plays the boyfriend of Leslie's mentee.

===Ron Dunn===

Ron Dunn (Sam Elliott) is the former director of Eagleton's parks department, the equivalent position of Ron Swanson's in Pawnee. In the Season 6 episode "Doppelgangers", he was brought over to the Pawnee offices along with other Eagleton employees when the towns merged. Swanson at first took a liking to Dunn, as the latter was mustachioed, taciturn and also named Ron. However, Dunn later revealed himself to be a hippie with New Age ideals, and Swanson found him insufferable.
Dunn was laid off along with most other Eagleton employees (excepting Craig), which he took in stride. He reappeared in "Flu Season 2", where Swanson and a drunk Ben encounter him at night, and he helps Ben overcome his anger at his parents' selling their vacation home.

==People from outside Pawnee==

===Detlef Schrempf===

Detlef Schrempf is a real-life retired basketball player for the Indiana Pacers who portrays himself on Parks and Recreation. He first appeared in "Telethon", where Leslie invited him to make a guest appearance on a 24-hour diabetes telethon. Tom picked him up from the airport, but first took him for a drink to the Snakehole Lounge, where Detlef proved so popular that bar owner Freddy would not let them leave. After Tom got drunk on two light beers, Detlef took him to the telethon, where he made his scheduled appearance.[tpl]cite news |last=Kandell |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation Recap: Diabetes, Yuck! |work=New York |date=May 7, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/05/parks_and_recreation_telethon.html |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVSOD2uD |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl] Detlef made another appearance in the third season finale "Li'l Sebastian", where Tom and Jean-Ralphio hired him to work for their new entertainment company, Entertainment 720.

Prior to filming "Telethon", Schrempf's acting skills had been limited to appearances on the American comedy series Married... with Children and the German soap opera Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten. Michael Schur said of his performance, "For a guy who literally never acted before in his life, he was really funny."[tpl]Cite web |last=MacKenzie |first=Carina |title='Parks and Recreation': Amy Poehler-penned episode to feature Detlef Schrempf |publisher=Zap2it |date=April 26, 2010 |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/04/parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-penned-episode-to-feature-detlef-schrempf.html |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVSH5ssu |archivedate=March 27, 2011[/tpl]

Eduardo, who only spoke Spanish, first appeared in "Go Big or Go Home", where Andy vowed to continue pursuing April despite her new relationship. When April claimed in Spanish that Andy just described his plans to become a woman, Eduardo encouraged Andy to follow his dreams, surprising Andy. In "Time Capsule", Andy and Eduardo started bonding, particularly over their mutual appreciation for the Dave Matthews Band. When April learned they were becoming friends, she became frustrated and broke up with Eduardo, who returned to Venezuela.

===Frank Beckerson===

Frank Beckerson (guest star John Larroquette) is a man who, in his youth, had a passionate love affair with Leslie Knope's mother, Marlene Griggs-Knope. The two met when Marlene was 18 years old and Frank, a lifeguard, saved her life. They had a two-week affair before going their separate ways. Decades later, Marlene shared the story of her long-lost love with Leslie, and Leslie's boyfriend Justin Anderson insisted they find Frank and surprise Marlene by reuniting the pair. Leslie was initially pleased with the idea, and together they tracked Frank to his new home in Illinois. However, the older Frank is an eccentric man who has long been unemployed and is extremely socially awkward, repeatedly vomiting in nervousness at the prospect of seeing Marlene.[tpl]cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: "Galentine's Day" |work=The A.V.

Leslie tried to call off the reunion, but Justin insisted on going through with it, and they brought Frank to a Valentine's Day senior citizen dance to meet Marlene. She was initially pleased to see him, but upon learning his life amounted to nothing, she rejected Frank, who publicly berated Marlene on a dance hall stage before storming off.

===Lindsay Carlisle Shay===

Lindsay Carlisle Shay (guest star Parker Posey) is the parks and recreation director of Eagleton, Pawnee's more upscale neighboring town. Once best friends with Leslie Knope, the two are now bitter rivals. Five years before the events of the third season,[tpl]cite news |last=Holbrook |first=Damian |title=Watercooler: Parker and Recreation |date=May 6, 2011 |work=TV Guide |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Parker-Posey-Parks-Recreation-1032752.aspx |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zleQeuWr |archivedate=June 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |title='30 Rock' and 'Parks and Recreation': Two opposing views of the world in which we live |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 6, 2011 |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/05/06/30-rock-parks-and-recreation-tina-fey/ |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zleUw5OY |archivedate=June 27, 2011[/tpl] Lindsay worked in the Pawnee parks department with Leslie, and the two made a vow they would never leave their hometown. Leslie was offered the parks director job in Eagleton but did not accept it due to this pact. However, the job was subsequently offered to Lindsay and she accepted, which Leslie considered an act of betrayal. Although she does not admit it, Lindsay appears to harbor resentment toward Leslie for having been offered the job first. Since leaving Pawnee, Lindsay lost 35 pounds, had a nose job,[tpl]cite news |last=Keller |first=Joel |title='Parks and Recreation' Season 3, Episode 12 Recap |publisher=TV Squad |date=May 6, 2011 |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/06/parks-and-recreation-season-3-episode-12-recap |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zleijpwb |archivedate=June 27, 2011[/tpl] adopted a slight aristocratic accent and developed a snobbish, nouveau riche personality.[tpl]cite news |last=Sundermann |first=Eric |title='Parks and Recreation' Recap: "Eagleton" |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=May 6, 2011 |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Parks_and_Recreation_Recap_Eagleton/7791059 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zlemwWM4 |archivedate=June 27, 2011[/tpl] She regularly insults Leslie and others in Pawnee with passive-aggressive, condescending comments, and has condemned Pawnee as "a dirty little nightmare from which you'll never wake up". Lindsay first appears in the episode "Eagleton", where she built a fence directly through a park Pawnee and Eagleton share to keep the Pawnee children out of her town. Leslie tried to fight this action, culminating in Leslie and Lindsay fighting amid piles of garbage and both getting arrested. Leslie ultimately solved the problem by turning Pawnee's side of the park into a wiffle ball field and making the fence its home run wall. Lindsay was ultimately impressed with Leslie's solution and her work ethic, and she seemed to respond positively when Leslie offered a reconciliation.
Posey previously starred with Amy Poehler in the 2009 comedy film Spring Breakdown. She had been in discussions with the Parks and Recreation staff to make a guest appearance since the show debuted, and grew frustrated when it took several months before she received an invitation.[tpl]cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Megan |title=Parker Posey guests on "Parks and Rec" this week; go behind the scenes! |work=Punchline Magazine |date=May 2, 2011 |url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/blog/2011/05/parker-posey-guests-on-parks-and-rec-this-week-go-behind-the-scenes |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zQNf7fxL |archivedate=June 13, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Martin |first=Denise |title=Parks and Recreations Parker Posey on Playing Leslie's Frenemy: "Dreams Do Come True!" |work=TV Guide |date=May 4, 2011 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Parks-Recreation-Posey-1032693.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zQNgyjFR |archivedate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]

===Raul===

Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana (guest star Fred Armisen, who starred on Saturday Night Live with Amy Poehler) most commonly referred to simply as Raul, is a parks official from Baraqua, the Venezuelan sister city of Pawnee. He appeared in the episode "Sister City", when he and a delegation of Venezuelan officials visited Pawnee, where they were met by Leslie and her fellow parks department employees.[tpl]cite news |last=Fog |first=Henning |title="Parks and Recreation" recap: Viva Pawnee! |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 16, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/16/parks-and-recreation-recap-viva-pawnee/ |accessdate=October 24, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vv4NIzWd |archivedate=January 22, 2011[/tpl] Since he comes from a military state, Raul is accustomed to being treated like royalty, so he was unimpressed with the conditions of Pawnee and its citizens, who he treated rudely from the moment he arrived.[tpl]cite news |last=Havrilesky |first=Heather |title=When did "Parks and Recreation" get so funny? |date=November 4, 2009 |publisher=Salon.com |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/i_like_to_watch/2009/11/04/parks_and_recreation/index.html |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uFSFFFKb |archivedate=November 14, 2010[/tpl] He was particularly unsettled by Pawnee's public forums, in which the residents loudly and angrily criticized their government officials; Raul explained he usually holds his meetings in fortresses, citadels or palaces, and that anyone who complains or does anything out of line is immediately thrown in jail. Leslie got annoyed with Raul's insults, but he eventually offered her a check for $35,000, enough to completely fund her plans to turn a construction pit into a park. However, Raul explained a condition of the check was that Leslie must praise Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and insult the United States,[tpl]Cite news |last=Pierce |first=Leonard |title=Parks and Recreation: "Sister City" |work=The A.V.

Leslie angrily ripped up the check and sent Raul and his delegation away.

===Jennifer Barkley===

Jennifer Barkley (Kathryn Hahn) is an extremely successful political operative who has taken over the City Council campaign of Bobby Newport after being promised $250,000 by the Newport family. She awed Leslie by appearing in a picture where she's sharing an egg salad with Colin Powell. Jennifer tells Leslie that she's bored and took this job for the money, not much caring who wins and finding Bobby to be stupid. While it appears she's being honest about this, she later trashes Leslie in a TV interview, edits Leslie's successful YouTube campaign ad to make her sound like an idiot, and swipes Leslie's building-ramp plan in favor of an electric lifts plan that leads Pawnee senior citizen powerbroker Ned Jones to endorse Bobby. Leslie later confronts Jennifer at her favorite restaurant, where Jennifer says bluntly she likes Leslie but has been hired to defeat her. Jennifer then gives Leslie some genuinely good advice about upcoming decisions, and tells the camera that she is doing so because she has no one to play chess with and "sometimes I need to play against myself". Jennifer appears to keep her work and her personal feelings separate, given that she's able to relate to people when she's not working a campaign. When Leslie appears on Perd Hapley's show to reveal that Bobby Newport has been avoiding his hometown in favor of making out with a woman on a Majorca beach, Jennifer says that Bobby is in Europe to get business opportunities for Pawnee and the woman is an anti-landmine advocate. Afterwards, she tells Leslie and Ben that she "mostly" made all that up, then details how she'll be able to spin any outrage from them in Bobby's favor. Leslie and Ben are left completely stunned by Jennifer's mercenary brilliance. However, Leslie and Ben are finally able to knock her off balance a little bit after Jennifer goes on Perd's TV show and says Leslie ordered a pet shelter closed (after Leslie had asked a retiring Councilman to reverse a funding cut for the Parks Department); after she's overjoyed with Leslie's idea that the Newport family use their wealth to fund the shelter, Leslie explains that she'll accept the initial funding cut if Jennifer breaks a promise to stop airing "puppy killer" ads, and that she's fine with losing a week's news momentum because she's debating Bobby Newport after that and she's going to ruin him. Jennifer's expression makes it clear Leslie has finally scored some points against her. But after Leslie does score a huge victory over Bobby in the debate and pulls within 2 points of him in the polls, Jennifer strikes back by using the death of Nick Newport (and Leslie's comments, made before she learned he had died, that Nick was a jerk) to force Leslie into several embarrassing mistakes. However, Jennifer finds out that she might not get any of her promised quarter-million fee due to her handshake deal with Nick, and watches as Bobby manages to tell the press that Leslie is an awesome person. The campaign having ended, Jennifer seeks out Chris Traeger and invites him to have sex with her, and he accepts. On Election Night, she tries and fails to keep pro-Newport voting machines in place, and later is rebuffed when she doesn't want an automatic recount to be triggered by Bobby's initial 21-vote victory margin. Recognizing Ben's talent on Leslie's campaign, she offers Ben a job working with her on a Congressional campaign (he eventually accepts it) and has sex with Chris again but leaves Pawnee without saying goodbye to him. When that campaign successfully ends in Washington D.C., she offers Ben another campaign job for a governor candidate in Florida.

===Buddy Wood===

Buddy Wood (guest star Sean Hayes) is a journalist from Indianapolis that does an annual special where he profiles five political candidates from around Indiana. The candidates he profiles tend to get elected, causing him to be described as a "lucky charm" for people running for office. Buddy interviews Leslie, but this doesn't go well because she is drunk, and Wood tries to turn the story to Pawnee not being as great as it once was. Leslie and Ben consider him to be rude, but they still drive to Buddy Wood's house to beg him for either a second chance for an interview or for him to erase the negative footage; Buddy then sourly reveals that he never aired the interview because his bag was lost in Pawnee, unaware that one of the airport workers, who liked Leslie and was angered by Buddy's rude attitude, took the interview tape and threw it into a dumpster.http://www.avclub.com/articles/lucky,70351/
