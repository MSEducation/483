HD 99109 is an orange dwarf star approximately 160 light-years away in the constellation of Leo.  The star is though to have about 93% as massive, probably smaller, and 72.4% the luminosity of the Sun.  It is over twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen than the Sun.  The star is one and half degree away from the celestial equator to the south.  As of 2006, one extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the star.

The planet HD 99109 b has an orbit comparable in eccentricity to the planet Mars in our solar system but has a mass at least half that of Jupiter. Stability analysis reveals that Earth-size planets could have stable orbits in the planet's Trojan points, located 60 degrees ahead and behind the planet's position in its orbit.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20077994 | volume=474 |issue=3|pages=1023–1029 |bibcode=2007A&A...474.1023S |title=Survey of the stability region of hypothetical habitable Trojan planets |author=R.
