The Canadian province of Manitoba was created in 1870.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 8, 2008|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/2/2/h2-1375-e.html|title=Entered Confederation: 1870|date=May 10, 2001|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081205122246/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/2/2/h2-1375-e.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 [/tpl] Manitoba has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the Premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly.  The Premier is Manitoba's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Manitoba, and then presides over that body.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 8, 2008|url=http://www.lg.gov.mb.ca/role/rr.html|title= Roles and Responsibilities |publisher=Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080927140707/http://lg.gov.mb.ca/role/rr.html |archivedate=September 27, 2008 [/tpl]
Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also happen if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=December 11, 2013 |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/education/faq/fact3.pdf |title=Legislative Terminology |work=Legislative Assembly of Manitoba |publisher=Government of Manitoba|format=PDF [/tpl]
Manitoba has had twenty-one Premiers since the province was formed, of which six were non-partisan, six were Progressive Conservatives, four were Liberals, and four were New Democrats. However, during the early years of the province and until 1874, leading ministers were not titled "Premier".Davd Burley, "The Emergence of the Premiership, 1870-1874," Manitoba Premiers of the 19th and 20th centuries, Barry Ferguson and Robert Wardhaugh, eds., Great Plains, 2010 Furthermore, they were officially non-partisan and were chosen by elected members of the Legislative Assembly from among themselves before the province began to use a party system in 1888.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=December 11, 2013 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/provincial-territorial-politics/friendly-rivalries-manitoba-elections-since-1966/topic---friendly-rivalries-manitoba-elections-since-1966.html |title=Friendly Rivalries: Manitoba Elections Since 1966 |publisher=CBC [/tpl] This article only covers the time since the province was created in 1870. Before that, the territory was part of the District of Assiniboia in Rupert's Land, and was loosely controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 8, 2008|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1870/1|archiveurl=http://archive.is/XH3q |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |title=Territorial Evolution, 1870 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada|date=April 6, 2004 [/tpl]
