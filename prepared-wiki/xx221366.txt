Paul Reade (1943 â€“ 7 June 1997) was an English composer.  Born in Lancashire, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music and worked at English National Opera as a repetiteur.
Reade was active as a composer for television, with credits including the series The Victorian Kitchen Garden (published in various arrangements, this music continues to be played in recitals and music examinations). He arranged the Beethoven extracts heard by millions of children in the surreal animated series 'Ludwig'; his other children's television credits include The Flumps and Crystal Tipps and Alistair. He was also the composer, with Tim Gibson, of the theme music for the Antiques Roadshow.
Reade eventually turned to ballet; among the latter works he scored were Hobson's Choice in 1989 (choreographed by David Bintley from the eponymous play), and 1996's Far from the Madding Crowd (after the work by Thomas Hardy).  Hobson's Choice has been recorded by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia and released on ASV Records.
Paul Reade's Chants du Roussillon were recorded by the prominent soprano, Virginia Kerr.
