The France national football team ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Équipe de France de football[/tpl]) represents France in international football. It is fielded by the French Football Federation ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Fédération Française de Football[/tpl]), the governing body of football in France, and competes as a member of UEFA, which encompasses the countries of Europe. The national team's traditional colours are blue, white and red, the colors of the national flag of France, known as the drapeau tricolore, and the coq gaulois is the symbol of the team. France is colloquially known as Les Bleus (The Blues), which is the name associated with all of the country's sporting national teams, due to the blue shirts each team incorporates.
France played its first official match in 1904, and today primarily plays its home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris. The national team has won one FIFA World Cup title, two UEFA European Football Championships, an Olympic tournament, and two FIFA Confederations Cups. Following France's 2001 Confederations Cup victory, they became, along with Argentina, the only national teams to win the three most important men's titles organized by FIFA. France has a strong rivalry with neighbours Italy, and has historically also had important rivalries with Belgium, Brazil, England, Germany, and Spain.
The national team has experienced much of its success during three major "golden generations": in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s respectively, which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and, although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup cycle.The other two being United States (withdrawing in 1938 without actually playing any match) and Brazil (reaching the finals tournament each time). In 1958, the team, led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, finished in third place at the FIFA World Cup. In 1984, France, led by Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, won UEFA Euro 1984. Under the leadership of Didier Deschamps and three-time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, France won the FIFA World Cup in 1998, becoming one of eight national teams to ever do so while hosting the tournament. Two years later, the team triumphed again in UEFA Euro 2000 and became the top team in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time. France has since added a pair of Confederations Cup titles, in 2001 and 2003, as well as an appearance in the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which it lost 5–3 on penalties to Italy.

==History==

The France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of FIFA's foundation on 21 May 1904 and contested its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium, in Brussels, which ended in a 3–3 draw.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=1|title=France v. Belgium 1904 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1–0 with the only goal coming from Gaston Cyprès. Due to disagreements between FIFA and the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA), the country's sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club's appearances in forthcoming Olympics Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation. In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the French Football Federation.
In July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos in Montevideo. Lucien Laurent became notable in the match as he scored not only France's first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup history. France later lost 1–0 to fellow group stage opponents Argentina and Chile resulting in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a black player to the national team. Raoul Diagne, who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 2–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia. Diagne later played with the team at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, alongside Larbi Benbarek, who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team. At the 1934 FIFA World Cup, France suffered elimination in the opening round, losing 3–2 to Austria. On the team's return to Paris, they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 FIFA World Cup and reached the quarter-finals losing 3–1 to the defending champions Italy.
The 1950s saw France handed its first Golden Generation composed of players such as Just Fontaine, Raymond Kopa, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Maryan Wisnieski, Thadée Cisowski, and Armand Penverne. At the 1958 FIFA World Cup, France reached the semi-finals losing to Brazil. In the third place match, France defeated West Germany 6–2 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural UEFA European Football Championship in 1960 and, for the second straight international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France faced Yugoslavia and were shocked 5–4 despite being up 4–2 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France were defeated 2–0 by the Czechoslovakians.
The 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly playing under several different managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1964, Henri Guérin was officially installed as the team's first manager. Under Guérin, France failed to qualify for the 1962 FIFA World Cup and the 1964 European Nations' Cup. The team did return to major international play following qualification for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The team lost in the group stage portion of the tournament. Guérin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by José Arribas and Jean Snella, who worked as caretaker managers in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international Just Fontaine, who only lasted two. Louis Dugauguez succeeded Fontaine and, following his early struggles in qualification for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was fired and replaced by Georges Boulogne, who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and was replaced by the Romanian Ștefan Kovács, who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Kovács also turned out to be a disappointment failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1976. After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with Michel Hidalgo.
Under Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders Marius Trésor and Maxime Bossis, striker Dominique Rocheteau and of course midfielder Michel Platini, who, alongside Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse, and Luis Fernández formed the "carré magique" ("Magic Square"), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals West Germany. The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was marred with controversy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/match_detail.php?nomatch=419|title=France v. Germany 1982 Match Report |work=French Football Federation|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning UEFA Euro 1984, which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated Spain 2–0 in the final. Platini and Bruno Bellone scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international Henri Michel. France later completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics football tournament and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2–0 to win the Artemio Franchi Trophy, an early precursor to the FIFA Confederations Cup. Dominique Rocheteau and José Touré scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the 1986 FIFA World Cup, France were favorites to win the competition, and, for the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 4–2 victory over Belgium gave France third place.
In 1988, the French Football Federation opened the Clairefontaine National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-President of France, François Mitterrand. Five months after Clairefontaine's opening, manager Henri Michel was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Platini did lead the team to UEFA Euro 1992 and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was replaced by his assistant Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification to the 1994 FIFA World Cup all but secured with two matches to go, which were against last place Israel and Bulgaria. In the match against Israel, France were upset 3–2 and, in the Bulgaria match, suffered an astronomical 2–1 defeat. The subsequent blame and public outcry to the firing of Houllier and departure of several players from the national team fold. His assistant Aimé Jacquet was given his post.
Under Jacquet, the national team experienced its triumphant years. The squad composed of veterans that failed to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup were joined by influential youngsters. The team started off well reaching the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996 where they lost 6–5 on penalties to the Czech Republic. In the team's next major tournament at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Jacquet led France to glory defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final at the Stade de France. Jacquet stepped down after the country's World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant Roger Lemerre who guided them through UEFA Euro 2000. Led by FIFA World Player of the Year Zidane, France defeated Italy 2–1 in the final. Trezeguet scored the golden goal in extra time. The victory gave the team the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the French national team were inserted to the number one spot in the FIFA World Rankings.
France failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments. Although, the team won the Confederations Cup in 2001, France suffered a stunning goalless first round elimination at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 1–0 defeat to debutantes Senegal in the opening game of the tournament. After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by Jacques Santini. A full strength team started out strongly in UEFA Euro 2004, but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners Greece. Santini resigned as coach and Raymond Domenech was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 4–0 win over Cyprus on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the final defeating the likes of Spain, Brazil, and Portugal along the way. France took on Italy in the final and despite controversial disruptions in extra time, France failed to get on the score-sheet and Italy won 5–3 on penalties to be crowned champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
France started its qualifying round for UEFA Euro 2008 strong and qualified for the tournament, despite two inevitable defeats to Scotland. France bowed out during the group stage portion of the tournament after having been placed in the group of death (which included Netherlands and Italy). Just like the team's previous World Cup qualifying campaign, the 2010 campaign got off to a disappointing start with France suffering disastrous losses and earning uninspired victories. France eventually finished second in the group and earned a spot in the UEFA play-offs against the Republic of Ireland for a place in South Africa. In the first leg, France defeated the Irish 1–0 and in the second leg procured a 1–1 draw, via controversial circumstances, to qualify for the World Cup.
In the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team continued to perform under expectations and were eliminated in the group stage, while the negative publicity the national team received during the competition led to further repercussions back in France. Midway through the competition, striker Nicolas Anelka was dismissed from the national team after reportedly having a dispute, in which obscenities were passed, with team manager Raymond Domenech during half-time of the team's loss to Mexico.[tpl]cite news |title=Communiqué de la Fédération |url=http://fff.fr/bleus/actu/533826.shtml |work=French Football Federation | publisher=fff.fr|date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8749698.stm |title = World Cup 2010: Nicolas Anelka sent home after bust-up |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl] The resulting disagreement over Anelka's expulsion between the players, the coaching staff, and federation officials resulted in the playerse boycotting training before their third game.[tpl]cite news |title=French football in chaos after players' mutiny |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJUAsTmR7HSPud4_PSwWxUvvRcwQ |work=Agence France Press|publisher=Google|date=20 June 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Communiqué de la FFF |url=http://fff.fr/bleus/actu/533838.shtml |work=French Football Federation|publisher=France Football Federation|date=20 June 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010 [/tpl] In response to the training boycott, sports minister Roselyne Bachelot lectured the players and "reduced France's disgraced World Cup stars to tears with an emotional speech on the eve of their final group A match".http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-06-22-3046509653_x.htm France then lost their final game 2-1 to the hosts South Africa and did not advance.

==Home stadium==

During France's early years, the team's national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As the years moved forward, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg.
Following the renovation of the Parc des Princes in 1972, which gave the stadium the largest capacity in Paris, France moved into the venue permanently. The team still hosted friendly matches and minor FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship qualification matches at other venues. Twice France have played home matches in a French overseas department - in 2005 against Costa Rica in Fort-de-France (Martinique) and in 2010 against China in Saint Denis (Réunion). Both matches were friendlies.
In 1998, the Stade de France was inaugurated as France's national stadium ahead of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Located in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France's first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1–0, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game.
Prior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among twelve élite academies throughout the country. The center was inaugurated in 1976 by former federation president Fernand Sastre and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

===Media coverage===

The national team currently has a broadcasting agreement with TF1 Group, who control the country's main national TV channel, TF1. The current agreement was set to expire following the 2010 FIFA World Cup. On 18 December 2009, the Federal Council of the French Football Federation agreed to extend its exclusive broadcasting agreement with the channel. The new deal grants the channel exclusive broadcast rights for the matches of national team, which include friendlies and international games for the next four seasons beginning in August 2010 and ending in June 2014. TF1 will also have extended rights, notably on the Internet, and may also broadcast images of the national team in its weekly program, Téléfoot.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=20091218082130P0007|title=TF1, diffuseur exclusif des matches de l’Equi... |work=Investegate|date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] The federation will receive €45 million a season, a €10 million decrease from the €55 million they received from the previous agreement reached in 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sport24.com/football/equipe-de-france/fil-info/tf1-garde-les-bleus-335350/|title=TF1 restera le diffuseur de l’équipe de France de football entre 2010 et 2014. |work=Sport24 |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl]

===Kit===

The France national team utilizes a three colour system, composed of colors blue, white and red. The team's three colors originate from the national flag of France, known as the drapeau tricolore. France have brandished the colors since their first official international match against Belgium in 1904. Since the team's inception, France normally wear blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks at home, while, when on the road, the team utilizes an all-white combination or wear red shirts, blue shorts, and blue socks with the former being the most current. Between the years 1909–1914, France wore a white shirt with blue stripes, white shorts, and red socks. In a 1978 World Cup match against Hungary in Mar del Plata, both teams arrived at Estadio José María Minella with white kits, so France played in green-and-white striped shirts borrowed from Club Atlético Kimberley.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2010/may/21/joy-of-six-world-cup|title=The Joy of Six: Things we miss about the World Cup|last=Murray|first=Scott|date=21 May 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=21 May 2010[/tpl]
Beginning in 1966, France had its shirts made by Le Coq Sportif until 1972. In 1972, France reached an agreement with German sports apparel manufacturer Adidas to be the team's kit provider. Over the next 38 years, the two would maintain a healthy relationship with France winning UEFA Euro 1984, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2000 while wearing the brand's famous tricolour three stripes.  During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France wore an all-white change strip in all four of its knockout matches, including the final.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/international/tournaments/fifa-world-cup/2006/2006-knock-out-stages.html|title=FIFA World Cup 2006 Knock Out Stages|accessdate=19 April 2013|publisher=Historical Football Kits[/tpl] On 22 February 2008, the French Football Federation announced that they were ending their partnership with Adidas and signing with the American manufacturer Nike, effective 1 January 2011. The unprecedented deal is valued at €320 million over seven years (2011–present).

Notes: 
(*) This jersey was used in the first stage-match against Hungary played in Mar del Plata, due to the French team arrived to that city provided only with the white away kit (the same that Hungary had brought to the stadium). The problem was finally solved by local club Kimberley which lent the French squad their green and white striped jerseys to play the match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kimberleyeldragon.blogspot.com.ar/2008/06/10-de-junio-de-1978-el-da-que-kimberley.html |title=El día que Kimberley jugó para Francia |publisher=Kimberleyeldragon.blogspot.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl]"Cuando Kimberley le ganó a Hungría"

===Nickname===

France is often referred to by the media and supporters as Les Bleus (The Blues), which is the nickname associated with all of France's international sporting teams due to the blue shirts each team incorporates. The team is also referred to as Les Tricolores or L'Equipe Tricolore (The Tri-color Team) due to the team's utilization of the country's national colors: blue, white, and red. During the 1980s, France earned the nickname the "Brazilians of Europe" mainly due to the accolades of the "carré magique" ("Magic Square"), who were anchored by Michel Platini. Led by coach Michel Hidalgo, France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful, and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their South American counterparts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/147/article.aspx|title=One-On-One: Michel Platini |work=FourFourTwo |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl]

===Representing multi-ethnic France===

The France national team has long reflected the ethnic diversity of the country. The first black player to play in the national team was Raoul Diagne in 1931. Diagne was the son of the first African elected to the French National Assembly, Blaise Diagne. Seven years later, Diagne played on the 1938 FIFA World Cup team that featured Abdelkader Ben Bouali, and Michel Brusseaux, who were the first players of North African descent to play for the national team. At the 1958 FIFA World Cup, in which France reached the semi-finals, many sons of immigrants such as Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, Roger Piantoni, Maryan Wisnieski and Bernard Chiarelli were integral to the team's success. The tradition has since continued with successful French players such as Michel Platini, Jean Tigana, Manuel Amoros, Eric Cantona, Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira, David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry, Claude Makélélé, Samir Nasri, Hatem Ben Arfa, and Karim Benzema all having either one or both of their parents foreign-born.
During the 1990s, the team was widely celebrated as an example of the modern multicultural French ideal.[tpl]cite news |title = Wider view of France ’98 gives Emmanuel Petit opportunity to look back in anger |work=The Times |location=UK |date = 1 March 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article7044481.ece |accessdate=27 July 2010  | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti[/tpl] The 1998 FIFA World Cup-winning team was celebrated and praised for inspiring pride and optimism about the prospects for the "French model" of social integration.[tpl]cite news |title = France's multicultural World Cup-winning team (1998) achieved little for integration |publisher=United for Peace of Pierce County |date = 11 November 2005|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/3626-background-frances-multicultural-world-cup-winning-team-1998-achieved-little-for-integration.html |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] Of the 23 players on the team, the squad featured players who could trace their origins to Armenia, Algeria, Guadeloupe, New Caledonia, Argentina, Ghana, Senegal, Italy, French Guiana, Portugal and Martinique with the patriarch of the team being Zinédine Zidane, who was born in Marseille to Algerian immigrants.
The multiracial makeup of the team has, at times, provoked controversy. In recent years, critics on the far right of the French political spectrum have taken issue with the proportional under-representation of ethnic white Frenchmen within the team. National Front politician Jean-Marie Le Pen protested in 1998 that the Black, Blanc, Beur team that won the World Cup did not look sufficiently French. In 2002, led by Ghanaian-born Marcel Desailly, the French team unanimously and publicly appealed to the French voting public to reject the presidential candidacy of Le Pen and, instead, return President Jacques Chirac to office. In 2006, Le Pen resumed his criticism charging that coach Raymond Domenech had selected too many black players.[tpl]cite news |title = The Sword is Mightier than Le Pen |publisher=ESPN |date = 7 July 2006 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=373084&root=worldcup&cc=5901 |accessdate=17 August 2006[/tpl] In 2005, French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut caused controversy by remarking to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that despite its earlier slogan, "the French national team is in fact black-black-black," and also adding that "France is made fun of all around Europe because of that." He later apologized for the comments declaring that they were not meant to be offensive.[tpl]cite news |title = Finkielkraut sur Europe 1|work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France|date = 25 November 2005|url=http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051125.OBS6590.html&host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|accessdate=25 November 2005[/tpl]
The Zidane-Materazzi headbutt incident in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final and its aftermath served as a symbol for the larger issue of Europe's struggle to integrate its immigrant population. Even though both players denied racism was involved in the exchange, the international media speculated for days about the presence of a racist element in the provocation from Materazzi observing that the Italian team contained no ethnic minorities.[tpl]cite news |title = Zidane and Materazzi fined and banned by FIFA|agency=Reuters  |date = 20 July 2006|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=tsunamiNews&storyID=2006-07-20T132638Z_01_L19626990_RTRUKOC_0_UK-SOCCER-ZIDANE.xml&archived=False|accessdate=20 July 2006[/tpl][ref]

The national team's overall impact on France's efforts to integrate its minorities and come to terms with its colonial past has been mixed. In 2001, France played a friendly match at the Stade de France, site of its 1998 World Cup triumph, against Algeria. It was the country's first meeting with its former colony, with whom it had fought a war from 1954–1962, and it proved controversial. France's national anthem, La Marseillaise, was booed by Algerian supporters before the game, and following a French goal that made the score 4–1 in the second half, spectators ran onto the field of play, which caused play to be suspended. It was never resumed.
On 28 April 2011, French investigative website Mediapart released a story which claimed that the French Football Federation had been attempting to secretly put in place a quota system in order to limit the number of dual-citizenship players in its national academies. Quoting a senior figure in the FFF, the organisation was said to have wanted to set a cap of 30% on the number of players of dual-nationality by limiting places in the academies in the 12–13 age bracket.[tpl]cite news |title = French football body to investigate 'race quota' claim |agency=BBC |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13236864 |accessdate= 9 May 2011 [/tpl] The FFF responded by releasing a public statement on its website denying the report stating "none of its elected bodies has been validated, or even contemplated a policy of quotas for the recruitment of its training centers".[tpl]cite news |title = Le DTN suspendu de ses fonctions |agency=French Football Federation |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537335.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl] The federation also announced that it has authorized a full investigation into the matter and, as a result, suspended National Technical Director François Blaquart pending the outcome of the investigation.[tpl]cite news |title = Précision de la FFF |agency=French Football Federation |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/537336.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl]
On 29 April, national team manager Laurent Blanc, who, in the report, was claimed to have agreed with the decision to implement the quotas, held a personal press conference at the l'Hôtel Le Régent in Bordeaux, in which he also denied the report declaring that he had "not heard of such a project".[tpl]cite news |title = Blanc: "Des quotas? N'importe quoi !" |agency=French Football Federation |date = 29 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/537322.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl] On the following day, after Mediapart announced that it had a taped audio recording of the November 2010 meeting, Blanc released a statement on the FFF's website in which he apologized for possible offending comments he made during the meeting, while also declaring he was misquoted and denying he was racist stating "I do not withdraw the remarks I made yesterday. I admit that some terms used during a meeting on a sensitive subject can be ambiguous, out of context, and, if in my case, I've hurt some feelings but, I apologize. But being suspected of racism or xenophobia, which I am against all forms of discrimination, I do not support it".[tpl]cite news |title = Communiqué de Laurent Blanc |agency=French Football Federation |date = 30 April 2011 |url=http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/537338.shtml |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl]
Former national team player Lilian Thuram said of the allegations, "Initially I thought this was a joke. I'm so stunned I don't know what to say", while Patrick Vieira declared that the comments Blanc allegedly made at the meeting made were "serious and scandalous". The French government also gave opinions on the matter. President Nicolas Sarkozy was quoted as being "viscerally opposed to any form of quota", while adding "setting quotas would be the end of the Republic". National Sports Minister Chantal Jouanno echoed the president's sentiments, while also demanding that the FFF "shed light" on a report.[tpl]cite news |title = France to investigate alleged racial bias |agency=ESPN |date = 28 April 2011 |url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6444371/french-sports-minister-chantal-jouanno-wants-light-shed-alleged-racial-bias |accessdate= 9 May 2011 [/tpl] Blanc was defended by several former players, most notably his 1998 FIFA World Cup-winning teammates Christophe Dugarry, Bixente Lizarazu, Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Marcel Desailly, and Emmanuel Petit, current players, such as current national team captain Alou Diarra, and external sources, which included Pathé Diba, the president of L’Association Soutien aux Handicapés Africains (Association to Support the Disabled in Africa).[tpl]cite news |title = France 1998 side split over Blanc's role in quota row |agency=Reuters |date = 28 April 2011 |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/05/05/idINIndia-56810820110505 |accessdate= 9 May 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Deschamps: "Je souhaite que Blanc reste le plus longtemps possible" |agency=RMC Sport |date = 6 May 2011 |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/160425/deschamps-je-souhaite-que-blanc-reste-le-plus-longtemps-possible/ |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Desailly: "Les propos de Blanc ont été déformés" |agency=RMC Sport |date = 5 May 2011 |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/160353/desailly-les-propos-de-blanc-ont-ete-deformes/ |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Zidane: "Ce serait fou que Blanc parte" |agency=RMC Sport |date = 7 May 2011 |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/160619/zidane-ce-serait-fou-que-blanc-parte/ |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Diba: "Blanc n’est pas raciste" |agency=RMC Sport |date = 9 May 2011 |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/160829/diba-blanc-n-est-pas-raciste/ |accessdate= 9 May 2011 | language = French [/tpl] On 9 May, Blanc gave testimony at a hearing set up by the federation to investigate the quota matter. The next day, the federation cleared him of any wrongdoing.
