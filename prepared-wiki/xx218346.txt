Nicholas Sinclair (born 1954) is a British photographer born in London.
Sinclair studied Fine Art at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His career as a photographer began in 1982 with a series of photographs taken in the circus which were first exhibited in 1983 at the University of Sussex and subsequently published in the British Journal of Photography. He is known principally as a portrait photographer and many of his portraits are held in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.
Sinclair is also an accomplished landscape photographer and has published five books. He has edited two books about the Welsh artist Sir Kyffin Williams RA, and has taken what are now recognised as the definitive portraits of the artist. His work has also been exhibited in many European cities and in 2003 he was made a Hasselblad Master.
