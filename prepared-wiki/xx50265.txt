==Early history==

In 1960, Pat Robertson, the son of former U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, purchased the license for WTOV-TV, channel 27 in Portsmouth, Virginia, which had ceased operation because of poor viewership.  Renamed WYAH-TV (known today as WGNT), the station began broadcasting Christian programming to the Hampton Roads area on October 1, 1961.
In 1962, the station suffered financially and almost closed. To keep the station on the air, WYAH produced a special telethon edition of the show.  For the telethon, Robertson set a goal of 700 members each contributing $10.00 per month, which was enough to support the station.  Robertson referred to these members as the '700 Club' and the name stuck. The telethon was successful and is still held annually.
After the telethon in 1966, The 700 Club continued as a nightly, two-hour Christian variety program of music, preaching, group prayer, Bible study, and interview segments.  The music was hymns, instrumental pieces, southern gospel music, and urban gospel music.
The first permanent host of the program was Jim Bakker who, along with his then-wife Tammy Faye Bakker, also hosted a children's show on WYAH called Come On Over (later retitled Jim and Tammy).  The couple left CBN in 1972; reportedly Jim Bakker was fired by Pat Robertson over philosophical differences."Pat Robertson: the man, the mission, and the medium."  Broadcasting.  March 6, 1978, pp. 56-68.  The Bakkers then moved on to help launch the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) before starting their own television ministry and signature show, The PTL Club.  After the Bakkers left, some staffers at the station reportedly responded by destroying the Bakkers' sets and puppets.Biography: Bakker, Jim  Pat Robertson took over as host, and evolved his 700 Club by cutting back on music and preaching and heading toward the talk show format developed by Bakker.  Robertson transformed the 700 Club from a nightly religious themed telethon to a religious talk show.
The 700 Club originally aired only on WYAH-TV and other CBN-owned stations in Atlanta (WANX-TV) and Dallas (KXTX-TV), and later Boston (WXNE-TV).  The program entered national syndication in 1974, as CBN purchased airtime on stations such as WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, and WDCA in Washington, D.C., among others.  The roster of stations carrying the program grew to over 100 markets by 1976.  In some markets, the show aired on multiple stations, choosing between either the full 90-minute version or an edited 60-minute version.  In 1977, The 700 Club received additional exposure nationally on the newly launched CBN Cable Network where, like CBN's broadcast outlets, it aired three times daily.

==1980 to the present==

In 1979, The 700 Club moved its studios from WYAH's facilities in Portsmouth into CBN's then-new campus in neighboring Virginia Beach, where the program continues to originate.  During the 1980s, the show evolved into more of a magazine-like format, with news/opinion and lifestyle segments interspersed with interviews.
Even after CBN sold its group of terrestrial stations later in the decade, The 700 Club continued to air on CBN Cable as well as many commercial secular stations and Christian stations nationally.  CBN was rebranded as The Family Channel in 1988.  The Family Channel was packaged as part of a sale of International Family Entertainment to News Corporation and television producer Haim Saban in 1998.  The channel was renamed Fox Family Channel, but only three years later Fox Family was sold to the Walt Disney Company and was subsequently rebranded ABC Family.  [tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], The 700 Club airs on ABC Family thrice daily, part of a contractual obligation originally made as part of the Family Channel's sale to News Corporation.ABC Family: Contact ABC FamilyABC Family Repudiates Robertson 'Hit' - 8/23/2005 4:19:00 PM - Broadcasting & Cable  As of 2009, the first airing of the show in the morning (only) has been preceded by a half hour show called 700 Club Interactive, which utilizes internet user generated videos and comments by viewers of the show.

==Political advocacy==

Between 1978 and 1980, discussions on current political issues became a part of the program, and news segments were added in the first 20 minutes of the show.  Following Pat Robertson's lead, The 700 Club clearly endorsed a politically conservative agenda supporting Republican candidates and causes as the Christian right movement was beginning to emerge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]  According to Robertson, this had influence in the 1980 presidential election as well as congressional elections.  It also served as the basis for Pat Robertson's candidacy for the U.S. presidency in 1988. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
The 700 Club strongly supports Israel, especially in its conflicts with the Palestinians and the United Nations.  Among its frequent Jewish guests are Michael Medved and Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who share the Club's conservative Judeo-Christian beliefs.

==International programs==

CBN Broadcasts currently reach over 100 nations in dozens of languages, and are viewed by more than 360 million people each year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  CBN's primary strategy is to develop television shows produced by local staff in selected countries.

===The 700 Club Asia===

An Asian edition of the show, The 700 Club Asia, originally premiered in the Philippines in the mid-1990s on GMA 7 or Global Media Arts . It was originally produced and hosted by Pat Robertson's son, Gordon Robertson, and co-hosted by broadcaster Mari Kaimo, and Philippine TV personality Coney Reyes.
In 1998, Reyes took over as host and producer of the show, with Tricia Amper Jimenez as co-host. When Reyes left the show in 2000 for medical reasons, it was retooled as The Club, hosted by Jimenez, Peter Kairuz and Carla Martinez.
In 2001, the show reverted to its old format and moved to ABS-CBN 2 (a network unrelated to Pat Robertson's CBN and the rival network of GMA 7) and ABC 5 (a network unrelated to the American or Australian networks), where it aired on its sister station, Studio 23. Kairuz remained as host with veteran singer Maria Teresa "Dulce" Llamedo-Cruz and TV personality Chat Silayan-Bailon (1959–2006), who later died of colon cancer.
In 2006, the show moved to GMA's sister station, QTV 11. Kairuz was retained hosts the show, with Reyes returning to co-host. The show also features Kata Inocencio, Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan, Alex Tinsay and Felichi Pangilinan-Buizon.
