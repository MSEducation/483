[[Golden Triangle (Canada)]]

CATEGORIES: Bicycle tours

The Golden Triangle is a major 330Â km cycling route located in western Canada along the border between British Columbia and Alberta, forming a triangle with Lake Louise, Golden, BC and Radium, BC as its points. It crosses the continental divide twice, through the Kicking Horse Pass between Lake Louise and Golden, and the Vermillion Pass between Radium and Lake Louise. The Triangle can be "extended" by riding to Jasper on the Icefields Parkway from Lake Louise.
