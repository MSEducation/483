Distance education, distance learning, dlearning, or D-Learning is a mode of delivering education and instruction, often on an individual basis, to students who are not physically present in a traditional setting such as a classroom. Distance learning provides "access to learning when the source of information and the learners are separated by time and distance, or both."[tpl]cite journal | last=Honeyman |first=M |coauthors=Miller, G |date=December 1993 | title= Agriculture distance education: A valid alternative for higher education? | journal =Proceedings of the 20th Annual National Agricultural Education Research Meeting | pages= 67–73[/tpl] Distance education courses that require a physical on-site presence for any reason (including taking examinations) have been referred to as hybrid[tpl]cite journal |last=Tabor | first = Sharon W |date= Spring 2007 |title= Narrowing the Distance: Implementing a Hybrid Learning Model |journal= Quarterly Review of Distance Education | volume = 8 |issue=1 |pages=48–49 |publisher=IAP |issn=1528-3518 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b46TLTrx0kUC | accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] or blended[tpl]cite book |last1=Vaughan |first1=Dr Norman D. |editor1-first=MF |editor1-last= Cleveland-Innes |editor2-first= DR | editor2-last =Garrison |title=An Introduction to Distance Education: Understanding Teaching and Learning in a New Era |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AI5as0yooGoC | accessdate=23 January 2011 | year=2010 | publisher=Taylor & Francis | isbn=0-415-99598-1 | page=165 | chapter=Blended Learning[/tpl] courses of study.  Massive open online courses (MOOCs),  aimed at large-scale interactive participation and open access via the web or other network technologies, are a recent development in distance education.

==History==

The earliest distance education courses may date back to the early 18th century in Europe. One of the earliest examples was from a 1728 advertisement in the Boston Gazette for "Caleb Phillips, Teacher of the new method of Short Hand," who sought students who wanted to learn through weekly mailed lessons.[tpl]cite book |last1=Holmberg |first1=Börje |title=The evolution, principles and practices of distance education |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YTtdNQAACAAJ | accessdate=23 January 2011 |series=Studien und Berichte der Arbeitsstelle Fernstudienforschung der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg ASF |volume= 11 |year=2005 |publisher= Bibliotheks-und Informationssystem der Universitat Oldenburg |language=German |isbn=3-8142-0933-8 | page=13[/tpl]

===First distance education courses===

The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on postcards and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction - the element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman's system.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/134/214author=Alan Tait|publisher=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning|title=Reflections on Student Support in Open and Distance Learning[/tpl] This scheme was made possible by the introduction of uniform postage rates across England from 1840.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MEax6VBfRscC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=distance learning... a magazine for leaders volume 2 number 6|author=IAP|page=18[/tpl]
This early beginning proved extremely successful, and the Phonographic Correspondence Society was founded three years later to establish these courses on a more formal basis. The Society paved the way for the later formation of Sir Isaac Pitman Colleges across the country.[tpl]cite book | last= Moore | first= Michael G. | coauthors = Greg Kearsley | year= 2005 | title= Distance Education: A Systems View | edition= 2nd | location= Belmont, CA | publisher= Wadsworth | isbn= 0-534-50688-7[/tpl]

===University correspondence courses===

The University of London was the first university to offer distance learning degrees, establishing its External Programme in 1858. The background to this innovation lay in the fact that the institution (later known as University College London) was non-denominational and, given the intense religious rivalries at the time, there was an outcry against the "godless" university. The issue soon boiled down to which institutions had degree-granting powers and which institutions did not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2680%28198824%2928%3A4%3C627%3ASADT%22H%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J |title=Sheldon Rothblatt, "Review: Supply and Demand: The Two Histories of English Education", History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 4., Winter, 1988, pp. 627-644 |publisher=Links.jstor.org |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]
The compromise solution that emerged in 1836 was that the sole authority to conduct the examinations leading to degrees would be given to a new officially recognised entity called the "University of London", which would act as examining body for the University of London colleges, originally University College London and King's College London, and award their students University of London degrees. As Sheldon Rothblatt states, "thus arose in nearly archetypal form the famous English distinction between teaching and examining, here embodied in separate institutions." With the state giving examining powers to a separate entity, the groundwork was laid for the creation of a programme within the new university that would both administer examinations and award qualifications to students taking instruction at another institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study.
Referred to as "People's University" by Charles Dickens because it provided access to higher education to students from less affluent backgrounds, the External Programme was chartered by Queen Victoria in 1858, making the University of London the first university to offer distance learning degrees to students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/history.shtml |title="History", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml |title="Key Facts", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl] Enrolment increased steadily during the late 19th century, and its example was widely copied elsewhere.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 |author=Tatum Anderson |title=History lessons at the people's university| date=16 May 2007 |publisher=Guardianabroad.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-27 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 | archivedate= 24 May 2007[/tpl] This program is now known as the University of London International Programme and includes Postgraduate, Undergraduate and Diploma degrees created by colleges such as the London School of Economics, Royal Holloway and Goldsmiths.[tpl]Citation | contribution = Key Facts | publisher = University of London | title = External Programme | url = http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml[/tpl]
In the United States William Rainey Harper, first president of the University of Chicago, developed the concept of extended education, whereby the research university had satellite colleges of education in the wider community. In 1892 he also encouraged the concept of correspondence school courses to further promote education, an idea that was put into practice by Columbia University.[tpl]cite book | last1= Levinson |first1= David L | title= Community colleges: a reference handbook | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=xrnPJcb7c54C | accessdate= 23 January 2011 | year= 2005 | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn= 1-57607-766-7 |page=69[/tpl]Von V. Pittman, "Correspondence Study in the American University: A Second Historiographical Perspective, in Michael Grahame Moore, William G. Anderson, eds. Handbook of Distance Education  pp 21-36 Enrollment in the largest private for-profit school based in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the International Correspondence Schools grew explosively in the 1890s. Originally founded in 1888 to provide training for immigrant coal miners aiming to become state mine inspectors or foremen, it enrolled 2500 new students in 1894 and matriculated 72,000 new students in 1895. By 1906 total enrollments reached 900,000. The growth was due to sending out complete textbooks instead of single lessons, and the use of 1200 aggressive in-person salesmen.Joseph F. Kett, Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties: From Self-Improvement to Adult Education in America (1996) pp 236-8J.J. Clark, "The Correspondence School--Its Relation to Technical Education and Some of Its Results," Science'' (1906) 24#611 pp 327-8, 332, 333. Clark was manager of the school's text-book department. There was a stark contrast in pedagogy:
Education was a high priority in the Progressive Era, as American high schools and colleges expanded greatly. For men who were older or were too busy with family responsibilities, night schools were opened, such as the YMCA school in Boston that became Northeastern University.  Outside the big cities, private correspondence schools offered a flexible, narrowly focused solution. In 1916 efficiency was enhanced by the formation of the National Association of Corporation Schools.Kett, Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties, p 240
Universities around the world used correspondence courses in the first half of the 20th century, especially to reach rural students. Australia with its vast distances was especially active; the University of Queensland established its Department of Correspondence Studies in 1911.[tpl]cite journal | last= White | first= M | year= 1982 | title = Distance education in Australian higher education — a history |journal= Distance Education |volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages =255–278[/tpl] The International Conference for Correspondence Education held its first meeting in 1938.[tpl]cite book|author=Francis Lee|title=Letters and bytes: Sociotechnical studies of distance education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6_V7z998PlgC&pg=PA48|year=2009|publisher=Francis Lee|page=48[/tpl] The goal was to provide individualized education for students, at low cost, by using a pedagogy of testing, recording, classification, and differentiation.Francis Lee, "Technopedagogies of mass-individualization: correspondence education in the mid twentieth century," History & Technology (2008) 24#3 pp 239-253Ellen L.  Bunker, "The History of Distance Education through the Eyes of  the International Council for Distance Education," in Michael Grahame Moore, William G. Anderson, eds. Handbook of Distance Education  pp 49-66

===Radio and television===

The very rapid spread of radio in the United States in the 1930s led to proposals to use it for distance education.  By 1938, at least 200 city school systems, 25 state boards of education, and many colleges and universities broadcast educational programs for the public schools.Levering Tyson, "Ten Years of Educational Broadcasting," School and Society (1936) 44:225-31  One line of thought was to use radio as a master teacher.
A typical setup came in Kentucky in 1948 when John Wilkinson Taylor, president of the University of Louisville, teamed up with the National Broadcasting Corporation to use radio as a medium for distance education, The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  endorsed the project and predicted  that the "college-by-radio" would put "American education 25 years ahead."  The University was owned by the city, and local residents would pay the low tuition rates, receive their study materials in the mail, and listen by radio  to live classroom discussions that were held on campus.Dwayne D. Cox and William J. Morison, The University of Louisville (1999) pp 115-17 Charles Wedemeyer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison also promoted new methods. From 1964 to 1968, the Carnegie Foundation funded Wedemeyer's Articulated Instructional Media Project (AIM) which brought in a variety of communications technologies aimed at providing learning to an off-campus population.

===Open University===

The Open University in the United Kingdom was founded by the then serving Labour Party government under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, based on the vision of Michael Young. Planning commenced in 1965 under Minister of State for Education Jennie Lee, who established a model for the OU as one of widening access to the highest standards of scholarship in higher education, and set up a planning committee consisting of university vice-chancellors, educationalists and television broadcasters, chaired by Sir Peter Venables. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Assistant Director of Engineering at the time James Redmond, had obtained most of his qualifications at night school, and his natural enthusiasm for the project did much to overcome the technical difficulties of using television to broadcast teaching programmes.
The University revolutionised the scope of the correspondence program and helped to create a respectable learning alternative to the traditional form of education. It has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to improve the distance learning service and is still the largest such institution in the world. Its success helped to hasten the establishment of similar institutions elsewhere, including in the US and Japan.[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief History of Distance Education|author=Bizhan Nasseh|url=http://www.seniornet.org/edu/art/history.html[/tpl] Walter Perry was appointed the OU's first vice-chancellor in January 1969, and its Foundation Secretary was Anastasios Christodoulou. The election of the new Conservative Party government under Prime Minister Edward Heath in 1970 led to budget cuts under Chancellor of the Exchequer Iain Macleod (who had earlier called the idea of an Open University "blithering nonsense")."In 1969, when the idea of The Open University was announced, it was described as "blithering nonsense" by Iain Macleod MP." However, the OU accepted its first 25,000 students in 1971, adopting a radical open admissions policy. At the time, the total student population of conventional universities in the United Kingdom was around 130,000.
Athabasca University, Canada's Open University, was created in 1970 and followed a similar, though independently developed, pattern.[tpl]cite book | last =Byrne | first =T.

In 1976, Bernard Luskin launched Coastline Community College as a college beyond walls, combining computer assisted instruction with telecourses proceed by KOCE TV, the Coast Community College District public television station. Coastline has been a landmark strategic success in helping to establish online distance learning using modern technology for learning.

===Internet===

The widespread use of computers and the internet have made distance learning easier and faster, and today virtual schools and virtual universities deliver full curricula online.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gold |first1=Larry |last2=Maitland |first2=Christine |editor1-first=Ronald A. |editor1-last=Phipps | editor2-first=Jamie P. |editor2-last=Merisotis |title=What's the difference?

Between 2000 and 2008, undergraduate enrollment in at least some distance programs became more and more common. The share of students "in at least one distance education class expanded from 8 percent to 20 percent, and the percentage enrolled in a distance education degree program increased from 2 percent to 4 percent."[tpl]cite web| last= Walton Radford, MPR Associates| first= Alexandria| format = PDF | title= Learning at a Distance: Undergraduate Enrollment in Distance Education Courses and Degree Programs|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012154.pdf|publisher= National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=30 November 2011[/tpl]
Many private, public, non-profit and for-profit institutions worldwide now offer distance education courses from the most basic instruction through the highest levels of degree and doctoral programs. Levels of accreditation vary: Widely respected universities such as Stanford University and Harvard now deliver online courses—but other online schools receive little outside oversight, and some are actually fraudulent, i.e., diploma mills. In the US, the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) specializes in the accreditation of distance education institutions.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.detc.org/accred.html | title = Accreditation | publisher = DETC[/tpl]
In the United States in 2011, it was found that a third of all the students enrolled in postsecondary education had taken an accredited online course in a postsecondary institution.[tpl]cite news|last=Lederman|first=Doug|title=Growth for Online Learning|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/01/08/survey-finds-online-enrollments-slow-continue-grow#.UTpqK6RUk3B.delicious|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=InsideHigherEd|date=8 January 2013[/tpl] Even though growth rates are slow, enrollment for online courses has been seen to increase with the advance in technology. The majority of public and private colleges now offer full academic programs online. These include, but are not limited to, training programs in the mental health,[ref]Blackmore, C., van Deurzen, E., & Tantam, D. (2007).

Distance education has a long history, but its popularity and use has grown exponentially as more advanced technology has become available.  By 2008, online learning programs were available in the United States in 44 states at the K-12 level.Olszewski-Kubilius, Paula; Corwith, Susan. “Distance Education: Where It Started and Where It Stands for Gifted Children and Their Educators.” Gifted Child Today, v. 34 issue 3, 2011, p. 16-24,.
SazmandAsfaranjan, Y., Shirzad, F., Baradari, F., Salimi, M., & Salehi, M. in a 2013 research paper argued that implementation of internet forum, online discussion group and online learning community contribute to an efficacious distance education. Researchers showed that socialization plays the most vital role in effective distance education.

==Technologies==

Although the expansion of the Internet blurs the boundaries, distance education technologies are divided into two modes of delivery: synchronous learning and asynchronous learning.
In synchronous learning, all participants are "present" at the same time. In this regard, it resembles traditional classroom teaching methods despite the participants being located remotely. It requires a timetable to be organized. Web conferencing, videoconferencing, educational television, instructional television are examples of synchronous technology, as are direct-broadcast satellite (DBS), internet radio, live streaming, telephone, and  web-based VoIP.[tpl]cite book |last1=Lever-Duffy |first1=Judy |last2= McDonald |first2= Jean B |others= Ana A. Ciereszko, Al P. Mizell | title= Teaching and Learning with Technology | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=9wxKAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 23 January 2011 | edition = 3rd |date=March 2007 | publisher=Allyn & Bacon | isbn=0-205-51191-0 | page=377[/tpl]
Online meeting software such as Adobe Connect has helped to facilitate meetings in distance learning courses.
In asynchronous learning, participants access course materials flexibly on their own schedules. Students are not required to be together at the same time. Mail correspondence, which is the oldest form of distance education, is an asynchronous delivery technology, as are message board forums, e-mail, video and audio recordings, print materials, voicemail, and fax.
The two methods can be combined. Many courses offered by The Open University use periodic sessions of residential or day teaching to supplement the remote teaching.[tpl]cite book |last1=Burns |first1=Mary | title= Distance Education for Teacher Training: Modes, Models and Methods | url= http://go.edc.org/07xd | accessdate = 10 September 2012[/tpl] The Open University uses a blend of technologies and a blend of learning modalities (face-to-face, distance, and hybrid) all under the rubric of "distance learning."
Distance learning can also use interactive radio instruction (IRI), interactive audio instruction (IAI), online virtual worlds, digital games, webinars, and webcasts, all of which are referred to as eLearning. Media psychology and media studies have evolved as the research area in the study of media effects. Each has grown into important academic areas with graduate degree programs now providing professional research, teaching and field staff to help build understanding of the behavioral implications of media. The first MA, PhD and EdD programs in Media Psychology and Media Studies were launched in 2002 by Bernard Luskin at Fielding Graduate University.

==Benefits==

Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.[tpl]cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series=|issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode=|oclc=|id=|url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format=|accessdate=23 January 2011 [/tpl] Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure. Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.
As the population at large becomes more involved in lifelong learning beyond the normal schooling age, institutions can benefit financially, and adult learning business courses may be particularly lucrative. Distance education programs can act as a catalyst for institutional innovation and are at least as effective as face-to-face learning programs,Blackmore, C., van Deurzen, E., & Tantam, D. (2007). Therapy training online: Using the internet to widen access to training in mental health issues. In T. Stickley & T. Basset (Eds.) Teaching Mental Health (pgs. 337-352). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. especially if the instructor is knowledgeable and skilled.
Distance education can also provide a broader method of communication within the realm of education. With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to "combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning.".[tpl]cite journal |title=Educational Benefits of Online Learning|pages=1–6|year=1998|url=http://blackboardsupport.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/handouts/Ben_Online.pdf|publisher=CalPoly.edu |accessdate=29 March 2013[/tpl]  It has been shown through research that "as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people they construct an individual meaning," which can help students become knowledable of a wide array of viewpoints in education. To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Y. Connie|coauthors=Gay, Geri|title=Homophily of Network Ties and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital in Computer-Mediated Distributed Teams|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|page=1062|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00308.x[/tpl]
The high cost of education affects students in higher education, to which distance education may be an alternative in order to provide some relief. Distance education has been a more cost-effective form of learning, and can sometimes save students a significant amount of money as opposed to traditional education. Distance education may be able to help to save students a considerable amount financially by removing the cost of transportation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldwidelearn.com/education-articles/benefits-of-online-learning.htm |title=Benefits of Online Education |publisher=Worldwidelearn.com |accessdate=2013-04-01[/tpl] In addition, distance education may be able to save students from the economic burden of high-priced course textbooks. Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.
Within the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide. It is able to promote good learning experiences and therefore, allow students to obtain higher satisfaction with their online learning.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kirtman|first=Lisa|title=Online Versus In-Class Courses: An Examination of Differences in Learning Outcomes|journal=Issues in Teacher Education|date=Fall 2009|year=2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=103–115|url=http://www1.chapman.edu/ITE/public_html/ITEFall09/12kirtman.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] For example, students can review their lessons more than once according to their need. Students can then manipulate the coursework to fit their learning by focusing more on their weaker topics while breezing through concepts that they already have or can easily grasp. When course design and the learning environment are at their optimal conditions, distance education can lead students to higher satisfaction with their learning experiences.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sinclaire|first=Jollean K.|title=Student satisfaction with online learning: Lessons from organizational behavior|journal=Research in Higher Education|year=20|month=June|volume=11|url=http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/11825.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] Studies have shown that high satisfaction correlates to increased learning. Students who are enrolled in distance education with high satisfaction in their online coursework are then motivated intrinsically to learn, which often means that their performance in class will improve. For those in a healthcare or mental health distance learning program, online-based interactions have the potential to foster deeper reflections and discussions of client issues as well as a quicker response to client issues, since supervision happens on a regular basis and is not limited to a weekly supervision meeting. This also may contribute to the students feeling a greater sense of support, since they have ongoing and regular access to their instructors and other students.
Distance learning may enable students who are unable to attend a traditional school setting, due to disability or illness such as decreased mobility and immune system suppression, to get a good education.[tpl]cite web|title=An Exploration of the Representation of Students with Disabilities in Distance Education|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter144/woods_maiden_brandes144.html|accessdate=7 December 2012[/tpl] Distance education may provide equal access regardless of socioeconomic status or income, area of residence, gender, race, age, or cost per student.[tpl]cite web |url=http://madamenoire.com/105928/cyber-charter-schools-the-end-of-public-education-or-a-new-beginning |title=Cyber-charter Schools: The end of Public Education or a New Beginning[/tpl] Applying universal design strategies to distance learning courses as they are being developed (rather than instituting accommodations for specific students on an as-needed basis) can increase the accessibility of such courses to students with a range of abilities, disabilities, learning styles, and native languages.Burgstahler, S.,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Technology/equal_access_uddl.html |title=Equal Access: Universal Design of Distance Learning |accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl]

Distance Learning may also offer a final opportunity for adolescences that are no longer permitted in the General Education population due to behavior disorders. Instead of these students having no other academic opportunities, they may continue their education from their homes and earn their diplomas, offering them another chance to be an integral part of society.

==Criticism==

Barriers to effective distance education include obstacles such as domestic distractions and unreliable technology,[tpl]cite web|last=Östlund|first=Berit|title=Stress, disruption and community — Adult learners' experiences of obstacles and opportunities in distance education|url=http://www.eurodl.org/index.php?p=&sp=full&article=179|publisher=Department of Child and Youth Education, Special Education and Counselling, Umeå University|accessdate=3 December 2011[/tpl]  as well as students' program costs, adequate contact with teachers and support services, and a need for more experience.[tpl]cite web |first=Jill M. |last=Galusha |title=Barriers to Learning in Distance Education |url=http://www.infrastruction.com/barriers.htm |accessdate=2012-04-10[/tpl]
Some students attempt to participate in distance education without proper training of the tools needed to be successful in the program.  Students must be provided with training on each tool that is used throughout the program.  The lack of advanced technology skills can lead to an unsuccessful experience.  Schools have a responsibility to adopt a proactive policy for managing technology barriers.[tpl]cite web |last=Stephens |first=D. |date=July 2007 |title=Quality issues in distance learning |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf[/tpl]
The results of a study of Washington state community college students showed that distance learning students tended to drop out more often than their traditional counterparts due to difficulties in language, time management, and study skills.http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html?UID=872
Distance Learning benefits may outweigh the disadvantages for students in such a technology driven society however before indulging into e-learning a few more disadvantages should be considered.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Some[tpl]who|date=January 2014[/tpl] say a negative to distance education is the lack of social interaction.
Not all courses required to complete a degree may be offered online. Health care profession programs in particular, require some sort of patient interaction through field work before a student may graduate.http://www.distancelearningnet.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-distance-learning/ Studies have also shown that students pursuing a medical professional graduate degree who are participating in distance education courses, favor face to face communication over professor-mediated chat rooms and/or independent studies. However, this is little to correlation between student performance when comparing the previous different distance learning strategies.name="Jedlicka, J. S. 2002">Jedlicka, J. S., Brown, S. W., Bunch, A. E., & Jaffe, L. E. (2002). A comparison of distance education instructional methods in occupational therapy. Journal of Allied Health, 31(4), 247-251.
There is a theoretical problem about the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. Daniel Barwick noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.[tpl]cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl] Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for MOOCs.
Finally, there may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment. Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program, especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.

==Distance e-Learning==

Distance e-Learning or DeL, is the combination of Distance Education and e-Learning which is characterized by the extensive use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the delivery of education and instruction and the use of synchronous and asynchronous online communication in an interactive learning environment or virtual communities, in lieu of a physical classroom, to bridge the gap in temporal or spatial constraints. Distance e-Learning combines the strengths and advantages of Distance Education and e-Learning. "The focus is shifted to the education transaction in the form of virtual community of learners sustainable across time."Garrison, D.R. (2011, 20 May). E-Learning in the 21st Century: A Framework for Research and Practice. New York: Taylor & Francis. ISBN 0-203-83876-9
The Distance Education model has its traditional focus on content delivery or correspondence, and emphasis on independent learning. Distance e-Learning has its roots on computer conferencing and collaborative constructivist learning approach; it encourages collaboration in an interactive learning environment. Distance e-Learning is also different from e-Learning. Distance e-Learning goes beyond the use of ICT as tools to access information which primarily characterizes e-Learning use in classroom teaching or in the residential setting.
One of the most significant issues encountered in the mainstream correspondence model of Distance Education is transactional distance. Transactional distance results from the lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in Distance Education. Distance Education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. Service providers began to use e-Learning, the generic term for all technologically supported learning, to deliver online courses or tutorial services. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of Information and Communication Technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002. Greater Learning Opportunities Through Distance Education: Experiences in Indonesia and the Philippines. Journal of Southeast Asian Education, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 283-320. Retrieved from http://www.seameo-journal.com/journal/index.php/education/article/viewFile/39/38 The increase in utilization of ICT, particularly the Internet, ushered in a new era in course design and delivery of instruction in ways never before experienced in the mainstream model of Distance Education and traditional education paradigms. The marriage of the two concepts, Distance Education and e-Learning, marked a new strategy in delivering courseware for academic programs and other learning resources developed by Open Universities and conventional educational institutions.
