A squish toy cow, travels in a yellow backpack. She asks various misidentified farm animals how to get home, because she is very confused and not really smart. Back home, she talks to her family which are a penguin doorstep, a hippo vase, and a vegetable brush. Her aunt, a vegetable brush, suggests that she write books about her adventures. That causes the toy cow to become famous and appear on TV.
