A native of the Ruther Glen, Virginia, the 6'5", 210-pound shooting guard was the two-time Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, first as a junior in 1998–99 and again as a senior the following year.

He played in 82 career games for a per-game average of 20.8 points per game. His 23.5 points per game average as a junior led the MEAC and was also the fifth-highest in all of NCAA Division I, while his 20.9 per game average as a senior led the MEAC once again. 
After college, Woolfolk had a stint playing for the short-lived Tampa Bay ThunderDawgs in the American Basketball Association, whose franchise lasted for only the 2000–01 season.
