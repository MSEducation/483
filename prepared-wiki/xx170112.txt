[[Remote sensing application]]

CATEGORIES: Remote sensing, Geographic information systems, GIS software

A remote sensing application is a software application that processes remote sensing data. Remote sensing applications are similar to graphics software, but they enable generating geographic information from satellite and airborne sensor data. Remote sensing applications read specialized file formats that contain sensor image data, georeferencing information, and sensor metadata. Some of the more popular remote sensing file formats include: GeoTIFF, NITF, JPEG 2000, ECW (file format), MrSID, HDF, and NetCDF.
Remote Sensing applications perform many features including:
Many remote sensing applications are built using common remote sensing toolkits, like GDAL and OSSIM.
