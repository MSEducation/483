[tpl]Hinduism small[/tpl]Samādhi (Sanskrit: [tpl]lang|sa|समाधि[/tpl]) in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and yogic schools is a higher level of concentrated meditation, or dhyāna. In the yoga tradition, it is the eighth and final limb identified in the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali.
It has been described as a non-dualistic state of consciousness in which the consciousness of the experiencing subject becomes one with the experienced object,Diener Michael S. ,Erhard Franz-Karl and Fischer-Schreiber Ingrid, The Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen, ISBN 0-87773-520-4 and in which the mind becomes still, one-pointed or concentratedDictionary.com (links directly to samadhi definition) while the person remains conscious. In Buddhism, it can also refer to  an abiding in which mind becomes very still but does not merge with the object of attention, and is thus able to observe and gain insight into the changing flow of experience.Richard Shankman, The Experience of Samadhi - an in depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation, Shambala publications 2008
In Hinduism, samādhi can also refer to videha mukti or the complete absorption of the individual consciousness in the self at the time of death - usually referred to as mahasamādhi.

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==

Samadhi (समाधि samādhi, [tpl]IPA-hns|səˈmaːd̪ʱi|hi[/tpl]) is the state of consciousness induced by complete meditation. The term's etymology involves "sam" (together or integrated), "ā" (towards), and "dhā" (to get, to hold). Thus the result might be seen to be "to acquire integration or wholeness, or truth" (samāpatti).
Another possible etymological analysis of "samādhi" is "samā" (even) and "dhi" (intellect), a state of total equilibrium ("samā") of a detached intellect ("dhi").

==Hinduism==

Samādhi is the main subject of the first part of the Yoga Sūtras called Samādhi-pada. Vyāsa, a major figure in Hinduism and one of the traditional authors of the Mahābharata, says in his commentary on verse 1.1 of the Yoga Sūtras that "yoga is samādhi."This has widely been misstated in many places, including previous versions of this web page, as coming from the Mahābharata instead of Yoga Sutras 1.1 This is generally interpreted to mean that samādhi is a state of complete control (samadhana) over the functions and distractions of consciousness.
Samādhi is described in different ways within Hinduism such as the state of being aware of one’s existence without thinking, in a state of undifferentiated “beingness" or as an altered state of consciousness that is characterized by bliss (ānanda) and joy (sukha). Nisargadatta Maharaj describes the state in the following manner:
The initial experience of it is enlightenment and it is the beginning of the process of meditating to attain self-realization (tapas). "There is a difference between the enlightenment of samādhi and self-realization. When a person achieves enlightenment, that person starts doing tapas to realize the self."Thomas L. Palotas, Divine Play: the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi (Lotus Press, 2006, ISBN 0-9760783-0-9), pp.45, 77-79.
According to Patañjali[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yogapoint.com/info/samadhi.htm |title=Samadhi - A Scientific Phenomenon? |publisher=yogapoint.com |author= Parikshiti Mhaispurkar[/tpl] samādhi has three different categories:
Entering samādhi initially takes great training and willpower, and maintaining it takes even more will. The beginning stages of samādhi (laya and savikalpa samādhi) are only temporary. By "effort" it is not meant that the mind has to work more. Instead, it means work to control the mind and release the self. Note that normal levels of meditation (mostly the lower levels) can be held automatically, as in "being in the state of meditation" rather than overtly "meditating."[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2010[/tpl] The ability to obtain positive results from meditation is much more difficult than simply meditating.[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2010[/tpl] It is recommended to find a qualified spiritual master (guru or yogi) who can teach a meditator about the workings of the mind. As one self-realized yogi explained, "You can meditate but after some time you will get stuck at some point. That is the time you need a guru. Otherwise, without a Guru, chances are very slim."[tpl]cite book |first=Thomas |last=Palotas |title=Divine Play: the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi |publisher=Lotus Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-9760783-0-9 |page=226[/tpl]
Samādhi is the only stable unchanging reality; all else is ever-changing and does not bring everlasting peace or happiness.
Staying in nirvikalpa samādhi is effortless but even from this condition one must eventually return to ego-consciousness. Otherwise this highest level of samādhi leads to nirvāṇa, which means total unity, the logical end of individual identity and also death of the body. However, it is entirely possible to stay in nirvikalpa samādhi and yet be fully functional in this world. This condition is known as sahājā nirvikalpa samādhi or sahājā samādhi. According to Ramana Maharshi, "Remaining in the primal, pure natural state without effort is sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi".

===Leaving the body===

Yogis are said to attain the final liberation or videha mukti after leaving their bodies at the time of death. It is at this time that the soul knows a complete and unbroken union with the divine, and, being free from the limitations of the body, merges effortlessly into the transcendent Self.  Mahāsamādhi (literally great samādhi) is a term often used for this final absorption into the Self at death.

===Mausoleum===

thumb|right|160px|Samadhi mandir of Anandamayi Ma, Kankhal, HaridwarSamadhi mandir is also the Hindi name for a temple commemorating the dead (similar to a mausoleum), which may or may not contain the body of the deceased. Samādhi sites are often built in this way to honour people regarded as saints or gurus in Hindu religious traditions, wherein such souls are said to have passed into mahāsamādhi, (or were already in) samādhi at the time of death.

===I.K. Taimni===

I. K. Taimni, in The Science of Yoga,I.K. Taimni, The Science of Yoga: The Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali in Sanskrit , ISBN 978-81-7059-211-2 Taimni's commentary on Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, provides a lucid and precise understanding of samadhi.  In simple terms, Taimni defines samadhi as "knowing by becoming".  Samadhi, as pointed out above, is the eighth arm of Patanjali's Ashtanga (eight limbed) yoga.  The last three of the eight limbs are called Antaranga, or Internal yoga, meaning they occur solely in the mind of the yogin. The three limbs are: dharana, dhyana and samadhi.  Together, the three are collectively called samyama.  Dharana, dhyana and samadhi are sometimes translated as concentration, contemplation, and meditation, respectively.  These translations do not shed any light on the nature of dharana, dhyana and samadhi.  Dharana, dhyana and samadhi are altered states of consciousness and have no direct counterpart in normal waking experience, according to Taimni's explanation of them.
According to Taimni, dharana, dhyana and samadhi form a graded series.
Samadhi can be compared to normal thought as a laser beam can be compared to normal light.  Normal light is diffuse.  A laser beam is highly concentrated light. The laser beam contains power that normal light does not.  Similarly, samadhi is the mind in its most concentrated state. The mind in samadhi possess power than a normal mind does not.  This power is used by the yogin to reveal the essence of the pratyaya.  This essence is called the artha of the pratyaya.  The release of the artha of the pratyaya  is similar to cracking open the shell of a seed to discover the essential elements of the seed, the genetic material, protected by the shell.
Once perfected, samadhi is the main tool used by a yogin to penetrate into the deeper layers of consciousness and seek the center of the yogin's consciousness.  Upon finding this center, the final act is using a variant form of samadhi, called dharma mega samadhi, to penetrate the center of consciousness and emerge through this center into Kaivalya. Kaivalya is the term used by Patanjali to designate the state of Absolute consciousness free from all fetters and limitations.
Thus it can be seen that, according to Taimni's interpretation of the Yoga Sutras, samadhi is the main tool the yogin uses to achieve the end goal of yoga, the joining of the individual self with the Universal Absolute.

==Buddhism==

Samādhi, or concentration of the mind, is the 3rd  division of the eightfold path of the Buddha's threefold training: wisdom (pañña), conduct (sīla), Samādhi (Buddhism) (samādhi) - within which it is developed by samatha meditation. Some Buddhist schools teach of 40 different object  meditations, according to the Visuddhimagga, a medieval commentarial text. These objects include meditations on the breath (anapanasati), loving kindness (metta) and various colours, earth, fire, etc. (kasiṇa).
Important components of Buddhist meditation, frequently discussed by the Buddha, are the successively higher meditative states known as the four jhānas which in the language of the eight-fold path, are "right concentration". Right concentration has also been characterised in the Maha-cattarisaka Sutta as concentration arising due to the previous seven steps of the noble eightfold path.("The Great Forty," MN 117)
Four developments of samādhi are mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
Post-canonical Pali literature identifies three different types of samādhi:
Not all types of samādhi are recommended either. Those which focus and multiply the five hindrances are not suitable for development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.108.than.html#concen|title=Gopaka Moggallana Sutta|accessdate=2008-01-15[/tpl]
The Buddhist suttas also mention that samādhi practitioners may develop supernormal powers (abhijñā, also see siddhis) and list several that the Buddha developed, but warn that these should not be allowed to distract the practitioner from the larger goal of complete freedom from suffering.
The bliss of samādhi is not the goal of Buddhism; but it remains an important tool in reaching the goal of enlightenment. Later Buddhist schools would eventually teach entirely different meditation methods for cultivating Samatha - the quality of tranquility -  than for developing vipassana - the quality of insight. However, the earliest Buddhist Canons make it clear that these two qualities are developed by the same practice, namely Jhāna via the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html|title=Samadhi Sutta|accessdate=2008-01-15[/tpl]

==Sikhism==

In Sikhism the word is used to refer to an action that one uses to remember and fix one's mind and soul on Waheguru.
The Sri Guru Granth Sahib informs "Remember in meditation the Almighty Lord, every moment and every instant; meditate on God in the celestial peace of Samadhi." (p 508)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]. So to meditate and remember the Almighty at all times in one's mind takes the person into a state of Samadhi. Also “I am attached to God in celestial Samadhi.” (p 865)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl] tells us that by carrying out the correct practices, the mind reaches a higher plane of awareness or Samadhi. The Sikh Scriptures advises the Sikh to keep the mind aware and the consciousness focused on the Lord at all times thus: “The most worthy Samadhi is to keep the consciousness stable and focused on Him.” (p 932)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The term Samadhi refers to a state of mind rather than a physical position of the body. Although, it has to be said that you can sit in meditation and also be in a state of Samadhi.  The Scriptures explain: “I am absorbed in celestial Samadhi, lovingly attached to the Lord forever. I live by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord” (p 1232)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl] and also “Night and day, they ravish and enjoy the Lord within their hearts; they are intuitively absorbed in Samadhi. ||2||” (p 1259)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]. Further, the Sikh Gurus inform their followers: "Some remain absorbed in Samadhi, their minds fixed lovingly on the One Lord; they reflect only on the Word of the Shabad." (p503)[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]
