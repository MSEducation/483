Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Health is a UK cabinet position responsible for the Department of Health. Since devolution in 1999, the position holder's responsibility for the health service is mainly restricted to England, with the holder's counterparts in Scotland and Wales responsible for the NHS in those countries. Prior to devolution the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales had those respective responsibilities but the Department of Health had a larger role than now in the co-ordination of health policy across Great Britain. Health services in Northern Ireland have always had separate arrangements from the rest of the UK, and are currently the responsibility of the Health Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.
The first Boards of Health were created by Orders in Council dated 21 June 14 November, and 21 November 1831. In 1848 a General Board of Health was created with the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests as its President. In 1854 this Board was reconstituted and the President appointed separately. However, the Board was abolished in 1858 and its function of overseeing the local boards was  transferred to a new Local Government Act Office within the Home Office. From 1871 that function was transferred to the new  Local Government Board.
The Ministry of Health was created in 1919 as a reconstruction of the Local Government Board.  Local government functions were eventually transferred to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, leaving the Health Ministry in charge of Health proper.
From 1968 it was amalgamated with the Ministry of Social Security under the Secretary of State for Social Services, until a de-merger of the Department of Health and Social Security on 25 July 1988.
