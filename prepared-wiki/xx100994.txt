===John Pizer===

left|60px|John PizerJohn Pizer or Piser (c. 1850–1897) was a Polish Jew who worked as a bootmaker in Whitechapel. After the murders of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman in late August and early September 1888 respectively, Police Sergeant William Thicke arrested Pizer on 10 September 1888. Pizer was known as "Leather Apron", and Thicke apparently believed that he had committed a string of minor assaults on prostitutes. In the early days of the Whitechapel murders, many locals suspected that "Leather Apron" was the killer, even though the investigating inspector reported that "there is no evidence whatsoever against him".Report by Inspector Joseph Helson, CID 'J' Division, in the Metropolitan Police archive, MEPO 3/140 ff. 235–8, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 99 and Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 24 He was cleared of suspicion when it turned out that he had alibis for two of the murders. He was staying with relatives at the time of one of the canonical murders, and he was talking with a police officer while watching a spectacular fire on the London Docks at the time of another.Rumbelow, p. 49 Pizer and Thicke had known each other for years,Whitehead and Rivett, p. 48 and Pizer implied that his arrest was based on animosity rather than evidence, though he did have a prior conviction for a stabbing offence.Marriott, p. 251 Pizer successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had named him as the murderer.O'Connor, T. P. (1929). Memoirs of an Old Parliamentarian. London: Ernest Benn. Vol. 2, p. 257, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 166 and Cook, Jack the Ripper, pp. 72–73 (Thicke himself was accused of being the Ripper by H. T. Haslewood of Tottenham in a letter to the Home Office dated 10 September 1889. The presumably malicious accusation was dismissed as without foundation.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213)

===James Thomas Sadler===

Sadler was a friend of Frances Coles, the last victim added to the Whitechapel murders police file. Coles was killed with a wound to the throat on 13 February 1891. Sadler was arrested, but there was little evidence against him. Though briefly considered by the police as a Ripper suspect, he was at sea at the time of the earlier murders, and was released without charge.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 218–222; Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 141 Sadler was named in Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum in connection with Coles' murder. Though Macnaghten thought Sadler "was a man of ungovernable temper and entirely addicted to drink, and the company of the lowest prostitutes", he thought any connection with the Ripper was unlikely.Macnaghten's notes quoted in Rumbelow, p.143

===Francis Tumblety===

left|60px|Francis TumbletyFrancis Tumblety (c. 1833–1903) earned a small fortune posing as an "Indian Herb" doctor throughout the United States and Canada, and was commonly perceived as a misogynist and a  quack.Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 He was connected to the death of one of his patients,Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 611–616; Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 but escaped prosecution.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 In 1865, he was arrested for complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but was released without charge.Roscoe, Theodore (1959) The Web of Conspiracy, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., pp. 301-302, 502. Tumblety was in England in 1888, and was arrested on 7 November, apparently for engaging in homosexuality, which was illegal at the time.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 621 Awaiting trial, he fled to France and then to the United States.News dispatch in Ludington Record, 20 December 1888. Already notorious in the States for his self-promotion and previous criminal charges, his arrest was reported as connected to the Ripper murders."Something About Dr. Tumblety." The New York Times, 23 November 1888, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 266 American reports that Scotland Yard tried to extradite him were not confirmed by the British press or the London police,Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 616 and the New York City Police said, "there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is under bond in London is not extraditable".Chief Inspector Byrnes quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 280 In 1913, Tumblety was mentioned as a Ripper suspect by Chief Inspector John Littlechild of the Metropolitan Police Service in a letter to journalist and author George R. Sims.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 203

==Contemporaneous press and public opinion==

The Whitechapel murders were featured heavily in the media, and attracted the attention of Victorian society at large. Journalists, letter writers, and amateur detectives all suggested names either in press or to the police. Most were not and could not be taken seriously.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 165; Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 105; Rumbelow, pp. 105–116 For example, at the time of the murders Richard Mansfield, a famous actor, starred in a theatrical version of Robert Louis Stevenson's book Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The subject matter of horrific murder in the London streets and Mansfield's convincing portrayal led letter writers to accuse him of being the Ripper.Letter dated 5 October 1888 from "M.P." to City of London Police, Corporation of London Records Office, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 277 and Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 149; letter dated 4 October 1888 from Mrs S Luckett of 10 Somerford Grove to City of London Police, Corporation of London Records Office, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 283

===William Henry Bury===

left|60px|William Henry BuryWilliam Henry Bury (25 May 1859 – 24 April 1889) had recently moved to Dundee from the East End of London, when he strangled his wife Ellen Elliott, a former prostitute, on 4 February 1889. He inflicted extensive wounds to her abdomen after she was dead and packed the body into a trunk. On 10 February, Bury went to the local police and told them his wife had committed suicide. He was arrested, tried, found guilty of her murder, and hanged in Dundee. A link with the Ripper crimes was investigated by police, but Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's homicide. Nevertheless, the hangman, James Berry, promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, pp. 207–208

===Thomas Neill Cream===

left|60px|Dr Thomas Neil CreamDr Thomas Neill Cream (27 May 1850 – 15 November 1892) was a doctor secretly specialising in abortions. He was born in Glasgow, educated in London and Canada, and entered practice in Canada and later in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881 he was found guilty of the fatal poisoning of his mistress's husband.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 209 He was imprisoned in the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois, from November 1881 until his release on good behaviour on 31 July 1891. He moved to London, where he resumed killing and was soon arrested. He was hanged on 15 November 1892 at Newgate Prison. According to some sources, his last words were reported as being "I am Jack the...", interpreted to mean Jack the Ripper.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 212; Rumbelow, p. 206 However, police officials who attended the execution made no mention of this alleged interrupted confession. As he was still imprisoned at the time of the Ripper murders, most authorities consider it impossible for him to be the culprit. However, Donald Bell suggested that he could have bribed officials and left the prison before his official release,Bell, Donald (1974), "Jack the Ripper – The Final Solution?", The Criminologist vol. 9, no. 33, quoted in Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 212 and Rumbelow, pp. 206–207 and Sir Edward Marshall-Hall suspected that his prison term may have been served by a look-alike in his place.Marjoribanks, Edward, The Life of Sir Edward Marshall Hall, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 208 Such notions are unlikely, and contradict evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream's solicitors, Cream's family and Cream himself.Rumbelow, pp. 206–208

===Thomas Hayne Cutbush===

Thomas Hayne Cutbush (1865–1903) was sent to Lambeth Infirmary in 1891 suffering delusions thought to have been caused by syphilis.Rumbelow, pp. 141–142 After stabbing a woman in the backside and attempting to stab a second he was pronounced insane and committed to Broadmoor Hospital in 1891, where he remained until his death in 1903.[tpl]cite news | last = Moore | first = Wendy | coauthors = Leach, Ben | title = Broadmoor files could unmask Jack the Ripper | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date=8 November 2008 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3407268/Broadmoor-files-could-unmask-Jack-the-Ripper.html | accessdate = 22 January 2010 | location=London[/tpl] The Sun newspaper suggested in a series of articles in 1894 that Cutbush was the Ripper. There is no evidence that police took the idea seriously, and Melville Macnaghten's memorandum naming the three police suspects Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog was written to refute the idea that Cutbush was the Ripper.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 284; Cook, pp. 198–199; Marriott, p.235; Rumbelow, pp.141–142; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 105, 110 Cutbush was the suspect advanced in the 1993 book Jack the Myth by A. P. Wolf, who suggested that Macnaghten wrote his memo to protect Cutbush's uncle who was a fellow police officer,Quoted in Whitehead and Rivett, p. 110 and another recent writer, Peter Hodgson, considers that Cutbush is the most likely candidate.Hodgson, Peter Jack the Ripper Through the Mists of Time

===Frederick Bailey Deeming===

left|60px|Frederick Bailey DeemingFrederick Bailey Deeming (30 July 1842 – 23 May 1892) murdered his first wife and four children in Rainhill near St. Helens, Lancashire, in 1891. His crimes went undiscovered and later that year he emigrated to Australia with his second wife, whom he then also murdered. Her body was found buried under their house, and the subsequent investigation led to the discovery of the other bodies in England. He was arrested, sent to trial, and found guilty. He boasted in jail that he was Jack the Ripper, but he was either imprisonedFido, p. 182; Rumbelow, p. 268 or in South AfricaEvans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 214 at the time of the Ripper murders. The police denied any connection between Deeming and the Ripper.Pall Mall Gazette, 8 April 1892, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 577–578 He was executed by hanging in Melbourne.[tpl]cite news|title=Deeming at the Gallows; The Wife Murderer Hanged at Melbourne This Morning|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 May 1892|page=1[/tpl]

===Carl Feigenbaum===

Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum (executed 27 April 1896) was a German merchant seaman arrested in 1894 in New York City for cutting the throat of Mrs Juliana Hoffmann. After his execution, his lawyer, William Sanford Lawton, claimed that Feigenbaum had admitted to having a hatred of women and a desire to kill and mutilate them. Lawton further stated that he believed Feigenbaum was Jack the Ripper. Though covered by the press at the time, the idea was not pursued for more than a century. Using Lawton's accusation as a base, author Trevor Marriott, a former British murder squad detective, argued that Feigenbaum was responsible for the Ripper murders as well as other murders in the United States and Germany between 1891 and 1894.In the second edition of his book, Jack The Ripper: The 21st Century Investigation (John Blake Publishing, 2007) ISBN 978-1-84454-370-0 According to Wolf Vanderlinden, some of the murders listed by Marriott did not actually occur; the newspapers often embellished or created Ripper-like stories to sell copy. Lawton's accusations were disputed by a partner in his legal firm, Hugh O. Pentecost, and there is no proof that Feigenbaum was in Whitechapel at the time of the murders.Vanderlinden, Wolf (2008). "Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum: An Old Suspect Resurfaces", in Ripper Notes: The Legend Continues, Inklings Press, pp. 4–24, ISBN 978-0-9789112-2-5

===Robert Donston Stephenson===

left|60px|Robert D'Onston StephensonRobert Donston Stephenson (alias Roslyn D'Onston Stephenson) (20 April 1841 – 9 October 1916) was a journalist and writer interested in the occult and black magic. He admitted himself as a patient at the London Hospital in Whitechapel shortly before the murders started, and left shortly after they ceased. He authored a newspaper article, which claimed that black magic was the motive for the killings and alleged that the Ripper was a Frenchman.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 179–181 Stephenson's strange manner and interest in the crimes resulted in an amateur detective reporting him to Scotland Yard on Christmas Eve, 1888.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 608–609 Two days later Stephenson reported his own suspect, a Dr Morgan Davies of the London Hospital.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 606–608 Subsequently he fell under the suspicion of newspaper editor William Thomas Stead. In his books on the case, author and historian Melvin Harris argued that Stephenson was a leading suspect,Rumbelow, pp. 254–258; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 181–182 but the police do not appear to have treated either him or Dr Davies as serious suspects.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 204 London Hospital night-shift rosters and practices indicate that D'Onston was not able to leave on the nights of the murders and hence could not have been Jack the Ripper.Dimolianis, chapter 4

==Proposed by later authors==

Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names, who were not considered in the police investigation at all. As everyone alive at the time is now dead, modern authors are free to accuse anyone they can, "without any need for any supporting historical evidence".Evans and Rumblelow, p. 261 Most of their suggestions cannot be taken seriously, and include English novelist George Gissing, British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and syphilitic artist Frank Miles.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 115

===Joseph Barnett===

left|60px|Joseph BarnettJoseph Barnett (c. 1858–1927) was a former fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and separated after he lost his job and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution.Rumbelow, p. 262; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 122–123 Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make it look like a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him.Rumbelow, p. 262 Other acquaintances of Kelly's put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 123

===Lewis Carroll===

left|60px|Lewis CarrollLewis Carroll (pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) (27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898) was the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. He was named as a suspect based upon anagrams which author Richard Wallace devised for his book Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend. This claim is not taken seriously by scholars.Woods and Baddeley, p. 61[tpl]clear[/tpl]

===David Cohen===

David Cohen (1865–1889) was a Polish Jew whose incarceration at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum roughly coincided with the end of the murders. Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist Martin Fido in his book The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper (1987). Fido claimed that the name "David Cohen" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that "John Doe" is used in the United States today.Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp.180–181 Fido identified Cohen with "Leather Apron" (see John Pizer above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888—the same time that Cohen appeared.Fido, pp. 215–219 Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see Aaron Kosminski above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.Fido, p. 220 In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI criminal profiler John Douglas has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person "known to the police as David Cohen ... or someone very much like him".[tpl]cite book|author=Douglas, John; Olshaker, Mark|year=2001|title=The Cases That Haunt Us |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=79–80|isbn=978-0-7432-1239-7[/tpl]

===William Withey Gull===

left|60px|Sir William Withey GullSir William Withey Gull (31 December 1816 – 29 January 1890) was physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria. He was named as the Ripper as part of the evolution of the widely discredited Masonic/royal conspiracy theory outlined in such books as Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. Coachman John Netley has been named as his accomplice. Thanks to the popularity of this theory among fiction writers and for its dramatic nature, Gull shows up as the Ripper in a number of books and films (including the 1988 TV film Jack the Ripper starring Michael Caine; and the 2000 graphic novel, compiled from the comic book series that ran from 1991 to 1996, From Hell written by Alan Moore with art by Eddie Campbell, as well as its 2001 subsequent film adaptation). Conventional historians have never taken him seriously as a suspect due to sheer lack of evidence; in addition, he was in his seventies at the time of the murders and had recently suffered a stroke.

===George Hutchinson===

George Hutchinson was a labourer. On 12 November 1888, he went to the London police to make a statement claiming that on 9 November 1888 he watched the room that Mary Jane Kelly lived in after he saw her with a man of conspicuous appearance. He gave a very detailed description of a suspect despite the darkness of that night.Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190–192; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 376–377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263 The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was later disputed among the senior police of the time. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230–2, quoted in Begg,Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 238–239 and Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 377–378 However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.Cook, Jack the Ripper, p. 176 Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.Marriott, p. 263

===James Kelly===

left|60px|James KellyJames Kelly (20 April 1860 – 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's "Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation" (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper, by Jim Tully, in 1997.Tully, Jim,  Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper .
James Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the Broadmoor Asylum, from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes.
Retired NYPD cold-case detective Ed Norris examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel program called "Jack the Ripper in America". In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. He worked as a furniture upholsterer, a job that requires strong handiness with a large knife. His escape from Broadmoor before the first of the five canonical murders and eventual escape to America after the last meant Kelly was in or around London at the right time. He also claimed to have resided in the United States and left behind a journal that spoke of his strong disapproval of the immorality of prostitutes and of his having been on the "warpath" during his time as a fugitive. Norris further argues Kelly was in New York at the time of a Ripper-like murder of a prostitute named Carrie Brown as well as in a number of cities while each experienced, according to Norris, one or two brutal murders of prostitutes while Kelly was there. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.

===James Maybrick===

left|60px|James MaybrickJames Maybrick (24 October 1838 – 11 May 1889) was a Liverpool cotton merchant. His wife Florence was convicted of poisoning him with arsenic in a sensational, and possibly unjust, trial presided over by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the father of another modern suspect James Kenneth Stephen.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 124 In her book, Jack the Ripper: The American Connection author Shirley Harrison asserted James Maybrick was both Jack the Ripper and the Servant Girl Annihilator of Austin, Texas. A diary purportedly by Maybrick, published in the 1990s by Michael Barrett, contains a confession to the Ripper murders. In 1995, Barrett confessed to writing the diary himself, and described the process of counterfeiting the diary in detail. He swore under oath that he and his wife, Anne, had forged it.Affidavit of Michael Barrett, 5 January 1995, quoted in Marriott, pp.272–277 Anne Barrett, after their divorce, later denied forgery, and their story changed several times over the years. The diary was discredited by historians who pointed to factual errors in relation to some of the crimes,Whitehead and Rivett, p. 125 and document experts pronounced the diary a fake; the handwriting does not match that of Maybrick's will,Marriott, p.272; Rumbelow, pp.252–253 and the ink contains a preservative not marketed until 1974.Rumbelow, p.251

===Alexander Pedachenko===

Alexander Pedachenko (alleged dates 1857–1908) was named in the 1923 memoirs of William Le Queux, Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks. Le Queux claimed to have seen a manuscript in French written by Rasputin stating that Jack the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko, an agent of the Okhrana (the Secret Police of Imperial Russia), whose aim in committing the murders was to discredit Scotland Yard. He was supposedly assisted by two accomplices: "Levitski" and a tailoress called Winberg.Le Queux, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 197 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 103 However, there is no hard evidence that Pedachenko ever existed, and many parts of the story as recounted by Le Queux fall apart when examined closely.Begg, p. 309 For example, one of the sources named in the manuscript was a London-based Russian journalist called Nideroest, who was known for inventing sensational stories. Reviewers of Le Queux's book were aware of Nideroest's background, and unabashedly referred to him as an "unscrupulous liar".Quoted in Rumbelow, p.198 Pedachenko was promoted as a suspect by Donald McCormick, who may have developed the story by adding his own inventions.Woods and Baddeley, p. 147

===Walter Sickert===

left|60px|Walter SickertWalter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 – 22 January 1942) was a German-born artist of British and Danish ancestry, who was first mentioned as a possible Ripper suspect in Donald McCormick's 1959 book The Identity of Jack the Ripper.Knight, p.250 He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, going so far as to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings. Sickert subsequently appeared as a character in the well-known royal/masonic conspiracy theory concocted by Joseph Gorman, who claimed to be Sickert's illegitimate son.Baron, Wendy (September 2004). "Sickert, Walter Richard (1860–1942)". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Accessed 18 June 2008. (Subscription required) The theory was later developed by author Jean Overton Fuller, and by crime novelist Patricia Cornwell in her book Portrait of a Killer. However, Sickert is not considered a serious suspect by most who study the case, and strong evidence shows he was in France at the time of most of the Ripper murders.[ref]
