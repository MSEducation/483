The game was described as "playable" and "addictive" although there were concerns about its long-term appeal.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue26/Pages/Crash2600134.jpg
Rick Robson, writing in Your Sinclair magazine was less positive, awarding it a score of 6/10, stating that "True Hill fans will lament the absence of Hills Angels and the risky jokes but if you prefer being chased to chaste, this is the one for you, poor soul".http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/bennyhill.htm
