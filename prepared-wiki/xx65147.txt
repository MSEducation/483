==Name and history==

There is no reliable information when and where the settlement on which foundations was build Vranje. It is assumed that it happened during Roman or Greek period and the region itself was inhabited by various Ilyrian and Thracian tribes. One thing was clear, that region where Vranje is located was very important, because many caravan roads and armies who went north passed through Vranje valley.
The Romans conquered the region in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC. Vranje was part of Moesia Superior and Dardania during the Roman rule. The Roman fortresses in the Vranje region was abandoned during the Hun attacks in 539–544 AD, these include the localities of Kale at Vranjska Banja, Gradište in Korbevac and Gradište in Prvonek.[tpl]cite web|last=Janković|first=Đorđe|title=The Slavs in the 6th century North Illyricum|url=http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/delo/13047|work=Projekat Rastko|accessdate=29 September 2013|location=Belgrade|language=Serbian|quote=Trial excavations of early Byzantine forts, conducted around Vranje in 2003, show that they were abandoned as early as in the course of the 6th century. These are the localities of Kale above Vranjska Banja and Gradište in Korbevac (Радичевић, Стојчић et al. 2004). Judging by surface findings, the case is the same with Gradište in Prvonek east of Vranjska Banja. The general impression is that all these forts are single-layered – that they were built and demolished at the same time. The same roofing tiles on all three sites, the thinness of the cultural layer and the similarity of pottery show this. The absence of animal bones is notable. Kale was destroyed in a fire, whereas Gradište conveys the impression of having been abandoned. The found pottery fragments are similar to others from North Illyricum, dated to the second and third quarter of the 6th century; there is no such pottery in the strata of the time of the reconstruction of Emperor Mauritius (Јанковић 1981: 141-147; Bjelajac 1990: 163-168). There are no data for the duration of other forts around Vranje, except for Kale at Klinovac, where a hoard was found with the latest coins from 544 (Гaj – Поповић 1973: 25-32). According to the inventory of the National Museum in Vranje, Markovo Kale was used in the 6th century, and later finds are not known. Kale at Veliki Trnovac to the South of Vranje (Чершков 1986) seems to have been the centre of this area in the early Byzantine period, judging by the basilica, undoubtedly episcopal, with rich marble decoration, which is also in Vranje; there are no data suggesting its usage in the late 6th or early 7th century.[/tpl]
Modern name stems from the old word for "black" ("vran") in the Serbian language and first appears in the Alexiad by Byzantine princess and scholar Anna Comnena (1083–1153):
[tpl]quote|Thereupon Bolcanus grew bold, as no opponent was left, and devastated the surrounding lands and towns; laid the country outside Scopia in ruins and even burnt some of it. As if this was not enough, he even seized Polobus, and proceeding to Branea laid that all waste, carried off a tremendous amount of plunder from it and then returned to his own country.[tpl]cite book|last=Comnena|first=Anna|title=The Alexiad|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/AnnaComnena-Alexiad09.asp|accessdate=8 September 2013|chapter=Book IX[/tpl] [/tpl]
