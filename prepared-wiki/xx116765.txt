The Doon School (informally Doon School or Doon) is a boys-only private boarding school in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India founded in 1935 by Satish Ranjan Das, a Calcutta lawyer.[tpl]citation|last=MacDougall|first=David|title=The corporeal image: film, ethnography, and the senses|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oFRF6vs5algC&pg=PA100|accessdate=31 March 2012|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12156-7|pages=100–[/tpl]  The founders foresaw a school modelled on the British public school, but alive to Indian ambitions and desires. The school's first headmaster, Englishman Arthur E. Foot, had spent some nine years as science master at Eton College, England, and returned to England soon after India's independence.'FOOT, Arthur Edward’, in Who Was Who 1961–1970 (London: A. & C.
