Video From Hell is a video released in 1987 by Frank Zappa. It is a compilation of pieces of music and video from a series of projects that Zappa presumably planned to finish and release for home video, including a companion video for the You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore series of albums, but those projects were ultimately never completed. Many pieces from this video had appeared on a one-hour Night Flight special entitled "You Are What You Watch". The music video for the song "G-Spot Tornado" features color 8mm footage that Zappa shot at a county fair in the early 1960s, while the music video for "Night School" features footage from the making of his feature film 200 Motels. It also features the music video for "You Are What You Is" which was banned by MTV. A guitar solo duet between Zappa and Steve Vai taken from the song "Stevie's Spanking" was later released on You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 4. As of December 2011, the video has not yet been released on DVD.
