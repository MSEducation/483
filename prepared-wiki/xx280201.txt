==Schedule==

The festival's programming consists of many different kinds of fiction films, both big blockbusters and small arthouse films.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.festivalfocus.org/festival_view.php?uid=993 |title=Leiden International Film Festival |publisher=Festivalfocus.org |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl]
The festival is a visitors' and not a market festival, attracting mainly film-fans and not sales agents. During the festival, films are not only screened in cinemas but special screenings are also hosted at venues like museums, an old factory, a historic church and an observatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leidenfilmfestival.nl/en/about-liff/locations |title=Locations |publisher=Leidenfilmfestival.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl] On the one hand, the LIFF has a deep connection with the city of Leiden, on the other hand it has over the years evolved into a festival with international ambitions, which is noticeable in its focus on American independent cinema and resulted in the American Indie Competition.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.withoutabox.com/03film/03t_fin/03t_fin_fest_01over.php?festival_id=6704 |title=Withoutabox |publisher=Withoutabox |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08[/tpl]
