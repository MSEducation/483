[[Huge cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In mathematics, a cardinal number κ is called huge if there exists an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and 
Here, αM is the class of all sequences of length α whose elements are in M.  
Huge cardinals were introduced by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=Kenneth Kunen|first=Kenneth |last=Kunen|year=1978[/tpl].

==Variants==

κ is almost n-huge if and only if there is j : V → M with critical point κ and 
κ is super almost n-huge if and only if for every ordinal γ there is j : V → M with critical point κ, γ<j(κ), and 
κ is n-huge if and only if there is j : V → M with critical point κ and 
κ is super n-huge if and only if for every ordinal γ there is j : V → M with critical point κ, γ<j(κ), and 
Notice that 0-huge is the same as measurable cardinal; and 1-huge is the same as huge. A cardinal satisfying one of the rank into rank axioms is n-huge for all finite n. 
The existence of an almost huge cardinal implies that Vopenka's principle is consistent; more precisely any almost huge cardinal is also a Vopenka cardinal.

==Consistency strength==

The cardinals are arranged in order of increasing consistency strength as follows:
The consistency of a huge cardinal implies the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, nevertheless, the least huge cardinal is smaller than the least supercompact cardinal (assuming both exist).

==ω-huge cardinals==

One can try defining an ω-huge cardinal κ as one such that an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and λM⊆M, where λ is the supremum of jn(κ) for positive integers n. However Kunen's inconsistency theorem  shows that ω-huge cardinals are inconsistent in ZFC, though it is still open whether they are consistent in ZF.
