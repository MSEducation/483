Duke of Cambridge is a title (named after the city of Cambridge in England) which has been conferred upon members of the British royal family several times. It was first used as a designation for Charles Stuart (1660–1661), the eldest son of James, Duke of York (later James II), though he was never formally created Duke of Cambridge. The title was most recently bestowed upon Prince William on 29 April 2011. Upon their marriage on the same day, his wife Catherine became The Duchess of Cambridge.

==History==

The first officially recognised creation was in the Peerage of England in 1664, when James Stuart, son of the Duke of York by his first wife, was granted the title. James, Duke of Cambridge, died young and without heirs, and the title became extinct. The title was next granted to Edgar Stuart, another son of the Duke of York by his first wife. Edgar also died young and the title again became extinct.
The Duke of York's eldest son by his second wife, Charles Stuart (1677), was also styled Duke of Cambridge, but died approximately a month old, not having lived long enough to be formally created.
The dukedom was next granted in 1706 to George Augustus, son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (who would in 1714 become King George I). When George Augustus ascended to the throne as King George II in 1727, the dukedom merged into the crown.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2011/Announcementoftitles29April2011.aspx |title=Announcement of Titles: Statement issued by the press secretary to The Queen |publisher=The Royal Household |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl] The title was next given, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, to Prince Adolphus, the seventh son of George III. Upon the death in 1904 of his only son, Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge, without a legitimate heir, the title became extinct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8138271/Could-William-and-Kate-be-the-next-Duke-and-Duchess-of-Cambridge.html|title= Could William and Kate be the next Duke and Duchess of Cambridge?|author= Tim Ross |date=16 November 2010 |work= The Telegraph |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl]
The first Duke's grandson (through a female line), Adolphus, Duke of Teck, who was the brother of Mary of Teck, George V's wife, was created Marquess of Cambridge in 1917 when he gave up his German titles and took the surname "Cambridge". Upon the death of the second Marquess without any male heirs, the marquessate became extinct.
During the period leading up to the 1999 wedding of The Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, experts speculated that the dukedom of Cambridge or Sussex were the most likely to be granted to him, and The Sunday Telegraph later reported that Prince Edward was at one point set to be titled Duke of Cambridge.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8196402/Royal-wedding-Prince-William-asks-the-Queen-not-to-make-him-a-duke.html|title= Royal wedding: Prince William asks the Queen not to make him a duke|author= Richard Eden|date= 12 December 2010|work= The Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl]  Instead, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex, and it was announced that he would eventually be created the next Duke of Edinburgh after his father.[tpl]cite web| title=The Earl of Wessex-Styles and Titles| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx| publisher=The Royal Household| accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl]
On 29 April 2011, the day of his wedding, Prince William was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus.
