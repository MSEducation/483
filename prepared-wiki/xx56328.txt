Amend stated that he wants to continue doing the strip, but at a less hurried pace."FoxTrot to Cease Dailies" press release from Universal Press Syndicate  This news was followed by several weeks of the characters discussing a "cartoonist" semi-retiring to Sundays only, and what methods he would use to phase out the daily strips.

==Characters==

The FoxTrot comic centers on the daily lives of the Fox family, composed of father Roger, wife Andy, and their children: Peter, Paige, and Jason, who live together in the same house.[tpl]cite web|last=Amend|first=Bill|url=http://www.foxtrot.com/about/|work=Original Comic Website|accessdate=3 August 2013[/tpl] Additional minor characters include Jason's pet iguana, Quincy; Jason's friend Marcus and classmate, Eileen Jacobson; Paige's friend Nicole and her classmate Morton Goldthwait; Peter's girlfriend Denise and his friend Steve; and other friends and classmates of the children and Roger's co-workers.  Like many comic strips, FoxTrot employs a floating timeline, where time passes but the characters themselves never age.

==Settings==

The Fox family lives in a suburban setting. Several storylines in the strip have focused on summer vacation trips to various places. Early on, the Fox family spent summer vacation at "Uncle Ralph's Cabin".[tpl]cite book|last=Amend|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Amend|title=FoxTrot: The Works (pp. 60–1)|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1990|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-8362-1848-5[/tpl] Later vacations by the Fox family have included trips to Hawaii, Washington D.C., the desert, various amusement parks (see Bury My Heart at Fun-Fun Mountain for an example), and campgrounds. In a series of strips though, references are made implying that they live in or near Chicago. However, Amend has denied this and claims that he has never given a particular location or name for where they live.
Early in the strip's run, FoxTrot often dealt with societal issues such as drug abuse.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=DSNB&d_place=DSNB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F35FB366200E5F1&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title='FoxTrot' tackles drug abuse|date=1989-03-06|work=Deseret News|accessdate=December 21, 2009[/tpl]

==Popular culture references==

In addition to family humor, the strip has many stories built around fandom and popular culture. In one example, Jason was playing chess with his friend Marcus, but the game was tweaked into being a modified Dungeons and Dragons.[tpl]citeweb |title=Applied Abstractions: Wikipedia As Seen By FoxTrot |author=Andersen, Espen |date=December 12, 2007 |url=http://www.espen.com/archives/2007/12/wikipedia_as_se.html |publisher=espen.com |accessdate=2008-12-28[/tpl]
On occasion, there have been a few celebrity guest appearances in the strip, such as The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
Amend majored in physics at Amherst College,Bill Amend – Creator Bio. Universal Press Syndicate. and his knowledge of physics is sometimes reflected in FoxTrot's frequent inclusion of complex mathematical or physics formulae, usually written by Jason. Jason is also used to express Amend's knowledge of computer languages.[tpl]cite book|last=Amend|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Amend|title=Death By Field Trip (p. 87)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C4gMKOkILZcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Death+By+Field+Trip&hl=en&ei=NxpJTJDXAoy6sQOKpv1I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wikipedia&f=false |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2001|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-1391-4[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

In a 1990 article which reviewed various then-current comic strips, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave FoxTrot a "B" rating, calling it "the most idiosyncratic comic strip to debut since Calvin and Hobbes" and describing the Fox family as "believable."[tpl]cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=October 15, 1990|title=Black & White and Read All Over|journal=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318318,00.html|accessdate=2009-12-21[/tpl]
