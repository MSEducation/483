During the investitures dispute William was on friendly terms with Anselm, and drew upon himself a sentence of banishment through declining to accept consecration from Gerard Archbishop of York in 1103. He was, however, one of the bishops who pressed Anselm, in 1106, to give way to the king. He was finally consecrated after the settlement of 1107 on 11 August and became a close friend of Archbishop Anselm.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] As bishop, William aided the first Cistercians to settle in England, when in 1128 he brought monks from the French abbey of L'Aumone to settle at Waverly Abbey.Burton Monastic and Religious Orders p. 69 He also restored Winchester Cathedral with great magnificence.
