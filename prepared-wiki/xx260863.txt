CATEGORIES: Uruguayan musical groups

Trotsky Vengarán (also known as TKYVGN) is an Uruguay rock band formed in 1991, by Guillermo Peluffo, lead singer, Hugo Diaz and Ignacio Guasch on guitars, Guillermo "Cuico" Perazzo on drums and Marcelo Abreu on bass. Since the very beginning they decided they were going to play hard and melodic rock.  They were influenced by groups such as Ramones, Beastie Boys, AC/DC, Sex Pistols and other 50's and 60's bands.
Their style is clearly defined as punk rock, but with hardcore characteristics. The themes in their songs vary greatly, dealing with political, social, and cultural everyday issues.  In 1994 they released their first album, called Salud, Dinero y Dinero (Health, Money and Money). ".[tpl]citation|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/trotsky-vengarán[/tpl]
