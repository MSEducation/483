Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine and Moldova to the northeast and east, and Bulgaria to the south. At [tpl]convert|238391|km2|sqmi[/tpl], Romania is the ninth largest country of the European Union by area, and has the 7th largest population of the European Union with 20,121,641 people (October 2011). Its capital and largest city is Bucharest – the 6th largest city in the EU.
The United Principalities emerged when the territories of Moldavia and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859. In 1866 Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to the throne as the Ruling Prince of the Romanian Principate and in 1881 he was finally crowned as King Carol I, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Romania. Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877, and was internationally recognised the following year. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania.
Following the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the Kingdom of Romania under King Carol II officially adopted a position of neutrality. In summer 1940, a series of territorial disputes were resolved unfavorably to Romania, resulting in the loss of most of the territory gained in the wake of World War I. This caused the popularity of Romania's government to plummet. World War II gave cause to the rise of a military dictatorship in Romania under far-right Marshal Ion Antonescu, who chose to fight on the side of the Axis powers from 1941-44 in order to regain the provinces. After his removal, Romania switched sides in 1944 and joined the Allies. By the end of the war, some formerly Romanian northeastern territories were occupied by the Soviet Union, with Red Army units stationed on Romanian soil. In 1947 Romania forcibly became a People's Republic (1947–1965) and a member of the Warsaw Pact. In 1965 Nicolae Ceaușescu became General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, and the harsh austerity measures, political repression, and cult of personality he implemented led to the Socialist Republic of Romania (1965–1989) becoming the most Stalinist police state in the Eastern bloc. Eventually his authoritarian government was toppled in December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution.
With the fall of the Iron Curtain, Romania began its transition towards democracy and a capitalist market economy. After a decade of post-revolution economic problems and living-standards decline, extensive reforms fostered economic recovery. As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle income country with a high Human Development Index.Statistics|Human Development Reports (HDR)|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Romania joined NATO on 29 March 2004, and the European Union on 1 January 2007. It is a member of the Latin Union, Francophonie, OSCE, WTO, BSEC, United Nations, etc. Romania is a unitary semi-presidential republic, in which the executive branch consists of the President and the Government.[tpl]cite web|author=Tony Verheijen |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/politicalscience/9780198293866/acprof-9780198293866-chapter-10.html |title=Oxford Scholarship Online: Semi-Presidentialism in Europe |publisher=Oxfordscholarship.com |date=14 March 1990 |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Romania  derives from the Latin romanus, meaning "citizen of Rome".[tpl]cite web|url=http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=rom%C3%A2n |title=Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language, 1998; New Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language, 2002 |publisher=Dexonline.ro |accessdate=25 September 2010[/tpl] [tpl]ro icon[/tpl] The first known use of the appellation was attested in 16th-century by Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia.[tpl]Cite book|quote="nunc se Romanos vocant"|author=Andréas Verres|title=Acta et Epistolae|volume=I|page=243[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|quote="...si dimandano in lingua loro Romei...se alcuno dimanda se sano parlare in la lingua valacca, dicono a questo in questo modo: Sti Rominest ?

The oldest surviving document written in Romanian, a 1521 letter known as the "Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung",Ion Rotaru, Literatura română veche, "The Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung", București, 1981, pp. 62–65 [tpl]en icon[/tpl] is also notable for including the first documented occurrence of the country's name: Wallachia is mentioned as Țeara Rumânească ("The Romanian Land", țeara from the Latin terra, "land"; current spelling: Țara Românească).
Two spelling forms: român and rumân were used interchangeably "am scris aceste sfente cǎrți de învățături, sǎ fie popilor rumânesti... sǎ înțeleagǎ toți oamenii cine-s rumâni creștini" "Întrebare creștineascǎ" (1559), Bibliografia româneascǎ veche, IV, 1944, p. 6.

In the "Istoria faptelor lui Mavroghene-Vodă și a răzmeriței din timpul lui pe la 1790" a Pitar Hristache writes: "Încep după-a mea ideie/Cu vreo câteva condeie/Povestea mavroghenească/Dela Țara Românească.

The use of the name Romania to refer to the common homeland of all Romanians—its modern-day meaning—is first documented in the early 19th century.In 1816, the Greek scholar Dimitrie Daniel Philippide published in Leipzig his work The History of Romania, followed by The Geography of Romania.  On the tombstone of Gheorghe Lazăr in Avrig (built in 1823) there is the inscription: "Precum Hristos pe Lazăr din morți a înviat/Așa tu România din somn ai deșteptat."

Roman Emperor Domitian led military campaigns in the region between 87 and 88 AD at Tapae. Roman incursions happened again during the years 101–102 AD, and 105–106 AD under Emperor Trajan, who successfully defeated Dacia and annexed its southwestern parts to the vast Roman Empire.

In Wallachia and Moldavia, many small local states with varying degrees of independence developed. Only in the 14th century did the larger principalities of Wallachia (1310) and Moldavia (around 1352) emerge to fight the threat of the Ottoman Empire. Both territories inhabited by Romanians achieved their independence from the Hungarian Crown after military conflicts (Battle of Posada, 1330) or social conflicts (Moldavian boyars' revolt against Hungary, 1364) — these historic events being initiated by Basarab I of Wallachia (1310–1352) and Bogdan I of Moldavia (1359–1365).[tpl]Cite book|last =Ștefănescu|first =Ștefan |title =Istoria medie a României|year =1991|location =Bucharest|volume =I|page=114[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia|last =Predescu|first =Lucian |title =Enciclopedia Cugetarea|year =1940[/tpl]
By 1541, the entire Balkan peninsula and most of Hungary had become Ottoman provinces. Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania were under Ottoman suzerainty, preserving partial or full internal autonomy until the mid-19th century (Transylvania until 1699). During this period, in the Romanian lands the feudal system slowly disappeared. A few rulers of territories in what is now Romania distinguished themselves: these rulers include Stephen the Great, Vasile Lupu, and Dimitrie Cantemir in Moldavia; Matei Basarab, Vlad the Impaler, and Constantin Brâncoveanu in Wallachia; and John Hunyadi (Ioannes Corvinus) and Gabriel Bethlen in Transylvania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511110153&ss=fro|title=Cumans and Tatars|last=István|first=Vásáry|publisher=cambridge.org|accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl]
In 1600, the principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania were simultaneously headed by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave (Mihai Viteazul), but the chance for a lasting unification was lost after Mihai was assassinated only one year later. After his death, as vassal tributary states, Moldavia and Wallachia had complete internal autonomy and external independence, which they finally lost in the 18th century.
In 1699, Transylvania became a territory of the Habsburgs' Austrian empire following the Austrian victory over the Turks in the Great Turkish War. The Habsburgs in turn expanded their empire in 1718 to include an important part of Wallachia called Oltenia (which was returned only in 1739), and in 1775 to include the northwestern part of Moldavia, later called Bukovina. The eastern half of the Moldavian principality (called Bessarabia) was occupied in 1812 by Russia.

===Independence and monarchy===

During the period of the Austro-Hungarian rule in Transylvania and Ottoman suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia, most Romanians were considered second-class citizens or even non-citizens[tpl]cite web|publisher =GenealogyRO Group|title =The Magyarization Process|url= http://www.genealogy.ro/cont/13.htm |accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] in a territory where they formed the majority of the population.[tpl]Cite book|last =Kocsis |first =Karoly |last2 =Kocsis-Hodosi |first2 =Eszter| year =1999 |title =Ethnic structure of the population on the present territory of Transylvania (1880–1992)|url =http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hmcb/Tab14.htm|archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20080222171134/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hmcb/Tab14.htm|archivedate =22 February 2008|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Kocsis |first =Karoly|last2 =Kocsis-Hodosi |first2 =Eszter|title =Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin|year =2001|page =102|publisher =Simon Publications|isbn =1-931313-75-X[/tpl]
Following the Wallachian uprising of 1821, more insurrections followed in 1848 in Wallachia as well as Moldavia. The flag adopted for Wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue-yellow-red horizontal tricolour (with blue above, in line with the meaning "Liberty, Justice, Fraternity"),Gazeta de Transilvania, year XI, no. 34 of 26 April 1848, p. 140. while Romanian students in Paris hailed the new government with the same flag "as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Muntenians".Dogaru (1978), p. 862.Căzănișteanu (1967), p. 36. The same flag, with the tricolour being mounted vertically, would later on be officially adopted as the national flag of Romania.
After the failed 1848 Revolution, the Great Powers did not support the Romanians' expressed desire to officially unite in a one single state, which forced them to proceed alone with their struggle against the Ottomans. The electors in both Moldavia and Wallachia chose in 1859 the same leader –Alexandru Ioan Cuza– to be their Ruling Prince (Domnitor in Romanian).[tpl]Cite book|last =Bobango|first =Gerald J|title =The emergence of the Romanian national State|publisher =Boulder|year =1979|location =New York|isbn =  978-0-914710-51-6[/tpl] Thus, Romania was created as a personal union, albeit without including Transylvania.  There, the upper class and the aristocracy chose to remain under Hungarian rule, even though the Romanians were by far the most numerous ethnic Transylvanian group and constituted the absolute majority.
In an 1866 coup d'état, Cuza was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who became known as Prince Carol I of Romania.

===World Wars and Greater Romania===

In August 1915, about a year after the start of World War I, Romania tried to maintain neutrality. One year later, under significant pressure from the Allies, on 27 August 1916 Romania joined the Allies, declaring war on Austria-Hungary. For this action, under the terms of the secret military convention, Romania was promised support for its goal of national unity of all the territories populated with Romanians.[tpl]cite web|last =Horne|first =Charles F.|year =Horne|title =Ion Bratianu's Declaration of War Delivered to the Austrian Minister in Romania on August 28, 1916|volume =V|publisher =Source Records of the Great War|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/romaniawardeclaration.htm|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl]
The Romanian military campaign began disastrously for Romania as the Central Powers occupied two-thirds of the country within months. Nevertheless, Moldavia remained in Romanian hands and the invading forces were blocked in 1917.

===Communism===

During the Soviet occupation of Romania, the Communist-dominated government called for new elections, which were fraudulently won with an 85% majority of the vote.Giurescu, "«Alegeri" după model sovietic", p.17 (citing Berry), 18 (citing Berry and note); Macuc, p.40; Tismăneanu, p.113 Thus they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/rotoc.html#ro0037 |publisher=Federal research Division, Library of Congress|title=Romania: Country studies – Chapter 1.7.1 "Petru Groza's Premiership"|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] In 1947, the Communists forced King Michael I to abdicate and leave the country, and proclaimed Romania a people's republic.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ro.html|publisher=CIA – The World Factbook |title=Romania |accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ed-u.com/ro.html|title=Romania – Country Background and Profile|publisher=ed-u.com|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s.

In 1965, Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power and started applying an independent foreign policy by being the only Warsaw Pact country to condemn the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, by maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War and by establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany the same year (economic links had been established in 1963).[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us|title=Romania: Soviet Union and Eastern Europe|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] At the same time, close ties with the Arab countries (and the PLO) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel–Egypt and Israel–PLO peace talks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/80.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us| title=Middle East policies in Communist Romania|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl]

The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the police state and imposed a severe cult of personality. All these led to a dramatic decrease in Ceaușescu's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution in the violent Romanian Revolution. By that time Romania's foreign debt was almost completely paid off.

After major political rallies, in April 1990 a sit-in protest contesting the results of the recently held parliamentary elections began in the University Square, Bucharest, accusing the NSF of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate.
The protesters called the election undemocratic and asked for the exclusion from political life of former high-ranking Communist Party members, such as president Iliescu himself. The protest rapidly grew to become what president Iliescu called the Golaniad. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners, summoned by Iliescu in June 1990, from the Jiu Valley.

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties including the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party and the Alliance for Romania. The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then there have been several democratic changes of government: in 1996 the Democrat-Liberals' opposition and its leader Emil Constantinescu acceded to power; in 2000 the Social-Democrats returned to power, with Iliescu once again as president; and, finally, in 2004 Traian Băsescu was elected president, with an electoral coalition called Justice and Truth Alliance.

==Geography==

With a surface area of [tpl]convert|238391|km2|sqmi|[/tpl], Romania is the largest country in southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap1.pdf|title=Geography, Meteorology and Environment|year=2004|publisher=Romanian Statistical Yearbook|language=Romanian|accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl] It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N, and longitudes 20° and 30° E.
Romania's terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountainous, hilly and lowland territories. The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above [tpl]convert|2000|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl], and the highest point at Moldoveanu Peak ([tpl]convert|2544|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]). These are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus and Pannonian and Wallachian plains. Romania's geographical diversity has led to an accompanying diversity of flora and fauna.
A large part of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is formed by the Danube. The Prut River, one of its major tributaries, forms the border with the Republic of Moldova. The Danube flows into the Black Sea within Romania's territory forming the Danube Delta, the second largest and best preserved delta in Europe, and also a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/588|title=Danube Delta|publisher=UNESCO's World Heritage Centre|accessdate=9 January 2008[/tpl] Other major rivers are the Siret (596 km), the Olt (614 km), the Someș (388 km), and the Mureș (761 km).
Lakes and lake complexes have a low share throughout Romania, occupying only 1.1% of total land area. The largest lake complex in size is Razelm-Sinoe (731 km²), located on the Black Sea seaside. Glacial lakes exist in the Făgăraș Mountains, a result of quaternary glaciation, of which the largest are: Lake Avrig (14,700 m²), Bâlea Lake (46,500 m²), Capra Lake (18,000 m²), etc. Other notable lakes are Lake Sfânta Ana, the only volcanic lake in Romania, and Red Lake, a natural dam lake, both situated in Harghita County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inromania.info/lacuri-romania.html |title=Lacuri Romania, Sfanta Ana, Lacul Rosu, Balea Lac: Lacuri Romania |publisher=Inromania.info |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

===Climate===

Owing to its distance from the open sea and position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is temperate and continental, with four distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is [tpl]convert|11|°C[/tpl] in the south and [tpl]convert|8|°C[/tpl] in the north.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/34.htm|title=Romania: Climate|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=10 January 2008[/tpl] The extreme recorded temperatures were [tpl]convert|44.5|°C[/tpl] at Ion Sion in 1951 and [tpl]convert|-38.5|°C[/tpl] at Bod in 1942.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.romaniatourism.com/climate.html|title=Romania: climate|publisher=Climate|accessdate=10 January 2008[/tpl]
Spring is pleasant with cool mornings and nights and warm days. Summers are generally very warm to hot, with summer (June to August) average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rising to [tpl]convert|28|°C[/tpl], and temperatures over [tpl]convert|35|°C[/tpl] fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country.

Because of Romania's geographic location, respectively the regional orographic peculiarities, there exists a varied range of local winds. Humid winds from the northwest are most common, but often the drier winds from the northeast are strongest. A hot southwesterly wind, the austru (cf. lat. Auster), blows over western Romania, particularly in summer. In winter, cold and dense air masses encircle the eastern portions of the country, with the cold northeasterly known as the crivăț blowing in from the Russian Plain, and oceanic air masses from the Azores, in the west, bring rain and mitigate the severity of the cold. Other wind types present locally are nemirul, black wind, foehn, băltărețul, zephyr, cosava etc. Romania enjoys four seasons, though there is a rapid transition from winter to summer. Autumn is frequently longer, with dry warm weather from September to late November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vremea.meteoromania.ro/node/5665 |title=Vanturile din Romania |publisher= Meteo Romania  |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Romania is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of Bucharest. Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.descopera.net/romania_geografie.html |title=Geografia Romaniei |publisher=descopera.net |language=Romanian |accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl]
Each county is further subdivided into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 319 cities and 2,686 communes in Romania.[tpl]cite report|language=ro|url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap1.pdf|format=PDF|chapter=1.8|title=Administrative Organisation of Romanian Territory, on December 31, 2005|publisher=Romanian National Institute of Statistics|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality statuses, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six sectors and has a prefect, a general mayor, and a general city council.
The NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level divisions of European Union reflect Romania's administrative-territorial structure, and correspond to the 41 counties plus Bucharest.

==Politics==

===Government===

The Constitution of Romania is based on the Constitution of France's Fifth Republic and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991. A plebiscite held in October 2003 approved 79 amendments to the Constitution, bringing it into conformity with European Union legislation. The country is governed on the basis of multi-party democratic system and of the segregation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers.
Romania is a semi-presidential republic where executive functions are held by both government and the president. The president is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms, and since the amendments in 2003, each term lasts five years. He appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers (based at Victoria Palace). The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers – the Senate with 140 members, and the Chamber of Deputies with 346 members. The members of both chambers are elected every four years by simple plurality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/politica/se-schimba-sistemul-de-vot-deputatii-au-adoptat-noua-lege-electorala-propusa-de-usl-168053.html |title=Se schimbă sistemul de vot. Deputații au adoptat noua Lege Electorală propusă de USL |publisher=Antena3.ro |accessdate=12 October 2012[/tpl]
The justice system is independent of the other branches of government, and is made up of a hierarchical system of courts culminating in the High Court of Cassation and Justice, which is the supreme court of Romania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scj.ro/monogr_en.asp|publisher=High Court of Cassation and Justice -—Romania|title=Presentation|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] There are also courts of appeal, county courts and local courts. The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the French model,[tpl]cite web|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps35389/2000//legal_system.html|title=Romanian Legal system|publisher=CIA Factbook|year=2000|accessdate=11 January 2008[/tpl] considering that it is based on civil law and is inquisitorial in nature. The Constitutional Court (Curtea Constituțională) is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations to the Romanian Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the country. The constitution, which was introduced in 1991, can be amended by only a public referendum, the last of which took place in 2003. Since this amendment, the court's decisions cannot be overruled by any majority of the parliament.
The country's entry into the European Union in 2007[tpl]Cite news|first=Stefan|last=Bos|title=Bulgaria, Romania Join European Union|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Voice of America|url =http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-01/2007-01-01-voa16.cfm|work =VOA News|accessdate = 2 January 2009|language = [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] has been a significant influence on its domestic policy. As part of the process, Romania has instituted reforms including judicial reform, increased judicial cooperation with other member states, and measures to combat corruption. Nevertheless, in 2013 Brussels report, Romania was described as the 9th most corrupt country in the EU (after Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Portugal, Hungary and Spain).[tpl]cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/justice/120064|title=Survey: Croatia and Slovenia most corrupt in EU|accessdate=8 May 2013 [/tpl]

===Foreign relations===

Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union. It joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it had joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/English/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |title=Understanding the WTO – members |publisher=WTO |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

Romania also declared its public support for Turkey, and Croatia joining the European Union. With Turkey, Romania shares a privileged economic relation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenewanatolian.com/ek6.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=The New Anatolian, 1 February 2006|title= Turkey & Romania hand in hand for a better tomorrow.[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] Because it has a large Hungarian minority, Romania has also developed strong relations with Hungary. Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to adhere the Schengen Area, an area of free movement in Europe that comprises the territories of twenty-five European countries. Romania's bid to join the Schengen Area was approved by the European Parliament in June 2011, but was rejected by the Council of Ministers in September 2011.

With a GDP according to CIA's The World Factbook of around $274 billion in 2012 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $12,800 for the year 2012, Romania is an upper-middle income country economy[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html#Upper_middle_income|publisher=World Bank|title=Country Classification Groups|year=2005|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] and has been part of the European Union since 1 January 2007.
After the communist regime was overthrown in late 1989, the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base and a lack of structural reform. From 2000 onwards, however, the Romanian economy was transformed into one of relative macroeconomic stability, characterised by high growth, low unemployment and declining inflation. In 2006, according to the Romanian Statistics Office, GDP growth in real terms was recorded at 7.7%, one of the highest rates in Europe.[tpl]cite web|language=Romanian|url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/statistici/comunicate/pib/pibr06.pdf|format=PDF|title=GDP in 2006|publisher=Romanian National Institute of Statistics|accessdate=10 January 2008[/tpl]

===National currency===

The official currency in Romania is (since 1867) leu (Romanian leu). The name (homonymous with the Romanian word for lion) comes from Leeuwendaalder (which had the figure of a lion on the reverse),a silver coin originally circulated in the Netherlands from the 16th century, that became a dominant currency in the Romanian states starting with the 17th century. Though the Leeuwendaalder eventually fell into disuse, the name Leu remained as a generic term. For the same reason, other regional currency, like the Bulgarian Lev and the Moldovan Leu are similarly named. The subdivision of leu is ban (plural: bani), 1 leu = 100 bani.
Between 1991 and 1997, high inflation (up to 256% in 1993)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/bani-afaceri/economie/cea-mai-mica-inflatie-din-ultimii-20-de-ani-rata-anuala-a-coborat-la-3-14-in-decembrie-vezi-cum-a-evoluat-inflatia-dupa-1990-249885.html |title=Article on inflation in Romania between 1990-2011 |publisher=Romanialibera.ro |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl] practically rendered the subdivision of leu irrelevant and its use ceased until a denomination occurred in 2005. As of 1 July 2005, the new leu, sometimes called ron, has been placed in service, obtained by removing four zeros from the leu (1 ron = 10,000 lei), in an effort to increase the competitiveness and improve trade against regional currencies, as well as the Euro. The subdivision of leu – ban was also reintroduced. There are coins of 1, 5, 10 and 50 bani and notes of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 lei.

Because of its location, Romania is a major crossroad for international economic exchange in Europe. However, because of insufficient investment, maintenance and repair, the transport infrastructure does not meet the current needs of a market economy and lags behind Western Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnadnr.ro/pagina.php?idg=20|title=Prezentarea generală a rețelei de drumuri|publisher=cnadnr.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl] Nevertheless, these conditions are rapidly improving and catching up with the standards of Trans-European transport networks. Several projects have been started with funding from grants from ISPA and several loans from International Financial Institutions (World Bank, IMF, etc.) guaranteed by the state, to upgrade the main road corridors. Also, the Government is actively pursuing new external financing or public-private partnerships to further upgrade the main roads, and especially the country's motorway network.
Romania has a relatively well-developed airport infrastructure compared to other countries in Eastern Europe, but still underdeveloped compared to Western European standards. There are 17 commercial airports in service today, most of them opened for international traffic. Five of the airports (OTP, BBU, TSR, CND, SBZ) have runways of over 3,000 meters in length and are capable of handling wide-body aircraft. Three of the airports (BCM, CRA, SUJ) have runways of 2,500 meters in length, while the rest of them have runways of 1,800 to 2,000 meters. As of December 2006, TCE and CSB are the only airports with no regular flights. Almost all the airports have experienced traffic growth in the last 4 years.

Also, Romania disposes of an unworkable international airport (Caransebeș Airport) and 16 under construction or planned airports, whose construction will be completed until 2020. Romania has about 200 flight corridors, as much as any other European country. Five of the airports (OTP, BBU, TSR, CND, SBZ) have runways of over 3,000 meters in length and are capable of handling wide-body aircraft. Three of the airports (BCM, CRA, SUJ) have runways of 2,500 meters in length, while the rest of them have runways of 1,800 to 2,000 meters. As of December 2006, TCE and CSB are the only airports with no regular flights. The air traffic has doubled in the last 20 years; in the summer of 2010, Romania was crossed by as many as 150 aircraft simultaneously, bringing considerable incomes to TAROM airline. As of May 2011, TAROM flies to 47 destinations (including the seasonal destinations), such as: Cairo, Tel Aviv, Dubai, Vienna, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Athens, Budapest, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Istanbul and London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/romania/fara-autostrazi-romania-are-la-fel-de-multe-coridoare-de-zbor-ca-orice-tara-europeana-130987.html |title=Fără autostrăzi, România are la fel de multe coridoare de zbor ca orice țară europeană |publisher=Antena3.ro |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

===Science and technology===

During the 1990s and 2000s, the development of Romanian science was hampered by several factors, including corruption, low funding and a considerable brain drain.http://www.ad-astra.ro/journal/2/editorial_en.pdf However, since the country's accession to the European Union, this has begun to change. After being slashed by 50% in 2009 because of the global recession, R&D spending was increased by 44% in 2010 and now stands at $0.5 billion (1.5 billion lei).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=124097 |title=Bulgaria: Science fortunes of Balkan neighbours diverge – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl] In January 2011, the Parliament also passed a law that enforces "strict quality control on universities and introduces tough rules for funding evaluation and peer review".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110112/full/469142a.html |title=Science fortunes of Balkan neighbours diverge : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl] The country has joined or is about to join several major international organizations such as CERN and the European Space Agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes-romania.com/article.php?article_id=97824 |title=Funeriu: Stiinta din Romania 'se imbunatateste', insa mai sunt multe lucruri de facut |publisher=Epochtimes-romania.com |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.actmedia.eu/2011/01/20/top+story/romania+is+to+sign+agreement+on+joining+european+space+agency+convention+/31695 |title=Romania is to sign agreement on joining European space agency convention |publisher=Actmedia.eu |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl] Overall, the situation has been characterized as "rapidly improving", albeit from a low base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110112/full/news.2011.8.html |title=Romania's high hopes for science : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]
Historically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields, such as: aeronautics, medicine, mathematics, computer science/engineering, physics, biophysics, chemistry, biochemistry and  biology. In the history of flight, Traian Vuia made the first airplane to take off on its own power[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblacad.ro/Vuiaeng.htm |title=Traian Vuia in a Century of Aviation |publisher=Romanian Academy Library|page=1|accessdate=7 August 2012[/tpl] and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft. Also, Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Preceding him, Elie Carafoli was a pioneering contributor to the field of aerodynamics in the world. It should also be noted that Hermann Oberth, the founding father of astronautics, was born in Sibiu.
Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil. Costin Nenițescu found new methods for the synthesis of pirilium salts, of carbenes, tryptamine, serotonin, two new syntheses for the indole nucleus[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl], and a new method of polymerisation of ethylene.
Several mathematicians distinguished themselves as well, among them: Gheorghe Țițeica, Spiru Haret, Grigore Moisil, Miron Nicolescu, Nicolae Popescu and Ștefan Odobleja; the latter is also regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics.
Notable physicists and inventors also include: Horia Hulubei in atomic physics, Șerban Țițeica in theoretical physics, Mihai Gavrilă specialized in quantum theory[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] and discoverer of the atomic dichotomy phenomenon, Alexandru Proca (known for the first meson theory of nuclear forces and Proca's equations of the vectorial mesonic field), Ștefan Procopiu known for the first theory of the magnetic moment of the electron in 1911 (now known as the Bohr-Procopiu magneton), Theodor V.

==Demographics==

===Demographic evolution===

According to the 2011 census, Romania's population is 20,121,641. Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to gradually decline in the coming years as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate. In October 2011 Romanians made up 88.6% of the population.  The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, who make up 6.5% of the population and Roma, who make up 3.2% of the population.2002 census data, based on Population by ethnicity, gave a total of 535,250 Roma in Romania. Many ethnicities not recorded at all, since they do not have ID cards.

The number of Romanians and individuals with ancestors born in Romania living abroad is estimated at around 12 million. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a significant number of Romanians emigrated to other European countries, North America or Australia, because of better working conditions and academic possibilities offered abroad. Some 45,000 foreigners are present on the local labor market, of which about 30,000 workers.

===Languages===

The official language of Romania is Romanian, a Romance language related to Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Romanian is spoken as a first language by 91% of the population.  Hungarian and Vlax Romani are the most important minority languages, spoken by 6.7% and 1.1% of the population, respectively. Until the early 1990s, there were also a substantial number of German-speaking Transylvanian Saxons, even though most have since emigrated to Germany, leaving only 45,000 native German speakers in Romania. There are approximately 32,000 Turkish speakers in Romania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files%5Cstatistici%5CStatistica%20teritoriala%202008%5Ceng%5C8.htm |title=POPULATION BY ETHNIC GROUPS AT POPULATION AND HOUSING CENSUS, ON MARCH 18, 2002 |publisher=Insse.ro |date=18 March 2002 |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In localities where a given ethnic minority makes up more than 20% of the population, that minority's language can be used in the public administration and justice system, while native-language education and signage is also provided. English and French are the main foreign languages taught in schools. English is spoken by 5–6 million Romanians, French is spoken by 4–5 million, and German, Italian and Spanish are each spoken by 1–2 million people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Historically, French was the predominant foreign language spoken in Romania, but English has since superseded it. Consequently, Romanian English-speakers tend to be younger than Romanian French-speakers. Romania is, however, a full member of La Francophonie, and hosted the Francophonie Summit in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.francophonie.org/doc/doc-historique/chronologie-oif.pdf|format=pfd|language=French|title=Chronology of the International Organization La Francophonie|accessdate=31 August 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080624195138/http://www.francophonie.org/doc/doc-historique/chronologie-oif.pdf |archivedate = 24 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] German has been taught predominantly in Transylvania, because of traditions tracing back to the Austro-Hungarian rule in this province.
The Romanian language remains, according to the Constitution of Romania, the only official language of Romania, but local councils ensure linguistic rights to all minorities, who form over 11% of the total population. Foreign citizens and stateless persons that live in Romania have access to justice and education in their own language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&par1=1 |title=Constitutia României |publisher=Cdep.ro |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

===Religion===

Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. However, an overwhelming majority of the country's citizens identify themselves as Christians.  86.7% of the country's population identified as Orthodox Christian according to the 2002 census, the vast majority of which belongs to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Other major Christian denominations include Protestantism (5.2%), Roman Catholicism (4.7%) and the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church (0.9%). The latter two religious organizations suffered most severely under the Communist regime. The Greek-Catholic Church was outlawed by the Communist government in 1948;Harper-Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism, 1132; Niessen, "The Greek Catholic Church and the Romanian Nation," 59–60 later, under the Ceaușescu regime, several churches in Transylvania were demolished. Protestants and Roman Catholics are also concentrated in Transylvania.
The foundation of the oldest-known Romanian Orthodox church is still visible at Drobeta-Turnu Severin today, and dates from the 14th century; however, much earlier crypts with unearthed relics of Christian martyrs executed at the orders of the Roman emperor Diocletian were found in local church records dating as far back as the 3rd century AD. Thus, the relics of Saint Sava the Goth who was martyred by drowning in the river Buzău in Romania, under Athanaric, on 12 April 372, were reverently received by St. Basil the Great. Earlier still, the first known Daco-Roman Christian priest Montanus and his wife Maxima were drowned because of their Christian faith, as martyrs, on 26 March 304.
Romania also has a Muslim minority concentrated in Dobruja, mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity and numbering 67,500 people.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.recensamant.ro/datepr/tbl6.html|title=Romanian Census Website with population by religion|publisher=Recensamant.ro|accessdate=1 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] According to the results of the 2002 census, there are 66,846 Romanian citizens of the Unitarian faith (0.3% of the total population). Of the total Hungarian-speaking minority in Romania, Unitarians represent 4.55%, being the third denominational group after members of the Reformed Church in Romania (47.10%) and Roman Catholics (41.20%). Since 1700, the Unitarian Church has had 125 parishes—in 2006, there were 110 Unitarian ministers and 141 places of worship in Romania.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
According to the 2002 census, there were 6,179 Jews, 23,105 people who are of no religion and/or atheist, and 11,734 who refused to answer. On 27 December 2006, a new Law on Religion was approved under which religious denominations can only receive official registration if they have at least 20,000 members, or about 0.1% of Romania's total population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bosnewslife.com/europe/romania/2674-romania-president-approves-europes-worst/|title=Romania President Approves Europe's "Worst Religion Law"|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
The Romanian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Orthodox church. It is in full communion with other Orthodox churches, and is ranked seventh in order of precedence. The Primate of the church has the title of Patriarch. Its jurisdiction covers the territory of Romania, with dioceses for Romanians living in nearby Moldova, Serbia and Hungary, as well as diaspora communities in Central and Western Europe, North America and Oceania.
It is the only Orthodox church using a Romance language. The majority of people in Romania (18,817,975, or 86.8% of the population, according to the 2002 census data2002 census data on religion[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]) belong to it, as well as some 720,000 Moldovans.[tpl]ro icon[/tpl] "Biserica Ortodoxă Română, atacată de bisericile 'surori'" ("The Romanian Orthodox Church, Attacked by Its 'Sister' Churches", Ziua, 31 January 2008 The Romanian Orthodox Church is the second-largest in size after the Russian Orthodox Church.

==Education==

Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has been both praised and criticized.[tpl]cite report|publisher=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/romania/rapport_1.html|title=The Romanian Educational Policy in Transition|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] According to the Law on Education adopted in 1995, the educational system is regulated by the Ministry of Education and Research. Each level has its own form of organization and is subject to different legislation. Kindergarten is optional for children between 3 and 6 years old. Schooling starts at age 7 (sometimes 6), and is compulsory until the 10th grade (which usually corresponds to the age of 17 or 16).[tpl]cite report|publisher=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/romania/rapport_2.html|title=The Romanian Educational Policy in Transition|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] Primary and secondary education are divided into 12 grades. Higher education is aligned with the European higher education area.
Aside from the official schooling system, and the added private equivalents after the fall of communist regime, there exists a semi-legal, informal, fully private tutoring system. Tutoring is mostly used during secondary as a preparation for the various examinations, which are notoriously difficult. Tutoring has subsisted and even prospered during the Communist regime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.genderomania.ro/book_gender_post/part1/Anca_Gheaus.pdf| title=Limited relevants.

==Culture==

Romania has a unique culture, which is the product of its geography and of its distinct historical evolution. Like Romanians themselves, it is fundamentally defined as the meeting point of three regions: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans, but cannot be truly included in any of them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itcnet.ro/folk_festival/culture.htm|title=Romania – Culture|accessdate=31 August 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071231125142/http://www.itcnet.ro/folk_festival/culture.htm |archivedate = 31 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Arts, literature and philosophy===

A unified Romanian literature began to develop with the revolutions of 1848 and the union of the two Danubian Principalities in 1859. The origin of the Romanians began to be discussed and by the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, Romanian Transylvanian scholars along with Romanian scholars from Moldavia and Wallachia began studying in France, Italy and Germany.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ici.ro/romania/en/cultura/cultural_aspects.html|title=Cultural aspects|publisher=National Institute for Research & Development in Informatics, Romania|accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20080307182620/http://www.ici.ro/romania/en/cultura/cultural_aspects.html |archivedate = 7 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
German philosophy and French culture were integrated into modern Romanian literature, and a new elite of artists led to the appearance of some of the classics of Romanian literature such as Mihai Eminescu, George Coșbuc, Ioan Slavici. Although not particularly renowned outside the country, these writers are widely appreciated within Romania for giving birth to modern Romanian literature. Eminescu is considered the greatest and most influential Romanian poet, particularly for the poem Luceafărul.[tpl]cite web|language=Romanian|url=http://www.ici.ro/romania/en/cultura/l_eminescu.html|title=Mihai Eminescu|publisher=National Institute for Research & Development in Informatics, Romania|accessdate=20 January 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071231163537/http://www.ici.ro/romania/en/cultura/l_eminescu.html  |archivedate = 31 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Among other writers that rose to prominence in the second half of 19th century are Mihail Kogălniceanu, Vasile Alecsandri, Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, and Ion Creangă.
The first half of the 20th century is regarded by many scholars as the Golden Age of Romanian culture, as it is the period when it reached its greatest level of international affirmation and enjoyed a strong connection to Western European cultural trends.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/romanian/articles/TheRomanianCulturalDebateOfTheSummer.html|title= Romanian Cultural Debate of the Summer: Romanian Intellectuals and Their Status Groups|publisher=Romanian Club @ Columbia University|author=Mona Momescu|accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl] Notably, figures such as Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco pioneered the anti-war Dada movement beginning with the First World War.Tom Sandqvist, DADA EAST: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire, London MIT Press, 2006. The most prominent Romanian artist of this time, however, was sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, a central figure of the modern movement and a pioneer of abstraction.

After the World Wars, Communism brought 'absolute' censorship, and used the cultural world as part of the tight control of the population exerted by the much feared "Securitate" paramilitary organization and its numerous informers. Freedom of expression was constantly restricted in various ways, but rebels, exemplified by Gellu Naum, Nichita Stănescu, Marin Sorescu and Marin Preda, managed to escape censorship, broke with "socialist realism" and were the leaders of a small "Renaissance" in Romanian literature.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ștefănescu|first=Alex.|title=Nichita Stănescu, The Angel with a Book in His Hands|language=Romanian|publisher=Mașina de scris|year=1999|page=8|isbn=978-973-99297-4-5[/tpl] While not many of them managed to obtain international acclaim because of censorship, some, like Constantin Noica and Paul Goma had their works published abroad even though they were jailed for various political reasons.
Some artists chose to leave the country for good and continued to make contributions in exile. Among them Eugen Ionescu, Mircea Eliade and Emil Cioran became renowned internationally for their works. Other literary figures who enjoy acclaim outside of the country include the poet Paul Celan and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, both survivors of the Holocaust. The novelist, poet and essayist Herta Müller also received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2009.
Romanian contemporary cinema has achieved worldwide acclaim with the appearance of such films as The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu, directed by Cristi Puiu, (Cannes 2005 Prix un certain regard winner) and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, directed by Cristian Mungiu (Cannes 2007 Palme d'Or winner).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/film-festivals/cannes-2007-winners/|title=Cannes 2007 Winners|publisher=Alternative Film Guide|accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl] The latter, according to Variety, is "further proof of Romania's new prominence in the film world."

On Christmas Eve, young people carol their village homes, hosts giving in exchange nuts, sponge cakes, apples, pretzels and other delicacies. The Star boys' singing procession is a very important part of the Romanian Christmas festivity. During the week between Christmas and New Year's Eve, in all villages groups of lads prepare for "bid", a complex system of customs and habits. In the evening, on the eve of the respective year which arises promising, are expected folklore dances/games: "Ursul", "Capra", "Bunghierii", "Căiuții", "Malanca", "Jienii", "Mascații" and others.[tpl]cite web|author=Improve It Grup S.R.L |url=http://www.traditii.ro/ |title=Traditii si obiceiuri romanesti.

The Romanian folkloric costumes characterize own attributes of the Romanian people and contribute essentially to the definition of the ethnic specificity. Closely related to the human existence, the folkloric costumes reflect over time, as they reflect nowadays, the mentality and artistic conception of the people. The folkloric costume has been developed along the people's history, being a genuine expression of coherent traditions throughout centuries. Distinct clothing ornamentation, traditional methods used for sewing and tailoring the pieces of clothing, and a wide variety of costumes from one region to another customize the defining spirit of the Romanian people.
For women, one of the most important parts of the celebration costume is a kerchief called "maramă". A "maramă" is made from a special fabric called "borangic", which resembles silk, so that the texture of the material is very nice and soft. An important aspect is its transparency, given by the weaver in which it is made. The "borangic" is obtained from silkworms' cocoons. Every woman grows the silkworms in her own yard, feeding them with mullberry leaves. After approximately 6 weeks, the worms would hide in their cocoons and the person who's in charge of them should move the cocoons into the sun so the worms die and the silk filament can be extracted. Once all the filaments are extracted, they're put into a weaver and one woman starts making the "maramă".[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
Also, the folklore of Romania is defined by its mythology, branch of folk literature that integrates a variety of ancestral habits, tales, fables and ballads, whose authors are anonymous. The rural character of the Romanian communities resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture. So, in the Romanian mythology were conceived fabulous beings, unreal characters endowed with supernatural powers. These include Baba Cloanța, a misshapen and recondite witch, Iele, inconstant virgins endowed with unapproachable ability of seduction and superhuman features, Muma Pădurii, a hag that lives in deep forest, Strigoi, troubled souls of the dead rising from the graves and Făt-Frumos, a Prince-Charm hero that fights the griffons, dragons and witches to liberate his heart chosen, Ileana Cosânzeana.[tpl]cite web|url=http://andilandi.ro/marul-de-aur/personaje-mitologice-romanesti/ |title=Personaje mitologice românești |publisher=Andilandi.ro |date=28 January 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2013[/tpl]
The words "longing" and "mourning" do have correspondents in other language, but the nonfigurative character remains undecipherable and defines the specificity of the Romanian soul. Doina, characteristic only to the Romanian literary folklore, represents the lyric creation of the Romanian language, the most varied and complex range of feelings, strongly rooted in its spiritual structure. In the Romanian folkloric tradition, "doina" was played mainly orally or accompanied by a single instrument, being the song of elegy, played for self comforting and not intended for festive events because of its sober nature.

===Cuisine===

Romanian cuisine is a diverse blend of different dishes from several traditions with which it has come into contact, but it also maintains its own character. It has been greatly influenced by Ottoman cuisine but also includes influences from the cuisines of other neighbours, such as the Greeks (musaca), Bulgarians (zacuscă), Turks (pilaf), and Hungarians (langoși). Quite different types of dishes are sometimes included under a generic term; for example, the category ciorbă includes a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. These may be meat and vegetable soups, tripe and calf foot soups, or fish soups, all of which are soured by lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, sour cherry plums, vinegar, or traditionally borș (fermented wheat bran). Popular main courses include mititei, frigărui and the șnițel. One of the most common dishes is mămăliga (similar to the Italian polenta), and is served on its own or as a side dish. Pork and chicken are the preferred meats, but beef, lamb and fish are also popular.
Sarmale are prepared from minced meat (pork, beef, mutton, poultry or fish meat, especially in the Danube Delta), mixed with rice and other aliments (pap, couscous etc.) and wrapped in cabbage (fresh or sour) or vine leaves in the form of rolls. Usually, they are served with polenta and sour cream, but can be served with a spoonful of fresh butter.
The list of desserts includes names like amandine, clătite, chec(cake), cozonac, gogoși, griș cu lapte, lapte de pasăre etc. In the north-western Romania, are prepared so-called ciureghe, gomboți cu prune, pancove, plăcinte crețe, while in north-eastern Romania, the traditional desserts are chec cu vișine, tartă cu mere, alivenci moldovenești.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bucataras.ro/retete-traditionale/140/ |title=Retete traditionale Moldova: retete peste sau cu carne de porc.|publisher=Bucataras.ro |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]
Țuică is a strong plum brandy that is widely regarded as the country's traditional alcoholic beverage, along with the wine. Romania is the world's second largest plum producer (after the United States)Romania second to USA in world plum production, 2007 plum production data on FAOSTAT and as much as 75% of Romania's plum production is processed into the famous țuică, a plum brandy obtained through one or more distillation steps reaching (but not limited to) a 70% alcohol concentration (depending on the number of steps of distillation).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.regard-est.com/home/breve_contenu.php?id=868 |title=Țuica production consumed 75% of Romanian plums in 2003 |publisher=Regard-est.com |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] Alcoholic beverages are also obtained from other fruits (see rachiu, palincă and vișinată).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.educations.com/Study_in_Romania__d2929.html |title=Study in Romania |publisher=Educations.com |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]
Wine, however, is the preferred drink, and Romanian wines have a tradition of over three millennia. Romania is currently the world's 9th largest wine producer, and recently[tpl]when|date=July 2011[/tpl] the export market has started to grow. Romania produces a wide selection of domestic varieties (Fetească[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl], Grasă, Tamâioasă, Băbească), as well as varieties from across the world (Italian Riesling, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Muscat Ottonel).
Beer is also highly regarded, like the blonde pilsener beer, the traditional methods of preparation being generally influenced by German wheat beers. There are some Romanian breweries with a long tradition, such as Timișoreana, Ursus and Azuga. Since the 19th century, beer has become increasingly popular, and today Romanians are amongst the heaviest beer drinkers in the world.[tpl]cite web|author=Diana Tudor |url=http://www.zf.ro/zf-english/romania-enters-global-top-10-for-beer-consumption-3053140/ |title=Romania enters global top 10 for beer consumption | Ziarul Financiar |publisher=Zf.ro |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]
Certain recipes are made in direct connection with the season's holidays. At Christmas, each family usually sacrifices a pig and prepares a large variety of dishes from its meat and internal organs, like (cârnați, caltaboși, chiftele, tobă,sarmale tochitura). At Easter, it is customary to sacrifice a lamb, preparing from its meat drob de miel and roast lamb with thyme, as dessert being served pască cu brânză and cozonac cu nucă.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gastronomie.ele.ro/Bucatarie_romaneasca_--a304.html |title=Bucatarie romaneasca – Cultura si retete – Articole |publisher=Gastronomie.ele.ro |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]

===Holidays===

Since 2013, there are 14 non-working holidays."ZILE LIBERE 2013. Calendarul sărbătorilor legale ale românilor de anul acesta", Gândul.info, 6 March 2013 In Romanian language, the consecrate Christian holidays have untranslatable correspondents, such as Rusalii (Pentecost), Dragobete (Valentine's Day) and Florii (Palm Sunday). Nowadays, the National Day of Romania, a legal non-working holiday, is December the 1st, celebrated by military marches and manifestations across the country. It commemorates the 1918 assembly of the delegates of all ethnic Romanians held in Alba Iulia, when the Union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania was declared upon. During the communist regime, the national day was August the 23rd, marking the 1944 royal coup d'état by King Michael I when he decided about the dismissal and arrest of general Ion Antonescu, Romanian Prime Minister and Leader of the State. On the same day he ordered the immediate cessation of Romania's collaboration with the Axis Powers, the beginning of negotiations for an armistice with the Allies and a military cooperation with the Soviet Union.Romania: the unfinished revolution, Steven D. Roper, Harwood Academic, 2000 A certain segment of Romanians, who support the reinstatement of the monarchy, prefers the date of May 10 to be the National Day, as it used to be between 1866–1947. On May 9, 1877, prime minister Kogălniceanu proclaimed the Principality of Romania's independence from the Ottoman Empire, a status recognized by the European powers in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.[tpl]ro icon[/tpl] Adriana Toma, "9 mai – Ziua Independenței de stat", România liberă, 9 May 2013
