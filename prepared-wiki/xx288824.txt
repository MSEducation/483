On November 4, 2013, Awesomeness TV received negative responses for a recap video uploaded by three of their vloggers Emily Hecht, Lauren Elizabeth, and Halleta Alemu, for their allegedly racist comments in reaction to the South Korean girl group Girls' Generation winning 'Video of the Year' at the first YouTube Music Awards. The three girls openly questioned the group winning the award over the other nominees.[tpl]cite web|last=Peterson|first=Jacques|title=Girlsâ€™ Generation Wins Big At YouTube Music Awards, Racist Tweets From Losing Fandoms Follow|url=http://popdust.com/2013/11/03/girls-generation-wins-big-at-youtube-music-awards-racist-tweets-from-losing-fandoms-follow/[/tpl] The video was taken down and a video with an apology from another reporter from Awesomeness TV was uploaded.
