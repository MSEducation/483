CATEGORIES: Herbs, Lavandula, Medicinal plants

Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 39 species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, southern Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India. Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. The most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia is often referred to as lavender, and there is a colour named for the shade of the flowers of this species.

==Description==

The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants, and suffrutescent perennials, subshrubs or small shrubs.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=xvgq-6VAX8kC |author=Upson T, Andrews S |title=The Genus Lavandula. |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew 2004 |accessdate=2012-03-30[/tpl]
Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They are simple in some commonly cultivated species; in others they are pinnately toothed, or pinnate, sometimes multiple pinnate and dissected. In most species the leaves are covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain the essential oils.
Flowers are borne in whorls, held on spikes rising above the foliage, the spikes being branched in some species. Some species produce coloured bracts at the apices. The flowers may be blue, violet or lilac in the wild species, occasionally blackish purple or yellowish. The calyx is tubular. The corolla is also tubular, usually with five lobes (the upper lip often cleft, and the lower lip has two clefts).[tpl]Cite book | title=Manual of Cultivated Plants | author=L. H.

==Nomenclature and taxonomy==

L. stoechas, L. pedunculata and L. dentata were known in Roman times.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=8gmsF-FQWuUC|editor=Lis-Balchin M|title=Lavender: The genus Lavandula|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2002[/tpl] From the Middle Ages onwards, the European species were considered two separate groups or genera, Stoechas (L. stoechas, L. pedunculata, L. dentata) and Lavandula (L. spica and L. latifolia), until Linnaeus combined them. He only recognised five species in Species Plantarum (1753), L. multifida and L. dentata (Spain) and L. stoechas and L. spica from Southern Europe. L. pedunculata was included within L. stoechas.
By 1790 L. pinnata and L. carnosa were recognised. The latter was subsequently transferred to Anisochilus. By 1826 Frédéric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz listed 12 species in three sections, and by 1848 eighteen species were known.
One of the first modern major classifications was that of Dorothy Chaytor in 1937 at Kew. The six sections she proposed for 28 species still left many intermediates that could not easily be assigned. Her sections included Stoechas, Spica, Subnudae, Pterostoechas, Chaetostachys and Dentatae. However all the major cultivated and commercial forms resided in the Stoechas and Spica sections. There were four species within Stoechas (Lavandula stoechas, L. dentata, L. viridis and L. pedunculata) while Spica had three (L. officinalis (now L. angustifolia), L. latifolia and L. lanata). She believed that the garden varieties were hybrids between true lavender L. angustifolia and spike lavender (L. latifolia).
Chaytor D A. A taxonomic study of the genus Lavandula. 1937
More recently work has been done by Upson and Andrews, and currently Lavandula is considered to have three subgenera.
In addition there are numerous hybrids and cultivars in commercial and horticultural usage.

==Etymology==

The English word lavender is generally thought to be derived from Old French lavandre, ultimately from the Latin lavare (to wash), referring to the use of infusions of the plants.Concise Oxford Dictionary The botanic name Lavandula as used by Linnaeus is considered to be derived from this and other European vernacular names for the plants. However it is suggested that this explanation may be apocryphal, and that the name may actually be derived from Latin livere, "blueish".The alternative derivation of the name lavender from Latin livere and medieval Latin lavindula is given in Upson and Andrews, where it is presented as a conjecture. The problems with the standard derivation are also described; such as that there is no knowledge of the common use of lavender for washing by Greeks and Romans.
The names widely used for some of the species, "English lavender", "French lavender" and "Spanish lavender" are all imprecisely applied. "English lavender" is commonly used for L. angustifolia, though some references say the proper term is "Old English Lavender".Hillier  The name "French lavender" may be used to refer to either L. stoechas or to L. dentata. "Spanish lavender" may be used to refer to L. stoechas, L. lanata or L. dentata.

==Cultivation==

The most common form in cultivation is the common or English lavender Lavandula angustifolia (formerly named L. officinalis). A wide range of cultivars can be found. Other commonly grown ornamental species are L. stoechas, L. dentata, and L. multifida (Egyptian lavender).
Because the cultivated forms are planted in gardens worldwide, they are occasionally found growing wild as garden escapes, well beyond their natural range. Commonly such adventitious establishment is apparently harmless at best, but in some cases Lavandula species have become invasive; for example, in Australia Lavandula stoechas has become a cause for concern; it occurs widely throughout the continent, and has been declared a noxious weed in Victoria since 1920.Carr, G.W, Yugovic, J.V and Robinson, K.E.. `Environmental Weed Invasions in Victoria - conservation and management implications' 1992 Pub: Department of Conservation and Environment and Ecological Horticulture, Victoria, Australia It also is regarded as a weed in parts of Spain.Csurches S., Edwards R.; National Weeds Program, Potential Environmental Weeds in Australia, Candidate Species for Preventative Control; Queensland Department of Natural Resources. January 1998 ISBN 0-642-21409-3 Also http://www.weeds.gov.au/publications/books/pubs/potential.pdf
Lavenders flourish best in dry, well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils in full sun. All types need little or no fertilizer and good air circulation. In areas of high humidity, root rot due to fungus infection can be a problem. Organic mulches can trap moisture around the plants' bases, encouraging root rot. Gravelly materials such as crushed rocks give better results.Kathleen Norris Brenzel, Editor, The Sunset Western Garden Book, 7th Edition

==Lavender oil==

Commercially the plant is grown mainly for the production of essential oil of lavender. This has antiseptic[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=16741725|year=2006|last1=Moon|first1=T|last2=Wilkinson|first2=JM|last3=Cavanagh|first3=HM|title=Antiparasitic activity of two Lavandula essential oils against Giardia duodenalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Hexamita inflata|volume=99|issue=6|pages=722–8|doi=10.1007/s00436-006-0234-8|journal=Parasitology research[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1093/jac/47.5.565|title=Antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact|year=2001|last1=Inouye|first1=S.|last2=Takizawa|first2=T.|last3=Yamaguchi|first3=H.|journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|volume=47|issue=5|pages=565–73|pmid=11328766[/tpl] and anti-inflammatory[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=14522434|year=2003|last1=Hajhashemi|first1=V|last2=Ghannadi|first2=A|last3=Sharif|first3=B|title=Anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of the leaf extracts and essential oil of Lavandula angustifolia Mill|volume=89|issue=1|pages=67–71|doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(03)00234-4|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology[/tpl] properties. These extracts are also used as fragrances for bath products.
English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) yields an essential oil with sweet overtones, and can be used in balms, salves, perfumes, cosmetics, and topical applications. Lavandin, Lavandula × intermedia (also known as Dutch lavender), yields a similar essential oil, but with higher levels of terpenes including camphor, which add a sharper overtone to the fragrance.
The lavandins Lavandula × intermedia are a class of hybrids of L. angustifolia and L. latifolia.Mark Griffiths, Index of Garden Plants (Portland, Oregon: Timber Press, 1994. ISBN 0-333-59149-6.) The lavandins are widely cultivated for commercial use, since their flowers tend to be bigger than those of English lavender and the plants tend to be easier to harvest, but lavandin oil is regarded by some to be of a lower quality than that of English lavender, with a perfume less sweet.National Non-Food Crops Centre.

==Culinary use==

It is grown as a condiment and used in salads and dressings.[tpl]cite book|title=Culinary Herbs: Their Cultivation Harvesting Curing and Uses|year=1912|publisher=Orange Judd Company|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21414/21414-h/21414-h.htm#Page_97|author=M. G.  Kains|editor=American Agriculturist|archivedate=2007|format=English[/tpl]  Flowers yield abundant nectar from which bees make  a high-quality honey.  Monofloral honey is produced primarily around the Mediterranean, and is marketed worldwide as a premium product.  Flowers can be candied and are sometimes used as cake decorations.  Lavender flavours baked goods and desserts (it pairs especially well with chocolate), and is also used to make "lavender sugar".http://www.purplehazelavender.com/cooking.html Purple Haze Lavender Farm - Cooking with Lavender Lavender flowers are occasionally blended with black, green, or herbal teas.
Though it has many other traditional uses in southern France, lavender is not used in traditional southern French cooking. It does not appear at all in the best-known compendium of Provençal cooking, J.-B. Reboul's Cuisinière Provençale J.-B. Reboul; Cuisinière Provençale (1910) In the 1970s, a herb blend called herbes de Provence usually including lavender was invented by spice wholesalers,[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0392192105055941|title=From its Birthplace in Egypt to Marseilles, an Ancient Trade: 'Drugs and Spices'|year=2005|last1=Laget|first1=F.|journal=Diogenes|volume=52|issue=3|pages=131 [/tpl] and lavender has more recently become popular in cookery.
Lavender lends a floral and slightly sweet flavour to most dishes, and is sometimes paired with sheep's-milk and goat's-milk cheeses. For most cooking applications the dried buds, which are also referred to as flowers, are used. Some chefs experiment with the leaves but only the buds contain the essential oil of lavender, from which the scent and flavour of lavender are derived. In the United States, both lavender syrup and dried lavender buds are used to make lavender scones and marshmallows.

==Medical uses==

The essential oil was used in hospitals during World War I.Mrs. M. Grieve, A Modern Herbal, Vol. II (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1971; ISBN 0-486-22799-5)
Lavender is used extensively with herbs and aromatherapy.  Infusions are believed to soothe insect bites, burns, and headaches. Bunches of lavender repel insects. In pillows, lavender seeds and flowers aid sleep and relaxation. An infusion of flowerheads added to a cup of boiling water is used to soothe and relax at bedtime[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]. Lavender oil (or extract of Lavender) is used to treat acne when diluted 1:10 with water, rosewater, or witch hazel; it also treats skin burns and inflammatory conditions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
A study published in 2010 investigated anxiolytic effects and influence on sleep quality.

==Health precautions==

The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that lavender is considered likely safe in food amounts and possibly safe in medicinal amounts. NIH does not recommend the use of lavender while pregnant or breast-feeding because of lack of knowledge of its effects. It recommends caution if young boys use lavender oil because of possible hormonal effects leading to gynecomastia, and states that lavender can cause skin irritation.[tpl]cite web |title=Lavender: MedlinePlus Supplements |publisher=National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/838.html#Safety |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/lavender/ataglance.htm |title=Lavender: Science and Safety |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine |date=March 2007 |accessdate=2013-11-05[/tpl]

===Gynecomastia===

A study was published in 2007 on the use of lavender and gynecomastia in prepubescent boys.[tpl]Cite web  |author1=Miranda Hitti |author2=Reviewer Louise Chang MD  | title = Lavender Oil May Spur Breasts in Boys | url = http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20070131/lavender-oil-may-spur-breasts-boys | publisher = WebMD, LLC  | date =  31 January 2007| accessdate = 2013-11-06[/tpl] Three young boys developed gynecomastia while using products containing lavender.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064725|title=Prepubertal Gynecomastia Linked to Lavender and Tea Tree Oils|year=2007|last1=Henley|first1=Derek V.|last2=Lipson|first2=Natasha|last3=Korach|first3=Kenneth S.|last4=Bloch|first4=Clifford A.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=356|issue=5|pages=479 85|pmid=17267908 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa064725[/tpl] The boys stopped using the products, and the gynecomastia went away. The researchers found that lavender and tea tree oil can cause estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities in cell cultures, and the paper states that "repeated topical exposure to lavender and tea tree oils probably caused prepubertal gynecomastia in these boys." After the study was published The New England Journal of Medicine received letters disputing the paper's findings, and the authors were allowed to respond.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa064725#t=letters |title=Prepubertal Gynecomastia Linked to Lavender and Tea Tree Oils|Letters |publisher=The New England Journal of Medicine, |date=14 June 2007 |accessdate=2013-11-05[/tpl]

The Australian Tea Tree Industry Association rebuttal states that various other plants have estrogen inducing effects in essential oil form, including, "soy, hops, garbanzo beans, red clover, lentils, flaxseed, sunflower seeds, alfalfa sprouts, liquorice, and ginseng."
A study published in 2010 from the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials did not find estrogenic activity from lavender oil in laboratory animals.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Politano | first1 = VT. | last2 = McGinty | first2 = D. | last3 = Lewis | first3 = EM. | last4 = Hoberman | first4 = EM | last5 = Christian | first6 = MS | last7 = Diener | first7 = RM | last8 = Api | first8 = AM | title = Uterotrophic assay of percutaneous lavender oil in immature female rats.  | journal = International journal of toxicology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–9 |date=Mar–Apr 2013 | doi = 10.1177/1091581812472209 | PMID =  23358464 |url=http://ijt.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/24/1091581812472209.abstract[/tpl]  A newer version of the paper became available in 2013.

===Skin Irritant===

A review published in 2005 on lavender essential oil states that, "Lavender is traditionally regarded as a 'safe' oil and, although it was recently reported that lavender oil, and its major constituent linalyl acetate, are toxic to human skin cells in vitro, contact dermatitis to lavender oil appears to occur at only a very low frequency."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Cavanagh |first1=Heather MA |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Jenny M |title=Lavender essential oil: a review |periodical=Australian Infection Control |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |date=March 2005 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=HI05035.pdf[/tpl]

===Photosensitivity===

A study was published in 2007 which looked a the relationship between various fragrances and photosensitivity. The study stated that lavender is known "to elicit cutaneous phototoxic reactions". However, the research did not find that lavender induced photohaemolysis.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Placzek | first1 = M. | last2 = Frömel | first2 = W. | last3 = Eberlein | first3 = B. | last4 = Gilbertz | first4 = KP. | last5 = Przybilla | first5 = B. | title = Evaluation of phototoxic properties of fragrances. | journal = Acta Derm Venereol | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 312–6 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi = 10.2340/00015555-0251 | doi_brokendate = 2013-11-06 | PMID = 17598033 |quote=Also, oils of lemon, lavender, lime, sandalwood and cedar are known to elicit cutaneous phototoxic reactions, but lavender, sandalwood and cedar oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our assay...Lavender oil and sandalwood oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our test system.

==Other uses==

Flower spikes are used for dried flower arrangements. The fragrant, pale purple flowers and flower buds are used in potpourris. Lavender is also used extensively as herbal filler inside sachets used to freshen linens. Dried and sealed in pouches, lavender flowers are placed among stored items of clothing to give a fresh fragrance and to deter moths. Dried lavender flowers have become recently popular for wedding confetti. Lavender is also popular in scented waters and sachets.

==In history and culture==

The ancient Greeks called the lavender herb nardus, after the Syrian city of Naarda (possibly the modern town of Dohuk, Iraq). It was also commonly called nard.[ref]The origin of most of these quotes comes from Dr. William Thomas Fernie, in his book "Herbal Simples" (Bristol Pub., 1895. ASIN: B0014W4WNE). A digital copy of the book can be read online via google books.
