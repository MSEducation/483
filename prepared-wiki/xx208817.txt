Sleep deprivation is the condition of not having enough sleep; it can be either chronic or acute. A chronic sleep-restricted state can cause fatigue, daytime sleepiness, clumsiness and weight loss or weight gain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Taheri S, Lin L, Austin D, Young T, Mignot E |title=Short Sleep Duration Is Associated with Reduced Leptin, Elevated Ghrelin, and Increased Body Mass Index |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=e62 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15602591 |pmc=535701 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062[/tpl] It adversely affects the brain and cognitive function.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Alhola |first=Paula |coauthor=Päivi Polo-Kantola |date=October 2007 |title=Sleep deprivation: Impact on cognitive performance |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=553–567|quote=Although both conditions and partial SD induce several negative effects including impairments in cognitive performance, the underlying mechanisms seem to be somewhat different. |pmc=2656292 |pmid=19300585[/tpl] Few studies have compared the effects of acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction. Complete absence of sleep over long periods has not been seen in humans (unless they suffer from fatal familial insomnia); it appears that brief microsleeps cannot be avoided.[tpl]cite book |title=Sleep deprivation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EaGWMXsR5XYC&pg=PA183 |last=Kushida |first= Clete Anthony |publisher=Informa Health Care |year=2005 |pages=1–2 |isbn=0-8247-5949-4[/tpl] Long-term total sleep deprivation has caused death in lab animals.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Rechtschaffen A, Bergmann B|doi=10.1016/0166-4328(95)00020-T |title=Sleep deprivation in the rat by the disk-over-water method |year=1995 |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=69 |pages=55–63 |pmid=7546318 |issue=1–2[/tpl]

==Physiological effects==

Generally, sleep deprivation may result in:[tpl]cite web |title=Sleep deprivation|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Sleep_deprivation?OpenDocument|work=betterhealth.vic.gov.au[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209144819/http://www.apa.org/ed/topss/bryanread.html|title=Sleep Deprivation|author=Read, Bryan F. |work=St. Paul's School for Girls, Brooklandville, Maryland[/tpl]

===Diabetes===

In 2005, a study of over 1400 participants showed that participants who habitually slept few hours were more likely to have associations with type 2 diabetes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gottlieb DJ |title=Association of sleep time with diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=165 |issue=8 |pages=863–7 |date= April 2005 |pmid=15851636 |doi=10.1001/archinte.165.8.863 |author2=Punjabi NM |author3=Newman AB |last4=Resnick |first4=HE |last5=Redline |first5=S |last6=Baldwin |first6=CM |last7=Nieto |first7=FJ[/tpl] However, because this study was merely correlational, the direction of cause and effect between little sleep and diabetes is uncertain. The authors point to an earlier study which showed that experimental rather than habitual restriction of sleep resulted in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).[tpl]cite journal |last=Spiegel |first=K. |coauthors=R. Leproult, E. Van Cauter |date=23 October 1999 |title=Impact of sleep debt on metabolic and endocrine function |journal=The Lancet |volume= 354 |issue=9188 |pages=1435–9 |pmid=10543671 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01376-8[/tpl]

===Effects on the brain===

Sleep deprivation can adversely affect the brain and cognitive function.[tpl]cite web|title=Renew – Sleep and Stress|publisher=The Franklin Institute Online|year=2004[/tpl] A 2000 study, by the UCSD School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in San Diego, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to monitor activity in the brains of sleep-deprived subjects performing simple verbal learning tasks.[tpl]cite web|title=Brain Activity is Visibly Altered Following Sleep Deprivation |work=UC San Diego Health System|date=3 February 2006 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110310143903/http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2000_02_09_Sleep.html[/tpl] The study showed that regions of the brain's prefrontal cortex, an area that supports mental faculties such as working memory and logical and practical ("means-ends") reasoning, displayed more activity in sleepier subjects. Researchers interpreted this result as indicating that the brain of the average sleep-deprived subject had to work harder than that of the average non-sleep-deprived subject to accomplish a given task, and from this indication they inferred the conclusion the brains of sleep-deprived subjects were attempting to compensate for adverse effects caused by sleep deprivation.
The temporal lobe, which is a brain region involved in language processing, was activated during verbal learning in rested subjects but not in sleep-deprived subjects. The parietal lobe, not activated in rested subjects during the verbal exercise, was more active when the subjects were deprived of sleep. Although memory performance was less efficient with sleep deprivation, greater activity in the parietal region was associated with better short term memory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20000209/lack-of-sleep-takes-toll-on-brain-power |title=Lack of Sleep Takes Toll on Brain Power |work=WebMD |accessdate=2010-12-14[/tpl]
A 2001 study at the Chicago Medical Institute suggested that sleep deprivation may be linked to serious diseases, such as heart disease and mental illness including psychosis and bipolar disorder.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  The link between sleep deprivation and psychosis was further documented in 2007 through a study at Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley. The study revealed, using MRI scans, that sleep deprivation causes the brain to become incapable of putting an emotional event into the proper perspective and incapable of making a controlled, suitable response to the event.
A study tested 17 right-handed civilian males, between the ages of 21 and 29 years (mean 24.7 ± 2.8 years), with no history of medical, neurological, psychiatric, or sleep disorder conditions. Their histories also included 7–8 hours of nightly sleep on a regular basis, no nicotine use, and low caffeine use (less than 100 mg/day).
The negative effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and cognitive performance suggest decreases in brain activity and function, primarily in the thalamus, structure involved in alertness and attention, and in the prefrontal cortex, a region sub-serving alertness, attention, and higher-order cognitive processes.
This study used a combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorine-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), a marker for regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) and neuronal synaptic activity. A time series design was used, with progressive sleep deprivation as the independent variable. Repeated measures of absolute regional CMRglu, cognitive performance, alertness, mood, and subjective experiences were collected after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of sleep deprivation. Additional measures of alertness, cognitive performance, and mood were collected at fixed intervals throughout the sleep deprivation period. These measures were included to place the performance results associated with the PET scans in the context of the circadian rhythm of cognitive performance, as well as to impose a moderate-to-heavy near continuous workload on the subjects as might be anticipated in a real-world sustained operation.
A noted 2002 University of California animal study indicated that non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) is necessary for turning off neurotransmitters and allowing their receptors to "rest" and regain sensitivity which allows monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) to be effective at naturally produced levels. This leads to improved regulation of mood and increased learning ability. The study also found that rapid eye movement sleep (REM) deprivation may alleviate clinical depression because it mimics selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This is because the natural decrease in monoamines during REM is not allowed to occur, which causes the concentration of neurotransmitters in the brain, that are depleted in clinically depressed persons, to increase. Sleep outside of the REM phase may allow enzymes to repair brain cell damage caused by free radicals. High metabolic activity while awake damages the enzymes themselves preventing efficient repair. This study observed the first evidence of brain damage in rats as a direct result of sleep deprivation.[tpl]cite news |first=Jerome M. |last=Siegel |title=Why We Sleep |url= http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf |work=Scientific American |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2008-04-03[/tpl]
Animal studies suggest that sleep deprivation increases stress hormones, which may reduce new cell production in adult brains.No sleep means no new brain cells. BBC (10 February 2007)

===Effects on growth===

A 1999 study[tpl]cite journal |author=Vgontzas AN, Mastorakos G, Bixler EO, Kales A, Gold PW, Chrousos GP |title=Sleep deprivation effects on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and growth axes: potential clinical implications |journal=Clin. Endocrinol. |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=205–15|date= August 1999 |pmid=10468992 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00763.x[/tpl] found that sleep deprivation resulted in reduced cortisol secretion the next day, driven by increased subsequent slow-wave sleep. Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which controls reactions to stress and regulates body functions such as digestion, the immune system, mood, sex, or energy usage) while suppressing growth hormones. The results supported previous studies, which observed adrenal insufficiency in idiopathic hypersomnia.

===Effects on the healing process===

A study conducted in 2005 showed that a group of rats which were deprived of REM sleep for five days experienced no significant changes in their ability to heal wounds, compared to a group of rats not deprived of "dream" sleep.[tpl]cite journal |title=Effects of sleep deprivation on wound healing |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=14 |issue=3 |year=2005|author=Mostaghimi, L. |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00455.x |pmid=16120095 |author2=Obermeyer, WH |author3=Ballamudi, B |author4=Martinez-Gonzalez, D |author5=Benca, RM |pages=213–9[/tpl] The rats were allowed deep (NREM) sleep. However, another study conducted by Gumustekin et al.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gümüştekín K |title=Effects of sleep deprivation, nicotine, and selenium on wound healing in rats |journal=Int. J. Neurosci. |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=1433–42 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15636354 |doi=10.1080/00207450490509168 |author2=Seven B |author3=Karabulut N |last4=Aktas |first4=Ömer |last5=Gürsan |first5=Nesrin |last6=Aslan |first6=Sahin |last7=Keles |first7=Mustafa |last8=Varoglu |first8=Erhan |last9=Dane |first9=Senol|display-authors=9 [/tpl] in 2004 showed sleep deprivation hindering the healing of burns on rats.

===Attention and working memory===

Among the numerous physical consequences of sleep deprivation, deficits in attention and working memory are perhaps the most important; such lapses in mundane routines can lead to unfortunate results, from forgetting ingredients while cooking to missing a sentence while taking notes. Working memory is tested by such methods as choice-reaction time tasks.
The attentional lapses also extend into more critical domains in which the consequences can be life-or-death; car crashes and industrial disasters can result from inattentiveness attributable to sleep deprivation. To empirically measure the magnitude of attention deficits, researchers typically employ the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) which requires the subject to press a button in response to a light at pseudo-random intervals. Failure to press the button in response to the stimulus (light) is recorded as an error, attributable to the microsleeps that occur as a product of sleep deprivation.
Crucially, individuals' subjective evaluations of their fatigue often do not predict actual performance on the PVT. While totally sleep-deprived individuals are usually aware of the degree of their impairment, lapses from chronic (lesser) sleep deprivation can build up over time so that they are equal in number and severity to the lapses occurring from total (acute) sleep deprivation. Chronically sleep-deprived people, however, continue to rate themselves considerably less impaired than totally sleep-deprived participants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year= 2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469|last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF[/tpl] Since people usually evaluate their capability on tasks like driving subjectively, their evaluations may lead them to the false conclusion that they can perform tasks that require constant attention when their abilities are in fact impaired.

===Impairment of driving ability===

The dangers of sleep deprivation are apparent on the road; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) reports that one in every five serious motor vehicle injuries is related to driver fatigue, with 80,000 drivers falling asleep behind the wheel every day and 250,000 accidents every year related to sleep,[tpl]cite web |title=Drowsy Driving Fact Sheet |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |work=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |date=2 December 2009[/tpl] though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests the figure for traffic accidents may be closer to 100,000.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carpenter, Siri |journal=Monitor on Psychology  |title=Sleep deprivation may be undermining teen health |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct01/sleepteen.html |volume=32 |issue=9 |year=2001|page=42[/tpl] The AASM recommends pulling off the road and taking a 15- or 20-minute nap to alleviate drowsiness.
According to a 2000 study published in the British Medical Journal, researchers in Australia and New Zealand reported that sleep deprivation can have some of the same hazardous effects as being drunk.[tpl]cite journal |author=Williamson AM, Feyer AM |title=Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=649–55 |year=2000 |pmid=10984335 |pmc=1739867 |doi= 10.1136/oem.57.10.649[/tpl] People who drove after being awake for 17–19 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of .05 percent, which is the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries and Australia. Another study suggested that performance begins to degrade after 16 hours awake, and 21 hours awake was equivalent to a blood alcohol content of .08 percent, which is the blood alcohol limit for drunk driving in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dawson, Drew and Kathryn Reid |title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6639 |year=1997 |page=235 |doi=10.1038/40775 |pmid=9230429[/tpl]

==Other forms of impairment==

In addition, as a result of continuous muscular activity without proper rest time, effects such as cramping are much more frequent in sleep-deprived individuals. Extreme cases of sleep deprivation have been reported to be associated with hernias, muscle fascia tears, and other such problems commonly associated with physical overexertion.
A 2006 study has shown that while total sleep deprivation for one night caused many errors, the errors were not significant until after the second night of total sleep deprivation.[tpl]cite journal |title= Effects of two nights sleep deprivation and two nights recovery sleep on response inhibition |journal=Journal of Sleep Research |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=September 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2006.00535.x |author=Drummond, SEAN P.A. |pmid=16911028 |author2=Paulus, MP |author3=Tapert, SF |pages= 261–5[/tpl] However, combining alcohol with acute sleep deprivation results in a trebled rate of driving off the road when using a simulator.[tpl]cite journal |author=Timothy Roehrs |title=Sleepiness and ethanol effects on simulated driving |journal=Alcoholism:clinical and experimental research |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=154–158 |date=February 1994 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1994.tb00896.x |last2=Beare |first2=David |last3=Zorick |first3=Frank |last4=Roth |first4=Thomas[/tpl]
The National Sleep Foundation identifies several warning signs that a driver is dangerously fatigued, including rolling down the window, turning up the radio, trouble keeping eyes open, head-nodding, drifting out of the lane, and daydreaming. At particular risk are lone drivers between midnight and 6 am.[tpl]cite web |title=Drowsy Driving:Key Messages and Talking Points |date=2 December 2009 |url=http://www.sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Drowsy%20Driving-Key%20Messages%20and%20Talking%20Points.pdf |work=National Sleep Foundation[/tpl]
Sleep deprivation can negatively impact performance in professional fields as well, potentially jeopardizing lives. Due largely to the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which killed 50 people and was partially attributed to pilot fatigue, the FAA reviewed its procedures to ensure that pilots are sufficiently rested.[tpl]cite web |author=Michaels, Dave |title=FAA Won't Allow Cockpit Naps as Part of Plan to Reduce Pilot Fatigue |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/washington/dmichaels/stories/120209dnbuspilotfatigue.30ec3d77b.html |date=2 December 2009|work=Dallas News[/tpl] A 2004 study also found medical residents with less than four hours of sleep a night made more than twice as many errors as residents who slept for more than seven hours a night, an especially alarming trend given that less than 11% of surveyed residents were sleeping more than seven hours a night.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baldwinn, DeWitt C. Jr. and Steven R.

Twenty-four hours of continuous sleep deprivation results in the choice of less difficult math tasks without decreases in subjective reports of effort applied to the task. Naturally caused sleep loss affects the choice of everyday tasks such that low effort tasks are mostly commonly selected. Adolescents who experience less sleep show a decreased willingness to engage in sports activities that require effort through fine motor coordination and attention to detail.[tpl]cite journal|last=Engle-Friedman|first=Mindy|coauthors=Suzanne Riela, Rama Golan, Ana M.

Astronauts have reported performance errors and decreased cognitive ability during periods of extended working hours and wakefulness as well as due to sleep loss caused by circadian rhythm disruption and environmental factors.[tpl]cite web|last=Whitmire|first=A.M.|title=Risk of Performance Errors due to Sleep Loss, Circadian Desynchronization, Fatigue, and Work Overload|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/Sleep.pdf|work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions: Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program|accessdate=25 June 2012|coauthors=Leveton, L.B; Barger, L.; Brainard, G.; Dinges, D.F.; Klerman, E.; Shea, C.[/tpl]

===Microsleeps===

Microsleeps occur when a person has a significant sleep deprivation. The brain automatically shuts down, falling into a sleep state for a period that can last from a fraction of a second up to half a minute.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014[/tpl] The person falls asleep no matter what activity he or she is engaged in.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014[/tpl] Microsleeps are similar to blackouts and a person experiencing them is not consciously aware that they are occurring.
An even lighter type of sleep has been seen in rats that have been kept awake for long periods of time. In a process known as local sleep, specific localized regions went into periods of short (~80 ms) but frequent (~40/min) NREM-like state. Despite the on and off periods where neurons shut off, the rats appeared awake, although they performed worse at tests.[tpl]cite journal | title=Local sleep in awake rats| author=Vyazovskiy VV, Olcese U, Hanlon EC, Nir Y, Cirelli C, Tononi G | journal=Nature| year=2011| volume=472| pages=443–447 |laysummary=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110427/full/news.2011.259.html |doi=10.1038/nature10009 | issue=7344 | pmid=21525926 | pmc=3085007[/tpl]

===Weight gain/loss===

In rats, prolonged, complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure with a net effect of weight loss and ultimately death.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 2928622 | volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Sleep deprivation in the rat: III. Total sleep deprivation |date=February 1989 | author=Everson CA, Bergmann BM, Rechtschaffen A | journal=Sleep | pages=13–21[/tpl] This study hypothesizes that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is associated with increased appetite and energy expenditure with the equation tipped towards food intake rather than expenditure in societies where high-calorie food is freely available.
Several large studies using nationally representative samples suggest that the obesity problem in the United States might have as one of its causes a corresponding decrease in the average number of hours that people are sleeping.Does the lack of sleep make you fat?, Bristol University Press Release, 7 December 2004[tpl]cite journal |author=Hasler G |title=The association between short sleep duration and obesity in young adults: a 13-year prospective study |journal=Sleep |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=661–6 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15283000 |author2=Buysse DJ |author3=Klaghofer R |last4=Gamma |first4=A |last5=Ajdacic |first5=V |last6=Eich |first6=D |last7=Rössler |first7=W |last8=Angst |first8=J[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gangwisch JE, Malaspina D, Boden-Albala B, Heymsfield SB |title=Inadequate sleep as a risk factor for obesity: analyses of the NHANES I |journal=Sleep |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1289–96 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16295214[/tpl] The findings suggest that this might be happening because sleep deprivation could be disrupting hormones that regulate glucose metabolism and appetite.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Cauter E, Spiegel K |title=Sleep as a mediator of the relationship between socioeconomic status and health: a hypothesis |journal=Ann.

The association between sleep deprivation and obesity appears to be strongest in young and middle-age adults. Other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems, such as sleep apnea, reduce an individual's chances of getting a good night's sleep.
Sleep loss is currently proposed to disturb endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis leading to weight gain and obesity. For instance, laboratory sleep deprivation studies in young men have demonstrated that one night of wakefulness (typically found e.g. in shift workers) exerts significant effects on the energy balance the next morning, including reduced energy expenditure,[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 21471283 | volume=93 | issue=6 | title=Acute sleep deprivation reduces energy expenditure in healthy men |date=June 2011 | author=Benedict C, Hallschmid M, Lassen A, Mahnke C, Schultes B, Schiöth HB, Born J, Lange T | journal=Am J Clin Nutr | pages=1229–36 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.110.006460[/tpl] enhanced hedonic stimulus processing in the brain underlying the drive to consume food,[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 22259064  | volume=97 | issue=3 | title=Acute sleep deprivation enhances the brain's response to hedonic food stimuli: an fMRI study |date=January 2012 | author=Benedict C, Brooks SJ, O'Daly OG, Almèn MS, Morell A, Åberg K, Gingnell M, Schultes B, Hallschmid M, Broman JE, Larsson EM, Schiöth HB | journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | pages=E443–7 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-2759[/tpl] and overeating that goes beyond satiety.[tpl]cite journal | title=Acute sleep deprivation increases portion size and affects food choice in young men | year=2013 | author= Hogenkamp PS, Nilsson E, Nilsson VC, Chapman CD, Vogel H, Lundberg LS, Zarei S, Cedernaes J, Rångtell FH, Broman JE, Dickson SL, Brunstrom JM, Benedict C, Schiöth JB | journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume=38 | issue=9 | pages=1668–74 | doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.01.012| pmid=23428257 | last2=Nilsson | last3=Nilsson | last4=Chapman | last5=Vogel | last6=Lundberg | last7=Zarei | last8=Cedernaes | last9=Rångtell | last10=Broman | last11=Dickson | last12=Brunstrom | last13=Benedict | last14=Schiöth [/tpl] Further studies have shown that a reduction of sleep duration to 4 hours for two consecutive nights has recently been shown to decrease circulating leptin levels and to increase ghrelin levels, as well as self-reported hunger. Similar endocrine alterations have been shown to occur even after a single night of sleep restriction.
In a balanced order, nine healthy normal-weight men spent three nights in a sleep laboratory separated by at least 2 weeks: one night with a total sleep time of 7 h, one night with a total sleep time of 4.5 hours, and one night with total sleep deprivation (SD).
On a standard symptom-rating scale, subjects rated markedly stronger feelings of hunger after total SD than after 7-hour sleep (3.9 ± 0.7 versus 1.7 ± 0.3; P = 0.020) or 4.5 h sleep (2.2 ± 0.5; P = 0.041). Plasma ghrelin levels were 22 ± 10% higher after total SD than after 7 h sleep (0.85 ± 0.06 versus 0.72 ± 0.04 ng mL(−1); P = 0.048) with intermediate levels of the hormone after 4.5 h sleep (0.77 ± 0.04 ng mL(−1)).
Feelings of hunger as well as plasma ghrelin levels are already elevated after one night of SD, whereas morning serum leptin concentrations remain unaffected. Thus, the results provide further evidence for a disturbing influence of sleep loss on endocrine regulation of energy homeostasis, which in the long run may result in weight gain and obesity.

===Gene regulation===

A sleepless week down-regulated 444 genes, and up-regulated 267.  Genes that were affected are related to circadian rhythms, metabolism, inflammation, immune response and stress.[tpl]cite web|title=Sleep deprivation plays havoc with genes › News in Science (ABC Science)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/02/26/3697827.htm|date=26 February 2013|publisher=abc.net.au[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Effects of insufficient sleep on circadian rhythmicity and expression amplitude of the human blood transcriptome|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/20/1217154110|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=2013-02-26|publisher=pnas.org[/tpl]

==Uses==

===Scientific study of laboratory animals===

In science, sleep deprivation (of rodents, e.g.) is used in order to study the function(s) of sleep and the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep deprivation.
Some sleep deprivation techniques are:

===Interrogation===

Sleep deprivation can be used as a means of interrogation, which has resulted in court trials over whether or not the technique is a form of torture.[tpl]cite news |title=Binyam Mohamed torture appeal lost by UK government... |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8507852.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2009[/tpl]
Under one interrogation technique, a subject might be kept awake for several days and when finally allowed to fall asleep, suddenly awakened and questioned. Menachem Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983, described his experience of sleep deprivation as a prisoner of the NKVD in Russia as follows:
[tpl]quote|In the head of the interrogated prisoner, a haze begins to form. His spirit is wearied to death, his legs are unsteady, and he has one sole desire: to sleep... Anyone who has experienced this desire knows that not even hunger and thirst are comparable with it.[tpl]cite book |author=Begin, Menachem |title=White nights: the story of a prisoner in Russia |publisher=Harper & Row |location=San Francisco |year=1979 |isbn=0-06-010289-6[/tpl][/tpl]
Sleep deprivation was one of the five techniques used by the British government in the 1970s. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques "did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture ... but amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment", in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Ireland v. the United Kingdom paragraph 102
The United States Justice Department released four memos in August 2002 describing interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency. They first described 10 techniques used in the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah, described as a terrorist logistics specialist, including sleep deprivation. Memos from May 2005 introduced four more techniques and confirmed that the combination of interrogation methods did not constitute torture under United States law.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/04/17/us/politics/20090417-interrogation-techniques.html | work=The New York Times | title=Explaining and Authorizing Specific Interrogation Techniques | date=17 April 2009[/tpl]

===Treatment for depression===

Recent studies show sleep restriction has some potential in the treatment of depression. As many as 60% of patients, when sleep-deprived, show immediate recovery, although most relapse the following night. The effect has been shown to be linked to increases in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).[tpl]Cite journal  | author = Gorgulu Y, Caliyurt O | title = Rapid antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation therapy correlates with serum BDNF changes in major depression | journal = Brain Res Bull | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 158–62 |date=Sep 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.06.016 | pmid = 19576267 [/tpl] It has been shown that chronotype is related to the effect of sleep deprivation on mood in normal people.

===Voluntary===

Sleep deprivation can sometimes be self-imposed due to a lack of desire to sleep or the habitual use of stimulant drugs. Sleep deprivation is also self-imposed to achieve personal fame in the context of record-breaking stunts.

==Sleep apnea==

Sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA) is a collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which reduces airflow to the lungs. It has many serious health outcomes if untreated, but can very often be effectively treated with positive air pressure therapy. Nasal problems such as a deviated septum will shut down the airway and increase swelling in the mucus lining and nasal turbinates. Corrective surgery (septoplasty) will maximise the airflow and correct the feedback loop to the brain which keeps awakening the sufferer so as not to asphyxiate.
Central sleep apnea is repeated stops in breathing during sleep when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.

==Mental illness==

The specific causal relationships between sleep loss and effects on psychiatric disorders have been most extensively studied in patients with mood disorders. Shifts into mania in bipolar patients are often preceded by periods of insomnia, and sleep deprivation has been shown to induce a manic state in susceptible individuals. Sleep deprivation may represent a final common pathway in the genesis of mania, and sleep loss is both a precipitating and reinforcing factor for the manic state.

==School==

A National Sleep Foundation survey found that college/university-aged students get an average of 6.7 hours of sleep each night.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] Sleep deprivation is common in first year college students as they adjust to the stress and social activities of college life.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate a 50% reduction of deep (stage 4) sleep and a 75% reduction in the peak amplitude of delta waves during NREM sleep in adolescence. School schedules are often incompatible with a corresponding delay in sleep offset, leading to a less than optimal amount of sleep for the majority of adolescents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Giedd JN |title=Linking adolescent sleep, brain maturation, and behavior |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=45 |issue=4 |date=October 2009 |pages=319–320 |pmid=19766933 |pmc=3018343 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.07.007 [/tpl]

==Counteracting the effects of sleep deprivation==

Several strategies are common in attempting to increase alertness and counteract the effects of sleep deprivation. Caffeine is often used over short periods to boost wakefulness when acute sleep deprivation is experienced; however, caffeine is less effective if taken routinely. Other strategies recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine include prophylactic sleep before deprivation, naps, other stimulants, and combinations thereof. However, the only sure and safe way to combat sleep deprivation is to increase nightly sleep time.[tpl]cite web |work=American Academy of Sleep Medicine |title=Sleep Deprivation Fact Sheet |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/SleepDeprivation.pdf |date=2 December 2009[/tpl]
Recovery of cognitive function is accomplished more rapidly after acute total sleep deprivation than after chronic partial sleep restriction. Chronic deprivation is the more common in everyday life. Just one night of recovery sleep can reverse adverse effects of total sleep deprivation. Recovery sleep is more efficient than normal sleep with shorter sleep latency and increased amounts of deep and REM sleep.

==Longest periods without sleep==

==Insomnia==

Insomnia is one of the six types of dyssomnias. Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders affecting 33% of adults. It has many symptoms that are easily recognizable. Many of these symptoms include, daytime sleepiness, frustration or worry about your sleep, problems with attention, concentration, or memory, extreme mood changes or irritability, lack of energy or motivation, poor performance at school or work, and tension headaches or stomach aches. There are two different categories insomnia is put into: primary and secondary. These categories are based upon the causes of the insomnia. Primary insomnia is caused by a known medical or psychological condition that results in poor sleep. There are three main types of primary insomnia. These include: psychophysiological, idiopathic, and sleep state misperception. In psychophysiological insomnia is anxiety-induced which results in poor sleep. Idiopathic insomnia is one that generally begins in childhood and lasts the rest of the person’s life. It’s suggested this type of insomnia is a neurochemical problem in the part of the brain that controls the sleep-wake cycle. Sleep state misperception is when the person gets enough sleep, but their awareness of the time they have slept is inaccurate. Secondary insomnia’s factors include medical conditions, neurological conditions, psychological and psychiatric conditions, use of stimulant substances, sleep apnea or parasomnias, and fatal familial insomnia.
