A number of smaller parties represented different ethnic groups and were more local than national.

==Polling day==

After identifying themselves and voting, voters would dip their forefinger in green indelible ink. Opposition parties complained of minor irregularities regarding election lists. Due to the security situation, the army was told to ensure free and fair elections but not to intimidate voters. Students in the capital Rangoon had threatened to cause disorder after one of their leaders was killed by police, however this did not materialise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=S6wnAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E2wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=|title=U Nu wins Burma vote|last=Associated Press|date=30 April 1956|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette[/tpl]
