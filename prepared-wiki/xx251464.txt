[[Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1869â€“1872]]

CATEGORIES: Members of New South Wales parliaments by term

This is a list of members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1869 to 1872. Elections for the sixth Legislative Assembly were held between 3 December 1869 and 10 January 1870 with parliament first meeting on 27 January 1870. There were 72 members elected for 52 single member electorates, 6 two member electorates and 2 four member electorates. Due to a change in the NSW Constitution the maximum term of this parliament was reduced from 5 years to 3. However the assembly was dissolved after only 25 months after the third government of James Martin lost a vote of supply.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
