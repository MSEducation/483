The now defunct Pah-Ute County was split from Mohave County in 1865, but merged back in 1871. All but La Paz County were created by the time Arizona was granted statehood in 1912.[tpl]cite book | last=Adams, Ward R.| title =History of Arizona | publisher =Higginson Book Company | year =1997 | isbn =0-8328-7044-7 [/tpl]
The names of many of the counties pay tribute to the state's Native American heritage. Nine of the fifteen counties are named after various native groups that are resident in parts of what is now Arizona.  Three of the other counties have Spanish names from the language of the early Hispanic explorers of Arizona: La Paz County, Santa Cruz County, and Pinal County. Another county, Graham County, is named for a physical feature, Mount Graham, with the final county, Greenlee County, being named after one of the state's early pioneers.[tpl]cite book | last=Kane, Joseph and Aiken, Charles | title =The American Counties: Origins of County Names, Dates of Creation, and Population Data, 1950-2000 | publisher =Scarecrow Press | year =2004 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yC9vFvCuW84C&pg=PA333&dq=arizona+county+origins| isbn =0-8108-5036-2 [/tpl]
