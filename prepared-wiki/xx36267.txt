A buoy ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ[/tpl], also [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|w|ɔɪ[/tpl] or  [tpl]IPAc-en|us|ˈ|b|uː|iː[/tpl]) is a floating device that can have many purposes. It can be anchored (stationary) or allowed to drift with the sea wave. The word, of Old French or Middle Dutch origin, is (in UK English) now most commonly pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ[/tpl] (identical with boy, as in buoyancy). In American English the pronunciation would be closer to "boo-ee."
