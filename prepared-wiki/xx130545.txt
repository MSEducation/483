[[Olfactory glands]]

CATEGORIES: Olfactory system

Bowman's glands (a.k.a. olfactory glands, glands of Bowman) are situated in the olfactory mucosa, beneath the olfactory epithelium, in the lamina propria, a connective tissue also containing fibroblasts, blood vessels, and bundles of fine axons from the olfactory neurons.
The structure of the Bowman's glands consists of an acinus in the lamina propria and a secretory duct going out through the olfactory epithelium.
Electron microscopy studies show that Bowman's glands contain cells with large secretory vesicles. Bowman's glands might secrete proteins such as lysozyme, amylase and IgA similarly to serous glands. The exact composition of the secretions from Bowman's glands is unclear, but there is evidence that Bowman's glands do not produce odorant binding protein.
