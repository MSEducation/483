[[Goatee]]

CATEGORIES: Facial hair

Goatee refers to a style of facial hair incorporating hair on a man’s chin. The exact nature of the style has varied according to time and culture.

==Description==

Traditionally, the term goatee was used to refer solely to a beard formed by a tuft of hair on the chin—like on the chin of a goat, hence the term 'goatee'.[tpl]cite web | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/goatee?q=goatee | title = goatee | accessdate = 2011-12-20 | publisher = Oxford English Dictionary[/tpl]  By the 1990s, the term was also used to refer to the style of facial hair that combines a chin beard and a short mustache; there is debate over whether this style is correctly called a goatee or a Vandyke.

==History==

The style dates back to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where the god Pan was traditionally depicted with one. When Christianity became the dominant religion and began coopting imagery from pagan myth, Satan was given the likeness of Pan, leading to Satan traditionally being depicted with a goatee in medieval and renaissance art.
The goatee became popular again in the late 19th century, becoming one of the characterizing physical traits of the bohemians in Paris. In the USA, the style became popular around the time of the United States Civil War. Numerous wartime figures from the era wore variations on the goatee, including Abraham Lincoln, who shaved his beard into a traditional goatee at various points during his presidency.
The goatee would not enjoy widespread popularity again until the 1940s, when it became a defining trait of the beatniks in post-World War II US. The style remained popular amongst the counter culture until the 1960s before falling out of favor again. In the 1990s, goatees with incorporated mustaches became fashionable for men across all socioeconomic classes and professions, and have remained popular into the 2010s.

==In popular culture==

In the media, goatees have often been used to designate an evil or morally questionable character; the convention has most consistently been applied in media depicting evil twins, with a goatee often being the sole physical difference between the twins.[tpl]cite web|title=Scientists Prove that a Goatee Makes you Look Evil|url=http://io9.com/5914836/scientists-prove-that-a-goatee-makes-you-look-evil|work=i09.com|accessdate=1 June 2012[/tpl] Goatees have also been used to signify a character's transformation from positive or neutral to evil. The use of goatees to designate evil characters has become enough of a trope that researchers from the University of Warwick conducted a study to assess the reasons for its prevalence. The study found that the human brain tends to perceive of downwards-facing triangles as inherently threatening; brains tend to perceive of goatees as making the human face resemble a downwards-facing triangle, causing individuals to subconsciously perceive of those with goatees as inherently sinister or threatening.[tpl]cite web|title=Scientists Prove that a Goatee Makes you Look Evil|url=http://io9.com/5914836/scientists-prove-that-a-goatee-makes-you-look-evil|work=i09.com|accessdate=1 June 2012[/tpl]
In media depicting members of counter-cultures, goatees have also been used to differentiate between average characters and those belonging to some subgroup.  Examples include Bob Denver in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, whose goatee serves to identify him as a beatnik; Shaggy Rogers in Scooby Doo, Where Are You?, who is, in part, identified as a hippie by his goatee; and the DC Comics superhero Green Arrow, who was visually redesigned with such a beard in the late 1960s, inspiring writer Dennis O'Neil to reimagine him as a politically active counter-culture hero.
