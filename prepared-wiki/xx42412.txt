[[File:Lateralus.jpg|thumb|SECRET TRACK LIST
Tool hides the letters of the album and band name in the letters of the song names on all their albums (except undertow & opiate). This is why the album names are the way they are. If you notice in this image the songs that have the letters US in them do not line up with the rest of the letters until you place them on top of triad. This is why the US is dropped slightly in the album artwork. Faaip de oiad must be translated to English as THE VOICE OF GOD (This is also used on 10,000 days where you have to translate viginti tres to English as TWENTY THREE]]
All songs written and performed by Tool.
