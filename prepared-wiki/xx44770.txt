Johnny Marr (born John Martin Maher; 31 October 1963) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. He was co-songwriter – with Morrissey – and guitarist of The Smiths between 1982–87. Marr has also been a member of Electronic, The The, Modest Mouse and The Cribs, as well as a prolific session musician. In 2013, he released a solo album titled The Messenger (2013).
In 2013, the NME honoured Marr with its Godlike Genius award, hailing Marr as "not content with rewriting the history of music with one of the world's greatest ever bands, The Smiths, he's continued to push boundaries and evolve throughout his career, working with some of the best and most exciting artists on the planet."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21409581|title=Johnny Marr to receive top NME honour|work=BBC News|date=11 February 2013|accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl] He was voted  the fourth best guitarist of the last 30 years in a poll conducted by the BBC in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20100409_axefactor.shtml|title=Chilis star wins Axe Factor|publisher=BBC|date=30 April 2010|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl] Phil Alexander, Editor-in-Chief of Mojo, has described Marr as "arguably Britain's last great guitar stylist".Mojo magazine.

==Early life==

Marr was born John Martin Maher in 1963 in Ardwick, Manchester, to Irish emigrants from Athy, County Kildare.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/johnny-marr-marrs-attacks-601125.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Johnny Marr: Marr's attacks|date=1 October 2003|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl] The family  moved to Wythenshawe in 1972.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|p=16[/tpl] From 1975, he attended St Augustine's Catholic Grammar School, which in 1977 merged with other schools to form St John Plessington High School.[tpl]cite web|title=The Smiths|url=http://www.staugs.org|work=St Augustine's Grammar School Old Boys|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Brief History of St Augustine's Grammar School|url=http://www.staugs.org/history.htm|work=www.staugs.org/history.htm|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl]
Maher had aspirations to be a professional football player. He was approached by Nottingham Forest and had trials with Manchester City F.C.[tpl]cite book|last=Middles|first=Mick|title=Factory: The Story of the Record Label|year=2009|publisher=Virgin Books|location=London|page=42[/tpl]
Maher formed his first band, The Paris Valentinos, at the age of 13, with Andy Rourke and Kevin Williams (who later became an actor, known as Kevin Kennedy), performing for the first time at a Jubilee party in Benchill in June 1977, playing Rolling Stones and Thin Lizzy covers.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|pp=22–23[/tpl] In 1979, he played a single gig at Wythenshawe Forum with  a band called Sister Ray and re-united with Rourke in a band called White Dice. White Dice entered a demo-tape competition organised by the NME and won an audition for F-Beat Records, which they attended in April 1980 but were not signed.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|pp=29–31[/tpl]
In October 1980, Marr enrolled at Wythenshawe College, serving as President of the school's Student Union.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|p=31[/tpl] White Dice dissolved in 1981. Maher and Rourke then formed a funk band, The  Freak Party, with Simon Wolstencroft on drums. Around this time, Maher first met Matt Johnson, with whom he would later collaborate.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|pp=32–33[/tpl]

==The Smiths==

By early 1982, The Freak Party had fizzled out, being unable to find a singer. Marr approached Rob Allman, singer in White Dice, who suggested Steven Morrissey, a short-lived singer with The Nosebleeds. Maher approached a mutual friend asking to be introduced and they visited Morrissey at his house in Kings Road, Stretford in May.[tpl]sfn|Rogan|1994|p=37[/tpl]
Marr's jangly Rickenbacker and Fender Telecaster guitar playing became synonymous with the Smiths' sound. Marr's friend Andy Rourke joined as bass player and Mike Joyce was recruited as drummer. Signing to indie label Rough Trade Records, they released their first single, "Hand in Glove", on 13 May 1983. By February 1984, The Smiths fanbase was sufficiently large to launch the band's long-awaited eponymous debut album to number two in the UK chart. Early in 1985  the band released their second album, Meat Is Murder. This was more strident and political than its predecessor, and it was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts. During 1985 the band completed lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording the next studio record, The Queen Is Dead.
In 1989 Spin magazine rated The Queen Is Dead as number one of "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Spin was not alone in this designation—numerous periodicals rank The Smiths and their albums, especially 'The Queen Is Dead', high on their best ever lists. NME, for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of  all time. However, a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, "'Worse for wear' wasn't  the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking  more than I could handle."[tpl]cite web| author=Kelly, Danny|date=14 February 1987|title=Exile on Mainstream|format=http|work=NME, cited at Foreverill.com|url=http://foreverill.com/interviews/1987/exile.htm|accessdate=22 April 2007[/tpl] Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin, although he was reinstated in short order. Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band – including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr—saw them on the verge of splitting.
In August 1987, Marr left the group, and auditions to find a replacement for him proved fruitless. By  the time Strangeways, Here We Come (named after Strangeways Prison, Manchester) was released in September, the band had split up. The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's becoming annoyed by Marr's work with other artists and Marr's growing frustration with Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Referring to the songs recorded in the band's last session together (B-sides for the "Girlfriend in a Coma" single, which preceded the album's release), Marr said "I wrote 'I Keep Mine Hidden', but 'Work Is a Four-Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs."[tpl]cite web|author=Rogan, Johnny|date=November–December 1992|title=The Smiths: Johnny Marr's View|format=http|work=Record Collector, cited at Foreverill.com|url=http://foreverill.com/interviews/post87/marrview.htm|accessdate=22 April 2007[/tpl] In 1989, in an interview with young fan, Tim Samuels (who later became a BBC journalist), Morrissey claimed the lack of a managerial figure and business problems were to blame for the band's eventual split.[tpl]cite web|author=David Tseng|url=http://www.morrissey-solo.com/content/interview/greenscene/index4.html|title="Meat Is Murder" (from "Greenscene", 1989), page 4|publisher=Morrissey-solo.com|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl]
In 1996, Smiths' drummer Mike Joyce took Morrissey and Marr to court, claiming that he had not received his fair share of recording and performance royalties. Morrissey and Marr had claimed the lion's share of The Smiths' recording and performance royalties and allowed ten percent each to Joyce and Rourke. Composition royalties were not an issue, as Rourke and Joyce had never been credited as composers for the band. Morrissey and Marr claimed that the other two members of the band had always agreed to that split of the royalties, but the court found in favour of Joyce and ordered that he be paid over £1 million in back pay and receive 25% thenceforth. As Smiths' royalties had been frozen for two years, Rourke settled for a smaller lump sum to pay off his debts and continued to receive 10%. Morrissey was described by the judge as "devious, truculent and unreliable".[tpl]cite web|author=BBC News|date=11 December 1996|title=Rock band drummer awarded £1m payout|format=http|work=BBC, cited at Cemetrygates.com|url=http://www.cemetrygates.com/vault/news/court.html|accessdate=22 April 2007[/tpl]
Marr and Morrissey have repeatedly stated they will not reunite the band. In 2005, VH1 attempted to get the band back together on its Bands Reunited show but abandoned its attempt after the show's host, Aamer Haleem, failed to corner Morrissey before a show. In December 2005 it was announced that Johnny Marr and the Healers would play at Manchester v Cancer, a benefit show for cancer research being organised by Andy Rourke and his production company, Great Northern Productions.[tpl]cite web|author=Cohen, Jonathan|year=2005|title=Smiths Members Regrouping For Cancer Benefit|format=http|work=Billboard|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001659262|accessdate=15 August 2006[/tpl] Rumours suggested that a Smiths reunion would occur at this concert but were dispelled by Marr on his website.[tpl]cite web|date=16 December 2005|title=Johnny and the Healers play Manchester Versus Cancer charity concert|format=http|work=Jmarr.com|url=http://www.jmarr.com|accessdate=22 April 2007[/tpl]
In an October 2007 interview on BBC Radio Five Live, Marr hinted at a potential reformation in the future, saying that "stranger things have happened so, you know, who knows?" Marr went on to say that "It's no biggy. Maybe we will in 18 or 32 years' time when we all need to for  whatever reasons, but right now Morrissey is doing his thing and I'm doing mine, so that's the answer really." This was the first indication of a possible Smiths reunion from Marr, who previously had said that reforming the band would be a bad idea.[tpl]cite web|title=Johnny Marr Doesn't Rule Out Smiths Reunion With Morrissey|work=BritMusicScene.com|url=http://britmusicscene.com/johnny-marr-doesnt-rule-out-smiths-reunion-with-morrissey|accessdate=8 January 2008|postscript= [/tpl]
Marr's guitar playing "was a huge building block" for more Manchester bands that followed The Smiths. The Stone Roses guitarist John Squire has stated that Marr was a major influence.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3005033.stm|work=BBC News|title=The Smiths: The influential alliance|date=13 May 2003|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl] Oasis  lead guitarist Noel Gallagher credited The Smiths an influence, especially Marr, whom he described as a "fucking wizard", also stating that "he's unique, you can't play what he plays."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1MsuoNJQ3U|title=Noel Gallagher on The Smiths|publisher=YouTube|date=10 April 2006|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl]

==Post-Smiths==

===Paul McCartney, The Pretenders, The The, Electronic (1987–1999)===

Marr has talked about a session that occurred with Paul McCartney shortly after the Smiths' demise. At the age of only 23, he found himself sharing a mic with the former Beatle on "I Saw Her Standing There", an occasion that he has described as, "a pretty good moment".[tpl]cite web|last=Wilks|first=Jon|title=Johnny Marr on "The Messenger"|url=http://www.thegrizzlyfolk.com/2013/02/11/johnny-marr-the-messenger-interview|work=The Grizzly Folk[/tpl]
In August 1987, he was very briefly an official member of the Pretenders. In late 1987, he toured with the band and appeared on the single "Windows of the World" b/w "1969". He then left the Pretenders, and recorded and toured with The The from 1988 through 1994, recording two albums with the group. He simultaneously formed Electronic with New Order's Bernard Sumner. Electronic were intermittently active throughout the 1990s, releasing their final album in 1999.

===Session work (1987–2002)===

In 1992 he recorded a cover version of Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly for the NME compilation Ruby Trax together with Billy Duffy. Fellow Manchester band Happy Mondays also once tried to court him to be a member of their band, which did not work out.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BgbvjvAWuY&feature=fvw |title=Johnny Marr's Happy Mondays Kidnap|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl]
He has also worked as a session musician and writing collaborator for artists including Pet Shop Boys, Billy Bragg, Kirsty MacColl, Black Grape, Jane Birkin, Talking Heads, and Beck. Marr played guitar on several Pet Shop Boys songs; he continues to have guest appearances on their albums, with his most significant contribution on Release (2002). The only remix that Marr has ever done was for the Pet Shop Boys—it was a mix of his favourite track from their 1987 album, Actually, called "I Want to Wake Up", and was released as the b-side to 1993's "Can You Forgive Her?" He later worked as a guest musician on the Oasis album Heathen Chemistry. He also joined Oasis on stage at a gig in 2001, playing "Champagne Supernova" and "I Am the Walrus".

===Johnny Marr and the Healers (2000–present)===

In 2000 Marr recruited drummer Zak Starkey (son of Ringo Starr), Cavewaves guitarist Lee Spencer and ex-Kula Shaker bassist Alonza Bevan for his new project, Johnny Marr and the Healers. The band had taken two years to come together as Marr had wanted members  to be chosen "by chemistry". Their debut album Boomslang was released in 2003, with all lyrics and lead vocals by Marr. A second album was originally scheduled for release in April 2005, and a short tour was expected soon after, but Marr has since stated that the band is on the "side burner" for the time being (Manchester Evening News, May 2007). Drummer Starkey is currently involved with the Who, and Bevan has regrouped with Kula Shaker.

===7 Worlds Collide (2001–2009)===

In 2001, Marr performed two Smiths songs and music by others with a supergroup called 7 Worlds Collide consisting of members from Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Split Enz and others, assembled by Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House in 2001.  A second set of concerts took place in December 2008/January 2009, and an album of new studio material titled The Sun Came Out was released in August 2009 to  raise money for Oxfam.

===Modest Mouse (2006–2009)===

In addition to his work as a recording artist, Marr has worked as a record producer. In 2006, he began work with Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock on songs that eventually were featured on the band's 2007 release, We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. The band subsequently announced that Marr was a fully fledged member, and the reformed line-up toured extensively throughout 2006–07.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59817/isaac-brock-collaborating-with-johnny-marr|title=Isaac Brock Collaborating With Johnny Marr|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl] During 2008, when Modest Mouse opened for R.E.M. during their summer tour of the United States, Marr would come on stage during the encore of R.E.M.'s set, for "Fall on Me", and, toward the end of the tour, "Man on the Moon". Marr and R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck have often been compared by alternative music fans as having a similar guitar style.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
The new album reached number one on the American Billboard charts in late March 2007. For Marr this is the first time he has had a number one record in the US. The highest chart position before that was with Electronic, who made the Top 40 in the singles chart with "Getting Away With It".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=P21805_0_2_0|title=Former Smiths' guitarplayer reaches Number 1 in this week's American Billboard Chart|publisher=Side-line.com|date=22 February 1999|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl]

In January 2008, Marr was reported to have been contributing his skill and experience to a secret songwriting session with Wakefield indie group The Cribs. Sources revealed that they worked together for a week at Moolah Rouge recording studio in Stockport and had penned a number of new songs. He also played at the Glasgow Barrowlands, Manchester Academy, Oxford Academy, Bristol Carling Academy, Leeds University, Cardiff University and Brixton Carling Academy with the Cribs on the NME Awards Tour.

===Recent soundtrack, session work, and The Messenger (2011–present)===

In the late 2007, Marr's daughter Sonny performed backing vocals on the track "Even a Child" on Crowded House's album Time on Earth, on which her father Marr played guitars. He played a large role in making the score for the 2010 science-fiction/drama film Inception, which was written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Using a 12-string-guitar, he produced repetitive, simple melancholic tones that became a character theme for the protagonist, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. "I kept coming up with this phrase ‘churned-up,'" Marr said, "You’ve got this character who all the way through the film has this underlying turmoil." Longtime composer Hans Zimmer penned the soundtrack.[tpl]Cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of Inception|work=Los Angeles Times|date=20 July 2010|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl]
