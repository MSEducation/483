[[Convective temperature]]

CATEGORIES: Severe weather and convection, Atmospheric thermodynamics

The convective temperature (CT or Tc) is the approximate temperature that air near the surface must reach for cloud formation without mechanical lift. In such case, cloud base begins at the convective condensation level (CCL), whilst with mechanical lifting, condensation begins at the lifted condensation level (LCL). Convective temperature is important to forecasting thunderstorm development.
