It is a deciduous tree growing to 25 m tall with a trunk up to 70 cm diameter. The bark is brown, smooth on young trees, becoming scaly to shaggy on old trees. The leaves are pinnate, 50–70 cm long and 30–40 cm broad, with 10–40 leaflets, the terminal leaflet usually absent (paripinnate) but sometimes present (imparipennate); the individual leaflets 9–15 cm long and 2.5–4 cm broad, with an entire or weakly serrated margin. The flowers are produced in summer in panicles 30–50 cm long at the end of a branch; each flower is small, 4–5 mm diameter, with five white or pale pink petals. The fruit is a capsule 2–3.5 cm long, containing several winged seeds.Taiwan Forestry: Toona sinensis (in Chinese, with photos; google translation)

==Medicinal Uses==

The fruit, bark, and roots are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Toona sinensis can induce apoptosis of cancer cells, reduce plasma glucose in diabetic rats, and improve lipolysis of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte and its uptake of glucose.Yang Y.-C., Hsu H.-K., Hwang J.-H., Hong S.-J. "Enhancement of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Toona sinensis leaf extract"   Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences 2003 19:7 (327-333) It has also been shown that TS may increase dynamic activity of human sperm.Ling Poon S., Leu S.-F., Hsu H.-K., Liu M.-Y., Huang B.-M.

Toona can safely prevent and alleviate lung cancer proliferation in vitro and in vivo. It has the potential to be developed as an anti-lung cancer drug.,Yang C.-J., Huang Y.-J., Wang C.-Y., Wang C.-S., Wang P.-H., Hung J.-Y., Wang T.-H., Hsu H.-K., Huang H.-W., Kumar S.P.A., Huang M.-S., Weng C.-F."Antiproliferative and antitumorigenic activity of Toona sinensis leaf extracts in lung adenocarcinoma."

Leaf extracts of Toona sinensis have cytotoxic activity on several cancer cells including prostate cancer cells. Gallic acid has been identified as the major anti-cancer compound. It is cytotoxic to DU145 prostate cancer cells.Chen H.-M., Wu Y.-C., Chia Y.-C., Chang F.-R., Hsu H.-K., Hsieh Y.-C., Chen C.-C., Yuan S.-S. "Gallic acid, a major component of Toona sinensis leaf extracts, contains a ROS-mediated anti-cancer activity in human prostate cancer cells."

Leaf extract of Toona sinensis  can inhibit SARS-CoVcoronavirus in vitro.Chen C.-J., Michaelis M., Hsu H.-K., Tsai C.-C., Yang K.D., Wu Y.-C., Cinatl Jr. J., Doerr H.W. "Toona sinensis Roem tender leaf extract inhibits SARS coronavirus replication"  Journal of Ethnopharmacology 2008 120:1 (108-111)

==Cultivation and uses==

The young leaves of T. sinensis (xiāngchūn) are extensively used as a vegetable in China; they have a floral, yet onion-like flavor, attributed to volatile organosulfur compounds.Li J.-X., Eidman K., Gan X.-W., Haefliger O. P., J. Carroll P. J., Pika J. "Identification of (S,S)‑γ-glutamyl‑(cis-S‑1-propenyl)thioglycine, a naturally occurring norcysteine derivative, from the Chinese vegetable Toona sinensis." Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 2013 61 (7470−7476). Plants with red young leaves are considered of better flavour than those where the young leaves are green.Plants for a Future: Toona sinensisOriental Vegetable Seeds: Toona sinensis
The timber is hard and reddish; it is valuable, used for furniture making  and for bodies of electric guitars. Being a "true mahogany", it is the most sought after replacement for Swietenia mahogany ("genuine mahogany") which is now commercially restricted from being sourced natively.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/unep181.doc.htm|title=Press Release UNEP/181_Cites Trade Controls to Take Effect for Mahogany[/tpl]
Outside of its native region T. sinensis is valued more as a large ornamental tree for its haggard aspect.More, D. & White, J. (2003). Cassell's Trees of Britain & Northern Europe. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 709 It is by far the most cold-tolerant species in the Meliaceae and the only member of the family that can be cultivated successfully in northern Europe.

==Culture==

In Chinese literature, Toona sinensis is often used for a rather extreme metaphor, with a mature tree representing a father. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write "wishing your Toona sinensis and daylily are strong and happy" ([tpl]zh|s=椿萱并茂|t=椿萱並茂|p=chūnxuānbìngmào[/tpl]), with Toona sinensis metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother.
