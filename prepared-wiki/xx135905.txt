==Story==

Leighanne Littrell stars as the spunky Michelle Malloy who feels life is perfect.  But she is soon caught unprepared when she learns that her mother has grown ill. The young lady promptly returns to Orlando to visit her sick mother.  While she is visiting, Michelle soon learns that her fiancé is not the perfect man that she believed he was.  Not only does he have a sordid past but he is also involved in some rather unethical activity.  She soon grows depressed as future plans for her living happily ever after now appear doomed.
She soon finds solace with a local pet shop owner who steals her heart with his natural charm and his lovable inventory.  Many comedic pratfalls ensue as she tries to fight her true feelings simply because her recent split with her fiancé went so badly.
