 The resulting loss of [[aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]] has depleted the habitat for much of the bay's animal life.  Beds of [[Zostera|eelgrass]], the dominant variety in the southern bay, have shrunk by more than half there since the early 1970s. Overharvesting, pollution, sedimentation and disease has turned much of the bay's bottom into a muddy wasteland.<ref>[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbf.org/Document.Doc?id=172 |title=Bad Water and the Decline of Blue Crabs in the Chesapeake Bay |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Foundation |date=December 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-21[/tpl]</ref>
One particularly harmful source of toxicity is Pfiesteria piscicida, which can affect both fish and humans. Pfiesteria caused a small regional panic in the late 1990s when a series of large blooms started killing large numbers of fish while giving swimmers mysterious rashes, and nutrient runoff from chicken farms was blamed for the growth.[tpl]cite news |title=Md. Gets Tough on Chicken Farmers |first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2008-09-12 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091103841.html[/tpl]
The bay improved slightly in terms of the overall health of its ecosystem, earning a rating of 31 out of 100 in 2010, up from 28 in 2008. An estimate in 2006 from a "blue ribbon panel" said cleanup costs would be $15 billion. Compounding the problem is the fact that 100,000 new residents move to the area each year. A report in 2008 in the Washington Post suggested that government administrators had overstated progress on cleanup efforts as a way to "preserve the flow of federal and state money to the project." In 2011 in January, there were reports that millions of fish had died, but officials suggested it was probably the result of extremely cold weather.

===Depletion of oysters===

While the bay's salinity is ideal for oysters and the oyster fishery was at one time the bay's most commercially viable,Oysters: Gem of the Ocean, The Economist, December 8, 2008; accessed September 2, 2009. the population has in the last fifty years been devastated.  Maryland once had roughly [tpl]convert|200000|acre|km2[/tpl] of oyster reefs.  Today it has about 36,000.  It has been estimated that in pre-colonial times, oysters could filter the entirety of the bay in about 3.3 days; by 1988 this time had increased to 325 days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://habitat.noaa.gov/restorationtechniques/public/habitat.cfm?HabitatID=2&HabitatTopicID=11|title=Oyster Reefs: Ecological importance|publisher=US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2007-11-06[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]  The harvest's gross value decreased 88% from 1982 to 2007.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][/ref] One report suggested the bay had fewer oysters in 2008 than 25 years earlier.
The primary problem is overharvesting.  Lax government regulations allow anyone with a license to remove oysters from state-owned beds, and although limits are set, they are not strongly enforced.  The overharvesting of oysters has made it difficult for them to reproduce, which requires close proximity to one another.  A second cause for the oyster depletion is that the drastic increase in human population caused a sharp increase in pollution flowing into the bay. The bay's oyster industry has also suffered from two diseases: MSX and Dermo.[ref]

The depletion of oysters has had a particularly harmful effect on the quality of the bay. Oysters serve as natural water filters, and their decline has further reduced the water quality of the bay.  Water that was once clear for meters is now so turbid that a wader may lose sight of their feet before their knees are wet.
Efforts of federal, state and local governments, working in partnership through the Chesapeake Bay Program, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and other nonprofit environmental groups, to restore or at least maintain the current water quality have had mixed results. One particular obstacle to cleaning up the bay is that much of the polluting substances arise far upstream in tributaries lying within states far removed from the bay. Despite the state of Maryland spending over $100 million to restore the bay, conditions have continued to grow worse. Twenty years ago, the bay supported over six thousand oystermen. There are now fewer than 500.
Efforts to repopulate the bay via hatcheries have been carried out by a group called the Oyster Recovery Partnership, with some success. They recently placed 6 million oysters on [tpl]convert|8|acre|m2[/tpl] of the Trent Hall sanctuary.Program turns pork into oysters, Jesse Yeatman, South Maryland Newspapers Online, August 12, 2009.

==Publications==

There are several magazines and publications that cover topics directly related to the Chesapeake Bay and life and tourism within the bay region.
The Capital, a newspaper based in Annapolis, reports about news pertaining to the Western Shore of Maryland and the Annapolis area.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2011|url=http://www.hometownannapolis.com/cgi-bin/read/TOP.html |title=Top Stories|work=The Capital Newspaper|publisher=Capital Gazette Communications[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Chesapeake Bay Magazine and PropTalk focus on powerboating while SpinSheet focuses on sailing.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2011|url=http://www.chesapeakeboating.net|title=Chesapeake Bay Magazine[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2011|url=http://www.proptalk.com|title=PropTalk|publisher=PropTalk Media LLC[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2011|url=http://www.spinsheet.com/|title=SpinSheet|publisher=SpinSheet Publishing Co.[/tpl]

Tom Wisner has recorded several albums, often about the Chesapeake Bay, and he tried to "capture the voice of the water and the sky, of the rocks and the trees, of the fish and the birds, of the gods of nature he believed still watched over it all." He was known as the Bard of the Chesapeake Bay.[ref]
