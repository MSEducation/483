Shameless was the sixth full-length album by the band Therapy?,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.therapyquestionmark.co.uk/discography/albums/shameless.php | title=Official Discography[/tpl] and the third and final to be released on Ark 21 Records. It was released on 3 September 2001. The album was recorded at Bob Lang Studios, in Seattle, from January to February 2001.
Shameless is considered by the band to be a straightforward punk rock 'n' roll album with more 'tunes' than previous album Suicide Pact - You First, and reflects the no-nonsense trash-rock that they were listening to at the time.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.therapyquestionmark.co.uk/press/interviews/2001/pixelsurgeon.php | title=Pixelsurgeon interview with Andy Cairns[/tpl] It was also the final album to feature drummer Graham Hopkins, who departed in December 2001. The limited edition CD-ROM included a live video of "Gimme Back My Brain", recorded at the Visions magazine party in Dortmund in June 2001. The album reached number 196 in the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_T.HTM | title=UK Top 200 Chart History[/tpl]
The album was released on CD and cassette.
