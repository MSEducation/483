==Form==

Serenade for Strings has 4 movements:
Tchaikovsky intended the first movement to be an imitation of Mozart's style, and it was based on the form of the classical sonatina, with a slow introduction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneysymphony.com/media/81472/PROG15_100611_SerenadeStrings-TaS_SSO.pdf|publisher=Sydney Symphony|title=Program Notes, Tchaikovsky Serenade for Strings|accessdate=February 14, 2014[/tpl]  The stirring 36-bar Andante introduction is marked "sempre marcatissimo" and littered with double-stopping in the violins and violas, forming towering chordal structures. This introduction is restated at the end of the movement, and then reappears, transformed, in the coda of the fourth movement, tying the entire work together.
On the second page of the score, Tchaikovsky wrote, "The larger number of players in the string orchestra, the more this shall be in accordance with the author's wishes."
The second movement, Valse, has become a popular piece in its own right.
