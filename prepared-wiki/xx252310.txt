==History==

The Christian people who lived in the small town "Thachanallur" started gathering in the TDTA primary school, which belonged to the Tirunelveli Junction Pastorate. The church was named "The Christ Church" by Rev. Clement Duraisingh. The first Catechist of this was Mr. P. Koilpillai. Having contributed much to the church he still stands as one of the pillars of the church.
While praying members of the congregation had a vision of building a new church for themselves. The land for the church was brought near the southern bye-pass road after, however, the members of the church were not rich enough to support the construction of the church building. At that time period Mr. Thangadurai Dhanaraj took the charge of catechist. Finally the church was built and opened for worship on 18 February 1996. Rev. Clement Duraisingh renamed it as “Good Shepherd Church”.http://wikimapia.org/#lat=8.7513007&lon=77.703284&z=18&l=0&m=s&v=9 In the year 2006, Mr. Andrew became the catechist of the congregation and he is continuing till now. Currently there are about 104 families in this congregation.
