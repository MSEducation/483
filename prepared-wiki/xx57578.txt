The video for the album's first single, "Pets," received heavy airplay on MTV. Following the album's release, Porno for Pyros continued a heavy touring schedule, including an appearance at Woodstock 94 along with a cameo on HBO's The Larry Sanders Show. Unlike the relatively straight-ahead rock shows that were the hallmark of live Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros live shows relied heavily on props, extras[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/music/woodstock/woodstock.html |title=Woodstock 1994 concert review |publisher=Ram.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-04[/tpl] and special effects (including, but not limited to, pyrotechnics).
