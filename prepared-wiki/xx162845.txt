===McKean County===

PA 321 enters Wetmore Township in McKean County and becomes Brickyard Road, heading away from the Allegheny National Forest. The road runs through more forests with some fields and homes, passing through Sergeant and East Kane. The route crosses into Kane and becomes Westerberg Way, passing residential and industrial areas as it crosses an abandoned railroad line and comes to an intersection with US 6. Here, PA 321 turns west briefly for a concurrency with US 6 on Biddle Street, immediately turning north-northwest onto Hacker Street and passing homes. The road curves northeast as Kinzua Avenue and crosses back into Wetmore Township, becoming Kane-Marshburg Road and heading north-northwest into forested areas with occasional homes. The route heads back into the Allegheny National Forest and continues northwest, crossing into Hamilton Township. PA 321 crosses the Allegheny Reservoir and heads along the northeastern shore of the reservoir, passing through Dunkle Corners. The road turns to the east and heads along the south shore of Chappel Bay, soon heading away from the reservoir and turning northeast. The route continues into Corydon Township and reaches an intersection with PA 59. At this point, PA 321 turns east for a concurrency with PA 59 and the name remains Kane-Marshburg Road. The road leaves the national forest and heads through more forested areas with scattered homes as PA 321 splits to the northwest onto Sugar Run Road in Lafayette Township. The road crosses back into Corydon Township and runs through more of the Allegheny National Forest. The route passes to the north of Allegheny Reservoir again and turns to the northeast, passing through more forest. PA 321 turns north, northwest, and north again as it comes to its northern terminus at PA 346.[tpl]cite map|publisher=PennDOT|title=McKean County, Pennsylvania Highway Map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/mckean_GHSN.PDF|year=2011|accessdate=May 13, 2011[/tpl]
