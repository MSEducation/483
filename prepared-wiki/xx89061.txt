Marc Bergevin (born August 11, 1965) is a retired French Canadian professional hockey defenceman and current general manager of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League.

==Playing career==

Bergevin was drafted by the NHL Chicago Black Hawks in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, third round, 59th overall.  After a junior career with the Chicoutimi Saguenéens of the QMJHL, he made the Black Hawks in 1984 and played with Chicago for the next five seasons before being traded to the New York Islanders.  His career with the Islanders was brief, and he spent much of that time with their AHL affiliate Springfield Indians, whom he helped lead to consecutive Calder Cup championships in 1990 and 1991.  In the 1991 season he was traded to the Hartford Whalers and became a fan favorite for his skilled checking.  1992 was his best season statistically, scoring seven goals and seventeen assists for twenty-four points.
Bergevin went on to sign with the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning the next season, becoming a leader for the fledgling franchise and continuing to play skillfully enough to be named to the gold medal-winning Canadian national team for the 1994 World Championships.  After three years with the Lightning, he subsequently played for the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Vancouver Canucks, and was known for his practical jokes in the locker room.1983 NHL Entry Draft - Marc Bergevin
