Mucklestone is a small village in Staffordshire, England. It is about nine miles (14 km) northwest of Eccleshall, and four and a half miles northeast of Market Drayton in Shropshire.
It is notable for its associations with the Battle of Blore Heath. According to legend, Queen Margaret of Anjou is said to have watched the defeat of her forces from the church tower, before fleeing on horse-back.[tpl]cite book |last=Mee |first=Arthur |title=Staffordshire (King's England) |year=1971 |publisher=Hodder & Straughton |location= |isbn=0-340-15030-0|pages=132[/tpl]  It is said that Margaret employed the local blacksmith, William Skelhorn, to reverse the shoes on her horse to disguise her getaway. An anvil said to have belonged to Skelhorn stands in the churchyard to commemorate the event.
