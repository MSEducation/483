He fought for the Spanish forces in Flanders.Richard Tuck, Philosophy and Government, 1572-1651 (1993), p. 74.
Olivares called him to Madrid, where he arrived in 1636, to become the official chronicler to Philip IV.J. H. Elliott, Richelieu and Olivares (1984), p. 168.J. H. Elliott, Power and Propaganda in Spain of Philip IV, p. 166, in Sean Wilentz, Rites of Power: Symbolism, Ritual, and Politics Since the Middle Ages (1999). In 1640 he was one of the ambassadors sent by Philip to England, in an attempt to avert the marriage of Mary Stuart to William II of Orange.Michael Mendle, Henry Parker and the English Civil War: The Political Thought of the Public's 'Privado'  (2003), pp. 12-13.
He became adviser to the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria from 1643.

==Writing==

Initially he wrote on Tacitus, in the tradition of Justus Lipsius, but as a Christian neo-stoic, and anti-Ciceronian.Adriana McCrea, Constant Minds: Political virtue and the Lipsian paradigm in England, 1584-1650 (1997), p. 9, citing Davide perseguitato. Olivares, who became Malvezzi's patron, was also a Lipsian.Elliott, p. 29-30. His style imitated Tacitus, too, in its dour compression, and was criticized for its opacity by the translator Thomas Powell; another view is that his prose was "elegantly laconic".George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism vol. III (1989), p. 357.Jon R. Snyder,Mare Magnum: the arts in the early modern age, p. 162, in John A. Marino, editor, Early modern Italy (2002).  John Milton referred to "Malvezzi, that can cut Tacitus into slivers and steaks".John Milton, Of Reformation in England, Book II, online text.
His political thought was in the tradition of Machiavelli.Mary Augusta Scott, Elizabethan Translations from the Italian (1969), p. 420. His Tarquin argues the case for dissimulation in politics.Sergio Zatti, The Quest for Epic: From Ariosto to Tasso (2006 translation by Dennis Looney, Sally Hill), p. 206.
His biography of Olivares (Ritratto del Privata Politico Christiano) has been called hagiography. It argued that he was right to invoke the reason of state on behalf of the Spanish Empire.R. A. Stradling, Spain's Struggle for Europe, 1598-1668 (1994), p. 130.

==Works==

He wrote in Italian and Spanish, and was early translated into Latin, Spanish, German and English, with a Dutch edition of 1679.
