God and Golem presents Wiener's ideas on machine learning, machine reproduction, and the place of machines in society, with some religious context. The provocative title sums up the confrontation of technical, mathematical and imaginative boldness with cultural prejudice.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Wiener mentions some of his secondary concerns: sensory feedback in artificial limbs, the problems of human responsibility in relation with technology, the limits of machine game-playing, Darwinism, Marxism, the Cold War, the rigidity of ideological thinking, and a critique of economy[tpl]clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl] as a science.
In the conclusion, he brings the burden of ethics to politics, away from religion.
