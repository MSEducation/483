Originally of Moorish design, the castle was rebuilt and expanded during the 15th century.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.castillosnet.org/programs/castillosnet.php?tip=inf&dat=toledo/TO-CAS-002|title= Castillo de Maqueda, Maqueda|accessdate=2009-02-09|publisher= CastillosNet[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] It was eventually appropriated by the state, which established a Guardia Civil post within the castle and provided for its future conservation.
The castle is rectangular in shape and sits on two distinct elevations. The castle's protections include 3.5-meter-thick walls, moats on two sides, and a number of circular towers. The exterior of the castle is free to visit, though visitors are not permitted to enter the castle proper.
The castle was declared an artistic historical monument on 3 June 1931.
