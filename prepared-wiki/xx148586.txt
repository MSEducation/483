After an eight-year absence the 1947 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy was the first race festival since 1939 due to the interruption of World War II. With the restart of racing the ACU decided to add three Clubman class races for production machines and introduced these races for Lightweight, Junior and Senior class machines making the festival a six race event.http://www.iomtt.com/TTDatabase/Races.aspx?meet_code=TT47 IOMTT.com 1947 race results (retrieved 29 October 2006)
Harold L. Daniell won the Senior TT at [tpl]convert|82.81|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on a Norton and the Norton team were to dominate the Senior race until 1954.http://birminghamuk.com/norton.htm Birmingham's history (retrieved 29 October 2006) Speeds were somewhat lower than the pre-war races due to the low quality "pool" petrol available, and it would be another three years before Harold L. Daniell's 1938 lap record was broken. Superchargers were banned for motorcycle racing from 1946, so that may have reduced speed too.http://www.gilera-saturno.com/history.htm Gilera-Saturno Gilera History (Retrieved 29 October 2006)
This was an early race appearance for the E90 AJS Porcupine, ridden to ninth in the Senior by Leslie Graham.
