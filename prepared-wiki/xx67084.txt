Hacienda ([tpl]IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|h|æ|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|US|ˌ|h|ɑː|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-es|aˈθjenda|lang[/tpl] or American Spanish: [tpl]IPA-es|aˈsjenda|[/tpl]) is a Spanish word for an estate. Some haciendas were plantations, mines or factories. Many haciendas combined these productive activities. The hacienda system of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, New Granada and Peru was a system of large land holdings. 
Similar system existed on a smaller scale in the Philippines and Puerto Rico. The hacienda were developed to be self-sustaining in everything but luxuries meant for display, which were destined for the handful of people in the circle of the patrón, also known as the hacendado.

==Origins==

Haciendas originated in Spanish land grants, made mostly to conquistadors. The system is considered to have started in present-day Mexico, when the Spanish Crown granted to Hernán Cortés the title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca in 1529. It gave him a tract of land that included all of the present state of Morelos. Cortés was also granted an encomienda, which included all the Native Americans then living on the land, and with power of life and death of every person on his domains.

==Personnel==

In Spanish America, the owner of a hacienda was called the hacendado or patrón.  Aside from the small circle at the top of the hacienda society, the remainder were peones, campesinos (peasants), or mounted ranch hands variously called vaqueros and gauchos (in the Southern Cone), among other terms. The peones worked land that belonged to the patrón. The campesinos worked small holdings, and owed a portion of their crops to the patrón. The economy of the eighteenth century was largely a barter system,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] with little specie circulated on the hacienda. 
Stock raising was central to ranching haciendas, and most estate raised enough stock to supply their own needs.  Where the hacienda included working mines, as in Mexico, the patrón might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable Jesuit hacienda Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its peones, its systems of land tenure and the workings of its isolated, intradependent society.
The Catholic Church and its orders, especially the Jesuits, were granted vast hacienda holdings. This connected the interests of the church with the rest of the landholding class. In the history of Mexico and other Latin American countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them. 
Haciendas in the Caribbean were developed primarily as sugar plantations, dependent on the labor of African slaves imported to the region. were staffed by slaves brought from Africa.African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A.

==South American haciendas==

In South America, the hacienda remained after the collapse of the colonial system in the early nineteenth century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as Dominican Republic, with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small subsistence farmers' holdings, an agrarian revolution. In Argentina and elsewhere, a second, international, money-based economy developed independently of the haciendas, which sank into rural poverty.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In most of Latin America the old holdings remained. In Mexico the haciendas were abolished by law in 1917 during the revolution, but remnants of the system affect Mexico today.  In rural areas, the wealthiest people typically affect the style of the old hacendados even though their wealth these days derives from more capitalistic enterprises.
In Bolivia, haciendas were more prevalent until the 1952 Revolution of Víctor Paz Estenssoro. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the Agrarian Reform. Likewise, Peru had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of Juan Velasco Alvarado, who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, the hacienda system and lifestyles were influenced by the Spanish colonization that occurred via Mexico for more than 300 years. Attempts to break up the hacienda system in the Philippines through land reform laws during the second half of the 1900s have not been successful. There were protests related to the Hacienda Luisita.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Puerto Rico===

Haciendas in Puerto Rico developed during the time of Spanish colonization. An example of these was the 1833 Hacienda Buena Vista, which dealt primarily with the cultivation, packaging, and exportation of coffee.Robert Sackett, Preservationist, PRSHPO (Original 1990 draft).

Yet by the 1990s, and despite significant government fiscal support, the last 13 Puerto Rican centrales azucares were forced to shut down.
