CATEGORIES: Topological games, General topology, Descriptive set theory, Determinacy

In general topology, set theory and game theory, a Banach–Mazur game is a topological game played by two players, trying to pin down elements in a set (space).  The concept of a Banach–Mazur game is closely related to the concept of Baire spaces.  This game was the first infinite positional game of perfect information to be studied.
