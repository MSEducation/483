==History==

The hospital was founded in 1910 when the Sisters of Mercy opened Saint Catherine's Hospital at Ninth and Forest Streets. In 1964, a new 250-bed hospital, now known as Bergan Mercy, was opened near 72nd and Center Streets, the current location. The hospital was named in honor of the Sisters of Mercy and the late Archbishop Gerald T. Bergan. Bergan Mercy Hospital became Bergan Mercy Health System of the Midlands in 1985 when Bergan and Mercy Hospital, Council Bluffs, Iowa merged.
During 1991, Bergan Mercy Hospital expanded to offer comprehensive healthcare and became Bergan Mercy Medical Center. In June 1996, Bergan Mercy Health System and Immanuel Medical Center came together to form Alegent Health. In June 2007, Bergan Mercy announced a $107.2 million expansion and enhancement project at Bergan Mercy. 
Among the expansion highlights is the Bergan Family Life Center which are a women’s and children’s hospital, with 16 labor and delivery beds, a 35-bed post-partum unit, nine ante partum beds for high-risk pregnancies and a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with 32 private rooms.
Modern Healthcare magazine recently named the hospital to the list of the nation’s Top 100 Hospitals for the first time and the American Association of Retired Persons named Bergan Mercy Medical Center one of 15 “Hospitals with a Heart” in the United States.
