The first white man to travel through the area that is now Prince Albert was Henry Kelsey in 1692. The first establishment in the area, from which it would eventually derive its name, was a trading post set up in 1776 by Peter Pond.[tpl]Cite web| title = Did You Know? | publisher=Prince Albert Patriot Website | date = | url = http://www.jmcpl.ca/patriot/trivia.html | accessdate = March 12, 2008[/tpl] James Isbister, an Anglo-Métis employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, settled on the site of the current city in 1862. He farmed there until 1866, and had been joined by a number of families who called the site Isbister's Settlement.
The community was founded in 1866 by Revd James Nisbet, a Canada Presbyterian Church minister who had come to establish a mission for the Cree. Nisbet named the community after Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria,[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.citypa.ca/Portals/0/pdf/Communications/Prince%20Albert%20-%20The%20First%20Century%201866-1966.pdf|title= Prince Albert: The First Century 1866–1966|first= Gary William David|last= Abrams|year= 1976|location= Saskatoon|page= 7|format= PDF|accessdate= December 13, 2010|quote= Nisbet named the new settlement Prince Albert, in honour of the late consort of Queen Victoria.[/tpl] who had died in 1861.

The settlement east of Prince Albert was termed Goschen before finally amalgamated, however East Prince Albert still appears on a 1924 map.
In 1884, Honore Jaxon and James Isbister were involved in the movement which brought Louis Riel back to Canada. In 1884, 500 people turned up to hear Riel speak. One month before this speech, he had returned from the United States following a political exile resulting from the Red River Rebellion that had occurred in 1869–1870.
In the Northwest Rebellion of the 1885, Prince Albert Volunteers bore the heaviest casualties of the fighting at the Battle of Duck Lake. Surrounding settlers took refuge with the North-West Mounted Police in a hastily improvised stockade at Prince Albert, fearing an attack by Gabriel Dumont which never came. After the Battle of Batoche, Major General Frederick Middleton marched to Prince Albert to relieve the town. Prince Albert was incorporated the same year under its first mayor, Thomas McKay.
The first recorded stagecoach robbery in what is now Saskatchewan occurred in 1886, when a lone outlaw held up a carriage near Prince Albert.
In 1904, the settlement was incorporated as the City of Prince Albert. Its government is of a council-mayor type.
Prince Albert was the capital of the District of Saskatchewan, a regional administrative division of what then constituted the Northwest Territories. The District of Saskatchewan was formed on May 8, 1882, and retained Prince Albert as the capital.[ref]
