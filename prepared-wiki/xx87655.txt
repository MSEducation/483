[[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Sydney

The Eastern Suburbs is the metropolitan area directly to the east and south-east of the Sydney central business district in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. This can include the suburbs within the local government areas of Woollahra, Waverley, Randwick and part of the City of Sydney.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics' "Eastern Suburbs Statistical Subdivision" includes only the Woollahra, Waverley and Randwick LGAs. According to the 2011 Census, the region's population was 249,546,[tpl]Census 2011 AUS|id=118|name=Sydney - Eastern Suburbs|accessdate=27 January 2014|quick=on[/tpl] up from 230,757 in 2006.[tpl]Census 2006 AUS |id = 10510 |name = Eastern Suburbs (Statistical Subdivision) |accessdate = 2009-03-07 |quick = on[/tpl] 
The Eastern Suburbs of Sydney extends from the peninsula of South Head at Watsons Bay in the north to South Coogee in the South.

==Location==

The northern parts surrounding Sydney Harbour features suburbs such as Vaucluse, Rose Bay, Darling Point, Dover Heights, Double Bay, Point Piper, Woollahra, Woolloomooloo, Watsons Bay, Potts Point, Rushcutters Bay, Elizabeth Bay and Bellevue Hill. The landscape in these areas is characterized by winding crescent-like streets, large homes and harbourside beaches and villages.
South of these suburbs are Bondi Junction, Bondi, Bronte, Tamarama, Queens Park, Waverley, Clovelly, Coogee and Randwick. The landscape in these areas is characterized by modest yet modern homes, ocean beaches, and a traditional 'middle-class' suburban feel.
To the west of Bondi Junction are the inner-city suburbs of Centennial Park, Paddington, Darlinghurst, Moore Park and the Kings Cross locality. The landscape in these areas is dominated by overhanging trees, renovated terrace houses, cafes and modernized pubs and bars.
Further south, the area is also known as South-Eastern Sydney. It includes suburbs such as Maroubra, Matraville, Kingsford, Malabar, Little Bay and La Perouse.  This area has an 'outer-suburban' feel due to its geographic distance from Sydney's CBD, and is a separate area. There is no overlap between the regions. The border between the eastern suburbs and south-eastern suburbs is generally regarded as Rainbow Street, Randwick, and Anzac Parade.

==Landmarks==

The largest commercial areas in the Eastern Suburbs are found at Bondi Junction, North Randwick, Maroubra and Double Bay. The Eastern Suburbs features some of Sydney's well-known beaches such as Bondi Beach, Bronte Beach, and Coogee Beach. The University of New South Wales is one of Australiaâ€™s leading universities located in Kensington.
