==Spread of Lionism==

===Lions Clubs around the world===

The organization became international on 12 March 1920, when the first club in Canada was established in Windsor, Ontario. Lions Clubs have since spread across the globe and have a current membership roster of 1,368,683 members worldwide.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Listed below are the dates of entry for some countries and regions.

===Extensions of the Lions family===

In addition to adult Lions Clubs, the Lions family includes Lioness Clubs, Leo Clubs, and Campus Lions Clubs and Lion Cubs. These divisions are important parts of Lions Clubs International.  They allow service-minded individuals the opportunity to build better communities at the high school and college or university level.

====Lioness Clubs====

Lioness Club Membership is generally for service-minded women, with exceptions of men also becoming Lioness members nowadays. They are formed under a parent Lions Club. The Lions Club thus becomes the Parent Club for the Lioness Club. Naming of the Club is also like that of the Lions Club—e.g., Lions Club of Vadodara (Race Course Circle) Dist 323F-1 forming and sponsoring a Lioness Club of Vadodara (Race Course Circle) Dist 323F-1. In many areas, particularly the United States, Lioness clubs have disbanded and merged into their parent clubs to make a more effective club as a whole.

====Leo Clubs====

Leo Clubs are an extension of the Lions service organization which aims to encourage community service and involvement from a young age. Leo Clubs much like Lioness Clubs are sponsored by a parent Lions Club. Leo Clubs are a common school-based organization with members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the same school, these are commonly referred to as Alpha Leo Clubs. Community based clubs also exist, these generally cater for 18- to 30-year-olds and are referred to as Omega Leo Clubs. Leo Clubs are required to have a Leo Club Advisor, a member of the sponsoring Lions Club who attends meetings and provides general advice to the club. Lions International includes more than 144,000 Leo club members in 139 countries.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/our-work/youth-programs/leo-clubs/index.php | title= Leo Clubs | accessdate= 2010-03-19 [/tpl]

====Campus Lions Clubs====

Many Leos join a Campus Lions Club if they attend a university or college after high school graduation.  There are more than 125 Campus Lions clubs in the world including nearly 2,500 members on college and university campuses in Australia, Brazil, China, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, England, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda, United States, Venezuela, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Ghana-Lions KNUST.  Campus Lions Clubs empower their members to create meaningful change in their communities while developing leadership and professional skills.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/programs_mem_benefits.shtml | title= Campus Lions Clubs News | accessdate= 2007-11-06 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Lion Cubs====

Lion Cubs is a youth service organization for the elementary aged students. The first club was chartered in the Owen J. Roberts School District in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States. It was developed for students in 4th through 6th grade, and therefore too young to be a Leo Club member. The clubs (one club in each of five elementary schools) started their meetings and activities in September 2008 and were officially chartered March 24, 2009. The club is sponsored by the Coventry Lions Club of District 14P. The Lion Cubs first year had 179 charter members.

==International convention==

An international convention is held annually in cities across the globe for members to meet other Lions, elect the coming year's officers, and partake in the many activities planned.  At the convention, Lions can participate in elections and parades, display and discuss fundraisers and service projects, and trade pins and other souvenirs.  The first convention was held in 1917, the first year of the club’s existence, in Dallas, Texas.  The 2006 convention was due to be held in New Orleans, but damage sustained during Hurricane Katrina meant that the convention had to be relocated to Boston.[tpl]cite news | title= Lions will be roaring into town | work= The Boston Globe | date= March 5, 2006 | accessdate=2007-06-07 |  url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/03/05/lions_will_be_roaring_into_town/ | first=Glenn | last=Yoder[/tpl]

==Conspiracy theories==

The Lions have been accused of being involved in the "New World Order" plot, along with the Freemasons, for the supposed purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. The most prominent of these claims came from the thirty-four-article Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS), released in 1988, defining its goals, objectives, and world view. The Lions Clubs are mentioned twice (in Articles 22 and 28Hamas and Freemasonry, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon) as a Zionist front, clearly perceived as an enemy of Islam.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html?chocaid=397 |title=Palestine Center – The Charter of the Hamas |publisher=The Jerusalem Fund |year=1988 |accessdate=April 5, 2014[/tpl]
Indonesian Islamic hardliners have called for a ban on the Lions Club,http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZDtWRl38rOTVGia51qB8VRdG1nw?hl=en&docId=CNG.59cd5233ec1cc00a5943103cea1bb00a.4d1&index=0 [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] saying it is part of a Zionist conspiracy. The club has been called an "infidel" front for Freemasonry and the world Zionist movement and threatened Islam in the world's most populous Muslim country.
Given that many Freemasons are members of Lions Clubs, and its founder, Melvin Jones, was also a Freemason,Melvin Jones, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon modern conspiracy theories have claimed that the Lions are connected to and act cohesively with Freemasonry. One example is found on Martha F. Lee's Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life. It says that the "Freemasons are apparently in cahoots with the Lions Clubs and involved in plots ranging from the distribution of aspartame to control the human mind, to the death of John Paul I, to an apparent plot to spread Zionism."Martha F Lee, Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life, Praeger, 2011, p 22, ISBN 9780313350139
This perception, according to a Freemasonry website, can be traced to John Robison and the Abbé Barruel's unfounded writings on the causes of the French Revolution, Leo Taxil's late 19th-century hoax and the debunked Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The charter's current status within Hamas, the Masonic website claims, is unclear. It has never been formally adopted since Hamas was elected as the Palestinian government in 2006.
While there is no direct link between the Lions and the Masons, they are compatible, as evidenced by a speech delivered in 2004 to a Lions Club by a Mason named James F. Kirk-White. The topic of the talk was "Sharing Freemasonry Within Your Community". As Kirk-White explains, Masons are welcome in Lions Clubs, and vice versa.  That Masons recruit from fraternal organizations such as the Lions among others. Others also believe that the Lions Clubs actually are a "secret society" that has a great deal of secret ritual within its structure.Adam Parfrey, 7 Fascinating Secret Society Photos, Huffington Post, April 6, 2012, retrieved April 8, 2014 According to them the Lions are one of those social groups belonging to a secret society that demand an oath of allegiance to join.Steven Heller, The Secret History of Secret Societies, The Atlantic, April 26, 2012, retrieved April 8, 2014
