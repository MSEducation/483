From his first news broadcast in 1957, the tag-line Henderson used to sign off at the end of every newscast was either "...and that's the way it is."[tpl]cite news|first=Jenny|last=Tabakoff|author2=Peatling, Stephanie|title=That's the way it is - Hendo to call it a night|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/21/1034561445970.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2002-10-22|accessdate=2007-05-28[/tpl] or ''"the way it is".
At the end of his final bulletin, Henderson's voice wavered as he told viewers it was time to watch the news, not present it:  "Not the way it was, as has been suggested, but for the last time, the way it is, this Friday the 29th of November, this is Brian Henderson - a sad Brian Henderson - saying not goodnight, this time, but goodbye."2003/169/5 Pen, plastic, used by Brian Henderson, made by Pentel, Japan, 2002 - Powerhouse Museum Collection
