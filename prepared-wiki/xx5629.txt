==Other Kuiper belts==

By 2006, astronomers had resolved dust disks believed to be Kuiper belt-like structures around nine stars other than the Sun. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts (like our own Kuiper belt) with radii of between 20 and 30 AU and relatively sharp boundaries. Beyond this, 15–20% of solar-type stars have an observed infrared excess that is believed to indicate massive Kuiper-belt-like structures.[tpl]cite journal | title = Debris Disks around Sun-like Stars | author=Trilling, D.

The left image is a "top view" of a wide belt, and the right image is an "edge view" of a narrow belt.[tpl]cite journal |bibcode=2006ApJ...637L..57K |arxiv=astro-ph/0601488 |title=First Scattered Light Images of Debris Disks around HD 53143 and HD 139664 |author1=Kalas |first1=Paul |last2=Graham |first2=James R. |last3=Clampin |first3=Mark C. |last4=Fitzgerald |first4=Michael P. |volume=637 |year=2006 |pages=L57 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |doi=10.1086/500305[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dusty Planetary Disks Around Two Nearby Stars Resemble Our Kuiper Belt|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2006/05/image/a|year=2006|accessdate=July 1, 2007[/tpl] Supercomputer simulations of dust in the Kuiper belt suggest that when it was younger, it may have resembled the narrow rings seen around younger stars.[tpl]cite journal | title = Collisional Grooming Models of the Kuiper Belt Dust Cloud | author=Kuchner, M.
