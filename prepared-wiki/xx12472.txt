==Evolutionary relationships==

Xenarthrans were previously classified alongside the pangolins and aardvarks in the order Edentata (meaning toothless, because the members do not have front incisor teeth and lack, or have poorly developed, molars). Subsequently, Edentata was realized to be a polyphyletic grouping whose New World and Old World taxa are unrelated, and it was split up to reflect their true phylogeny. Aardvarks and pangolins are now placed in individual orders, and the new order Xenarthra was erected to group the remaining families (which are all related). The name Xenarthra means "strange joints", and was chosen because their vertebral joints have extra articulations and are unlike those of any other mammals. Because they lack characteristics believed to be present in the common ancestor of other known eutherian mammals, some weak morphological evidence suggests Xenarthra is outside Epitheria, the group that contains all other eutherians known today. Some workers have even placed xenarthrans outside of placentals, in the separate group Paratheria.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01454253 |title=Reexamination of the morphological evidence for the cohort Epitheria (Mammalia, Eutheria) |year=1996 |last1=Gaudin |first1=Timothy J. |last2=Wible |first2=John R. |last3=Hopson |first3=James A. |last4=Turnbull |first4=William D. |journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution |volume=3 |pages=31–79[/tpl]
The morphology of xenarthrans generally suggests the anteaters and sloths are more closely related to each other than either is to the armadillos; this is upheld by molecular studies. Since its conception, Xenarthra has increasingly come to be considered to be of a higher rank than 'order'; some authorities consider it to be a cohort, while others consider it to be a superorder. Whatever the rank, Xenarthra is now generally considered to be divided into two orders: Cingulata, which contains the armadillos; and Pilosa, which contains the Vermilingua (anteaters) and Folivora (sloths; previously known as Tardigrada or Phyllophaga).
Xenarthra may be most closely related to either Afrotheria[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.5918807 |title=Using genomic data to unravel the root of the placental mammal phylogeny |year=2007 |last1=Murphy |first1=W.
