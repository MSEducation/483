During World War II, Operation Pastel was the deception plan scheduled to protect Operation Olympic, the planned invasion of southern Japan. Pastel would have falsely portrayed a threat of an American-led invasion against ports in China via attacks on Taiwan. Parts of Operation Majestic, an operation declined due to Operation Olympic, were incorporated in Operation Pastel.
