CATEGORIES: Fictional provinces, Clark Ashton Smith

Averoigne is a fictional counterpart of a historical province in France, detailed in a series of short stories by the American writer Clark Ashton Smith. Smith based Averoigne on the actual province of Auvergne.

==History==

In ancient times, Averoigne was settled by the fictional Gallic tribe called the Averones. They established a number of settlements in the region, many of which were fortified when the Roman Empire absorbed the region. When Christianity spread through the Empire, many churches and monasteries were established among the ruins of Druidic temples. Greatest among these was a great cathedral constructed in Vyones, completed in 1138. The historical Auvergne did not have an established English spelling till the early 20th century. The area was the site of the 2nd Vatican with their own Pope in a division from the Roman Pope. The Rome Vatican led an army to smash the French Vatican. This area was also rife with witch and werewolf stories and many were burned at the stake and killed in other ways during the inquisition period. This was a perfect backdrop for Smith to set some of his tales.

==Geography==

Averoigne is located in the southern half of France. The northern half of the territory is dominated by the walled city of Vyones, site of an impressive cathedral. In the southern half is located the town of Ximes; the main road of Averoigne runs between Ximes and Vyones, straight through the thick, dark forest that blankets the province. A river called Isoile flows from the mountains in the northern part of the province to feed into a swamp in the south.
Other towns and villages located in Averoigne include: Moulins, Les Hiboux, La Frenâie, Touraine, Sainte Zenobie, and Périgon. In the forest can be found haunted ruins, such as the Château of Fausseflammes and the stronghold of Ylourgne.
