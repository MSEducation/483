[[Palm oil]]

CATEGORIES: Palm oil, Tropical agriculture

Palm oil (also known as dendê oil, from Portuguese) is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms, primarily the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis,[tpl]Cite book|last1=Reeves |first1=James B. |last2=Weihrauch |first2=John L. |author3=Consumer and Food Economics Institute |title=Composition of foods: fats and oils |series=Agriculture handbook 8-4 |year=1979 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Science and Education Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=5301713 |page=4[/tpl] and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm Elaeis oleifera and the maripa palm Attalea maripa. 
Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content. It is not to be confused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same fruit,[tpl]Cite book|chapter=Origin of oil palm |chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/y4355e/y4355e03.htm |title=Small-Scale Palm Oil Processing in Africa |first=Kwasi |last=Poku |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |series=FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin 148 |year=2002 |isbn=92-5-104859-2[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red), and in saturated fat content: Palm mesocarp oil is 41% saturated, while Palm Kernel oil and Coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated respectivelyHarold McGee.

Along with coconut oil, palm oil is one of the few highly saturated vegetable fats. It is semi-solid at room temperature and contains several saturated and unsaturated fats in the forms of glyceryl laurate (0.1%, saturated), myristate (1%, saturated), palmitate (44%, saturated), stearate (5%, saturated), oleate (39%, monounsaturated), linoleate (10%, polyunsaturated), and alpha-linolenate (0.3%, polyunsaturated).[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=2012022 |year=1991 |last1=Cottrell |first1=RC |title=Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil |volume=53 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=989S–1009S |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition[/tpl] Like all vegetable oils, palm oil does not contain cholesterol,US Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR 101.25 as amended in Federal Register July 19, 1990, Vol.55 No.139 pg.29472[tpl]Verify source|101.25 does not exist according to here: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/SCRIPTs/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm|date=March 2010[/tpl][tpl]Verify source|101.45 has a statement about cholesterol, so perhaps that's what was intended|date=June 2013[/tpl]UK Food Labelling Regulations (SI 1984, No.1305)[tpl]Verify source|not here: List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1984|date=September 2009[/tpl] although saturated fat intake increases a person's LDL[tpl]Cite book|first=Lisa Hark, Gail Morrison|title=Medical nutrition & disease: a case-based approach|page=202|isbn=0-632-04658-9[/tpl] and HDL[tpl]Cite journal|year=1992 |last1=Mensink |first1=RP |last2=Katan |first2=MB |title=Effect of dietary fatty acids on serum lipids and lipoproteins.

The use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups; the high oil yield of the trees, attractive to profit-driven investors, has led to the clearing of forests in parts of Indonesia in order to make space for oil-palm monoculture. This has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the orangutan, of which both species are endangered; one species in particular, the Sumatran orangutan, has been listed as "critically endangered".International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==History==

Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at Abydos dating back to 3,000 BCE.[tpl]cite book |title=The Cambridge World History of Food |editor1-last=Kiple |editor1-first= Kenneth F. |editor2-last=Conee Ornelas |editor2-first=Kriemhild |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521402166 |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/palmoil.htm |accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl] It is believed that Arab traders brought the oil palm to Egypt.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Obahiagbon |first1=F.I. |year=2012 |title=A Review: Aspects of the African Oil Palm (Elaeis guineesis Jacq.) |journal=American Journal of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume= |issue= |pages=1–14 |publisher= |doi=10.3923/ajbmb.2012 |url=http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/academicjournals/ajbmb/0000/38799-38799.pdf |accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl]
Palm oil from Elaeis guineensis has long been recognized in West and Central African countries, and is widely used as a cooking oil. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in Europe.
Palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by British traders, for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during Britain's Industrial Revolution.[tpl]cite journal | year = 2000 | title = BRITISH COLONIAL POLICIES AND THE OIL PALM INDUSTRY IN THE NIGER DELTA REGION OF NIGERIA, 1900-1960. | url = | journal = African Study Monographs | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 19–33 [/tpl]
Palm oil formed the basis of soap products, such as Lever Brothers' (now Unilever) "Sunlight" soap, and the American Palmolive brand.[tpl]cite web|first=Mary |last=Bellis |date= |title=The History of Soaps and Detergents |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsoap.htm |publisher=About.com |quote=In 1864, Caleb Johnson founded a soap company called B.J.

Many processed foods contain palm oil as an ingredient.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8517000/8517093.stm|title=Palm oil products and the weekly shop|date=22 February 2010|publisher=BBC Panorama|accessdate=22 February 2010[/tpl] The USDA agricultural research service states that palm oil is not a healthy substitute for trans fats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2009/090415.htm|title=Palm Oil Not a Healthy Substitute for Trans Fats|author=Rosalie Marion Bliss|year=2009[/tpl] Much of the palm oil that is consumed as food is to some degree oxidized rather than in the fresh state, and this oxidation appears to be responsible for the health risk associated with consuming palm oil.[tpl]cite journal|author=Edem, D.O.|year=2002|title=Palm oil: Biochemical, physiological, nutritional, hematological and toxicological aspects: A review|journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Formerly Qualitas Plantarum)|volume=57|issue=3|pages=319–341|doi=10.1023/A:1021828132707[/tpl]

===Palm oil===

Palm oil is composed of fatty acids, esterified with glycerol like all fat. Unlike all fat, it is high in saturated fatty acids, which are solid at room temperature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/Truth-about-fats.shtml |title=The truth about fats: bad and good |publisher=Health.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27[/tpl] Palm oil gives its name to the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitic acid. Monounsaturated oleic acid is also a constituent of palm oil. Unrefined palm oil is a large natural source of tocotrienol, part of the vitamin E family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tocotrienol.org/en/index/sources.html |title=Welcome to Tocotrienol Resource Website |publisher=Tocotrienol.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15[/tpl]
According to the World Health Organization, evidence is convincing that consumption of palmitic acid increases risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, placing it in the same evidence category as trans fatty acids.Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases, WHO Technical Report Series 916, Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2003, p. 88 (Table 10)  Trans fats are also solid at room temperature.

===Red palm oil===

Red palm oil gets its name from its characteristic dark red color, which comes from carotenes, such as alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, the same nutrients that give tomatoes, carrots and other fruits and vegetables their rich colors.
Red palm oil contains at least 10 other carotenes, along with tocopherols and tocotrienols (members of the vitamin E family), CoQ10, phytosterols, and glycolipids.[ref]

The World Health Organization established a tolerable oral acrolein intake of 7.5 mg/day per kilogram of body weight.  Although acrolein occurs in French fries, the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram.  A 2011 study concluded a health risk from acrolein in food is unlikely.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fmnfr.201100481 |title=Toxicology and risk assessment of acrolein in food - Abraham - 2011 - Molecular Nutrition & Food Research - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Dx.doi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27[/tpl]

===Refined palm oil===

After milling, various palm oil products are made using refining processes. First is fractionation, with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid (stearin), and liquid (olein) fractions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aaj-id.com/operation.html|title=Investment in Technology|publisher=PT. Asianagro Agungjaya[/tpl] Then melting and degumming removes impurities. Then the oil is filtered and bleached. Physical refining[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2012[/tpl] removes smells and coloration to produce "refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil" (RBDPO) and free sheer fatty acids,[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2012[/tpl] which are used in the manufacture of soaps, washing powder and other products. RBDPO is the basic palm oil product sold on the world's commodity markets. Many companies fractionate it further to produce palm olein for cooking oil, or process it into other products.

==Other uses==

===Butter substitute===

Many processed foods contain palm oil as an ingredient. The highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions, making it a cheap substitute for butter in uses where solid fat is desirable, such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods: in this respect, it is less of a health hazard than the alternative substitute of partially hydrogenated trans fat.

===Fatty acids===

Splitting of oils and fats by hydrolysis, or under basic conditions saponification, yields fatty acids, with glycerin (glycerol) as a byproduct. The split-off fatty acids are a mixture ranging in carbon chain length from C4 to C18, depending on the type of oil or fat.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1002/apj.25 |title=Advanced fractionation technology for the oleochemical industry |year=2007 |last1=Faessler |first1=Peter |last2=Kolmetz |last3=Seang |last4=Lee |journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering |volume=2 |page=315 |first2=Karl |first3=Kek Wan |first4=Siang Hua|issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/compounds-fatty.html |title=Free Fatty Acids : Butter |publisher=Webexhibits.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15[/tpl]

The use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food, leading to malnourishment in developing nations. This is known as the food versus fuel debate. According to a 2008 report published in the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel. The production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies.[tpl]Cite report |author=Man Kee Kam |coauthors=Kok Tat Tan, Keat Teong Lee, Abdul Rahman Mohamed |date=9 September 2008 |title=Malaysian Palm oil: Surviving the food versus fuel dispute for a sustainable future |url=http://www.academia.edu/876673/Malaysian_palm_oil_Surviving_the_food_versus_fuel_dispute_for_a_sustainable_future |publisher=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review |accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl] According to a 2009 study published in the Environmental Science and Policy journal, palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future, resulting in the expansion of palm oil production, and therefore an increased supply of food.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/j.envsci.2008.10.011[/tpl]

==Market==

According to the Hamburg-based Oil World trade journal,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor, accounting for 48 million tonnes, or 30% of the total output. Soybean oil came in second with 37 million tonnes (23%). About 38% of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans. Of the 60.3 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world, palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60%; Malaysia, with 45% of the market share, dominated the palm oil trade.

===Food label regulations===

Currently, palm oil may be listed as "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" on food labels in the European Union (EU). Beginning in 2015, food packaging in the EU will no longer be allowed to use the generic terms "vegetable fat" or "vegetable oil" in the ingredients list. Food producers will be required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used, including palm oil.[tpl]Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=12 January 2012 |title=New EU Food Labeling Rules Published |url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/NEW%20EU%20FOOD%20LABELING%20RULES%20PUBLISHED_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_1-12-2012.pdf |publisher=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service |page= |docket= |accessdate=29 January 2013 |quote= [/tpl]

Both small- and large-scale producers participated in the industry.[tpl]cite web|last=Ayodele|first=Thompson|title=African Case Study: Palm Oil and Economic Development in Nigeria and Ghana; Recommendations for the World Bank’s 2010 Palm Oil Strategy|url=http://www.ippanigeria.org/worldbankreportpalmoil%5B1%5D.pdf|publisher=Initiative For Public Policy Analysis|date=August 2010|accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=AYODELE|first=THOMPSON|title=The World Bank’s Palm Oil Mistake|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/opinion/16ayodele.html?_r=1&src=sch&pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 8, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 2010[/tpl]

===Thailand===

Thailand produced 1.3 million tonnes of crude palm oil on roughly 5,700,000 hectares.[tpl]date?[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] The government of Thailand proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to 10,000,000 hectares in 2027.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Colombia===

In the 1960s, about [tpl]convert|18,000|ha|sqmi[/tpl] were planted with palm. Colombia has now become the largest palm oil producer in the Americas, and 35% of its product is exported as biofuel. In 2006, the Colombian plantation owners' association, Fedepalma, reported that oil palm cultivation was expanding to [tpl]convert|1,000,000|ha|sqmi[/tpl]. This expansion is being funded, in part, by the United States Agency for International Development to resettle disarmed paramilitary members on arable land, and by the Colombian government, which proposes to expand land use for exportable cash crops to [tpl]convert|7,000,000|ha|sqmi[/tpl] by 2020, including oil palms. Fedepalma states that its members are following sustainable guidelines.Fedepalma Annual Communication of Progress Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, 2006

===Other countries===

====Benin====

Palm is native to the wetlands of western Africa, and south Benin already hosts many palm plantations. Its 'Agricultural Revival Programme' has identified many thousands of hectares of land as suitable for new oil palm export plantations. In spite of the economic benefits, Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as Nature Tropicale, claim biofuels will compete with domestic food production in some existing prime agricultural sites. Other areas comprise peat land, whose drainage would have a deleterious environmental impact. They are also concerned genetically modified plants will be introduced into the region, jeopardizing the current premium paid for their non-GM crops.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/120/Benin.html | title = Benin: Large scale oil palm plantations for agrofuel | date = 2007-08-03 | first = Flavio | last = Pazos | publisher = World Rainforest Movement[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=African Biodiversity Network|year=2007|title=Agrofuels in Africa: the impacts on land, food and forests : case studies from Benin, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia|publisher=African Biodiversity Network|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=as4sAQAAMAAJ|others=translated by [/tpl]

====Cameroon====

Cameroon has a production project underway initiated by Herakles Farms in the US.Report Assails Palm Oil Project in Cameroon September 5, 2012 New York Times However, the project has been halted under the pressure of Greenpeace, WWF and other civil society organizations in Cameroon. Before the project was halted, Herakles left the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) early on in negotiations. The project has been controversial due to opposition from villagers and the location of the project in a biodiversity hotspot.http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/herakles-cameroon-palm-oil-project-starts-to-/blog/45259/http://wwf.panda.org/?209145/Cameroon-changes-mind-on-Herakles-palm-oil-project

====Kenya====

Kenya's domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand, estimated at around 380,000 metric tonnes. The rest is imported at a cost of around US$140 million a year, making edible oil the country's second most important import after petroleum. Since 1993 a new hybrid variety of cold-tolerant, high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in western Kenya. As well as alleviating the country's deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop, it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region, because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil.[tpl]cite web| title =  Hybrid oil palms bear fruit in western Kenya | date = 2003-11-24 | publisher = UN FAO | url = http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/field/2003/1103_oilpalm.htm [/tpl]

====Ghana====

Ghana has a lot of palm nut species, which may become an important contributor to the agriculture of the region. Although Ghana has multiple palm species, ranging from local palm nuts to other species locally called agric, it was only marketed locally and to neighboring countries. Production is now expanding as major investment funds are purchasing plantations, because Ghana is considered a major growth area for palm oil.

==Impacts==

===Social===

The palm oil industry has had both positive and negative impacts on workers, indigenous peoples and residents of palm oil-producing communities.

===Health===

====Blood lipid and cholesterol effects====  
According to studies reported on by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), excessive intake of palmitic acid, which makes up 44 percent of palm oil, increases blood cholesterol levels and may contribute to heart disease. Several studies have linked palm oil and cardiovascular disease including a 2005 study conducted in Costa Rica which indicated that replacing palm oil in cooking with polyunsaturated non hydrogenated oils could reduce the risk of heart attacks,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Kabagambe, Baylin, Ascherio & Campos|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/135/11/2674|publisher=Journal of Nutrition|title=The Type of Oil Used for Cooking Is Associated with the Risk of Nonfatal Acute Myocardial Infarction in Costa Rica|edition=135|pages=2674–2679 |date=November 2005|pmid=16251629|journal=Journal of Nutrition |volume=135 |issue=11 [/tpl] and a 2011 analysis of 23 countries which showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually there was an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths though the increase was much smaller in high-income countries.[tpl]cite doi|10.1186/1744-8603-7-45[/tpl]
However, results from several studies indicate that palm oil provides health benefits, including increasing good cholesterol and reducing bad cholesterol, and that consumption of palm oil does not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease.[tpl]Cite report |author=Sutapa Mukherjee |authorlink= |coauthors=Analava Mitra |date=2009 |title=Health Effects of Palm Oil |url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-26-0-000-09-Web/JHE-26-3-000-09-Abst-PDF/JHE-26-3-197-09-1776-Mukherjee-S/JHE-26-3-197-09-1776-Mukherjee-S-Tt.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Technology |page=199 |docket= |accessdate=12 February 2013 |quote= [/tpl] Additionally, a 1993 study published by the United Nations University Press found that consumption of palmitic acid appeared to have no impact on cholesterol levels when daily cholesterol intake is below 400 mg per day.[tpl]Cite report |author=Pramod Khosla  |authorlink= |coauthors=K.

A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Vega-López, Sonia et al. |date=July 2006|title=Palm and partially hydrogenated soybean oils adversely alter lipoprotein profiles compared with soybean and canola oils in moderately hyperlipidemic subjects |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |publisher=American Society for Nutrition |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=54–62 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/84/1/54 |doi= |pmid=16825681 [/tpl]

In 1996, Dr Decker of University of Massachusetts Medical School stressed that saturated fats in the sn–1 and -3 position of triacylglycerols exhibit different metabolic patterns because of their low absorptivity. Dietary fats containing saturated fats primarily in sn–1 and -3 positions (e.g., cocoa butter, coconut oil, and palm oil) have very different biological consequences than those fats in which the saturated fats are primarily in the sn–2 position (e.g., milk fat and lard). Differences in stereospecific fatty acid location should be an important consideration in the design and interpretation of lipid nutrition studies and in the production of specialty food products.[ref]

==Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil==

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was created in 2004 following concerns raised by non-governmental organizations about environmental impacts related to palm oil production. The organization has established international standards for sustainable palm oil production. Products containing Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) can carry the RSPO trademark.[tpl]cite news |title=RSPO trademark, not much gain for growers: Gapki |last1=Yulisman |first1=Linda |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/04/rspo-trademark-not-much-gain-growers-gapki.html |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl] Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products.[tpl]cite news |title=Defining ‘Sustainable’ Palm Oil Production |last1=Browne |first1=Pete |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/roundtable-on-sustainable-palm-oil/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=The beginning of the end for RSPO? |last=Gunasegaran |first=P. |url=http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?file=/2011/10/8/columnists/aquestionofbusiness/9656169 |newspaper=The Star Online |date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl]
Palm oil growers who produce Certified Sustainable Palm Oil have been critical of the organization because, though they have met RSPO standards and assumed the costs associated with certification, the market demand for sustainable palm oil remains low. Low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil. In 2011, 12% of palm oil produced was certified sustainable, though only half of that was purchased under the RSPO label.[tpl]cite news |title=WWF: Industry should buy into GreenPalm today, or it will struggle to source fully traceable sustainable palm oil tomorrow |last1=Watson |first1=Elaine |last2= |first2= |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Market/WWF-Industry-should-buy-into-GreenPalm-today-or-it-will-struggle-to-source-fully-traceable-sustainable-palm-oil-tomorrow |newspaper=Foodnavigator |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2013[/tpl] Even with such a low proportion being certified, Greenpeace has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil by only meeting RSPO standards, which Greenpeace argues fall short of protecting rain forests and reducing greenhouse gases.Growing pressure for stricter palm oil standards.
