==Overview==

The series follows the misadventures of a group of young men, who live in the small village of Maaskantje in North Brabant. Maaskantje's distinctly rustic and pleasant appearance as a traditional village is juxtaposed by the actions of the group, who are antisocial and indulge in the 'happy-hardcore' culture. They drink excessively, eat junkfood and ride noisily around the village in a garish Opel Manta. Just about every sentence they speak is mindlessly punctuated by the expletive 'kut' ('cunt', it should be noted that in Dutch this word doesn't carry the same severity as it does in English, although it is nevertheless considered crude). Although most of the characters work, none of them appear particularly adept in their jobs. 
Visually, the group displays a terrible understanding of fashion-sense and have dated hairstyles.
Despite their antisocial and immature mentality, the group rarely exhibits any serious malicious intent in their actions; much of the humor in the series is derived from the absurdity of the characters' lack of intelligence or even common sense.
A particularly distinct feature of the main characters is the presence of a heavy, somewhat exaggerated Brabants dialect, which is especially noticeable in the characters' pronunciation of 'jongen' (dude, guy).
