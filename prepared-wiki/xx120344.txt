Mini Mine Train is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas. There also was a similar version at Six Flags Over Georgia, which was open from 1967 until 1988.
This is a junior roller coaster built shortly after the original Runaway Mine Train roller coaster opened at Six Flags Over Texas. It is designed for families with smaller children not yet tall enough to ride the larger coasters in the park. The Mini Mine Train had to be modified in 1997 to make way for parts of the Mr. Freeze roller coaster.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
