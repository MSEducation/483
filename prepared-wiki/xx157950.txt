[[1998 Florida Marlins season]]

CATEGORIES: Miami Marlins seasons, 1998 Major League Baseball season

The 1998 Florida Marlins season started off with the team trying to repeat as World Series Champions, a title they won from 1997.  Their manager was Jim Leyland. They played home games at Pro Player Stadium. They finished with a record of 54-108, 5 in the NL East. The team is notable for having arguably the biggest fire sale in sports history, auctioning off nearly all of their most notable players.
Entering 2014, the Marlins are the last team to have a losing record a year after beating the Cleveland Indians in the postseason.
