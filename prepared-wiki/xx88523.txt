==Television career==

===1991–2000===

Winkleman's first major television job was in 1991, on the regional discussion programme Central Weekend.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/2010/team|title=BBC biography |publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 January 2011[/tpl] In 1992, she began frequently to appear in the long-running BBC series Holiday, and this continued throughout the mid-1990s. This culminated in a special documentary in which she travelled around the world for 34 days reporting from Japan, India, Costa Rica and Dubai. Throughout this period, she appeared as a reporter on other shows, particularly This Morning interviewing celebrities, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Blair, Alan Sugar and Harrison Ford. During the late 1990s, Winkleman presented a number of programmes on smaller digital channels. She had a stint on the cable channel L!VE TV, run by Kelvin MacKenzie and Janet Street-Porter, but soon left to pursue other projects. One programme made during this period was a short series titled Toilets shown on BBC Choice, which examined the "design, etiquette, psychology and hidden culture behind the humble loo".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

===Strictly Come Dancing===

It is through her work on Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two that Winkleman has gained the most public recognition. The programme, which started in 2004, was devised as a companion show to run conjoined with the second series of Strictly Come Dancing, and continues to run to date. It follows a similar format to the one Winkleman made popular on Fame Academy, and sees the presenter deliberating and dissecting the ins and outs of the main competition, accompanied by an array of dance experts, assorted guests and the competitors themselves. The show is aired every weekday throughout the course of the series at 6:30pm on BBC Two. The show's four judges also appear regularly on the programme. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
One of the show's features was "Len's Masterclass," a segment in which Head Judge Len Goodman demonstrated with Winkleman a dance move or two. Her attempts to follow the steps are accompanied by much girlish giggling. The 2011 series of the programme was presented by former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Zoë Ball, as Winkleman was on maternity leave, and some different segments were introduced.
In 2012, it was announced that Zoë Ball would be the regular presenter of Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m8dq/profiles/zoe-ball|title=Zoe Ball|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl] with Winkleman's involvement in Series 10 of the show being limited to co-hosting the Sunday night results show with Tess Daly.
