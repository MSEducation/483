[[Rhodochorton]]

CATEGORIES: Red algae

Rhodochorton is a genus of filamentous red alga adapted to low light levels. It may form tufts or a thin purple "turf" up to 5 millimetres high.  The filaments branch infrequently, usually at the tips.

==Morphology==

In most species of Rhodochorton, the spore does not persist in the mature plant; instead, a basal web of filaments acts as a holdfast.  Indeed, all Rhodochorton species have distinct basal threads, usually forming a disc, and upright threads, which are typically thinner.  Lateral branches usually occur at or near the top of the patent cell, and branching is concentrated towards the tips of threads.

==Ecology==

The organism may encrust bare rock surfaces, or be epiphytic upon frondose algae - particularly Laminaria hyperborea.http://www.horta.uac.pt/Species/Algae/Rhodochorton_purpureum/Rhodochorton_purpureum.htm  It typically grows in the shadow of these larger algae, in the intertidal zone, and its adaption to low light levels means it is also common in caves.
It reproduces in winter using tetrasporangia and don't bear any monosporangia.[tpl]Citation|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.1969.tb02569.x|title=The Life Histories Of Rhodochorton Purpureum And R.
