In the U.S. and Canada, Ritz Bits Sandwiches are sold. They are miniature-sized Ritz sandwiches with several types of filling between the two crackers. The flavors of filling used to be: Cheese, Peanut Butter, S'mores, and Peanut Butter and Jelly. A pizza version was sold in the early 1990s and again in the early 2000s. Plain Ritz Bits were also sold. Ritz Crackers were also available in a toasted crisp chip called Ritz Toasted Chips and in an elongated form known as Ritz Sticks.
For a while, there were two Ritz Bits flavors including Peanut Butter and Fudge, which consisted of half peanut butter and the other half fudge, and the other Extreme Cheese. Extreme Cheese is similar to regular cheese flavor, except the cracker also contains cheese flavor in it.
There is also a variety of Ritz crackers which are actually pretzels designed to resemble miniature Ritz crackers.
In early 2012, Nabisco introduced Ritz Crackerfuls, a cracker sandwich approximately six inches in length filled with various fillings such as cheddar cheese and other varieties thereof.
