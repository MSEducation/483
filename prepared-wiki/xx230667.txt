==History==

The school was established in September 1997 but formally started its operation in June 1998.  HSIS was organized and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was followed by the release of its Government Permit to  operate for the S.Y. 1998-1999. The first year of operation was inaugurated with 29 pupils in Pre-school (N-K-P) to Grade V gathered in a school house which is now the Administration Building. In the second year a two-room annex building was built on the vacant lot.
For five years, HSIS operated with a Government Permit granted by the Department of Education which had to be renewed every school year. In 2003, when HSIS was granted by the DepED, "Government Recognitions in Pre-school, Grade school and High school" served as a permanent license to operate.  HSIS was granted by the Bureau of Immigration an "Authority to Accept Foreign Students" through a Special Order issued in January 2006.
