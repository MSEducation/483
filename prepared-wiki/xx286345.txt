The cup game is a children's clapping game that involves tapping and hitting a cup using a defined rhythm. The game can be played by many players seated around a table and is often played in large groups. Each player possesses a cup and in unison the players tap out the defined rhythm using their cups. It can be played competitively, where a player making a mistake in the rhythm must drop out of the game, with game play continuing until only one player remains.

==Cup game rhythm==

The cup game begins with a cup placed upside down in front of each player. Assuming a right-handed player, the rhythm normally proceeds as follows:
Repeat the above sequence indefinitely. Some versions involve variations where the players exchange cups during the performance of the rhythm, or players slap hands with each other.[tpl]cite web|url= http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/games/thecupgame.html|title=The Cup Game|publisher=Zoom Games|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl]

==Another cup game rhythm==

In the Lulu and the Lampshades (and newer) performances, this is the right hand which slaps down flat onto the table.
Repeat the above sequence indefinitely.

==In music==

Christian singer Rich Mullins used the cup game to accompany his song "Screen Door" on his 1987 album Pictures in the Sky. In 2009 the band Lulu and the Lampshades used the game in their performance of the 1930 Carter Family song When I'm Gone as modified to suit the game by "Lulu" (Luisa Gerstein). Rapper P.O.S also uses the cup game in Optimist (We Are Not for Them) from his 2009 album Never Better. In 2011 the cup game was again used by Anna Burden to accompany the song "When I'm Gone" in a YouTube video that went viral. Anna Kendrick taught herself to copy Burden's video, and this was worked into her performance in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, her version When I'm Gone (Cups) in turn becoming widely copied with a 2013 video after the single from the soundtrack rose on the national and international charts.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cups-the-newfangled-patty-cake-game-thats-gone-viral-among-young-girls/2013/02/26/a6f98452-7232-11e2-a050-b83a7b35c4b5_story.html|author=Robert Samuels|title=‘Cups,’ the ‘Pitch Perfect’ patty-cake game that’s gone viral in the schoolyard|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 26, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl]
