CATEGORIES: Geography of Nottinghamshire

Hidden Valleys was a name coined in 2004 to describe an area of interesting historical and scenic value between Nottingham and Mansfield in the county of Nottinghamshire.

Partners in the project were Ashfield District Council, Gedling District Council, the East Midlands development agency, Nottinghamshire County Council, and the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.
