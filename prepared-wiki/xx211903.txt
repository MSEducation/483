===Nagorno-Karabakh War===

In the Nagorno-Karabakh War 7 persons were killed in inter-ethnic fighting.
In 1991, the second operation of Operation Ring took place in and around Voskepar. This was a military operation conducted by Soviet Internal Security Forces and OMON units, officially dubbed a "passport checking operation," the stated goal launched by the Soviet Union's internal and defense ministries was to disarm Armenian militia detachments which were organized in "illegally armed formations."De Waal, Thomas. Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War. New York: New York University Press, 2003, p. 114. ISBN 0-8147-1945-7. The operation involved the use of soldiers who accompanied a complement of military vehicles, artillery and helicopter gunships to be used to root out the self-described Armenian fedayeen. However, contrary to their stated objectives, Soviet troops and the predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the Azerbaijan SSR OMON and army forcibly depopulated many Armenians. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing.Melander, Erik in "State Manipulation or Nationalist Ambition" in The Role of the State in West Asia. Ed. Annika Rabo and Bo Utas. New York: I.B. Tauris, 2006, p. 173. ISBN 91-86884-13-1. According to Svante E. Cornell, Operation ring was carried out with 'harshly systematic Human Rights violations'.[tpl]cite book|last=E.
