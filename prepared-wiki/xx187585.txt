[[Plasmodium species infecting primates]]

CATEGORIES: Plasmodium, Parasites of primates

The Plasmodium species infecting primates include the parasites causing malaria in humans.

==Species infecting humans==

(Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium rhodiani which have been reported to infect humans, are likely synonymous with P. malariae)
The first six listed here are the only common species that infect humans. While infection of humans by other species is known, they are quite rare, in some instances, only a single case. In a number of the cases, the means of infection is unknown, and may be due to accident, i.e. infection by laboratory equipment or a bite by an animal.
With the use of the polymerase chain reaction additional species have been and are still being identified that infect humans:
One possible experimental infection has been reported with Plasmodium eylesi. Fever and low grade parasitemia were apparent at 15 days. The volunteer (Dr Bennett) had previously been infected by Plasmodium cynomolgi and the infection was not transferable to a gibbon (P. eylesi 's natural host) so this cannot be regarded as definitive evidence of its ability to infect humans. A second case has been reported that may have been a case of P. eylesi but the author was not certain of the infecting species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tsukamoto M |title=An imported human malarial case characterized by severe multiple infections of the red blood cells |journal=Ann. Trop. Med. Parasit. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=95–104 |year=1977[/tpl]
A possible infection with Plasmodium tenue has been reported.[tpl]cite journal |author=Russel PF |title=Plasmodium tenue (Stephens): A review of the literature and a case report |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. |volume=s1-8 |issue=5 |pages=449–79 |year=1928[/tpl] This report described a case of malaria in a three year old black girl from Georgia, USA who had never been outside the US. She suffered from both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria and while forms similar to those described for P. tenue were found in her blood even the author was skeptical about the validity of the diagnosis.
Confusingly Plasmodium tenue was proposed in the same year (1914) for a species found in birds. The human species is now considered to be likely to have been a misdiagnosis and the bird species is described on the Plasmodium tenue page.

===Notes===

Until recently the only known host of P. falciparum was humans but this species has also been described in gorillas (Gorilla gorilla)[tpl]cite journal | author = Prugnolle F, Durand P, Neel C, Ollomo B, Ayala FJ, Arnathau C, Etienne L, Mpoudi-Ngole E, Nkoghe D et al. | year = 2010 | title = African great apes are natural hosts of multiple related malaria species, including Plasmodium falciparum | url = | journal = Proc.

PloS Pathog. 12;6(2):e1000765 There has been a single report of P. falciparum in a brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) and in black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya)[tpl]cite journal |author=Duarte AM, Malafronte Rdos S, Cerutti C |title=Natural Plasmodium infections in Brazilian wild monkeys: Reservoirs for human infections? |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=179–85 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18620330 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2008.05.020 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(08)00165-4[/tpl] but until this is confirmed its validity should be considered dubious.
A possible report of P. falciparum in a greater spot-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) has not been confirmed in a large survey.Ayouba A, Mouacha F, Learn GH, Mpoudi-Ngole E, Rayner JC, Sharp PM, Hahn BH, Delaporte E, Peeters M (2012) Ubiquitous Hepatocystis infections, but no evidence of Plasmodium falciparum-like malarial parasites in wild greater spot-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans).

A species that clusters with P. falciparum and P. reichenowi has been identified in Gabon, Africa in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).[tpl]cite journal |author=Ollomo B, Durand P, Prugnolle F |title=A new malaria agent in African hominids |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=5 |issue=5 | pages=e1000446 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19478877 |pmc=2680981 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000446 | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000446[/tpl] This appears to have diverged from these two species about 21 million years ago. It has only been identified from the sequence of its mitochondrion to date and further work is needed to characterise the species. A second report has confirmed the existence of this species in chimpanzees. A third report has confirmed the existence of this species.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kaiser M, Lowa A, Ulrich M, Ellerbrok H, Goffe AS, Blasse A, Zommers Z, Couacy-Hymann E, Babweteera F et al. |date=Dec 2010 | title = Wild chimpanzees infected with 5 Plasmodium species | url = | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 16 | issue = 12| pages = 1956–1959 [/tpl]
Night monkeys (Aotus nigriceps) can be infected with P. falciparum. This infection may occur naturally.da Silva Araújo M, Messias MR, Figueiró MR, Gil LH, Probst CM, de Medeiros Vidal N, Katsuragawa TH, Krieger MA, Pereira da Silva LH, Ozaki LS (2013) Natural Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the state of Rondonia (Brazilian Western Amazon). Malar J 12(1):180 Their potential role - if any - as a source of human infection is unknown.
Two additional species within the subgenus Laverania have been identified on the basis of DNA sequences alone: Plasmodium billbrayi and Plasmodium billcollinsi. and bonbos P. billbrayi was found in two subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). P. billcollinsi was found in only one subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). Further work is needed to characterise these species.
Humans are currently considered to be the only host for P. malariae. However Rodhain and Dellaert in the 1940s showed with transmission studies that P. malariae was present in chimpanzees.Rodhain J (1940) Les plasmodiums des anthropoids de l'Afrique centrale et leurs relations avec les plasmodiums humains. Récepticité de l'homme au Plasmodium malariae. (Plasmodium rodhaini Brumpt) du chimpanzé. C. R. Soc. Biol. 133:276-277Rodhain J and Dellaert R (1943) L'infection á Plasmodium malariae du chimpanzé chez l'homme. Etude d'une premiére souche isolée de l'anthropoide Pan satyrus verus. Ann. Soc. Belge. Med. Trop. 23:19-46
The presence of P. malaria in chimpanzees has been reported in Japan suggesting that this species may be able to act as a host.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hayakawa T, Arisue N, Udono T |title=Identification of Plasmodium malariae, a human malaria parasite, in imported chimpanzees |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=e7412 |year=2009 |pmid=19823579 |pmc=2756624 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007412 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007412[/tpl]  A second paper has described the presence of P. malaria in wild chimpanzees. Another paper has reported several cases of P. malariae in  brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) and black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) It has been shown that splectomised three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus) can be infected with P. malariae.[tpl]cite journal | author = Collins WE, Contacos PG | year = 1969 | title = Infectivity of Plasmodium malariae in the Aotus trivirgatus monkey to Anopheles freeborni mosquitoes | url = | journal = J Parasitol | volume = 55 | issue = 6| pages = 1253–1257 [/tpl] Another paper has confirmed the presence of P. malaria in chimpanzees.Pacheco MA, Cranfield M, Cameron K, Escalante AA (2013) Malarial parasite diversity in chimpanzees: the value of comparative approaches to ascertain the evolution of Plasmodium falciparum antigens. Malar J 12(1):328
The existence of multiple independent reports seem to suggest that the chimpanzee and possibly other species may act as a host to P. malaria at least occasionally.
P. vivax will infect chimpanzees. Infection tends to be low grade but may be persistent and remain as source of parasites for humans for some time. P. vivax is also known to infect orangutans[tpl]cite journal |author=Reid MJ, Ursic R, Cooper D |title=Transmission of human and macaque Plasmodium spp. to ex-captive orangutans in Kalimantan, Indonesia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1902–8 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17326942 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no12/06-0191.htm[/tpl] and the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans) P. vivax has been reported from chimpanzees living in the wild. It has been suggested that vivax infection of the great apes in Africa may act as a reservoir given the prevalence of Duffy antigen negative humans in this area.Prugnolle F, Rougeron V, Becquart P, Berry A, Makanga B, Rahola N, Arnathau C, Ngoubangoye B, Menard S, Willaume E, Ayala FJ, Fontenille D, Ollomo B, Durand P, Paupy C, Renaud F (2013) Diversity, host switching and evolution of Plasmodium vivax infecting African great apes. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
Like P. vivax, P. ovale has been shown to be transmittable to chimpanzees. P. ovale has an unusual distribution pattern being found in Africa, Myanmar the Philippines and New Guinea. In spite of its admittedly poor transmission to chimpanzees given its discontigous spread, it is suspected that P. ovale may in fact be a zooenosis with an as yet unidentified host. If this is actually the case, the host seems likely to be a primate. A report has been published suggesting that P. ovale may be a natural parasite of chimpanzees[tpl]cite journal |author=Duval L, Nerrienet E, Rousset D |title=Chimpanzee malaria parasites related to Plasmodium ovale in Africa |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=e5520 |year=2009 |pmid=19436742 |pmc=2677663 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005520 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005520[/tpl] but this needs confirmation. P. ovale has since been described from chimpanzees living in the wild. This suggests that human infection with this species may as previously suspected be a zoonosis.
It has been recently shown that P. ovale is actually two genetically distinct species that coexist. These species are Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri.[tpl]cite journal|title=Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale occur globally|author=Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, Oguike M, Jennison C, Pukrittayakamee S, Dolecek C, Hien TT, do Rosário VE, Arez AP, Pinto J, Michon P, Escalante AA, Nosten F, Burke M, Lee R, Blaze M, Otto TD, Barnwell JW, Pain A, Williams J, White NJ, Day NP, Snounou G, Lockhart PJ, Chiodini PL, Imwong M, Polley SD|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=10|pages=1544–50|pmid=20380562|doi=10.1086/652240[/tpl] These two species separated between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago.
Plasmodium knowlesi has a natural reservoir in the macaques of Southeast Asia, and was only in 1965 identified as being transmissible to humans.
The remaining species capable of infecting humans all have other primate hosts.

==Plasmodium taxonomy==

Interrelatedness - The evolution of these species is still being worked out and the relationships given here should be regarded as tentative. This grouping, while originally made on morphological grounds, now has considerable support at the DNA level.

===Notes===

==Species previously described as infecting humans but no longer recognised as valid==

Taxonomy in parasitology until the advent of DNA based methods has always been a problem and revisions in this area are continuing. A number of synonyms have been given for the species infecting humans that are no longer recognised as valid.[tpl]cite journal |author=Coatney GR, Roudabush RL |title=A catalog and host-index of the genus Plasmodium |journal=J. Parasitol. |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=338–53 |year=1936 |doi=10.2307/3271859 |jstor=3271859[/tpl] Since perusal of the older literature may be confusing some currently defunct species names are listed here.

Plasmodium shortii and Plasmodium osmaniae are now considered to be junior synonyms of Plasmodium inui.

==Species infecting other hosts==

Most if not all Plasmodium species infect more than one host: the host records shown here should be regarded as incomplete.
It has been proposed that the species P. gora and P. gorb should be renamed P. adleri and P. blacklocki respectively.
