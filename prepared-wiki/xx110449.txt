===Traditional K-12 Schools===

The following lists the high schools of the system, including their feeder elementary and middle schools.  Some exceptions to the following diagram exist, but this depiction is typically accurate.
(Note: high schools are grades 9-12; middle schools 6-8; and elementary schools K-5)

===Non-Traditional Schools===

==Growth==

As the population of Cabarrus County has exploded over the past fifteen years, so too has the size of the school system.  In 2001 the county opened Robinson High School, the first new high school in Cabarrus County in 35 years.  However, new schools at all three levels tend to become quickly overcrowded (Robinson High School, built for 1,500 students, opened in the fall of 2005 with nearly 1,800 students enrolled).  Therefore, new schools are being constantly planned and added, with eight new schools having been constructed since 1996 (plus four new buildings for outdated existing schools).

==Soccer Partnership==

Since 2005 FC Carolina Alliance Youth Soccer Club has served as the administrator for Cabarrus County Schools Middle School Soccer League. FCCA provides the venue, schedule, uniforms, coaches, referees, and end-of-season awards for a successful middle school soccer program. 
The program is open to all middle school boys and girls.
Each school may enter a maximum of 2 teams in the boy’s league, and 2 teams in the girl’s league. (If a school is only able to form a co-ed team then that team will play in the boys division.)
The program is run in a league format with an end-of-season play off tournament. Each team should plays between 8-12 games, depending on their play-off results.
FCCA also works with Cabarrus County School's "Kid's Plus" after-school program, providing free soccer clinics to Cabarrus County elementary schools.
