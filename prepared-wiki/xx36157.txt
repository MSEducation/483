Babes in Arms is a 1937 musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Lorenz Hart and book by Rodgers and Hart. It concerns a young man and woman (about 20) who put on a show with their friends to avoid having them be sent to a work farm, since their parents are out of work vaudevillians.
The original versions had strong political overtones with discussions of Nietzsche, a Communist character and two African-American youths who are victims of racism. In 1959 George Oppenheimer created a "sanitized, de-politicized rewrite" which is now the most frequently performed version.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.42ndstmoon.org/babes-in-arms-1999 |title=Babes in Arms- staged concert production |author= |year=1999 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=3 August 2013[/tpl] In the new version, the young people are trying to save a local summer stock theatre from being demolished, not trying to avoid being sent to a work farm. The sequence of the songs is drastically changed, the orchestration changed, and the dance numbers eliminated.
The sanitized version was the only one available for performance until 1998 when the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music presented the original version (with a few race references slightly re-edited.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.johnhallmtw.com/musicaltheater/babes.html |title=UCLA Music workshop presents |author= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=3 August 2013[/tpl]

==Production history==

Babes in Arms opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on April 14, 1937, transferred to the Majestic Theatre on October 25, 1937, and closed on December 18, 1937 after 289 performances. The production, under the auspices of Dwight Deere Wiman, was staged by Robert B. Sinclair with choreography by George Balanchine. Settings were by Raymond Sovey, and costumes by Helene Pons. Hans Spialek created the orchestrations and Gene Salzer led the orchestra which included pianists Edgar Fairchild and Adam Carroll. The cast featured Mitzi Green, Ray Heatherton, and Alfred Drake, as well as the Nicholas Brothers[tpl]cite web|title=Babes in Arms|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12218|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=12 December 2012[/tpl]
Several songs in Babes in Arms became pop standards, including the title song; "Where or When"; "My Funny Valentine"; "The Lady Is a Tramp"; "Johnny One Note" and "I Wish I Were in Love Again".
The film version, released in 1939, starred Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and was directed by Busby Berkeley. It radically revised the plot retained only two songs from the original stage version, Where or When and Babes in Arms. The film is credited with making the trope of kids putting on a musical show for charity popular.
A studio cast recording starring Gregg Edelman as Val, Judy Blazer as Billie, Jason Graae as Gus, Donna Kane as Dolores, Judy Kaye as Baby Rose, Adam Grupper as Peter, with JQ and the Bandits as the Quartet and featuring the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra was released by New World Records in 1990.

==Later revivals of original 1930s version==

==Other performances of the 1950s version==

The musical was produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre from June 7, 2007 through July 7, 2007, and cast Judy Garland's daughter Lorna Luft as the domineering mother of former child star Baby Rose Owens. One reviewer complained that the musical seemed to have lost its legendary political bite, evidently unaware that this was the revised 1950s de-politicized version.What's On Stage, accessed May 12, 2009 She was given two new songs from neither the stage version nor the film in which her mother appeared.
