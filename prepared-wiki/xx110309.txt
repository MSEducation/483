According to the original Federal Radio Commission broadcast license records, radio stations KFZ, KOE, and KFIO (antecedent of the current KSBN) were on the air in Spokane before KHQ signed on in Spokane on October 30, 1925.
Wasmer moved the station's studios and office across Post Street from the Davenport Hotel to the seventh floor of Spokane Stock Exchange Building (also called the Eilers Building) in 1928 because the fledgling station had outgrown its quarters in the hotel."KHQ Will Move Radio Studios."

After the Second World War, Cowles Publishing Company, publisher of The Spokesman-Review newspaper, bought KHQ and used it to launch an FM station (now KISC) and a television station (which still bears the KHQ-TV calls). KHQ stayed in the Radio Central Building until 1960 when it moved to a modern facility next to its transmitter site on South Regal on the Moran Prairie.KHQ Radio Broadcasting Station Licenses from 1934 to 1937.
