[[10-Hydroxy Lycopodium alkaloids]]

CATEGORIES: Alkaloids

The 10-hydroxy ''Lycopodium'' alkaloids, 10-hydroxylycopodine, deacetylpaniculine and paniculine, are a series of natural products isolated from a Chilean club moss Lycopodium confertum. Deacetylpaniculine and paniculine were also isolated from Lycopodium paniculatum.[tpl]cite journal |last= Muñoz |first= Orlando M. |title=High Resolution NMR Studies of Paniculine and Related Lycopodium Compounds|journal=Journal of Natural Products |date=January 1990|volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=200–203 |doi=10.1021/np50067a032[/tpl]
The Lycopodium alkaloids are of interest due to their biological activity and unique skeletal characteristics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://stoltz.caltech.edu/litmtg/mechclub/2008/AHSC7_08.pdf|title=Lycopodine and the Lycopodium Alkaloids[/tpl] however, many compounds in this class have not been well studied.

==Synthesis==

The first enantioselective synthesis of 10-hydroxylycopodine, deacetylpaniculine and paniculine was published by Mrinmoy Saha and Professor Rich Carter in 2013 from Oregon State University. A common intermediate strategy was used to accomplish the total synthesis.[tpl]cite journal |last=Garter |first=Rich G. |title=Toward a Unified Approach for the Lycopodines: Synthesis of 10-Hydroxylycopodine, Deacetylpaniculine, and Paniculine |journal=Organic Letters |date=February 2013|volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=736–739 |doi=10.1021/ol303272w |pmid=23384410[/tpl] The key steps toward the syntheses are an organocatalyzed (Proline sulfonamide catalyst nick named as Hua Cat.) Michael reaction and a Zn(OTf)2 mediated conformationally accelerated Mannich reaction.
