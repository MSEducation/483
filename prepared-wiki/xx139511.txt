[[The Next Passage (Alternamorphs)]]

CATEGORIES: Animorphs books, 2000 novels

Alternamorphs #2: The Next Passage is the second and final book of the Alternamorphs series, a spinoff of the Animorphs series. It involves a second-person narrative so as to allow the reader to actually take part in the story. It lies outside of the regular Animorphs continuity.

==Plot summary==

This book loosely follows the plots of Animorphs books #20: The Discovery, Megamorphs #2: In the Time of Dinosaurs and #26: The Attack. The book narrates from the reader point of view, as a sixth Animorph, and they are able to choose their morphs as the story progresses.
Like all gamebooks, the choices the reader make cause different endings. One of the splits in the story involves Cassie being killed and Rachel forcing the reader to promise not to meddle. If the reader refuses, the others will force them to stay in a fly morph and become a nothlit and they will die but the other split is being in prehistoric time. Unlike other gamebooks, if the reader make a decision that causes them to die, the 'failure' page will refer them to the page that allows the reader to choose another action. Notes are written in bold text at the bottom of certain pages.
