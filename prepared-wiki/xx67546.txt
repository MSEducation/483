==Profile==

Born in Coronado, California, Weymouth is of French heritage on her mother's side (she is the great-granddaughter of Anatole Le Braz, a Breton writer). Heritage-d'Anatole Le Braz aux talking heads dated 31 August 2012 at letelegramme.fr[tpl]cite book|last=Bowman|first=David|title=This Must Be the Place: The Adventures of Talking Heads in the 20th Century|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-380-97846-5|page=10[/tpl] She was a cheerleader in high school. As a bass guitarist, she combined the minimalist art-punk basslines of groups such as Wire and Pere Ubu with danceable, funk-inflected riffs to provide the bedrock of Talking Heads signature sound. Her sound is often very syncopated (i.e. reggae/funk) in feel, combining low fundamental notes with higher flourishes in clipped, staccato rhythms. She joined Talking Heads as bass guitarist at the request of then-boyfriend, Chris Frantz.

==Life outside Talking Heads==

Full members of the Compass Point All Stars, Weymouth and Frantz formed the Tom Tom Club in 1980, which kept them busy during a fairly long hiatus in Talking Heads activity. When it became obvious that Talking Heads frontman David Byrne had no interest in another Talking Heads album, Weymouth, Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited without him for a single album called No Talking, Just Head under the name "The Heads" in 1996, featuring a rotating cast of vocalists. Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as "a man incapable of returning friendship."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Byrning-down-the-house/2005/02/04/1107476787488.html|title=Byrning down the house|author=Guy Blackman|publisher=The Age|date=2005-02-06|accessdate=2007-06-01|quote=In March, 2007, Weymouth described Byrne as "a man incapable of returning friendship". She told Glasgow's Sunday Herald: "Cutting off attachments when a thing/person is perceived to have served its purpose or there is a perceived threat to ego is the lifelong pattern of his relations".[/tpl]
She also co-produced the Happy Mondays' 1992 album Yes Please! and has recently contributed backing vocals and percussion for the alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz; the backing vocals were provided for the character Noodle.
