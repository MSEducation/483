Victor Moses (born 12 December 1990) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays for Liverpool on loan from Chelsea. Moses can play in a variety of positions, but in the first-team games he has taken part in so far, Moses has mostly played as a winger. Born in Nigeria, he represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels, but opted to play for the Nigeria as opposed to being fully capped for England.
Moses began his career in the Championship with Crystal Palace, before his performances caught the eye of Wigan Athletic. After two years, his game had improved to the extent that European Champions Chelsea were interested. Despite 10 goals during his first season, he was deemed surplus to requirements following the purchases of several attacking players, and he was let out on a season-long loan to Liverpool.

==Early life==

Moses was born in Lagos, Nigeria, the son of a Christian pastor. When he was 11, his parents were among thousands killed by rioters.Crystal Palace starlet Victor Moses was playing street football with a 'sticky tape' ball when he heard both his parents had been murdered..">[tpl]cite news |last=Holt |first=Oliver |date=18 February 2009 |url= http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/oliver-holt/Crystal-Palace-starlet-Victor-Moses-was-playing-street-football-with-a-sticky-tape-ball-when-he-heard-both-his-parents-had-been-murdered-article53720.html |title=Crystal Palace starlet Victor Moses was playing street football with a 'sticky tape' ball when he heard both his parents had been murdered. |newspaper=The Mirror |accessdate=16 November 2012 |location=London[/tpl][/ref][tpl]cite news |last= Kelso |first= Paul |date=20 May 2005 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/20/football.immigration |title=14-year-old asylum seeker becomes school's football hero |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 July 2008 |location= London[/tpl] A week later with his travel being paid for by relatives, Moses came to Britain as an asylum seeker. He attended Stanley Technical High School (now known as the Harris Academy) in South Norwood. Scouted playing football in the local Tandridge League for Cosmos 90 FC, Crystal Palace approached him, with the club's Selhurst Park stadium just streets away from his school. Offered a place in the Eagles' academy, Palace recommended him to the fee-paying Whitgift School in Croydon, where former Arsenal and Chelsea star Colin Pates was coaching the school football team.

==Club career==

===Crystal Palace===

Moses first came to prominence at 14 after scoring 50 goals for Palace's under-14s side. Playing alongside side Joe Szekeres for three years at both Whitgift and Palace, the pairing scored over 100 goals between them, as well as helping Whitgift win many School Cups, including a National Cup where Moses scored all five goals in the final against Healing School of Grimsby at the Walkers Stadium, Leicester.
He made his debut in The Championship on 6 November 2007 away from home against Cardiff. In the Palace first team Moses settled down well, scoring 3 times in his first season and settling into the squad well. In the close season Moses committed his future to Palace, signing a four-year contract to take him through until 2012,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~1352919,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211208/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~1352919,00.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |title=Moses Signs Four Year Deal |publisher= Crystal Palace FC|date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2013[/tpl] but the following season failed to ever really get going however, and despite a sustained period of starting matches he only managed to score twice.

===Wigan Athletic===

It was the 2009–10 season where he really came to prominence, when a run of five goals in eight games for the Eagles saw him become the hottest property of the January transfer window. On the final day of it he completed a £2.5 million transfer to Premier League side Wigan Athletic after Palace went into administration.
He made his debut on 6 February 2010 as a substitute against Sunderland in a 1–1 draw.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8493730.stm|title=Sunderland 1–1 Wigan|date=6 February 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]

He scored his first league goal of the season
on 13 November 2010 in a 1–0 win against West Bromwich Albion.
Following the departure of Charles N'Zogbia, Moses became a regular starter for Wigan in the 2011–12 season. On 10 December 2011, he scored his first goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion – his first goal since scoring against the same team last season.

==International career==

===England===

====U-16 and U-17 level====

Despite originally hailing from Nigeria Moses initially chose to represent his adopted home of England, featuring for the under-16 team, in which he won the Victory Shield in 2005, and under-17 level. He travelled with the squad to the 2007 UEFA European U-17 Championship in Belgium, scoring three times (including the only goal in the semi-final win over France) to help John Peacock's side to the competition final, where they were narrowly beaten by a single goal by Spain, though Moses managed to finish as the competition's top scorer and collect the Golden Boot for doing so.
That same summer the squad travelled to South Korea for the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Moses finished as the Young Lions' top scorer, netting three times in the Group B fixtures, but sustained an injury in the victory over Brazil that ruled him out of the competition. Moses' teammates went on to reach the quarterfinal stage.

====U-19s====

Following that tournament Moses was promoted to the under-18 squad, and following his goalscoring exploits for Palace's first-team, he was promoted to the under-19 side without appearing sufficiently for the U-18s to actually collect a cap. He went with the U-19s to the 2008 UEFA European U-19 Championship in the Czech Republic, playing two matches and picking up one assist as the Young Lions failed to make it out of Group B. Speculation grew as Stuart Pearce snubbed him that Moses would return to play for Nigeria in the 2010 World Cup, this move never materialised.

====U-21s====

Moses was promoted to the under-21 squad at the beginning of the 2010-2011 Premier League season and made his debut against Uzbekistan in a 2–0 win.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvUzbekistan/Teamsheets?p=ts&mid=102750 |title=Teamsheets |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl]

===Nigeria===

Moses was selected to play for Nigeria against Guatemala in February 2011, but the friendly was cancelled.Ameobi, Moses get Nigeria call. kickoff.com. 14 January 2011. He accepted a call-up in March 2011 for Nigeria's games against Ethiopia and Kenya.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/9431866.stm |title=Victor Moses gets late Nigeria call |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012[/tpl] However, he was ruled out of those games because his application to FIFA to switch nationalities was not received in time. It was announced on 1 November 2011, that FIFA had cleared Moses and Shola Ameobi to play for Nigeria. He was called up to Nigeria's 23-man squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring two penalties in their final group stage game against Ethiopia, which Nigeria needed to win to go through. For the second, the Ethiopian Goalkeeper Sisay Bancha was given his second booking in the events leading to the penalty and was sent off. Ethiopia had already used all three substitutes so their holding midfielder went in goal, and missed Moses' penalty. The game ended 2–0.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20970786|title=Nations Cup 2013: Nigeria pick six locally-based players|author=Oluwashina Okeleji|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
