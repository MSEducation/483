The Confusion Range is a north-south trending mountain range in west-central Utah, USA.  It is bounded by Snake Valley to the west, Tule Valley to the east, the Great Salt Lake Desert to the north, and the Ferguson Desert to the south.  The range trends into the Burbank Hills, Mountain Home Range, and the Wah Wah Mountains to the south.  In the central part of the range, an offshoot of the mountains to the west is known as the Conger Range.  The Confusion Range is named for its "rugged isolation and confusing topography."Van Cott, J.
