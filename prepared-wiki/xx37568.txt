Ikeda has written and illustrated many shōjo manga, many of which are based on historical events, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution. Her use of foreign settings and androgynous themes made The Rose of Versailles and Orpheus no Mado "enormous successes".Halldór Stefánsson (1994). "Foreign myths and sagas in Japan: the academics and the cartoonists" in Beyond Boundaries: Understanding, Translation and Anthropological Discourse, p. 88, edited by Gísli Pálsson. Berg Publishers.

Her most famous manga is The Rose of Versailles also known as Lady Oscar in Europe. This manga, loosely based on the French Revolution, has been made into several Takarazuka musicals and into an anime series and a live-action film. After Rose of Versailles concluded, Ikeda wrote articles for Asahi Shimbun. In the 2000s Ikeda studied at a music school and became a singer. Her voice is in the soprano range. She made a comeback to the comic industry as a scenarist in 1999.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  Her recent manga includes Der Ring des Nibelungen.
