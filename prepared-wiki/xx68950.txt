The WWF Championship was decided at the 1992 Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match. Hogan failed to regain the championship as he was eliminated by friend Sid Justice and in turn caused Sid to be eliminated, leaving Ric Flair the winner and new champion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152//mainevent/|title=Ric Flair (spot No. 3) wins the Royal Rumble Match to become new WWE Champion|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=January 19, 1992[/tpl] Hogan and Sid patched things up and teamed together on the February 8, 1992 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event against Flair and Undertaker but during the match Sid abandoned Hogan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/feb081992|title=Saturday Night's Main Event XXX results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=February 8, 1992[/tpl] starting their feud. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid's manager Harvey Wippleman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm8/mainevent/|title=Sycho Sid vs. Hulk Hogan|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=April 5, 1992[/tpl] Hogan was then attacked by [[Charles Wright (wrestler)| Papa
Shango]] and was saved by the returning Ultimate Warrior.
At this time, news sources began to allege that Dr. George Zahorian, a doctor for the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, had been selling steroids illegally to wrestlers in general and Hogan in particular. Hogan appeared on an episode of The Arsenio Hall Show to deny the allegations. Due to intense public scrutiny, Hogan took a leave of absence from the company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20112274,00.html|title=Incredible Hulk?|publisher=People|accessdate=2009-08-09|date=March 23, 1992[/tpl]

====Brief comeback (1993–1994)====

Hogan returned to the WWF in February 1993, helping out his friend Brutus Beefcake in his feud with Money Inc. ("The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster), and officially renaming themselves The Mega-Maniacs, taking on Money Inc.'s former manager "The Mouth of the South" Jimmy Hart (a long time friend of Hogan's outside of wrestling) as their manager in what was the first time WWF audiences had seen Hart as a face. At WrestleMania IX, Hogan and Beefcake took on Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. However, Hogan thought he was too big of a star to be a tag champion and instead wanted the World title. So Hogan and Vince McMahon came up with the plan that Hogan and Brutus would be disqualified in their match. Hogan went into the match sporting a cut above a black eye rumored to be caused by a Randy Savage punch after an argument between the two the day before the event. The WWF used Hogan's injury in a storyline that had DiBiase allegedly paying a group of thugs to take Hogan out before WrestleMania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm9/results/|title=WrestleMania IX official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=April 4, 1993[/tpl] Later that night, Hogan won his fifth WWF Championship by pinning Yokozuna only moments after Yokozuna had defeated Bret Hart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454131|title=Hulk Hogan's fifth WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-14[/tpl] McMahon then planned that Hogan and Bret Hart would eventually fight in a big match at Summerslam 1993 in which Hogan would drop the title to Hart. Hogan did not want to drop the title in a clean loss to Hart, due to Hart's size and doubts over whether he could draw. He opted to lose the title to the heel Yokozuna instead. At the first annual King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 13, 1993, Hogan defended the championship against the former champion, Yokozuna, in his first title defense since defeating Yokozuna at WrestleMania IX. Yokozuna kicked out of Hogan's signature leg drop and scored the pinfall after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by a "Japanese photographer" (actually a disguised Harvey Wippleman). This was Hogan's idea as he did not want Yokozuna to gain a clean victory over him. The victorious Yokozuna proceeded to give Hogan a Banzai Drop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html|title=King of the Ring 1993 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=June 13, 1993[/tpl] This was Hogan's last WWF pay-per-view appearance until 2002, as both he and Jimmy Hart were preparing to leave the promotion. Hogan continued his feud on the international house show circuit with Yokozuna until August 1993. After that, Hogan sat out the rest of his contract which expired later that year.
In 1994, Hogan, having received immunity from prosecution, testified in the trial of Vince McMahon relating to shipments of steroids received from Dr. Zahorian by both parties. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used anabolic steroids since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that Vince McMahon had neither sold him the drugs, nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.[tpl]Cite news|last=Keller|first=Wade|newspaper=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=July 18, 1994[/tpl]

===Return to New Japan (1993–1994)===

On May 3, 1993, Hulk Hogan returned to NJPW as WWF Champion, defeating IWGP Heavyweight Champion The Great Muta in a dream match at Wrestling Dontaku 1993. Hogan wrestled against Muta again, under his real name, Keiji Mutoh on September 26, 1993. Hogan also wrestled The Hell Raisers with Muta and Masahiro Chono as his partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994 at Battlefield, when he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami.

===World Championship Wrestling (1994-2000)===

====Early run (1994–1996)====

After Hogan left the WWF in the summer of 1993, he split his time working on movies, television, wrestling in Japan, and spending time with his family. In June 1994, Hogan signed with Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and began appearing on television the next month. Hogan won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in his debut match, defeating Ric Flair in a 'dream' match at Bash at the Beach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411021|title=Hulk Hogan's first WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-14[/tpl] After overcoming the likes of Flair,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#94|title=Halloween Havoc 1994 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=October 23, 1994[/tpl] The Butcher (former partner Brutus Beefcake),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#94|title=Starrcade 1994: Triple Threat results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=December 27, 1994[/tpl] Vader,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#94|title=SuperBrawl V results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=February 19, 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#95|title=Uncensored 1995 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=March 19, 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#95|title=Bash at the Beach 1995 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=July 16, 1995[/tpl] and the Dungeon of Doom[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#95|title=Fall Brawl 1995: WarGames results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=September 17, 1995[/tpl] for the next fifteen months (the longest reign of all time for this championship), Hogan dropped the belt to The Giant at Halloween Havoc 1995 via DQ.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#95|title=Halloween Havoc 1995 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=October 29, 1995[/tpl] Following the controversial loss (which was due to a "contract clause"), the WCW title became vacant.
In early 1996, Hogan continued his feud with The Giant,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VI|title=SuperBrawl VI results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=February 11, 1996[/tpl] before teaming with Randy Savage in a feud with the Alliance to End Hulkamania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#96|title=Uncensored 1996 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=March 24, 1996[/tpl] After coming out victorious from his feuds, Hogan began to only appear occasionally on WCW programming.

====New World Order (1996–1998)====

At Bash at the Beach in 1996, during a six man tag team match pitting The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) against WCW loyalists, Hogan interfered on behalf of Nash and Hall, attacking Randy Savage, thereby turning heel for the first time in nearly fifteen years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/wcw96.htm|title=WCW Show Results 1996|publisher=Angelfire|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=July 7, 1996 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080314150541/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/wcw96.htm  |archivedate = March 14, 2008[/tpl] After the match, Hogan delivered a promo, accosting the fans and WCW for underappreciating his talent and drawing power, and announcing the formation of the New World Order (nWo). The new stable gained prominence in the following weeks and months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/n/nwo-original.html|title=new World order (nWo) Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-14[/tpl] Hogan grew a beard alongside his famous mustache and dyed it black, traded his red and yellow garb in for black and white clothing, often detailed with lightning bolts, and renamed himself Hollywood Hulk Hogan (often shortened to Hollywood Hogan). Hogan returned to WCW programming eight days after his heel turn.
Hogan won his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Hog Wild, defeating The Giant for the title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411038|title=Hulk Hogan's second WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-14[/tpl] He spray painted "nWo" across the title belt, scribbled across the nameplate, and referred to the title as the "nWo title" during this and any other time he held the title while in the nWo. Hogan then started a feud with Lex Luger after Luger and The Giant defeated Hogan and Dennis Rodman in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach.
On the August 4, 1997, episode of Nitro, Hogan lost the WCW title to Luger by submission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/19970804.htm|title=WCW Monday Night Nitro – Monday 08/04/97|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=August 4, 1997[/tpl] Five days later, at Road Wild, Hogan defeated Luger to regain the WCW title and begin his third WCW World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/3044541108|title=Hulk Hogan's third WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-14[/tpl] Hogan then lost the belt to Sting in a match at Starrcade. In the match, WCW's newly contracted Bret Hart accused referee Nick Patrick of fast-counting a victory for Hogan and had the match restarted—with himself as referee. Sting later won by submission. After a rematch the following night, where Sting controversially retained the title, the WCW Championship became vacant. Sting then went on to win the vacant title against Hogan at SuperBrawl VIII.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VIII|title=SuperBrawl VIII results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=February 22, 1998[/tpl]
Hogan then developed a rivalry with former friend (and recent nWo recruit) Randy Savage, who had just cost Hogan the title match at SuperBrawl by hitting him with a spray can. The heat culminated in a steel cage match at Uncensored, which ended in a no contest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#98|title=Uncensored 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=March 15, 1998[/tpl] Savage took the World Championship from Sting at Spring Stampede, while Hogan teamed with Kevin Nash to take on Roddy Piper and The Giant in the first-ever Bat match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/stampede.html#98|title=Spring Stampede 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=April 19, 1998[/tpl] Hogan betrayed Nash by hitting him with the bat and then challenged Savage the following night for his championship. In the no disqualification match for Savage's newly won title, Nash entered the ring and powerbombed Hogan as retribution for the attack the previous night. Bret Hart interfered moments later and turned heel by jumping in to attack Savage and preserve the victory for Hogan, who won his fourth WCW World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411024|title=Hulk Hogan's fourth WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16[/tpl] However, Nash's attack on him signified a split of the nWo into two separate factions—Hogan's became nWo Hollywood and Nash's became nWo Wolfpac—that feuded with each other for the remainder of the year.
Hogan defended the title until July of that year, when WCW booked him in a match against newcomer and then WCW United States Champion Goldberg, who had yet to lose a match in the company. Late in the match, Hogan was distracted by Karl Malone, and Goldberg pinned Hogan to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1998072m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro – Monday, 07/06/98|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=July 6, 1998[/tpl]
Hogan spent the rest of 1998 wrestling celebrity matches. His second tag team match with Dennis Rodman pitted them against Diamond Dallas Page and Karl Malone at Bash at the Beach[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#98|title=Bash at the Beach 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=July 12, 1998[/tpl] and at Road Wild, he and Eric Bischoff lost to Page and Jay Leno thanks to interference from Kevin Eubanks, who leveled Bischoff with a Diamond Cutter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#98|title=Road Wild 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=August 8, 1998[/tpl] Hogan also had a rematch with the Ultimate Warrior at Halloween Havoc, where his nephew Horace aided his victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#98|title=Halloween Havoc 1998 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=October 25, 1998[/tpl]

====Return to WCW (1998-1999)====

On the Thanksgiving episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Hogan officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling, as well as his candidacy for President of the United States.[tpl]cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov27_hogan.html|title=Hollywood Hogan retires|author=John Powell|publisher=SLAM! Sports|accessdate=2007-10-24|date=November 27, 1998[/tpl] Campaign footage aired on Nitro of Hogan and Bischoff holding a press conference, making it appear legitimate. In the long run, however, both announcements were false and merely done as a publicity stunt attempting to draw some of the hype of Jesse Ventura's Minnesota gubernatorial win back to him.
After some time off from WCW, Hogan returned on the January 4, 1999 edition of Nitro to challenge Kevin Nash for the WCW title. Hogan won the match for his fifth WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but many people found the change to be "scandalous".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411037|title=Hulk Hogan's fifth WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16[/tpl] As a result, the warring factions of the nWo reunited into one group, which began feuding with Bill Goldberg and The Four Horsemen.

====Conflicts with Vince Russo (1999–2000)====

He then lost the title to Ric Flair at Uncensored in a Steel Cage First Blood match. A heavily bleeding Flair won via pinfall in a match refereed by Charles Robinson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#99|title=Uncensored 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=March 14, 1999[/tpl] During that match, however, Hogan began to show some signs that a face turn was imminent, showing off some old tactics like his "Hulking up" no-sell. The turn would have to wait, however, as Hogan was severely injured in a Texas Tornado match for the world championship featuring him, Sting, Diamond Dallas Page, and Flair at Spring Stampede[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/stampede.htm |title=Spring Stampede |publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com |accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl]
On the July 12 edition of Nitro, Hogan made his grand return as a full-fledged face and accepted an open challenge from Savage, who had gained the world title at Bash at the Beach the night before in a tag team match by pinning Kevin Nash. Thanks to interference from Nash, Hogan defeated Savage to win his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110315|title=Hulk Hogan's sixth WCW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16[/tpl] Nash turned on him the next week, however, and the two began a feud that lasted until the next pay-per-view.
On August 9, 1999, he started the night dressed in the typical black and white, but after a backstage scene with his son, Hogan came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main-event 6-man tag team match. He then defeated Nash in a retirement match at Road Wild to retain his title. Injuries and frustrations were mounting up however, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Bollea said that he was asked to take time off by newly hired head of creative booking Vince Russo and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at Halloween Havoc, Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (which he had lost to Sting at Fall Brawl the previous month, when Sting beat Hogan by cheating and had turned heel in the process).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#99|title=Fall Brawl 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=September 12, 1999[/tpl] Hogan, however, came to the ring in street clothes, laid down for the pin, and left the ring.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#99|title=Halloween Havoc 1999 results|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=October 24, 1999[/tpl]
Soon after his return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was involved in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000716/ai_n13870868|title=No more Hulkamania? No way|author=Blackjack Brown|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2007-10-22|date=July 16, 2000|archivedate=November 11, 1007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111062336/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000716/ai_n13870868[/tpl] Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo. Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan that he was going to have Jarrett lay down for him, simulating a conflict, although Jarrett wasn't told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett laid down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Title belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW World Title. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the "creative control" clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no.  In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when Hogan knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!"
Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jeff Jarrett later that night. Whether or not the whole incident was a shoot or a work was hotly debated. As a result, Hogan filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Russo soon after,[tpl]cite book|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|author=Eric Bischoff|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn= 1-4165-2729-X|pages=344–346[/tpl] which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims the whole thing was a work, and Hogan claims that Russo made it a shoot.[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_2/ai_67872110|title=Hogan Speaks on Work-shoot|publisher=Wrestling Digest| accessdate=2007-10-25|date=December 2000 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111042536/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_2/ai_67872110  |archivedate = November 11, 2007[/tpl] Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's side of the story when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the title was a work, and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan.
In the months following the eventual demise of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees in order for him to wrestle again. As a test, Hogan worked a match in Orlando, Florida for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation promotion run by his longtime handler Jimmy Hart. Hogan defeated Curt Hennig in this match and felt healthy enough to accept an offer to return to the WWF in February 2002.

===Return to World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===

====Hollywood Hogan and Undisputed WWF/E Champion (2002)====

At No Way Out in 2002, Hogan returned to the company that had made him a pop culture icon. Returning as leader of the original nWo with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, the three got into a confrontation with The Rock and cost Steve Austin a chance at becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion against Chris Jericho in the main event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/nowayout02.htm|title=No Way Out 2002 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=February 17, 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080327162533/http://www.gerweck.net/nowayout02.htm  |archivedate = March 27, 2008[/tpl] The nWo feuded with both Austin and The Rock, and Hogan accepted The Rock's challenge to a match at WrestleMania X8. At the event, Hogan asked Hall and Nash not to interfere, wanting to defeat The Rock by himself. Despite the fact that Hogan was supposed to be the heel in the match, the crowd cheered for him heavily. The Rock cleanly won the contest,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm18/results/|title=WrestleMania X8 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=March 17, 2002[/tpl] but befriended Hogan at the end of the bout and helped him fight off Hall and Nash, who were upset by Hogan's conciliatory attitude.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/wrestlemania18.htm|title=WrestleMania 18 review|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=March 17, 2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080324113713/http://www.gerweck.net/wrestlemania18.htm |archivedate=2008-03-24[/tpl] After the match, Hogan was a definite face again, siding with The Rock, though he continued wearing black and white tights for a few weeks after WrestleMania X8 until he resumed wearing his signature red and yellow tights. During this period, the "Hulk Rules" logo of the 1980s was redone with the text "Hulk Still Rules." Hogan wore the original "Hulk Rules" attire 12 years earlier, when he headlined WrestleMania VI at the same arena, in the SkyDome. For a time, he was still known as "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan, notably keeping the Hollywood Hogan style blond mustache with black beard while wearing Hulkamania-like red and yellow tights and using the "Voodoo Child" theme music he used in WCW. On April 4, Hogan feuded with Triple H and defeated him for the Undisputed WWF Championship and sixth and final WWF Championship at Backlash,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/backlash2002/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan defeats Triple H to become new WWE Undisputed Champion|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=April 21, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445414114|title=Hulk Hogan's sixth WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16[/tpl] thus becoming the last ever WWF champion before the initials dispute against the World Wildlife Fund For Nature.

On the July 4, 2002 edition of SmackDown!, Hogan teamed with Edge to defeat Billy and Chuck and capture the WWE World Tag Team Championship for the first time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413211222|title=Hollywood Hogan and Edge's first World Tag Team Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16[/tpl] They celebrated by waving the American flag as the overjoyed audience sang along to Hogan's theme song "Real American."

Lesnar won by submission (the match was called after Hogan became unconscious from a bear hug hold). Lesnar became only the second WWE Superstar to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), and the first to defeat Hogan by having the match called. Following the match, Lesnar continued to beat on Hogan, leaving him bloody and unconscious in the ring. As a result of Lesnar's assault, Hogan went on hiatus and was not able to return until early 2003, shaving off his black beard and dropping "Hollywood" from his name in his return. He battled The Rock (who had turned heel) once again at No Way Out[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=February 23, 2003[/tpl] and defeated Vince McMahon at WrestleMania XIX in a match billed as "20 years in the making."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|title=WrestleMania XIX official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=March 30, 2003[/tpl]

====Mr. America (2003)====

Later, he had a run as the masked Mr. America. The persona was supposed to be Hulk Hogan in disguise, wearing a mask. He used Hulk Hogan's "Real American" theme music and used all of Hogan's signature gestures, moves, and phrases. He was the subject of a storyline that took place after Hulk Hogan was forced by Vince McMahon to sit out the rest of his contract. After Hogan won at WrestleMania XIX, McMahon was frustrated with him and wanted Hulkamania to die. A WWE pre-debut push took place with mysterious Mr. America promos airing for weeks during SmackDown!. There was also on-screen discussion on SmackDown! between then General Manager Stephanie McMahon and other players concerning her hiring Mr. America "sight unseen." On May 1, Mr. America debuted on SmackDown! on a Piper's Pit segment. McMahon appeared and claimed that Mr. America was Hulk Hogan in disguise; Mr. America shot back by saying, "I am not Hulk Hogan, brother!" (lampooning Hogan's use of "brother" in his promos). The feud continued through the month of May, with a singles match between Mr. America and Hogan's old rival Roddy Piper at Judgment Day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/|title=Judgment Day 2003 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=May 18, 2003[/tpl] McMahon tried desperately to prove that Mr. America was indeed Hulk Hogan but failed at all attempts. Mr. America even passed a lie detector test.
Mr. America's last WWE appearance was on the June 26 edition of SmackDown! when The Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) defeated the team of Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match when Show pinned Mr. America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030626.html|title=SmackDown! results – June 26, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=June 26, 2003[/tpl] After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hulk Hogan, putting his finger to his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team.[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20030706/ai_n12510640|title=No Hulk means no chance of 20th anniversary rematch|author=Blackjack Brown|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=July 6, 2003|accessdate=2007-10-23|archivedate=November 11, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111062341/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20030706/ai_n12510640[/tpl] On the July 3 edition of SmackDown!, Vince McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and "fired" him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. The Mr. America gimmick came under fire briefly from Marvel Comics, who anointed it a rip-off of Captain America, citing costume similarity; the single star on the mask was also a trademark on Captain America's chest piece. This was also adding fuel to the fire over the rights to use the Hulk Hogan name because of Marvel's ownership of the Incredible Hulk character. Because of these problems, WWE was forced to edit out all references to the "Hulk Hogan" name, including pictures which featured Hogan wearing memorabilia that said "Hulk" (a majority of them) and started to refer to Hogan under the "Hollywood Hogan" name he used in WCW. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract, and Hogan left WWE in 2003.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)===

Shortly after Hogan left WWE, TNA Wrestling began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in Jeff Jarrett, co-founder of TNA and then NWA World Heavyweight champion, launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan in October 2003. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA title at TNA's first three-hour pay-per-view. However, due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA. Still, the incident has been shown several times on TNA broadcasts, and was included in the TNA DVD TNA's Fifty Greatest Moments.

===Return to WWE (2005–2007)===

In 2005, weeks before WrestleMania 21, it was announced on all WWE programming that Hogan would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. On April 2, Hogan was inducted by actor and friend Sylvester Stallone.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050322/ai_n13453252|title=Stallone set to induct Hulk Hogan into hall|publisher=Deseret News (Salt Lake City)|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=March 22, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090224124834/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050322/ai_n13453252|archivedate=February 24, 2009[/tpl] Hogan was applauded for several minutes before he was able to make a speech. When he paused during his speech, the crowd chanted "One More Match! One More Match!" The fans also chanted "Austin, Hogan" (referring to a Steve Austin vs. Hulk Hogan match); Hogan responded "that may be a good match someday". At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Hogan came out to rescue Eugene, who was being attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Khosrow Daivari. Some of the build-up to Hogan's induction into the Hall of Fame and preparation for this angle were shown on the first season of Hogan Knows Best.
The next night on Raw, Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week, Michaels approached Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused but told Michaels if he found a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan to come back and team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, and saved Michaels and accepted his offer. At Backlash 2005, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels.[tpl]cite news|first=Scott|last=Zerr|title=Hogan thrilled to be retro|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/05/01/1021236.html|publisher=SLAM!

Hogan then appeared on July 4 edition of Raw as the special guest of Carlito on his talk-show segment Carlito's Cabana. After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke Hogan, Hogan proceeded to attack Carlito. This was then followed up by an appearance of Kurt Angle, who made comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan. Hogan was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle but was saved by Shawn Michaels. Later that night, Michaels and Hogan defeated Carlito and Kurt Angle in a tag match. During the post match celebration, Michaels delivered Sweet Chin Music to Hogan and walked off.[tpl]cite news|title= Heartbreaker|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07042005/| publisher=WWE|date=July 4, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl] The following week on Raw, Michaels appeared on Piper's Pit and challenged Hogan to face him one-on-one for the first time.[tpl]cite news|title=HBK challenges Hogan for SummerSlam|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/raw/200507/11hbkchallenge|publisher=WWE|date=July 11, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl] Hogan appeared on Raw one week later and accepted the challenge.[tpl]cite news|title=Cena overcomes the odds|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07182005/|publisher=WWE|date=July 18, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-22[/tpl] The match took place at SummerSlam. The "Legend vs. Icon" storyline was the main event for the Raw brand going into SummerSlam. The match went back and forth, with two referees getting knocked out and Michaels using a steel chair to try to gain an advantage. Even after Michaels hit his Sweet Chin Music, Hogan still kicked out and mounted some offense against Michaels, finally hitting him with the legdrop and scoring the victory. Michaels extended his hand to him, telling him that he "had to find out for himself," and Hogan and Michaels shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2005/mainevent/|title=Legend vs. Icon: Shawn Michaels vs. Hulk Hogan|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=August 21, 2005[/tpl]
Prior to WrestleMania 22, Hogan inducted friend and former announcer "Mean" Gene Okerlund into the WWE Hall of Fame. Hogan returned on the July 15, 2006 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event with his daughter Brooke. During the show, Randy Orton flirted (kayfabe, as he was engaged to his former wife, Sam Speno, at the time) with Hogan's daughter, and later attacked Hogan in the parking lot and hit the RKO onto the trunk of Hogan's car.[tpl]cite web|first=Jen|last=Hunt|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/july152006/matches/258159821/results/|title=Summer slammed|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=July 15, 2006[/tpl] He later challenged Hulk to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan won.[tpl]cite web|first=Zack|last=Zeigler|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2006/matches/2944490/results/|title=The Legend lives on|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-16|date=August 20, 2006[/tpl] In regards to the public reaction to Summerslam, and his treatment as an employee, he said:
[tpl]cquote|Last year at SummerSlam, I fought Randy Orton—and me and Vince had some problems with the money. Before SummerSlam, I was a little worried because instead of being a main event match I was on fourth against Randy Orton. When I heard about the first three matches at the Fleet Center in Boston, it sounded like a funeral. And when I listened to the crowd reactions to those matches, it did sound like a funeral. Then, when my music came on it was like the old days, people were stood up. It was electric. Randy is a great hard working wrestler and we fought an old school style match. That was the most exciting match I've ever had in the Fleet Centre. I wrestled Steve Borden in a cage, which was a great match in my opinion at least, but this one was better; as after second-guessing I was like 'Oh my god, it still works'. Then Vince went out with his son and wrestled Triple H and Shawn Michaels and it was dead again. Cena went on for the main event, and people started leaving.[tpl]cite news|last=Simon |first=By |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article256127.ece#ixzz0ZQOrAjLE |title=Hulk: I'll defeat desperate Vince | The Sun |Sport|Wrestling |publisher=The Sun |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-21 |location=London[/tpl][/tpl]
He also spoke extensively on his payment, and his concerns of not being a top priority to Vince McMahon, despite the fact that he felt he was the company's biggest draw:
Hogan appeared next on December 10, 2007 at the WWE Raw 15th anniversary where he saved Hornswoggle from being attacked by The Great Khali.

===Memphis Wrestling and PMG Clash of Legends (2007)===

After a brief fall out with McMahon and WWE,[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070325/ai_n18756946|title=Hogan pitches old-timers' tour|author=Blackjack Brown|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=March 25, 2007|archivedate=November 11, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111062346/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070325/ai_n18756946[/tpl] Hogan was lured to Memphis Wrestling with the proposal of wrestling Jerry Lawler.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070415/ai_n19013656|title=WWE derails Lawler vs. Hogan|author=Blackjack Brown|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2007-10-24|date=April 15, 2007|archivedate=November 11, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111062406/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070415/ai_n19013656[/tpl] The match had been promoted on Memphis Wrestling Prime Time for several months. On April 12, 2007, however, Lawler announced in a news conference that WWE had barred him from wrestling Hogan on the basis that NBC performers (including Lawler, on the basis of co-hosting the NBC-owned USA Network's WWE Raw and his appearances on the biannual WWE Saturday Night's Main Event) are contractually prohibited from appearing on VH1, the channel on which Hogan Knows Best airs. The situation resulted in a lawsuit being filed against WWE by event promoter Corey Maclin.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.memphisdailynews.com/Editorial/StoryLead.aspx?id=100606|title=Memphis Promoter Files Suit Against WWE|first=Bill|last=Dries|publisher=Memphis Daily News|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-01-11[/tpl] Lawler was replaced with Paul Wight.

===Return to TNA Wrestling (2009-2013)===

====Dixie Carter's business partner (2009–2010)====

On October 27, 2009 it was announced on TNAwrestling.com that Hulk Hogan had signed a contract to join TNA on a full-time basis where, partnered with Eric Bischoff, he would partner with TNA President, Dixie Carter. The footage of his signing and the press conference in the Madison Square Garden following it were featured on the October 29 episode of TNA Impact!. His role remained uncertain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_36498.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Impact Report 10/29: Examining the Hulk Hogan announcement, Sabin controversy, Wolfe vs. Angle, Joe-Styles-Daniels hype|date=November 3, 2009|last=Keller|first=Wade|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl]
On November 21, 24, 26, and 28, Hogan performed with a group of wrestlers including Spartan-3000, Heidenreich, Eugene, Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake and Orlando Jordan across Australia in a tour titled Hulkamania: Let the Battle Begin. The main event of each show was a rematch between Hogan and Ric Flair—the wrestler who defeated Hogan more times than any other. Hogan defeated Flair in all four matches, bringing his career record against Flair from 2–8 to 6–8.[tpl]cite web|url=http://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=HulkAMAN09&v=SSD&searchId=278c866e-8461-4b0c-a20c-082bfcf71b96 |title=Hulkamania: Let the Battle Begin |publisher=Tickettek |accessdate=2009-11-05[/tpl] It was the first time Hogan had performed in Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/Hulk-hogan-downs-ric-flair-in-burswood-bout/story-e6frg13u-1225803762480|title=Hulk Hogan downs Ric Flair in Burswood bout|date=November 25, 2009|last=Elborough|first=Brad|publisher=Perth Now[/tpl]

On the January 4, 2010 Impact!, Hogan debuted after a motorcade arrival reuniting briefly with former nWo partners Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman, the latter two of whom made their returns to the company. He, however, refused to join them for a full-fledged reunion of their group claiming, "it's a different time", and stuck to his business relations with Bischoff, who made his appearance to declare that, the two of them would "flip the company upside down" and everyone would have to earn their spot. Hogan also encountered TNA Founder, Jeff Jarrett on the broadcast, appearing via video wall and interrupting Jarrett's company success speech, stating that Carter was instrumental to the company's survival, and that just like the rest, Jarrett would have to (kayfabe) earn his spot in TNA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_37861.shtml|title=KELLER'S TNA IMPACT LIVE REPORT 1/4: Jeff Hardy, NWO reunion, Hulk Hogan, TNA Knockout Title match, more surprises – ongoing coverage|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=January 4, 2010|work=PWTorch|accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl]

In an interview on the The Tonight Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Bollea claimed that the George Foreman Grill was originally offered to him, but he failed to respond in time, and George Foreman endorsed the grill instead. Bollea endorsed a blender, known as the Hulk Hogan Thunder Mixer. This claim was confirmed on an episode of Hogan Knows Best, in which his wife Linda and the family are worried about Hogan's wrestling career and plead with him to take up a career in marketing."Twilight of A God". ''Hogan Knows Best. May 7, 2006. No. 8, season 2. Hogan explains about turning down the Foreman grill, and his choice to invest in the shake-mixer instead, saying that whenever he thinks about investing in something "big," he thinks about what happened with the grill and the shake-mixer. However, he has since endorsed an indoor grill known as "The Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill."

==Personal life==

On March 27, 1985, just days prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, Richard Belzer requested on his cable TV talk show Hot Properties that Hulk Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified Guillotine choke, which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court; the settlement was rumored at $1.5 million. On October 20, 2006, on Bubba the Love Sponge, it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008 appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio's The Howard Stern Show, Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

Nick pleaded no contest and was sentenced to eight months in prison on May 9, 2008.[tpl]cite web|last=Dagostino |first=Mark |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20198974,00.html |title=Nick Bollea Gets Eight Months Jail for Injury Accident |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl]

On January 2013, Bollea filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, citing that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen "unnecessary and ineffective" spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. After the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Bollea underwent a traditional spinal fusion surgery on December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements without his permission.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/hulk-hogan-wrestles-with-laser-spine-center-in-lawsuit.html |title=Hulk Hogan Wrestles with Laser Spine Center in Lawsuit |author=Armstrong, David |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl]
