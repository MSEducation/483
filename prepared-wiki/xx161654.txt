The Flora Lamson Hewlett Library houses one of the largest collections of theological books in the United States. 
The building's distinctive, terraced design was based on preliminary sketches by famed architect Louis I. Kahn.http://library.gtu.edu/library/information/library-history
In addition to housing one of the largest collections of theological books in the United States, the library is home to archives of material recording religious activity in the United States and a Center for Teaching and Learning. The library serves the nine-member schools of the Berkeley, California-based Graduate Theological Union (GTU).
After Kahn's unexpected death in 1974, the GTU selected the San Francisco, California-based architectural firm of Peters, Clayberg, and Caulfield, in association with Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis, to design the building. Thomas J. Caulfield was appointed lead architect.
Built in phases, construction on the building's first phase began in 1979, and it opened in 1981. The final phase of the building was completed in 1987.
The library was named for Flora Lamson Hewlett, wife of Hewlett-Packard founder William Hewlett, thanks to support for the project from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
