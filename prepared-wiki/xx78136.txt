[[Flag of Eritrea]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Eritrea, Flags of Africa

The current flag of Eritrea was adopted on May 24, 1993. It uses the basic layout of the flag of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. The wreath with upright olive branch symbol was derived from the 1952 flag.

==History and symbolism==

The flag is dominated by a red triangle extending from the hoist to the fly, with complementary green and blue triangles above and below. Green stands for the fertility of the country; blue stands for the sea (Red Sea); and red for the blood lost in the fight for freedom. In the red triangle, a gold wreath symbol with 14 leaves on each side derived from the 1952 flag replaces the gold star of the EPLF flag.
