==History==

Toohey's dates from 1869, when John Thomas Toohey (an Irish immigrant to Melbourne) obtained his brewing license.  John Thomas Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited, and commenced brewing lager (the present day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe, where it is currently sited.Tooheys New :: For the Love of Beer  In 1967, Tooheys bought competitor Miller's Brewers located in Tavener's Hill, closing the brewery in 1975.Keith Deutsher The Breweries of Australia: A History.

Lion Nathan acquired 50% stake in Bond's Natbrew Holdings in 1990, and took total ownership in 1992.  As of 2007, Tooheys Pty. Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lion Nathan. 
Production of Hahn-branded beers was moved from the Camperdown Hahn Brewery to Tooheys, some time between 1993 (Lion Nathan's acquisition of Hahn) and 19991998, according to A Quiet Beer with Chuck Hahn; 1999 according to Lion Nathan History (when Hahn Brewery was renamed Malt Shovel Brewery).
