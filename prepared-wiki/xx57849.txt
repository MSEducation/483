The University of Oregon (UO) is a public, coeducational research university in Eugene, Oregon, United States. UO was founded in 1876 and graduated its first class two years later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uoregon.edu/our-history |title=University of Oregon: Our History |publisher=Uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl] The Carnegie Foundation classifies the University of Oregon as a Tier 1 RU/VH (very high research activity) university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uonews.uoregon.edu//archive/news-release/2011/1/uo-improves-top-tier-us-research-institutions |title=UO improves into top tier of U.S. research institutions |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2011[/tpl] It is one of 108 universities to have such a designation.

==History==

===The  years===

The Oregon State Legislature established the university on October 12, 1872, despite the new state's funding woes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://anniversary.uoregon.edu/history/index.html |title=125th Anniversary: History of the University of Oregon; Early History |publisher=Anniversary.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] The residents of Eugene struggled to help finance the institution, holding numerous fundraising events such as strawberry festivals, church socials, and produce sales. In total they raised $27,500, enough to buy eighteen acres of land at a cost of $2500.[tpl]cite journal|last=Walton|first=J.J.|title=A Brief History of the Establishment and Location of the University of Oregon at Eugene|journal=The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society|date=1 Jun 1906|year=1906|volume=7|page=150|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-20609687/20609687#page/n6/mode/1up|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]   The doors officially opened in 1876, with Deady Hall its sole building. The first year of enrollment contained 155 students taught by five faculty members. The first graduating class was in 1878, graduating five students. In 1881, the university was nearly closed, it was $8,000 in debt before Henry Villard donated $7,000 toward to help pay for the debt. In 1913, and again in 1932, there were proposals to merge the university with what is now referred to as Oregon State University. Evidently, both proposals were defeated.

===Maturity as a university===

During Prince Lucien Campbell's tenure as president from 1902 to 1925, the university experienced tremendous growth compared to its early years. The budget, enrollment, facilities, and faculty members all grew several times
its amount prior to his presidency. Numerous schools were also established during his tenure, including the School of Music in 1902, the School of Education in 1910, the School of Architecture, the College of Business in 1914, the School of Law in 1915, the School of Journalism in 1916, and the School of Health and Physical Education in 1920.
However, the University of Oregon lost its School of Engineering to Oregon Agricultural College, now known as Oregon State University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://anniversary.uoregon.edu/history/index.html |title=125th Anniversary: History of the University of Oregon; University Boom |publisher=Anniversary.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]
The Zorn-MacPherson Bill in 1932 proposed that the University of Oregon and Oregon State College (now "University"), to be merged into one university. The bill lost in a landslide vote of over 6 to 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/archive/mss/zorn_macpherson_des.html |title=Zorn-Macpherson Bill Collection, 1926–1932 |publisher=Osulibrary.oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] The University of Oregon Medical School was originally founded in 1887 in Portland and later merged with Willamette University's program in 1913. However, in 1974 it officially became an independent institution known as Oregon Health Sciences University.[tpl]cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2006/02/05/News/Uo.Considers.New.Medical.School-1965052.shtml |title= UO considers new medical school |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |last=Sylwester |first=Eva |date=2006-02-05 |publisher=Oregon Daily Emerald[/tpl] In 1969, the UO was admitted into the Association of American Universities.

===Push for independence and growth===

The University occupies 80 buildings.  However, there are also many ongoing construction projects, which are expected to help accommodate an increase in total undergraduate enrollment.
In reaction to a growing movement to establish an independent university board, the Oregon Legislature in 2013 passed SB 270, requiring local governing boards for the state's three largest institutions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2013/SB270/|newspaper=The Oregonian[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Independent board|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2012/01/university_of_oregon_interim_p.html|accessdate=18 February 2012 | work=The Oregonian|date=2012-01-20[/tpl] This means that effective July 1, 2014, the University of Oregon will be an independent public body governed by the Board of Trustees of the University of Oregon. The Trustees will have broad authority to supervise and manage the University and may exercise all of the powers, rights, duties and privileges expressly granted by law or that are implied by law or are incident to the Board's powers, rights, duties and privileges.[tpl]cite web|first=Board of Trustees|url=http://trustees.uoregon.edu/|publisher=University of Oregon[/tpl]
Proponents of local governing boards believe an independent board will give the university more autonomy, and free it from relying on inadequate state funding. Additionally, it is believed that an independent board will help pave the way for a new $1.6 billion endowment.[tpl]cite web|title=Help or get out of the way|url=http://special.registerguard.com/web/opinion/25976885-47/lariviere-state-university-oregon-endowment.html.csp|publisher=The Register Guard|accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl]
On March 31, 2012, a Political Action Committee called Oregonians For Higher Education Excellence was formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[tpl]cite web|last=Brown|first=Kate|title=Oregonians For Higher Education Excellence|url=https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/cneSearch.do?cneSearchButtonName=search&cneSearchFilerCommitteeId=15708|publisher=Oregon Secretary of State|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] As of May 23, 2012, the organization has raised over $320,000. Notable contributors to the PAC include, Phil Knight, Patrick Kilkenny, and Tim Boyle. According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in autonomy at the University of Oregon.[tpl]cite web|last=Jaquiss|first=Nigel|title=New Political Action Committee Will Focus on Higher Ed|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-28595-new_political_action_committee_will_focus_on_highe.html|publisher=Willamette Week|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]

==Institution==

===Colleges and schools===

The University of Oregon is organized into eight schools and colleges—six professional schools and colleges, an Arts and Sciences College and an Honors College.

====School of Architecture and Allied Arts====

The School of Architecture and Allied Arts (called "triple-A" or "AAA") was founded by Ellis F. Lawrence in 1914.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aaa.uoregon.edu/info/ |title=About the University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts |publisher=Aaa.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]  The school offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in architecture, art, including digital arts, arts and administration, art history, interior architecture, landscape architecture, and planning, public policy and management, and product design, a graduate degree in historic preservation. The school also offers an architectural program, digital arts program, and product design program in Portland, Oregon.
The school offers the only accredited degree in architecture, landscape architecture, and interior architecture in Oregon. The National Architectural Accrediting Board accredits both the undergraduate bachelor of architecture five-year degree and the master of architecture. Other nationally accredited degrees include the planning and public administration, landscape architecture, and interior architecture programs. The undergraduate architecture program is consistently ranked among the highest in the country, and is currently ranked as the #1 public program for "Sustainable Design Practice and Principles" by DesignIntelligence magazine.

====College of Arts and Sciences====

====College of Education====

The College of Education was established in 1896 as a branch of the Department of Philosophy and later merged with the Department of Science and Arts in 1900. It wasn't until 1910 that the School of Education was established as an independent college. In 1908, this college was accredited by the Northwest Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://education.uoregon.edu/feature.htm?id=1102 |title=University of Oregon, College of Education: : |publisher=Education.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] According to the U.S. News & World Report 2009 edition of "America’s Best Graduate Schools," the College of Education ranked 4th overall and 1st among public universities.[tpl]cite web|url= http://news.opb.org/article/4842-university-oregon-grad-schools-rank-high/ |title= University Of Oregon Grad Schools Rank High |accessdate=April 24, 2009 |last=Kellner |first=Angela |date=2009-04-23 |publisher=OPB News[/tpl] For the 4th consecutive year, the UO special education program ranked third in the nation.

=====Oregon Bach Festival=====

The UO is the home of the Oregon Bach Festival, a donor-supported program of the University and the only major music festival affiliated with an American university. Founded in 1970 by German conductor Helmuth Rilling and UO professor (and past president of the American Choral Directors Association) Royce Saltzman, the festival has grown into an international program that draws hundreds of musicians and over 40,000 attendees annually.  The festival's focus is choral and orchestral music, and it hosts a professional choir and orchestra each year to perform major works by Bach and other composers; it also sponsors a master class in conducting that draws participants from around the world.
The festival has presented such artists as Frederica von Stade, Bobby McFerrin, Garrison Keillor, and Thomas Quasthoff, who made his American debut in Eugene in 1995.  The festival actively commissions and premieres new choral-orchestra works, including pieces by Arvo Pärt, Osvaldo Golijov, and Tan Dun.  A Bach Festival recording of the world-premiere performance of Krzyztof Penderecki's Credo won the 2001 Grammy Award for best choral performance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://old.thedailystar.com/news/stories/2001/02/22/grammy.html |title=The Daily Star – Online Edition |publisher=Old.thedailystar.com |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]

===Research institutes===

====Institute of Molecular Biology====

Oregon's Institute of Molecular Biology, founded in 1959, is one of the first of the University's research institutes and, possibly, its most illustrious. It was conceived by University of Oregon physical biochemist Terrell Hill, who recognized the future of biology studied at the molecular level, and, at the same time, recognized that the interdisciplinary nature of these studies would require an administrative unit that could transcend the parochial interests of the classical departments of Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Rather than creating a Department of Molecular Biology, the University opted for an interdisciplinary research institute, in which the appointees would exercise their research responsibilities through the Graduate School and their formal teaching within an existing department of the (then) College of Liberal Arts.
Following Hill's advice, the University sought to attract a Director by offering a five-member institute to be molded according to the Directors taste. These appointments would be subject to veto by the College department only on the basis of scientific competence but never on the basis of the appointees area of research.  Aaron Novick, a physical chemist with post-war interests in the genetics of bacteria, took the bait and quickly filled the four other positions, two of them with young biologists (Frank Stahl and George Sreisinger) working with bacteriophage T4 at a time when bacteriophages were too chemical for a typical biology department and too biological for a typical chemistry department. This small group gained sufficient recognition to initiate an expansion of the Institute to its present size of 19 faculty.
Streisinger's subsequent development of the zebrafish as a model organism for the study of vertebrate development is cited as an outstanding accomplishment of an Institute noted for many accomplishments, including those of Peter von Hippel, Brian Matthews, John Schellman, Vicki Chandler, Ira Herskowitz and Eric Selker, who, like Stahl and Streisinger, are, or were, members of the National Academy of Sciences. An identifiable factor in the Institute's success is its organization as a commune, in which resources are shared among the several laboratories.

==Internal university governance==

The internal governance of the university is conducted in accordance with The Constitution of the University of Oregon. The UO Constitution provides a collaborative process that ensures a strong voice for the faculty, acting through the University Senate. The representation of students, civil servants, and administrative employees in the senate ensures that this predominantly faculty body operates in the best interests of the entire university community.

==Campus==

thumb|Lillis Complex (University of Oregon) The campus is spread over [tpl]convert|295|acre|ha[/tpl] and holds sixty major buildings,About the UO – University of Oregon[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] as well as providing a home for more than 500 varieties of trees.[tpl]cite book |author=Office of University Planning |title=University of Oregon Atlas of Trees |year=1996 |publisher=University of Oregon Books |isbn=0-87114-293-7[/tpl] Eugene is located near many prominent geographic features such as the Willamette River, Cascade Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Also within a two-hour drive is the Portland metropolitan area.
Based on Ellis F. Lawrence's vision, many of the university's buildings are planned around several major quadrangles, many of which abut the 13th Avenue pedestrian mall.http://www.uoregon.edu/~uplan/CampusPlan/CampusPlan1991/1991_LRDPIntro.pdf (PDF) [tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] The university is known for being the site of a pioneering participatory planning experiment known as the Oregon Experiment, which is also the subject of a book of the same name that evolved into the well known book A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander. The two major principles of the project are that buildings should be designed, in part, by the people who will ultimately use them with the help of an "architect facilitator", and that construction should occur over many small projects as opposed to a few large ones.
Although academic buildings are spread throughout the campus, the majority are located along East 13th Avenue, with heavy pedestrian traffic at the intersection with Kincaid Street.[tpl]cite web | first = Trevor | last = Davis | title = Could Hilyard be safer? | publisher = Oregon Daily Emerald | date = April 26, 2007 | url = http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&ustory_id=656e547a-4144-439d-a0c8-cba8ddcbcef7 | accessdate = 2008-02-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301190600/http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&ustory_id=656e547a-4144-439d-a0c8-cba8ddcbcef7  |archivedate = 2008-03-01[/tpl] Student recreation and union centers are located toward the center of the campus, with residence halls on the east side of campus. Sports facilities are grouped in the southern-central part of campus with the Autzen Stadium and PK Park complexes across the Willamette River. The university also owns and operates several satellite facilities, including a large facility in the White Stag Block of downtown Portland.

===Old campus and memorial quad===

The oldest section of campus is located in the northwest area of the current campus. The university’s first building, Deady Hall, opened on October 16, 1876, when the University had an enrollment of 177 students. It was originally known as “the building” before being named after Judge Matthew Deady in 1893. The second building on campus is known as Villard Hall and is home to the Theater Arts and Comparative Literature Departments. Completed in 1886, the hall was named after railroad magnate Henry Villard, who provided financial aid to the university in 1881. Before its naming, it was known as “the new building.” Both Deady and Villard Halls were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1977.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1260&ResourceType=Building| title=National Historic Landmarks Program/ Deady & Villard Halls | accessdate= 2007-11-27[/tpl]
Just south of Old Campus is the Memorial Quad, which runs north and south along Kincaid Street, capped at both ends by the main campus library, Knight Library, on the south side, and the Lillis Business Complex on the north. It is flanked on the west by the tallest building on campus, Prince Lucien Campbell Hall, also known as “PLC,”, Condon Hall on the west, housing the Geography department, and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art on the east, which was remodeled and reopened on January 23, 2005. Also adjacent to Memorial Quad is Chapman Hall, which houses the Robert D. Clark Honors College.

===Central campus===

The center of campus houses a mixture of academic buildings, an administration building, and student recreation buildings. Just to the east of Memorial Quad, facing 13th Avenue is Johnson Hall where offices for higher administration and trustee offices are found, including the offices of the University President. Directly across 13th Avenue, facing Johnson Hall is "The Pioneer" a statue of a bearded, buckskin-clad pioneer cast in bronze by sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor in 1919.[tpl]cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Outdoor Sculpture & Building Ornamentation | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/xpioneer.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25[/tpl] In 1932, Proctor's "Pioneer Mother" statue was dedicated in the Women's Memorial Quadrangle on the other side of Johnson Hall; the two statues are aligned so that they can "see" one another through the large windows of the hall's main floor.
Lawrence Hall is located at the end of hardscape walkway, directly north of the intersection of 13th Avenue and University Street. It houses the School of Architecture and Allied Arts and is named after its first Dean, Ellis F. Lawrence in 1957.[tpl]cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Lawrence Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/lawrence.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25[/tpl] Allen Hall, opened in 1954, is located adjacent to Lawrence Hall and houses the School of Journalism and Communication.[tpl]cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Allen Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/allen.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25[/tpl]
Additionally, Erb Memorial Union and the recreation center are situated in this part of campus.

===Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex and east campus===

thumb|Willamette Hall, the centerpiece of the Physics departmentThe Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex comprises multiple science buildings to the east of Lawrence Hall, on the north side of 13th Avenue. Willamette Hall's Paul Olum Atrium is the center of the university's hard sciences complex. The construction of the $45.6 million additions of Willamette Hall, home of the physics department; Cascade, home of the geology department; Deschutes Hall, home of the computer science department; and Streisinger Halls to the complex was completed in 1989.[tpl]cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Willamette Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/willamette.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25[/tpl]
Within the Lokey Science Complex are two facilities focused on integrative science.UO Integrative Science One is the Lokey Laboratories, which is a shared-use facility with state-of-the-art characterization instrumentation. Lokey Laboratories is associated with the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) and was dedicated to Lorry I. Lokey on February 19, 2008 for his $25 million donation toward the project.  It is located underground, beneath the quad between Heustis and Deschutes Halls, to minimize vibrations.

===Other areas and satellites===

The controversialPittman, Alan (14 January 2010). "Park or parking lot?" Eugene Weekly. Riverfront Research Park is a small facility maintained by the university, located across Franklin Boulevard from the main campus, next to the Willamette River. The park is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, and it is the home of the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), the zebrafish model organism database. Local controversy has existed since before the development and approval of the site master plan by the City of Eugene in 1989. Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River. The University and Student Senates have each passed resolutions [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] against construction on the banks of the Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist. In March 2010, the issue of a conditional use permit extension for the Research Park was appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals by a group of citizens, students, and faculty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.connectingeugene.org |title=Connecting Eugene |publisher=Connecting Eugene |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]
The complex for the Ducks football and baseball team is located north across the Willamette River.

==Student life and culture==

===Representation===

The Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO) is the student government at the University of Oregon.  It is a non-profit organization funded by the University of Oregon. Its purpose is to provide for the social, cultural, educational and physical development of its members, and for the advancement of their individual and collective interests both within and without the University. The ASUO is the student government and is run by students for students and works on campus-, city-, state-, and federal-level campaigns. Membership consists of all students at the University of Oregon, who have paid the current term or semester student incidental fee.ASUO About Page, Associated Students of the University of Oregon website, University of Oregon.
Additionally, the Erb Memorial Union (EMU) board of directors is responsible for making general policy decisions and long-range plans for the operation of the EMU. The board allocates the EMU's multi-million dollar budget, assigns space for student groups and advises staff in the management of the EMU. The sixteen-member board consists of twelve students (seven elected in a campus-wide election and five direct appointments from either EMU programs or the ASUO), three faculty members appointed by the University of Oregon President and one EMU staff member elected by their peers.EMU Board Page, Erb Memorial Union website, University of Oregon.
Every fiscal year, the EMU Board prepares a benchmark increase to the ASUO Senate for approval. After the benchmark process, the EMU presents its final budget to the senate, requesting a decrease, increase, or no change in incidental fees to be allocated to the EMU.  If the budget request is approved, the budget must be signed by the ASUO President and then the UO President. Unlike the budget process, any general policy decisions by the EMU Board do not require senate oversight or approval.
Student participation in governance of the university extends to membership in the University Senate, which has five student members with full voting rights plus the ASUO President as a nonvoting member. Students are also represented on the university's Board of Trustees by a voting member appointed by the Governor of Oregon.

====Media====

The University of Oregon has a diverse array of student-run and student-created media, including the Daily Emerald,  the Oregon Commentator, and Ethos Magazine among others[tpl]cite web|url=http://emu.uoregon.edu/index_html.php |title=EMU: Student Media |publisher=Emu.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]
The Libraries' Educational Video Group maintains the UO Channe, which uses streaming media to provide access to campus lectures, interviews, performances, symposia, and documentary productions.
The University is also home of two radio stations: KWAX (classical music) and KWVA (campus radio).

====Forensics====

In addition to its athletic teams, the university also has a competitive intercollegiate Speech and Debate team. The University of Oregon Forensics program was founded in 1876, at the same time as the university. Initially the program consisted of two student-formed forensic societies, which developed into "doughnut league" inter-dorm competitions in the 1890s. In 1891, the UO began intercollegiate competition. Forensics continued to grow as a staple of the university's community and by 1911, the team was so successful that it began charging admission to debates. Money raised during these events was often donated to the fledgling University of Oregon football program.
Parliamentary debate was integrated into UO Forensics in 1998–99 and the team has been competitive since. In 2001, the UO's Alan Tauber and Heidi Ford claimed a national title, winning the first ever National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE).  In 2011, the team of Matt Gander and Hank Fields claimed both national titles, winning the NPTE and the National Parliamentary Debate Association Championship, coached by Thomas Schally, Benjamin Dodds, Sarah Hamid, and Will Chamberlain.

====Traditions====

==Athletics==

The University of Oregon is a member of the Pacific-12 Conference and the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision of the NCAA. The athletic programs have garnered 21 NCAA team championships,Schools with the Most NCAA Championships[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] as well as 60 NCAA individual champions in various track and field events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportshistory.uoregon.edu/details/show/6 |title=Leadership and Legacy – Athletics and the University of Oregon | Topics |publisher=Sportshistory.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] The two primary rivals of the Oregon Ducks football team are the Washington Huskies and the Oregon State Beavers. The football rivalry with Oregon State University, known as the "Civil War", is one of the nation's oldest. Every year, the two teams face off in the last game of the regular season. The two teams have faced each other nearly every year since 1894 with the exception of five years. Games were not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/index.aspx?sid=359&gid=1&pgid=454 |title=OSU Alumni Association – Greatest Civil War |publisher=Osualum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]
The university competes in 14 sports: football, men’s and women’s basketball, cross country, track and field, baseball, softball, men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s golf, women’s soccer, women’s lacrosse, women’s volleyball, and acrobatics & tumbling. This does not include club sports which competes at the Division I level in Rugby, Soccer, Rowing, and Waterpolo. As well as women's Division I club athletics in Rowing, Rugby, and Waterpolo.
With 20 NCAA championships between them, cross country and track and field are the two programs at the university that have enjoyed the most success. The programs have produced many world-class athletes including Steve Prefontaine and Alberto Salazar. Nike had been formed by the former track and field head coach Bill Bowerman and former University of Oregon track runner Phil Knight. The successes of the programs have given the name of Track Town, USA to Eugene.
Created in 1893, the football team played its first game in 1894 and won its first Rose Bowl in 1917 against the University of Pennsylvania. The 1938–39 men's basketball team, nicknamed the “Tall Firs,” won the first-ever NCAA basketball tournament by defeating Ohio State in the March 28, 1939 championship game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportshistory.uoregon.edu/timeline |title=Leadership and Legacy – Athletics and the University of Oregon | Timeline |publisher=Sportshistory.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]
Originally recognized as an official sport at the university in 1908, baseball was disbanded in 1981 due to concerns with Title IX. In 2007, the athletic director Patrick Kilkenny announced plans to reinstate baseball and to drop wrestling while adding women’s acrobatics & tumbling.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

===Mascot===

The mascot of the University of Oregon is the fighting duck. The popular Disney character Donald Duck has been the mascot for decades, thanks to a handshake agreement made between then-Athletic Director Leo Harris and Walt Disney in 1947.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=28746&SPID=252&DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=153778 |title=The Duck – GoDucks.com—The University of Oregon Official Athletics Web Site |publisher=Goducks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] The mascot has been challenged more than a few times in its lifetime. The first came in 1966 when Walt Disney died and the company realized there was no formal contract written for the use of Donald’s image. A formal contract was written up in 1973. Potential heirs "Mallard Drake" and "Mandrake" challenged Donald’s position in 1978 and 2003 respectively,[tpl]cite web|url=http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2002/11/15/News/One-Duck.or.Two.part.1-1978791.shtml|title=One duck...or two?|last=Schmidt|first=Brad|date=November 15, 2002|accessdate=2008-02-26|work=Oregon Daily Emerald[/tpl] but both were unpopular and discontinued.

===Song===

The fight song is "Mighty Oregon", written by professor Albert Perfect and student John DeWitt Gilbert in 1916. It has undergone several changes since its original performance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2.2358/mighty-oregon-sings-of-the-past-1.201089|title='Mighty Oregon' sings of the past|last=Neuman|first=Steven|date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=2009-11-09|work=Oregon Daily Emerald[/tpl]

==In fiction and popular culture==

===Onscreen===

The film National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) was filmed on the university campus and the surrounding area. The building used as the exterior of the Delta House (which belonged to the University of Oregon Pi Kappa Alpha chapter) was demolished in 1986, but the interior scenes were shot in the Sigma Nu house, which still stands today. The Omega house belongs to the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and still stands today. The sorority house where Bluto climbs the ladder to peek in on the coeds was actually the exterior of the Sigma Nu fraternity."University archives". UO Libraries. Other buildings that were used during filming include Johnson Hall, Gerlinger Hall, Fenton Hall, Carson Hall, and the Erb Memorial Union (EMU). The EMU dining facility known as "The Fishbowl" was the site of the famous food-fight scene. The Knight Library and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art can also be seen in the movie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acmewebpages.com/animal/locales.htm |title= ACME Animal House Film Locations[/tpl]
