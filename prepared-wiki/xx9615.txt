[[List of organizations with .int domain names]]

CATEGORIES: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, Intergovernmental organizations, Lists of organizations, Domain name lists

This is a list of organizations with INT domain names, in alphabetical order of the second-level domain name. The list is not comprehensive. As of June 2012, the INT domain consists of 166 subdomain delegations.
These organizations are generally international organizations established by treaty. Some however (such as YMCA) do not meet current restrictions and were grandfathered in from prior acceptance.
 Bodies which are not international treaty organizations or (arguably) related to Internet infrastructure, and so do not meet current .INT requirements.
 Domains connected with Internet infrastructure; these are not international intergovernmental organizations.
 Domains connected with treaties but which may not have the full status of intergovernmental organization (sites for treaties or treaty secretariats).
