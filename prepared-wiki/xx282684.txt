==Opera==

Di Lello composed, orchestrated, conducted and staged two operas that he adapted from plays by W. B. Yeats — Purgatory and The Cat and the Moon.  This double bill was produced by Philip Meister and Maurice Edwards at The Cubiculo in New York City and had its premiere in March 1974.  An unreleased  recording of Purgatory is found in the Billy Rose Collection of the New York Public Library.

A television version of Purgatory was featured on University Broadcast Lab on WNYC-TV in 1974. 
Di Lello's Ann Garner was  premiered in 1978 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT.  This chamber cantata — a setting of the long poem by James Agee — was conducted by Chester Biscardi at various performances in 1978-79.  Ann Garner was notable for its mixture of tonal harmony and structured noise, as well as simultaneous combinations of spoken and sung poetry.

==The Peaches Series==

From 1975 through 1977 Di Lello created four related works:  Peaches' Lament, Peaches' Beacon, Peaches' Perplex and Peaches Melisma, all of which came out of Di Lello's teaching at the Dance Center of the Harvard Summer School.  In these dance/music works, Di Lello developed his unique focus on performance by dancer/musicians – performers trained as dancers and musicians.  Peaches' Lament was a 15-minute work for four dancer/musicians who danced together and alone, in silence and to music they made themselves on four keyboards.  
In the January 1979 issue of Dance Magazine, Amanda Smith wrote that the music and choreography of Peaches' Melisma created a “slightly eerie limbo” through which the work slowly emerged.  Peaches' Beacon (1976) was a one-hour work for large ensemble on themes of being lost, communication in unknown realms, rescue and codes.  All of the vocal, piano and percussion music was performed by the cast of 18 dancer/actor/musicians.
