Kulja is a small town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The town is situated along the Bonnie Rock Burakin Road.
The area was charted in 1908 and the Indigenous Australian name of a local soak was recorded as Kulja.
The townsite was originally established in the late 1920s as part of a railway siding on the Ejanding North Railway line. 
The townsite was gazetted in 1928 once a large enough local population had settled in the area.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|K|7 October 2008[/tpl]
