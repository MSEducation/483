Spanning the river at the border of McCreary and Whitley city, the waterfall is the central feature of Cumberland Falls State Resort Park.Cumberland Falls Retrieved on May 29, 2010

Under a full moon on clear nights, an elusive lunar rainbow or moonbow is sometimes formed by the mist emanating from the falls.Cumberland Falls Moonbow Retrieved on May 29, 2010
The Moonbow that appears here may be observed under a full moon and a clear sky. An arch of white light is usually produced at base of Falls and continues downstream. Generations of people have visited here to see this natural phenomenon. The last hotel on this site, Moonbow Inn, was named for the moonbow.http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=9814
