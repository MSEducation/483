Comte Antoine Drouot (January 11, 1774 – March 24, 1847) was one of Napoleon's generals.

==Biography==

Born in Nancy, France, the son of a baker, Drouot trained as an artilleryman and took part in the battles of the French Revolution where he rose through the ranks.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Later he had an illustrious career in the many battles of the Empire, notably, Wagram, Moscow, Lützen, Hanau and Waterloo. He became a major-general in 1805 and aide-de-camp to Napoleon in 1813. Napoleon called him le Sage de la Grande Armée (the sage of the Grand Army). He was with Napoleon during his exile to the island of Elba, and during his brief comeback known as the Hundred Days.
During the Battle of Waterloo Drouot was ordered to relieve a corps of the army as the Marshal who would generally assume command fell ill, as a result it is argued that Drouot (an expert in artillery fire) was therefore dispatched ineffectively throughout the engagement.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]dubious|reason=A. Drouot was not a Marshal. B. Possibly the writer has mixed up artillery commander Drouot and corps commander Drouet d'Erlon. C. The words "dispatched ineffectively" are awkward.|date=January 2014[/tpl]
