The Mollen Commission is formally known as The City of New York Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the Police Department. Former judge Milton Mollen was appointed in July 1992 by then New York City mayor David N. Dinkins to investigate corruption in the New York City Police Department. Mollen's mandate was to examine and investigate “the nature and extent of corruption in the Department; evaluate the departments procedures for preventing and detecting that corruption; and recommend changes and improvements to those procedures”.
In December 1993, the New York Times reported that the "special mayoral panel asserted ... that the New York City Police Department had failed at every level to uproot corruption and had instead tolerated a culture that fostered misconduct and concealed lawlessness by police officers."[tpl]cite news|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|title=New York's police allow corruption, Mollen panel says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/nyregion/new-york-s-police-allow-corruption-mollen-panel-says.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 Dec 1993[/tpl]
Mollen issued a report in July 1994. The conclusion:
 
 Today's corruption is not the corruption of Knapp Commission days. Corruption then was largely a corruption of accommodation, of criminals and police officers giving and taking bribes, buying and selling protection. Corruption was, in its essence, consensual. Today's corruption is characterized by brutality, theft, abuse of authority and active police criminality.

The Mollen Commission transcripts and videotapes are housed in the Special Collections of the Lloyd Sealy Library, John Jay College of Criminal Justice.[tpl]cite web|title=Manuscript Collections|url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/aecontent.php?pid=227219&sid=1880539|publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl]
