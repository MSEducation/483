==History==

The airport was named after the general and politician Juan Pistarini (1882–1956).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] He, as Minister of Public Works, placed the cornerstone of the project on [tpl]date|1945-12-22[/tpl]. It was designed and erected by Argentine technicians, and was built between 1945 and 1949.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Its construction was one of the major projects in the five-year plan of the first presidency of Juan Perón. When it opened, it was the third-largest airport in the world.
The first civil flight from the then new London Heathrow Airport, a BSAA Avro Lancastrian, flew to Ministro Pistarini International Airport in 1946.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] A 1949 diagramAmerican Aviation 1 August 1949 p15 shows three runways crossing at 60-degree angles: 9,353 ft runway 10/28, 7,220 ft 4/22 and 6,892 ft 16/34. In 1997, RWY 05/23 was closed and it is now used for parking large aircraft (such as the Airbus A340 or Boeing 747).
The Ezeiza massacre took place near the airport in 1973.

==Accessibility==

The Riccheri Motorway connects the airport with downtown Buenos Aires. There are no rail links between the airport and the city. The closest rail station is Ezeiza, the railway line passing through it having Constitución station as terminus. Ezeiza station can be reached by bus number 518. Other bus lines entering the terminal are the 8, 51, and 394. The first of them offers a semi-rapid service between the airport and downtown Buenos Aires that partly runs through the Riccheri Motorway, whilst the other two link the airport with several cities located within the southern Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Although the service offered by these buses is cheap, passengers with large luggage are often not carried as the buses lack luggage capacity. Another way of accessing the terminal is by taxi or by a number of charter buses.
