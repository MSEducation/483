==History==

Kilimanoor (which means the "land of the 'Kili' bird and deer") was ruled by a tribal chief during time of the Ettuveetil Pillamar of Travancore. The chief rebelled against the Maharajah Marthanda Varma, and the region was annexed and given to the Royal House of Kilimanoor.The Travancore State Manual by V. Nagam Aiya
This Royal House of Kilimanoor has a history of more than 300 years. In 1705 (ME 880), the son and two daughters of Ittammar Raja of Beypore Thattarikovilakam, a Kolathunadu royal house, were adopted by the Royal house of Venad. Ittammar Raja's sister and her sons, Rama Varma and Raghava Varma, settled in Kilimanoor and married the now-adopted sisters. Marthanda Varma, the founder of the Kingdom of Travancore was the son of Raghava Varma. Raghava Varma's nephew, Ravi Varma Koil Thampuran, married Marthanda Varma's sister. Their son came to be known as Dharma Raja Kartika Thirunnal Rama Varma. In 1740, when an allied force led by Dutch Captain Hockert supporting the Deshinganadu king attacked Venad, an army from Kilimanoor tactfully resisted and then defeated them. Although a small victory, this was the first time an Indian army defeated a European power. In recognition of this feat, Marthanda Varma, in 1753, exempted the areas under control of Kilimanoor palace from taxes and proclaimed autonomous status. The present palace complex was also built during this time. The present Ayyappa temple, for the family deity, was also built.
Velu Thampi Dalawa held meetings at Kilimanoor palace, planning his revolts against the British. He handed over his sword at the palace before going for his final battle against the British. India's First President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad received the Sword from the palace, and it is now kept at the national museum in Delhi.

==Politics==
