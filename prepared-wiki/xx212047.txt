==Denver Broncos==

Kaiser purchased the Broncos from the Gerald Phipps’ family in 1981.http://www.litigationcolorado.com/articles/broncos_verdict.html Kaiser sold his 60.8% share of the Broncos to current owner Pat Bowlen in 1984.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] He then sued Bowlen for violating the original sales’ agreement, which he contended granted him right of first purchase of any sale of shares in the team.  Kaiser claimed Bowlen violated this agreement by offering former Broncos quarterback John Elway a 10% stake of the company that holds ownership of the team. In 2004, a jury ruled in favor of Kaiser and a Federal judge decreed that Kaiser was entitled to purchase back 10 percent of the Broncos using the identical purchase terms offered to Elway.James Paton "Clock runs out for ex-Broncos owner" October 2, 2008, Rocky Mountain News, Denver, Colorado, http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team/ Bowlen appealed the original verdict that ruled in favor of Kaiser and won the appeal, as the appellate court ruled that the structure of the Bowlen-Elway deal did not violate the original agreement.
