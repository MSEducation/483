A cigarette ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|t|[/tpl]; from the French word cigarette [tpl]IPA-fr|siɡaʁɛt|[/tpl], meaning "small cigar")[tpl]cite web|url=http:/   /etimologias.dechile.net/?cigarro |title=Cigarro |publisher=Etimologias.dechile.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl] is a small cylinder of finely cut tobacco leaves rolled in thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end and allowed to smoulder; its smoke is inhaled from the other end, which is held in or to the mouth; in some cases a cigarette holder may be used as well. Most modern manufactured cigarettes are filtered and include reconstituted tobacco and other additives.Wigand, J.S. Additives, Cigarette Design and Tobacco Product Regulation, A Report To: World Health Organization, Tobacco Free Initiative, Tobacco Product Regulation Group, Kobe, Japan, 28 June-2 July 2006
The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette but can apply to similar devices containing other herbs, such as cloves or cannabis. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is normally white, though other colors are occasionally available. Cigars are typically composed entirely of whole-leaf tobacco.
Rates of cigarette smoking vary widely, and have changed considerably over the course of history — since cigarettes were first widely used in the mid-20th century. While rates of smoking have over time leveled off or declined in the developed world, they continue to rise in developing nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm#fig |title=Cigarette Smoking Among Adults - United States, 2006 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/fact_sheets/fs_20020528.htm |title=WHO/WPRO-Smoking Statistics |publisher=Wpro.who.int |date=2002-05-28 |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl]
Cigarettes carry serious health risks, which are more prevalent than in other tobacco products. Nicotine, the primary psychoactive chemical in tobacco and therefore cigarettes, is addictive.http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/chi/chi24-4-pktguide.pdf About half of cigarette smokers die of tobacco-related disease[tpl]Cite doi|10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE[/tpl] and lose on average 14 years of life.

==History==

The earliest forms of cigarettes were similar to their predecessor, the cigar. Cigarettes appear to have had antecedents in Mexico and Central America around the 9th century in the form of reeds and smoking tubes. The Maya, and later the Aztecs, smoked tobacco and various psychoactive drugs in religious rituals and frequently depicted priests and deities smoking on pottery and temple engravings. The cigarette and the cigar were the most common methods of smoking in the Caribbean, Mexico and Central and South America until recent times.Robicsek, Francis Smoke; Ritual Smoking in Central America pp. 30–37
The North American, Central American and South American cigarette used various plant wrappers; when it was brought back to Spain, maize wrappers were introduced, and by the 17th century, fine paper.  The resulting product was called papelate and is documented in Goya's paintings La Cometa, La Merienda en el Manzanares, and El juego de la pelota a pala (18th century).[tpl]Cite book |author=Goodman, Jordan Elliot |title=Tobacco in history: the cultures of dependence |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1993 |page=97 |isbn=978-0-415-04963-4 [/tpl]
By 1830, the cigarette had crossed into France, where it received the name cigarette; and in 1845, the French state tobacco monopoly began manufacturing them.
Production climbed markedly when a cigarette-making machine was developed in the 1880s by James Albert Bonsack which vastly increased the productivity of cigarette companies, who went from making approximately 40,000 hand-rolled cigarettes daily to around 4 million.[tpl]cite news|last=James |first=Randy |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1905530,00.html |title=A Brief History Of Cigarette Advertising |publisher=TIME |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]
In the English-speaking world, the use of tobacco in cigarette form became increasingly widespread during and after the Crimean War, when British soldiers began emulating their Ottoman Turkish comrades and Russian enemies, who had begun rolling and smoking tobacco in strips of old newspaper for lack of proper cigar-rolling leaf. This was helped by the development of tobaccos suitable for cigarette use, and by the development of the Egyptian cigarette export industry.
Cigarettes may have been initially used in a manner similar to pipes and cigars and not inhaled; for evidence, see the Lucky Strike ad campaign asking
consumers "Do You Inhale?" from the 30s. As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic inhaling may have become perceived as more agreeable. On the other hand, Moltke noticed in the 1830s (cf. Unter dem Halbmond) that Ottomans (and he himself) inhaled the Turkish tobacco and Latakia from their pipes[tpl]cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/3038/30 |title=Projekt Gutenberg-DE - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Kultur |publisher=Gutenberg.spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl] (which are both initially sun-cured, acidic leaf varieties).
As early as 1888, cigarettes were described colloquially as "coffin nails."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coffin%20nail |title=Merriam-Webster dictionary: 'coffin nail' |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl]
The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon – at the start of the 20th century the per capita annual consumption in the USA was 54 cigarettes (with less than 0.5% of the population smoking more than 100 cigarettes per year), and consumption there peaked at 4,259 per capita in 1965. At that time about 50% of men and 33% of women smoked (defined as smoking more than 100 cigarettes per year).[tpl]Cite journal |title=Tobacco Use, United States 1990-1999 |journal=Oncology (Williston Park) |volume=13 |issue=12 |date=December 1999[/tpl] By 2000, consumption had fallen to 2,092 per capita, corresponding to about 30% of men and 22% of women smoking more than 100 cigarettes per year, and by 2006 per capita consumption had declined to 1,691;Tobacco Outlook Report, Economic Research Service, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture implying that about 21% of the population smoked 100 cigarettes or more per year.
German doctors were the first to identify the link between smoking and lung cancer which led to the first anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany.Roffo, A. H. (January 8, 1940). "Krebserzeugende Tabakwirkung effects of tobacco" (in German). Berlin: J. F. Lehmanns Verlag. Retrieved 2009-09-13.[tpl]cite pmid|16799735[/tpl] During World War I and World War II, cigarettes were rationed to soldiers. During the Vietnam War, cigarettes were included with C-ration meals. In 1975 the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in military rations. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking started to become widely known and text-only health warnings became commonplace on cigarette packets. Warnings became prevalent but unpopular, mainly due to the political influences held by tobacco growers.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] The United States has not implemented graphical cigarette warning labels, which are considered a more effective method to communicate to the public the dangers of cigarette smoking.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Hammond D, Fong GT, McNeill A, Borland R, Cummings KM |title=Effectiveness of cigarette warning labels in informing smokers about the risks of smoking: findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey |journal=Tob Control |volume=15 Suppl 3 |issue= Suppl 3|pages=iii19–25 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16754942 |doi=10.1136/tc.2005.012294 |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/15/suppl_3/iii19 |pmc=2593056[/tpl] Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Greece, the Netherlands,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] New Zealand, Norway, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Romania, Singapore and Turkey however, have both textual warnings and graphic visual images displaying, among other things, the damaging effects tobacco use has on the human body.
The cigarette has evolved much since its conception; for example, the thin bands that travel transverse to the "axis of smoking" (thus forming circles along the length of the cigarette) are alternate sections of thin and thick paper to facilitate effective burning when being drawn, and retard burning when at rest. Synthetic particulate filters may remove some of the tar before it reaches the smoker.
The 'holy grail' for cigarette companies has been the quest for a cancer free cigarette. On record, the closest historical attempt was produced by a scientist James Mold. Under the name project TAME, he produced the XA cigarette. However, in 1978, his project was terminated.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/9509679/Will-smoking-ever-be-safe.html |title= Quest for a safer cigarette | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Will |last=Storr |date=2012-09-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/James_D._Mold |title= Project XA[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/safer-cigarettes-history.html |title= Safer cigarette history[/tpl]

==Legislations==

===Smoking restrictions===

Many governments impose restrictions on smoking tobacco, especially in public areas. The primary justification has been the negative health effects of second-hand smoke.WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; First international treaty on public health, adopted by 192 countries and signed by 168. Its Article 8.1 states "Parties recognize that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that exposure to tobacco causes death, disease and disability." Laws vary by country and locality. Bhutan is currently the only country in the world to completely outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production and sale of tobacco and tobacco products under the 'Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010'. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted as long as the possessor can prove that they have paid import duties.[tpl]cite web|author=Gayatri Parameswaran |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/09/201292095920757761.html |title=Bhutan smokers huff and puff over tobacco ban - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl] The Pitcairn Islands had previously banned the sale of cigarettes, however it now permits sales from a government run store.

Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000. See: Smoking age, Smoking bans in private vehicles, Retail display ban, Cigarette machine.
In March 2012, Brazil became the world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco including menthols. It also banned the majority of the estimated 600 additives used, permitting only 8. This regulation applies to domestic and internationally imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers have 18 months to remove the non-compliant cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of non-compliant tobacco.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/implementation/news/news_brazil/en/index.html |title=WHO | Brazil - Flavoured cigarettes banned |publisher=Who.int |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2012/04/brazils-flavored-cigarette-ban-now-targeted.html |title=Eyes on Trade: Brazil's flavored cigarette ban now targeted |publisher=Citizen.typepad.com |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl]

===Smoking age===

Beginning on April 1, 1998, the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to people under the state purchase age has been prohibited by law in all 50 states of the United States. The purchasing age in the United States is 18 for 46 of the 50 states — but 19 in Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey, Utah, and Nassau, Suffolk, and Onondaga counties in New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/governor/njnewsline/view_article.pl?id=2894 |title=NJ Office of the Governor - Press Releases - Codey Signs Two Major Bills into Law, Scoring Public Health Triumph for New Jersey |publisher=State.nj.us |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]News 10 Now (19 December 2006), "Lawmakers raise minimum age on purchasing tobacco products". Retrieved December 19, 2006. The intended effect of this is to prevent older high school students from purchasing cigarettes for their younger peers. Legislation was pending as of 2004 in some other states. In Massachusetts,Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 270 (Crimes Against Public Health), Section 6 (Tobacco; sale or gift to minors) http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/270-6.htm parents and guardians are allowed to give cigarettes to minors, but sales to minors are prohibited.
Similar laws exist in many other countries. In Canada, most of the provinces require smokers to be 19 years of age to purchase cigarettes (except for Quebec and the prairie provinces, where the age is 18). However, the minimum age only concerns the purchase of tobacco, not use. Alberta, however, does have a law which prohibits the possession or use of tobacco products by all persons under 18, punishable by a $100 fine. Australia, New Zealand, Poland and Pakistan have a nationwide ban on the selling of all tobacco products to people under the age of 18.
Since 1 October 2007, it has been illegal for retailers to sell tobacco in all forms to people under the age of 18 in three of the UK's four constituent countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland) (rising from 16). It is also illegal to sell lighters, rolling papers and all other tobacco-associated items to people under 18. It is not illegal for people under 18 to buy or smoke tobacco, just as it was not previously for people under 16; it is only illegal for the said retailer to sell the item. The age increase from 16 to 18 came into force in Northern Ireland on 1 September 2008. In the Republic of Ireland, bans on the sale of the smaller ten-packs and confectionery that resembles tobacco products (candy cigarettes) came into force on May 31, 2007 in a bid to cut underaged smoking.
Most countries in the world have a legal vending age of 18. In Macedonia, Italy, Malta, Austria, Luxembourg and Belgium the age for legal vending is 16. Since January 1, 2007, all cigarette machines in public places in Germany must attempt to verify a customer's age by requiring the insertion of a debit card. Turkey, which has one of the highest percentage of smokers in its population,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tob_tot_adu_smo-health-tobacco-total-adult-smokers |title = Total adult smokers by country |accessdate = 2008-06-04 |publisher = NationMaster.com[/tpl] has a legal age of 18. Japan is one of the highest tobacco-consuming nations, and requires purchasers to be 20 years of age (suffrage in Japan is 20 years old).[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook - Japan |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl] Since July 2008, Japan has enforced this age limit at cigarette vending machines through use of the taspo smart card. In other countries, such as Egypt, it is legal to use and purchase tobacco products regardless of age.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Germany raised the purchase age from 16 to 18 on the 1 September 2007.
Some police departments in the United States occasionally send an underaged teenager into a store where cigarettes are sold, and have the teen attempt to purchase cigarettes, with their own or no ID. If the vendor then completes the sale, the store is issued a fine.http://www.abc.state.va.us/licensing/downloads/underagebuyer.pdf [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]  Similar enforcement practices are regularly performed by Trading Standards Officers in the UK, Israel and the Gardaí Siochana, the police force of the Republic of Ireland.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4205066.stm |title=UK | England | Bristol/Somerset | Retailers sell tobacco to youths |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]

===Taxation===

Cigarettes are a significant source of tax revenue in many localities. This fact has historically been an impediment for health groups seeking to discourage cigarette smoking, since governments seek to maximize tax revenues. Furthermore, some countries have made cigarettes a state monopoly, which has the same effect on the attitude of government officials outside the health field.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tobacco/stories/asia.htm |title=U.S. Aided Cigarette Firms in Conquests Across Asia |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1996-11-17 |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl] In the United States, cigarettes are taxed substantially, but the states are a primary determinant of the total tax rate.  Generally, states that rely on tobacco as a significant farm product tend to tax cigarettes at a low rate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxadmin.org/FTA/rate/cigarett.html |title=State Excise Tax Rates On Cigarettes (January 1, 2007) |publisher=Taxadmin.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl] It has been shown that higher prices for cigarettes discourage smoking. Every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduced youth smoking by about seven percent and overall cigarette consumption by about four percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tobaccofreekids.org/reports/prices/ |title=Higher Cigarette Taxes |publisher=Tobaccofreekids.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl] Thus increased cigarette taxes are proposed as a means to reduce smoking. Coupled with the federal cigarette tax of $1.01 per pack, total cigarette-specific taxes range from $1.18 per pack in Missouri to $8.00 per pack in Silver Bay .  States also charge sizable settlement payments to tobacco companies, and the federal government levies user fees to fund FDA regulatory measures over tobacco.  While these charges are not cigarette-specific, tobacco companies are ultimately forced to pass on those costs to their consumers.  Lastly, most jurisdictions apply sales tax to the full retail price of cigarettes.

===Fire safe cigarette===

According to Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, the burning agents in cigarette paper are responsible for fires and reducing them would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3540489,00.html |title=European Union Pushes for Self-Extinguishing Cigarettes |publisher=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl] Since the 1980s, prominent cigarette manufacturers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds developed fire-safe cigarettes but did not market them.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

New York was the first U.S. state to mandate that all cigarettes manufactured or sold within the state comply with a fire safe standard. Canada has passed a similar nation-wide mandate based on the same standard.

European Union wishes to ban in 2011 cigarettes that are not fire-safe.

This caused 520 deaths and 1600 people injured.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/actualite-high-tech/les-cigarettes-anti-incendie-seront-obligatoires-en-2011_160019.html |title=Les cigarettes anti-incendie seront obligatoires en 2011 |publisher=Lexpansion.com |date= |language=French |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl]

===Cigarette advertising===

In many parts of the world tobacco advertising and sponsorship has been outlawed. The ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the EU in 2005 has prompted Formula One Management to look for races in areas that allow the tobacco sponsored teams to display their livery. In the United States, advertising restrictions took effect on June 22, 2010.
In some jurisdictions, such as the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta, the retail store display of cigarettes is completely prohibited if persons under the legal age of consumption have access to the premises.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/smoking/smokingbans.html |title=Banning the butt: Global anti-smoking efforts |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |publisher=CBC News |quote=On Jan. 19, 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada rules the province Saskatchewan could reinstate the "shower curtain law" that requires store owners to keep tobacco products out of sight. |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] In Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, The ACT, and Quebec, Canada, the display of tobacco is prohibited for everyone, regardless of age, as of 2010.

===Warning messages in packages===

As a result of tight advertising and marketing prohibitions, tobacco companies look at the pack differently: they view it as a strong component in displaying brand imagery and a creating significant in-store presence at the point of purchase. Market testing shows the influence of this dimension in shifting the consumer’s choice when the same product displays in an alternative package. Studies also show how companies have manipulated a variety of elements in packs designs to communicate the impression of lower in tar or milder cigarettes whereas the components were the same.
