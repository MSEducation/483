Limpopo [tpl]IPAc-en|l|ɪ|m|ˈ|p|oʊ|p|oʊ[/tpl] is the northernmost province of South Africa. It is named after the Limpopo River that flows across the province; the name "Limpopo" has its etymological origin from the Sepedi word diphororo tša meetse - meaning strong gushing waterfalls. (The Sepedi language is spoken by a third of the people in the province.) The capital is Polokwane, formerly named Pietersburg.
The province was formed from the northern region of Transvaal Province in 1994, and initially named Northern Transvaal. The following year, it was renamed Northern Province, which remained the name until 2003, when the name of the province was formally changed to the name of its most important river–on the border with Zimbabwe and Botswana–after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the Constitution. A notable consideration for the name was Mapungubwe, the area where the most ancient gold-using civilisation of the province was discovered a few years earlier.
Limpopo is the South African province with the highest level of poverty, with 78.9% of the population living below the national poverty line.[tpl]cite web|title=Living condition|url=http://beta2.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=739&id=1|publisher=Statistics South Africa|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl] In 2011, 74.4% of local dwellings were located in a tribal or traditional area, compared to a national average of 27.1%.[tpl]cite web|title=Community profiles > Census 2011 > Dwellings > Geo type|url=http://interactive.statssa.gov.za|publisher=Statistics South Africa SuperWEB|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

Limpopo Province shares international borders with districts and provinces of three countries: Botswana's Central and Kgatleng districts to the west and north-west respectively, Zimbabwe's Matabeleland South and Masvingo provinces to the north and northeast respectively, and Mozambique's Gaza Province to the east.[tpl]cite web|title=http://www.limpopo.gov.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=3|url=http://www.limpopo.gov.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=3[/tpl]  The province is the link between South Africa and countries further afield in sub-Saharan Africa. On its southern flank from east to west, the province shares borders with Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and North West. Its border with Gauteng includes that province's Johannesburg-Pretoria axis, the most industrialised metropole on the continent. The province is at the centre of regional, national, and international developing markets.
The province contains much of the Waterberg Biosphere, a UNESCO-designated Biosphere Reserve. The Waterberg Biosphere, a massif of approximately [tpl]convert|15000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. The massif was shaped by hundreds of millions of years of riverine erosion to yield diverse bluff and butte landforms.C.Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, The Waterberg Biosphere, Lumina Technologies, 22 May 2006. http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html  The Waterberg ecosystem can be characterised as a dry deciduous forest or Bushveld. Within the Waterberg, archaeological finds date to the Stone Age. Nearby are early evolutionary finds related to the origin of humans.
