[[Scotch broth]]

CATEGORIES: Lamb dishes, Scottish cuisine, Scottish soups

Scotch broth is a filling soup, originating in Scotland but now obtainable worldwide. The principal ingredients are usually barley, stewing or braising cuts of lamb, mutton or  beef, root vegetables such as carrots, swedes or sometimes turnips and dried pulses (most often split peas and red lentils). Cabbage and leeks are often added shortly before serving to preserve their texture, colour and flavours. The proportions and ingredients vary according to the recipe or availability.[tpl]cite book |title=Scottish Miscellany: Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Scotland the Brave | chapter = When Does a Broth Become Scotch Broth? | last = Green | first = Jonathan |year= 2010 |publisher= Skyhorse Publishing |location=New York |isbn= 9781616080631|page=|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ol56FSFMLe4C&pg=PT137&dq=scotch+broth#v=onepage&q=scotch%20broth&f=false[/tpl][ref]
