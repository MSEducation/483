The Scottish Constitutional Commission is an independent and non-partisan think-tank, founded in 2005 by John Drummond, Chris Thomson and Canon Kenyon Wright, formerly of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.  The Scottish Constitutional Commission conducts research and advocacy on the establishment of a liberal and democratic Constitution for Scotland based upon the sovereignty of the Scottish people.  
It is not to be confused with the Commission on Scottish Devolution (Calman Commission) which is an official commission established by the Scottish Parliament to review devolution.
