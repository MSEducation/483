The following is a list of place names in Canada (primarily Western Canada) whose name origin is in the Ukrainian language. Some places – especially in Saskatchewan – were named by ethnic Germans from Ukraine.
Most of these places were rural communities without a railway or grain elevator and accessible solely by gravel road; typically consisting only of a church & cemetery, post office, school, and sometimes a community/national hall, a grocery/"general" store or a blacksmith shop.
