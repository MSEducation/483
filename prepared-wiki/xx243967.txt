==Plot==

An odd mix of cops, including a transsexual and an Elvis impersonator, are given one final opportunity to distinguish themselves in the field of law enforcement, when they are assigned to the 56th, LA's seediest and most woebegone precinct. Under the leadership of Capt. Rick Wright, these losers-in-blue attempt possible redemption, if they can make an arrest without killing themselves.http://www.tv.com/the-last-precinct/the-last-precinct/episode/181998/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap
