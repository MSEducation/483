Very little is known about him. He succeeded his brother King Lie of Zhou in 368 BC.Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian 
He sent gifts to many of the feudal states, supposedly his vassals, particularly Qin and Chu. Late in his reign, the leaders of the states declared themselves kings, and ceased to recognise the king of Zhou as even nominally their overlord.[ref]ZHOU GENEALOGY

After his death, his son King Shenjing of Zhou ruled over China.Trình Doãn Thắng, Ngô Trâu Cương, Thái Thành (1998), Cố sự Quỳnh Lâm, NXB Thanh Hoá
