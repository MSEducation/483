Towaco Station is a New Jersey Transit station in the Towaco section of Montville, New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line.  The station was renovated in the late 1990s.  The railroad line is currently just one main track, but operated as many as four tracks in the 1920s for transport of eastbound coal and goods.  The railway bridges over US 202 in the Towaco area initially carried the four tracks.  The general incline of the track in this area is an eastward downhill grade.
The station was built by the DL&W in 1910-11 as a concrete facility, replacing the old "Whitehall" stop, which was renamed Towaco in 1905.[tpl]cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert J.|title=Lackawanna Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=Scotch Plains, New Jersey|year=2007|volume=1:Hoboken to Dover|pages=52–53, 80|isbn=1-58248-214-4[/tpl]
In this area, the Morris Canal paralleled the railroad from Boonton to Towaco to Lincoln Park until its abandonment in 1925.  Considerable evidence of the Canal is visible along US 202.  These include the towpath and canal bed. An inclined plane for canal boats was used along US 202 farther south, between Lake Valhalla Road and the Montville Inn.
