[[Odiogo]]

CATEGORIES: Blog software, Speech synthesis

Odiogo (from audio-to-go) enables content providers and bloggers to quickly and automatically generate high fidelity audio from textual content, allowing consumers to easily "listen to" their favorite online news and information. The Odiogo generated content can be listened to on  Windows/Mac PCs, Mobile phones and iPods/MP3 players.
Odiogo's proprietary algorithms perform several pre and post processing tasks on the content before it is processed by state of the art Text to speech engines.
Odiogo users can deploy the Listen Button widget on their content site. Located near the familiar "Email" and "Print" buttons on top of each article in mainstream media and blogs, the Listen Button when clicked will open a player which will read aloud the currently displayed article.
The Listen Button widget is available for the majority of Blogging and Content Management System. As of April 2008, the following platforms are supported:  BlogEngine.Net, Blogger, Drupal, Joomla, MojoPortal, Movable Type, SquareSpace, Terapad, TypePad, WordPress.
