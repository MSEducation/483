[[Mahte]]

CATEGORIES: Latvian mythology, Latvian goddesses

In Latvian mythology, the term Māte stands for "mother", sometimes written in English as Mahte. It was an epithet applied to some sixty-seventy goddesses.  They were clearly distinct goddesses in most or all cases, so the term definitely referred to the mother-goddess of specific phenomena.
