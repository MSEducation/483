The Yorkshire bagpipe is a type of bagpipe once native to the county of Yorkshire in northern England. The instrument is currently extinct, but sources as early as 1885 describe it as being familiar in Shakespeare's time.JJohn Ogilvie, editor Charles Annandale. The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language: a complete encyclopedic lexicon, literary, scientific, and technological. Blackie & Son, 1882. Pg. 203
Modern researcher Kathleen Scott notes that the instrument was often likened to sows, but not based on its sound.[ref]Gary D. Schmidt. Vides festinare pastores: The medieval artistic vision of shepherding and the manipulation of cultural expectation in the Secunda pastorum.
