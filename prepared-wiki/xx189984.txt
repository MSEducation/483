The letters are square. Tischendorf suggested the scribe was a Copt, because the letters often show Coptic forms. There is no notation of sections or other divisions. The shapes of alpha and iota are specially noticeable.[ref]

==Text==

The Greek text of this codex is a secondary representative of the Alexandrian text-type (named also Egyptian text) with a mixture of the Byzantine readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category II.Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland, The Text of the New Testament..., pp. 113, 160. The Alexandrian text of the Gospel of John stands in close relationship to the Codex Vaticanus, and P75.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 80. 
It reads βηθαβαρα in John 1:28 and βηθσαιδα in John 5:2.

==History==

The manuscript came from White Monastery. It once belonged to Cardinal Stefano Borgia, hence name of the codex.
Fragments of the codex were discovered independently at separate times and were numbered 029, 0113, 0125, and 0139. Together they have 23 leaves. "It appears that the ignorant monk who brought it this manuscript with him from Egypt to Europe, was so unaware of its value, that he lost the greater part of the leaves".S. P. Tregelles, "An Introduction to the Critical study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures", London 1856, p. 180 
The text of the codex 029 was carefully edited in 1789 by A. A. Giorgi.A. A. Giorgi, Fragmentum evangelii S. Johannis Graecum Copto-Sahidicum, Rome 1789. The manuscript was examined by Birch who collated the Greek text of 029. Birch gave description of the codex:
 
 Codex in membranis scriptus est, charactere inciali quadro, graeco textui adjecta est versio coptica. Vehementer sane dolendum, particulam tam exiguam eximini codicis servatam esse, ex quo, si integrum aetas tulisset, plurima ad textus emendationem peti potuissent.A. Birch, Variae Lectiones ad Textum IV Evangeliorum, Haunie 1801, p. LVII

==Present location==

A few leaves from Uncial 070, formerly designated by Ta, were wrongly suggested by Tregelles as a part of the same codex to which Borgianus belonged.
The codex is located, at the Vatican Library (Borgia Coptic 109), in New York (Pierpont Morgan M 664A), and in Paris (BnF Copt. 129).[tpl]Cite web |url=http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php?ObjID=20029 |title=Liste Handschriften |publisher=Institute for New Testament Textual Research |accessdate=16 March 2013 |location=Münster[/tpl]
