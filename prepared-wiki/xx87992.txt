[[Alamein railway line]]

CATEGORIES: Railway lines in Melbourne, Railway lines opened in 1891

The Alamein railway line is a suburban electric railway in Melbourne, Australia. It serves part of the City of Boroondara, to the east of the Melbourne central business district. It has six stations and branches from the Belgrave and Lilydale lines at Camberwell station. It is entirely within Metlink ticketing Zone 1. 

==Description==

The Alamein line heads south from Camberwell across gentle hills, with some moderately heavy earthworks. The line crosses under or over several roads by means of bridges, and only has two level crossings, one of which carries tram tracks, one of four such tram/train crossings in Melbourne.  The area served by the line is fully built up and a mostly residential area.
The line is operated as a shuttle service between Camberwell and Alamein stations during off-peak periods, while trains run the whole distance to Flinders Street Station during peak hours.

==Infrastructure==

The line is double track from the junction at Camberwell station to just north of Ashburton station; changing to a single track for the rest of the distance, a short enough section that it is not a serious bottleneck. The maximum permissible train speed limits range from [tpl]convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] on most of the double track sections, to [tpl]convert|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] on the single track, and [tpl]convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] over the tram/train level crossing on the line.
There is a crossover point at Riversdale station, which allows trains to turn back when they cannot proceed.  There are no stabling facilities on the line, although there is a single, rarely used siding at Ashburton station.  The city-bound track between Camberwell and Riversdale stations is signalled for two-way running. This is used by shuttle services when running at frequencies greater than 15 minutes.

==History==

What is now known as the Alamein line was opened as the Outer Circle Railway between 1890 and 1891. The segment still in use today was opened on 24 March 1890.[ref]
