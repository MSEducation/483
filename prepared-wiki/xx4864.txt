Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones, Jr.,The character's full name is stated in the Corey Carrier narration of the feature-length episode My First Adventure from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. often shortened to "Indy", is the title character of the Indiana Jones franchise. George Lucas created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials. The character first appeared in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, to be followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in 1984, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles from 1992 to 1996, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008.

Jones is also featured in the Disney theme park attraction; Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, as well as the Disneyland Paris attraction Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril.
Jones is most famously played by Harrison Ford and has also been portrayed by River Phoenix (as the young Jones in The Last Crusade) and in the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles by Corey Carrier, Sean Patrick Flanery, and George Hall. Doug Lee has supplied Jones's voice to two LucasArts video games, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, while David Esch supplied his voice to Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and John Armstrong in Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings (Video Game 2009) – IMDb
Particularly notable facets of the character include his iconic look (bullwhip, fedora, and leather jacket), sense of humor, deep knowledge of many ancient civilizations and languages, and fear of snakes.
Since his first appearance in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones has become a worldwide star and remains one of cinema's most revered film characters. In 2003, the American Film Institute ranked him as the second greatest film hero of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246|title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|publisher=afi.com|accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl] He was also named the 6th Greatest Movie Character by Empire magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=6|title=Empire's The 100 Greatest Movie Characters|publisher=Empire|accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly ranked Indy 2nd on their list of The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20268279_19,00.html|title=Entertainment Weekly's 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] Premiere magazine also placed Indy at number 7 on their list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/100characters4.html|title=Premiere's The 100 Greatest Movie Characters|publisher=Filmsite.org|accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl] On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked Indy at number 10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fandomania.com/100-greatest-fictional-characters-10-6/|title= The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters|publisher=Fandomania.com|accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl]

==Appearances==

A native of Princeton, New Jersey, Indiana Jones was introduced in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936. The character is an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial treasure hunters and pulp action heroes, whose research is funded by Marshall College (named after producer Frank Marshall),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.com/News/statenews/200805260088|title=Indiana Jones teaches at Marshall|accessdate=2010-06-20|last=Fulks|first=Tricia|date=2008-05-26|work=Charleston Daily Mail|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528045617/http://www.dailymail.com/News/statenews/200805260088|archivedate=2008-05-26[/tpl] a fictional college in Connecticut, where he is a professor of archaeology.  In this first adventure, he is pitted against the Nazis, traveling the world to prevent them from recovering the Ark of the Covenant (see also Biblical archaeology). He is aided by Marion Ravenwood and Sallah. The Nazis are led by Jones's archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named René Belloq, and Arnold Toht, a sinister Gestapo agent.
In the 1984 prequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty Thuggee cult. He is aided by Short Round, a young boy, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).
The third film, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody, a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at Barnett College), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous Nazi mystics, this time trying to find the Holy Grail. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a bullwhip, the scar on his chin, and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that "Indiana" is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a buddy movie of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good plot element to drive the next instalment.[tpl]cite news|author=Nick de Semlyen, Ian Freer, Chris Hewitt, Ian Nathan, Sam Toy|title=A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV|page=100|publisher=Empire|date=2006-09-29[/tpl]
The 2008 film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is the latest film in the series. Set in 1957, 19 years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against Soviet agents bent on harnessing the power of a crystal skull associated with extraterrestrials discovered in South America by his former colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt). Jones is aided in his adventure by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and her son—a young greaser named Henry "Mutt" Williams (Shia LaBeouf), later revealed to be Jones's biological child, Henry Jones III. There were rumors that Harrison Ford will not return for any future installments and LaBeouf will take over the Indy franchise.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indy_update200802 |title=My Indiana Jones Crackpot Theory |accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] This film also reveals that Jones was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services (a predecessor department to the Central Intelligence Agency) during World War II, attaining the rank of Colonel in the United States Army and running covert operations with MI6 agent George McHale on the Soviet Union.

===Television===

From 1992 to 1996, George Lucas executive-produced a television series named The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, aimed mainly at teenagers and older children, which showed many of the important events and historical figures of the early 20th century through the prism of Indiana Jones' life.
The show initially featured the formula of an elderly (93 to 94 years of age) lndiana Jones played by George Hall introducing a story from his youth by way of an anecdote: the main part of the episode then featured an adventure with either a young adult Indy (16 to 21 years of age) played by Sean Patrick Flanery or a child Indy (8 to 11 years) played by Corey Carrier. One episode, "Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues", is bookended by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, rather than Hall. Later episodes and telemovies did not have this bookend format.
The bulk of the series centers around the young adult Indiana Jones and his activities during World War I as a 16–17 year old soldier in the Belgian Army and then as an intelligence officer and spy seconded to French intelligence. The child Indy episodes follow the boy's travels around the globe as he accompanies his parents on his father's worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910.
The show provided some backstory for the films, as well as new information regarding the character. Indiana Jones was born July 1, 1899, and his middle name is Walton (Lucas's middle name). It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever, and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues. His relationship with his father, first introduced in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy. Indy damages or loses his right eye sometime between the events in 1957 and the early 1990s, when the "Old Indy" segments take place, as the elderly Indiana Jones wears an eyepatch.
In 1999, Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases, and re-edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature-length stories. The series title was also changed to The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones.

===Video games===

The character has appeared in several officially licensed games, including LEGO Indiana Jones video games, beginning with adaptations of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, two adaptations of The Last Crusade (one with purely action mechanics, one with an adventure and puzzle based structure) and Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures which included the storylines from all three of the original films.
Following this, the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/indianajones/|title=Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11[/tpl] Emperor's Tomb sets up Jones's companion Wu Han and the search for Nurhaci's ashes seen at the beginning of Temple of Doom. The first two games were developed by Hal Barwood and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; Emperor's Tomb had David Esch fill the role and Staff of Kings starred John Armstrong.
Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine was the first Indy-based game presented in three dimensions, as opposed to 8-bit graphics and side-scrolling games before.
There is also a small game from Lucas Arts Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures. A video game was made for young Indy called Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos, as well as a video game version of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.
Two Lego Indiana Jones games have also been released. Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures was released in 2008[tpl]cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/|title=LEGO Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11[/tpl] and follows the plots of the first three films. It was followed by LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues in late 2009. The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films, but focuses on the plot of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Indiana Jones has also made cameo appearances as an unlockable character in the games Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Theme parks===

Indiana Jones is featured at several Walt Disney theme park attractions. The Indiana Jones Adventure attractions at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea ("Temple of the Forbidden Eye" and "Temple of the Crystal Skull," respectively) place Indy at the forefront of two similar archaeological discoveries. These two temples each contain a wrathful deity who threatens the guests who ride through in World War II troop transports.

Disneyland Paris also features an Indiana Jones-titled ride where people speed off through ancient ruins in a runaway mine wagon similar to that found in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril is a looping roller coaster engineered by Intamin, designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, and opened in 1993.
The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! is a live show that has been presented in the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort with few changes since the park's 1989 opening, as Disney-MGM Studios. The 25-minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a feature film production, and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show. Stunt artists in the show re-create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the Raiders of the Lost Ark films, including the well-known "running-from-the-boulder" scene. Stunt performer Anislav Varbanov was fatally injured in August 2009, while rehearsing the popular show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2009-08-18/news/disney_1_epic-stunt-spectacular-indiana-jones-cast-member|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|title=Disney performer dies during rehearsal|date=2009-08-18|author=Willoughby Mariano[/tpl] Also at Disney's Hollywood Studios, an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones appears in another attraction; during the The Great Movie Ride's Raiders of the Lost Ark segment.[tpl]cite news|last=Winders|first=Glenda|title=Disney theme park re-creates Hollywood in its heyday|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VrAeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gs4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6715,3962551&dq=great+movie+ride+raiders&hl=en|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=13 August 1989|agency=Copley News Service|location=Spartanburg SC|page=12[/tpl]

==Character description and formation==

In his role as a college professor of archaeology, Henry Jones Jr. is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it is revealed that Jones is influenced by the Marxist Archaeologist, Vere Gordon Childe, whose qualified acceptance of cultural diffusionism theory he propounds. Ironically, though Childe loathes fieldwork,[tpl]cite book|last=Green, Sally|title=Prehistorian: A Biography of V. Gordon Childe|publisher=Moonraker Press|year=1981|page=64|isbn=0-239002067[/tpl] Indy goes on to say, "If you want to be a good archaeologist, you gotta get out of the library."  This is in tongue-in-cheek contrast to the previous film's comment, "Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library."
However, at the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into "Indiana," a "non-superhero superhero" image he has concocted for himself.[tpl]cite book|author=Douglas Brode|title=The Films of Steven Spielberg|publisher=Citadel|year=1995|pages=90–98|isbn=0-8065-1540-6[/tpl] Producer Frank Marshall said, "Indy is a fallible character. He makes mistakes and gets hurt. ... That's the other thing people like: He's a real character, not a character with superpowers."[tpl]cite news|author=Anthony Breznican|title=First look: Whip cracks over new 'Indiana Jones' movie|publisher=USA Today|date=2007-12-09|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-12-09-indiana-jones_N.htm|accessdate=2007-12-10[/tpl] Spielberg said there "was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him."[tpl]cite news|author=Jim Windolf|title=Q&A: Steven Spielberg|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=2007-12-02|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/spielberg_qanda200802?currentPage=3|accessdate=2007-12-02[/tpl] According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana's personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic,[tpl]cite video|people=Shinji Hata (interviewer)|title=From Star Wars to Indiana Jones: The Best of the LucasFilm Archives|publisher=LucasFilm|date=1994[/tpl] while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.[tpl]cite news|author=Maria Puente|title=Indiana Jones: He's Everyman, with wit and a whip|publisher=USA Today|date=2008-05-22|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-05-22-indiana-jones-cover_N.htm|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl]
Like many characters in his films, Jones has some autobiographical elements of Spielberg. Indiana lacks a proper father figure because of his strained relationship with his father, Henry Senior. His own contained anger is misdirected towards Professor Abner Ravenwood, his mentor at the University of Chicago, leading to a strained relationship with Marion Ravenwood. The teenage Indiana bases his own look on a figure from the prologue of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, after being given his hat.[tpl]cite book|author=Douglas Brode|title=The Films of Steven Spielberg|publisher=Citadel|year=1995|pages=174, 176–187|isbn=0-8065-1540-6[/tpl] Marcus Brody acts as Indiana's positive role model at the college. Indiana's own insecurities are made worse by the absence of his mother. In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, he becomes the father figure to Willie Scott and Short Round, to survive; he is rescued from Kali's evil by Short Round's dedication. Indiana also saves many enslaved children.[tpl]cite book|author=Douglas Brode|title=The Films of Steven Spielberg|publisher=Citadel|year=1995|pages=141–43|isbn=0-8065-1540-6[/tpl]
Because of Indiana's strained relationship with his father, who was absent much of Indiana's youth searching for the Holy Grail, the character does not pursue the more spiritual aspects of the cultures he studies.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet[/tpl] Indiana uses his knowledge of Shiva to defeat Mola Ram. In Raiders, however, he is wise enough to close his eyes in the presence of God in the Ark of the Covenant. By contrast, his rival Rene Belloq is killed for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God.
In the prologue of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Jones is seen as a teenager, establishing his look when given a hat. Indiana's intentions are revealed as prosocial, as he believes artifacts "belong in a museum." In the film's climax, Indiana undergoes "literal" tests of faith to retrieve the Grail and save his father's life. He also remembers Jesus as a historical figure – a humble carpenter – rather than an exalted figure when he recognizes the simple nature and tarnished appearance of the real Grail amongst a large assortment of much more ornately decorated ones. Henry Senior rescues his son from falling to his death when reaching for the fallen Grail, telling him to "let it go," overcoming his mercenary nature. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles explains how Indiana becomes solitary and less idealistic following his service in World War I.[tpl]cite news|author=Travis Fickett|title=Indiana Jones and the Small Screen|publisher=IGN|date=2008-05-22|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/875/875720p3.html|accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Jones is older and wiser, whereas his sidekicks Mutt and Mac are youthfully arrogant and greedy, respectively.[tpl]cite news|title=News, Etc.|publisher=Empire|date=March 2008|page=17[/tpl]

==Origins and inspirations==

Indiana Jones is modeled after the strong-jawed heroes of the matinée serials and pulp magazines that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg enjoyed in their childhoods (such as the Republic Pictures serials, and the Doc Savage series). Sir H. Rider Haggard's safari guide/big game hunter Allan Quatermain of King Solomon's Mines, who dates back to 1885, is a notable template for Jones."Based on a 1885 novel by Henry Rider Haggard, exploits of Allan Quartermain have long served as a template for the Indiana Jones character. King Solomon's Mines (1950), Quartermain finds himself unwillingly thrust into a worldwide search for the legendary mines of King Solomon. The look and feel of Indiana and his past adventures are quite apparent. Both Quartermain and Jones are confronted by angry villagers and a myriad of dangerous booby traps. Look to King Solomon's Mines for a good idea on the feel and tone Lucas and Spielberg are after with their latest Indiana Jones outing". Superheroflix.com.

Two of the possible bases for Indiana Jones are Professor Challenger, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1912 for his novel, The Lost World. Challenger was based on Doyle's physiology professor, Sir William Rutherford, an adventuring academic, albeit a zoologist/anthropologist.[tpl]cite news|title=This Month in History: Dr. Hamlett & Zoological Treasure Hunting|url=https://www.lsuhsc.edu/no/library/news/?p=7211|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LSUHeathNewOrleans|location=New Orleans LA[/tpl]
The character was originally named Indiana Smith, after an Alaskan Malamute Lucas owned in the 1970s (Indiana); the name was perhaps in a nod to the 1966 Western film Nevada Smith.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Spielberg disliked the name Smith, and Lucas casually suggested Jones as an alternative.
Lucas has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of British secret agent James Bond was one of the primary inspirations for Jones, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Bond Inspiration For Indiana Jones.

Costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis noted that the inspiration for the series as well as Indiana Jones' outfit was Charlton Heston's Harry Steele in Secret of the Incas (1954) and called Raiders of the Lost Ark "almost a shot for shot" remake of the Heston film, citing that Indiana Jones was "a kinder, gentler Harry Steele": "We did watch this film together as a crew several times, and I always thought it strange that the filmmakers did not credit it later as the inspiration for the series."[tpl]cite news|author=Mike French & Gilles Verschuere|title=Debora Nadoolman interview|publisher=TheRaider.net|date=2005-09-14|url=http://www.theraider.net/features/interviews/deborah_nadoolman.php|accessdate=2008-04-07[/tpl]

===Historical models===

Many people are said to be the real-life inspiration of the Indiana Jones character—although none of the following have been confirmed as inspirations by Lucas or Spielberg. There are some suggestions, listed here in alphabetical order by last name:

==Costume==

Upon requests by Spielberg and Lucas, the costume designer gave the character a distinctive silhouette through the styling of the hat; after examining many hats, the designers chose a tall-crowned, wide-brimmed fedora. As a documentary of Raiders pointed out, the hat served a practical purpose. Following the lead of the old "B"-movies that inspired the Indiana Jones series, the fedora hid the actor's face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly. Examples in Raiders include the wider-angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall, and Indy sliding under a fast-moving vehicle from front to back. Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time.
The hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to put it back on. In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head.[tpl]cite web | title=Hat and Jacket featurette | publisher=Official site | date=2008-02-08 | url=http://www.indianajones.com/site/?deeplink=videos/1/v28 | accessdate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same.

==Casting==

Originally, Spielberg suggested Harrison Ford; Lucas resisted the idea, since he had already cast the actor in American Graffiti, Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, and did not want Ford to become known as his "Bobby De Niro" (in reference to the fact that fellow director Martin Scorsese regularly casts Robert De Niro in his films). During an intensive casting process, Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors, and finally cast actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones. Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum, P.I. (which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings), forcing him to turn down the role. One of CBS's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders, both of which were to begin about the same time. However, Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for Magnum P.I. was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for Raiders had concluded.
After Spielberg suggested Ford again, Lucas gave in, and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began.
