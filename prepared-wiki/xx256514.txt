A cuckoo is a military slang term for a sniper, disguised in a  sprawling tree. This word has been particularly applied to the Finnish Winter War snipers and the World War II German snipers, who took pot-shots from hidden vantage points.
During World War II, before 1944, the German high command left many cuckoos behind as their armies retreated, in order to delay the Soviet rush.[tpl]cite magazine|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=LQ0tRtOXV-AC&pg=PA36&dq=cuckoo+sniper&hl=en&ei=wYIcTdKyF5HrOYKo2ZUJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=cuckoo%20sniper&f=false|title= Boys' Life |publisher= Boy Scouts of America, Inc.|date=Dec 1943|page=36[/tpl]
