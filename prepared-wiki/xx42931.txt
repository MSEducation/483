Pandora ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɔər|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|pan|DOHR|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Πανδώρα[/tpl]) is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated [tpl]nowrap|S/1980 S 26[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|IAUC 3532[/tpl] In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology.[tpl]sfn|IAUC 4157[/tpl] It is also designated as [tpl]nowrap|Saturn XVII[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|USGS: Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers[/tpl]
Pandora is the outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters [tpl]convert|30|km[/tpl] in diameter. Majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.[tpl]sfn|Solar System, NASA: Pandora[/tpl]
The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean motion resonances with Prometheus.[tpl]sfn|Renner et al. 2005[/tpl] The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years,[tpl]sfn|Spitale Jacobson et al.|2006[/tpl] when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about [tpl]convert|1400|km[/tpl]. Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.[tpl]sfn|Spitale Jacobson et al.|2006[/tpl]
From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.
