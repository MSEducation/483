Cheddleton Flint Mill is a water mill situated in the village of Cheddleton in the English county of Staffordshire. The mill was built to grind flint for use in the pottery industry. The mill complex includes two separate water mills, a miller's cottage, two flint kilns, a drying kiln and outbuildings, and is adjacent to the Caldon Canal. The complex has been restored and is now maintained and operated by the Cheddleton Flint Mill Industrial Heritage Trust.[tpl]cite web | title = Cheddleton Flint Mill Industrial Heritage Trust | url = http://www.people.ex.ac.uk/akoutram/cheddleton-mill/ | publisher =  Cheddleton Flint Mill Industrial Heritage Trust | accessdate = August 2, 2006 [/tpl]
