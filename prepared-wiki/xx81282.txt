[[Axiomatic semantics]]

CATEGORIES: Formal specification languages, Logic in computer science, Programming language semantics

Axiomatic semantics is an approach based on mathematical logic to proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to Hoare logic. 
Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statements - predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.
