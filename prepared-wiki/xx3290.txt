</ref> Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. That form was developed mainly by American Protestant [[missionary|missionaries]] during 1820–1826. They assigned letters from the Latin alphabet that corresponded to the Hawaiian sounds.
Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools were established where all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian. Also, the University of Hawaii developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.
Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowels. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a macron (kahakō).  Also, Hawaiian uses the glottal stop as a consonant ([tpl]okina[/tpl]okina). It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or opening single quote.
Hawaiian-language newspapers published from 1834–1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The [tpl]okina[/tpl]okina and kahakō are intended to help non-native speakers.
A sign language for the deaf, based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s.  Hawaiʻi Sign Language is now nearly extinct.

====Hawaiian Pidgin====

Some locals speak Hawaii Creole English (HCE), often called "pidgin". The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also has words from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration (mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—and especially from the Azores archipelago—and Spain), caused a variant of English to develop. By the early 20th century pidgin speakers had children who acquired the pidgin as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic. Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants or animals. For example, tuna fish are often called ahi.
HCE speakers have modified the meanings of certain English words. For example, "aunty" and "uncle" refer to any adult who is a friend, or to show respect for an elder. Grammar is also different. For example, instead of "It is hot today, isn't it?", an HCE speaker would say simply "stay hot, eh?" When a word does not come to mind quickly, the term "da kine" refers to any word you cannot think of. Through the surfing boom in Hawaii, HCE has influenced surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as brah and da kine, have found their way to other places.

===Religion===

The largest denominations by number of adherents were the Catholic Church with 249,619 in 2010[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/15/rcms2010_15_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives | State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 68,128 in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/statistical-information|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080730060850/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/statistical-information|archivedate=July 30, 2008 |title=LDS Newsroom Statistical Information |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] The third largest group are the non-denominational churches with 128 congregations and 32,000 members, the third largest are the United Church of Christ with 115 congregations and 20,000 members.

According to data provided by religious establishments, religion in Hawaii in 2000 was distributed as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2000 |title=State of Hawaii Data Book 2000, Section 1 Population, Table 1.47 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Sep/21/il/il11afaith.html |title=Survey shows partial picture |publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=September 21, 2002 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]
"Other" are religions other than Christianity, Buddhism, or Judaism; this group includes Bahá'í Faith, Confucianism, Daoism, the Hawaiian religion, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism, and other religions.
"Unaffiliated" refers to people who do not belong to a congregation; this group includes agnostics, atheists, humanists, deists and the irreligious.
A Pew poll found that the religious composition was as follows:U.S. Religion Map and Religious Populations - U.S. Religious Landscape Study - Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life
A 2010 Glenmary Research Center study also places the Roman Catholic population as greater than 22%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.glenmary.org/site/files/919/133180/443856/608807/Population_Penetration.pdf |title=Population Penetration, Catholic Church Adherents in the United States, 2010 |work=Religious Congregations and Membership Study 2010: Mapping the Catholic Data |year=2012 |publisher=Glenmary Research Center |location=Fairfield, OH, USA |accessdate=May 7, 2012[/tpl]
A special case is Ho[tpl]okina[/tpl]oponopono, an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with prayer. It is both philosophy and way of life. Traditionally ho[tpl]okina[/tpl]oponopono is practiced by healing priests or kahuna lapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]au among family members of a person who is physically ill.

===LGBT===

A 2012 poll by Gallup found that Hawaii had the largest proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults in the country, at 5.1 per cent. This constitutes a total LGBT adult population estimate of 53,966 individuals. The number of same-sex couple households in 2010 stood at 3,239. This grew by 35.45% from a decade earlier."LGBT Percentage Highest in D.C., Lowest in North Dakota". State of the States. Gallup Politics. 15 February 2013Williams Inst.

==Economy==

The history of Hawaii can be traced through a succession of dominant industries: sandalwood,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&PageID=274 |title=Hawaii sandalwood trade |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] whaling,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&PageID=287 |title=Whaling in Hawaii |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] sugarcane (see Sugar plantations in Hawaii), pineapple, military, tourism, and education. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the Gross State Product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The gross output for the state in 2003 was US$47 billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents was US$30,441.
Hawaiian exports include food and apparel. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, however, due to the considerable shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the United States. Food exports include coffee (see coffee production in Hawaii), macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane, and both honey[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaiibeekeepers.org/history.php |title=A History of Honey Bees in the Hawaiian Islands| accessdate=December 15, 2011[/tpl] and honeybees: "by weight, Hawaii's honeybees may be the state's most valuable export."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2012/apr/23/hawaii-honeybees-vie-for-most-valuable-export/ |title=Hawaii honeybees vie for most valuable export| accessdate=December 15, 2011[/tpl] Agricultural sales for 2002, according to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, were US$370.9 million from diversified agriculture, US$100.6 million from pineapple, and US$64.3 million from sugarcane. Hawaii's relatively constant climate has attracted the Genetically modified food research industry which is able to test three generations of crops in a single year on the islands as compared to one or two on the mainland.[tpl]cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/hawaii-genetically-engineered-crop-flash-point |title=Hawaii is genetically engineered crop flash point |last1=McAVOY |first1=AUDREY |date=19 April 2014 |website=ap.org |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=19 April 2014[/tpl]
Hawaii was one of the few states to control gasoline prices through a Gas Cap Law. Since oil company profits in Hawaii compared to the mainland U.S. were under scrutiny, the law tied local gasoline prices to those of the mainland. It took effect in September 2005 amid price fluctuations caused by Hurricane Katrina, but was suspended in April 2006.
Hawaiian Electric Industries provides electricity (mostly from fossil-fuel power stations) to 95% of the state's population.

According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Hawaii had the fourth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 7.18 percent.[tpl]cite web|last=Frank|first=Robert|title=Top states for millionaires per capita|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101338309|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl]

===Taxation===

Hawaii has a relatively high state tax burden. In 2003, Hawaii residents had the highest state tax per capita at US$2,838.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] This is partly because education, health care and social services are all provided directly by the state, as opposed to local government in all other states.[tpl]synthesis-inline|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Millions of tourists contribute to the tax take by paying the general excise tax and hotel room tax; thus not all taxes come directly from residents. Business leaders, however, consider the state's tax burden too high, contributing to both higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/21/news/story1.html |title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=November 30, 2006 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]

===Cost of living===

The cost of living in Hawaii, specifically Honolulu, is quite high compared to most major cities in the United States. However, the cost of living in Honolulu is 6.7% lower than in New York City and 3.6% lower than in San Francisco.Cost of Living Wizard on The New York Times website These numbers may not take into account certain costs, such as increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers "outside the continental United States". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii,FreeShipping.org for examples of stores that ship free to Hawaii many merchants exclude Hawaii and Alaska, as well as Puerto Rico and certain other US territories.
The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 US Census was $272,700 while the national median home value was less than half of that, at $119,600. Hawaii home values were the highest of all states, including California with a median home value of $211,500.Historic Housing Values on www.census.gov More recent research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu, Hawaii at $607,600 and the US median sales price at $173,200. The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any US city in 2010, just above the "Silicon Valley" area of California ($602,000).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realtor.org/research/research/metroprice |title=Metropolitan Median Prices |publisher=Realtor.org |date=February 15, 2005 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]
One of the most significant contributors to the high cost of living in Hawaii is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also known as the Jones Act), which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports (a practice known as cabotage).  Most U.S. consumer goods are manufactured in East Asia at present, but because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with those goods cannot stop in Honolulu, offload Hawaii-bound goods, load mainland-bound Hawaii-manufactured goods, and continue to West Coast ports.  Instead, they must proceed directly to the West Coast, where distributors break bulk and send Hawaiian-bound Asian-manufactured goods back west across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |work=Hawaii Business Magazine |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-03-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-12/u-dot-s-dot-law-restricting-foreign-ships-leads-to-higher-gas-prices/ |title=U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices - |first=Matthew |last=Philips |date=2013-12-12 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |accessdate=2014-03-14[/tpl]
Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods again across the Pacific on U.S.-flagged ships subject to the extremely high operating costs imposed by the Jones Act.  This also makes Hawaii less competitive with West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from home countries with much higher taxes (like Japan), even though prices for Asian-manufactured goods in theory should be cheaper since Hawaii is much closer to Asia.[tpl]cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |title=U.S.-only shipping rule praised, blasted; Backers and foes of the Jones Act make their case before the Legislature |first=Russ |last=Lynch |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=April 4, 1997 |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher= Black Press Group Ltd |issn=0439-5271|id=[tpl]OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098[/tpl] |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2012/bills/SR11_.HTM |title=SR11.DOC |first=Sam |last=Slom |authorlink=Sam Slom |work=Hawaii State Legislature |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher=Hawaii State Legislature |year=26th Legislature, 2012 |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] 2012 resolution introduced requesting Congress to exempt Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Puerto Rico from the Jones Act.

==Culture==

The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian. Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast Polynesian triangle of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains only as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are reenactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences are strong enough to affect the United States at large, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of luaus and hula.

===Cuisine of Hawaii===

The Cuisine of Hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, particularly of American, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Polynesian and Portuguese origins, including plant and animal food sources imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii.  Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous plate lunch featuring the Asian staple, two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American macaroni salad (consisting of macaroni and mayonnaise), and a variety of different toppings ranging from the hamburger patty, a fried egg, and gravy of a Loco Moco, Japanese style tonkatsu or the traditional lu'au favorite, kalua pig and beef, and curry.

===Customs and etiquette in Hawaii===

Some key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: When visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift (for example, a dessert) for one's host. Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawai‘i families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is customary at Hawai'i weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a Money dance (also called the pandango). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as "locals of Hawaii" or "people of Hawaii".

===Folklore in Hawaii===

The folklore in Hawaii in modern times is a mixture of various aspects of Hawaiian mythology and various urban legends that have been passed on regarding various places in the Hawaiian islands. According to Hawaiian legend, night marchers (huaka‘i po in Hawaiian) are ghosts of ancient warriors. Local folklore on the island of Oahu says that one should never carry pork over the Pali Highway connecting Honolulu and Windward Oahu. In Paradise Park and the Manoa Falls Hiking Trail, folk legends say you can hear a spectre screaming. Across the street from Kahala Mall is a graveyard. It is said that if you drive past the remaining portion of this graveyard with your windows open, you will feel somebody else is in your car. The story of the green lady is that of a woman who would visit the gulch of Wahiawa and will take any child that she comes across.

===Hawaiian mythology===

Hawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general Polynesian mythology, developing its own unique character for several centuries before about 1800. It is associated with the Hawaiian religion. The religion was officially suppressed in the 19th century, but kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.thumb|160px|A statue of Hawaiian deityProminent figures and terms include Aumakua, the spirit of an ancestor or family god and Kāne, the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.

===List of Hawaiian state parks===

There are many Hawaiian state parks. The main Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i (island) has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.
Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i has the Ahukini State Recreation Pier, six state parks, and the
Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park. Maui has two state monuments, several state parks, and the Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area. Moloka‘i has the Pala'au State Park. O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu has several state parks, a number of state recreation areas, and a number of monuments, including the Ulu Pō Heiau State Monument.

===Literature in Hawaii===

The literature in Hawaii is diverse and includes authors such as Kiana Davenport, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, and Kaui Hart Hemmings, author of The Descendants. Hawaiian magazines include Hana Hou!, Hawaii Business Magazine and Honolulu, among others.

===Music of Hawaii===

The music of Hawaii includes an array of traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop. Hawaii's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state's small size. Styles like slack-key guitar are well-known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar.Unterberger, pgs. 465 - 473
Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state's musical heritage. The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge. Their music is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music. Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the music of other Polynesian islands; indeed, music author Peter Manuel called the influence of Hawaiian music a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".Manuel, pgs. 236 - 241

===Polynesian mythology===

Polynesian mythology is the oral traditions of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island archipelagos in the Polynesian triangle together with the scattered cultures known as the Polynesian outliers. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as Proto-Polynesian that was probably spoken in the Tonga - Samoa area around 1000 BC.
Prior to the 15th century AD, Polynesian people fanned out to the east, to the Cook Islands, and from there to other groups such as Tahiti and the Marquesas. Their descendants later discovered the islands from Tahiti to Rapa Nui, and later Hawai‘i and New Zealand.
Latest research puts the settlement of New Zealand at about 1300 AD. The various Polynesian languages are all part of the Austronesian language family. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to permit communication between some other language speakers. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organisation, childrearing, as well as horticulture, building and textile technologies; their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The various Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions, that is, legends or myths traditionally considered to recount the history of ancient times (the time of "pō") and the adventures of gods (“atua”) and deified ancestors.

==Tourism==

Tourism is an important part of the Hawaii economy. In 2003 alone, according to state government data, there were over 6.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with expenditures of over $10 billion.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hawaii State DBEDT|title=Overview of All Visitors|journal=Summary of 2003 Visitors to Hawaii|year=2003|page=pp 2|url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2003-annual-visitor.pdf|accessdate=February 23, 2012[/tpl] Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. The summer months and major holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, however, especially when residents of the rest of the United States are looking to escape from cold, winter weather. The Japanese, with their economic and historical ties to Hawaii and the USA as well as relative geographical proximity, are also principal tourists.
Hawaii is home to numerous cultural events. The annual Merrie Monarch Festival is an international Hula competition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/current/il/merriemonarch05 |title=Merrie Monarch Festival 2005|publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] The state is also home to the Hawaii International Film Festival, the premier film festival for Pacific rim cinema.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://www.travelweekly.com/Hawaii-Travel/Insights/Hawaii-International-Film-Festival--Kinship-through-cinema/?a=hawaii |title=Hawaii International Film Festival: Kinship through cinema |journal=Travel Weekly|first=Shane |last=Nelson | publisher=Northstar Travel Media |location=Secaucus, NJ, USA |date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012 |oclc=60626324 [/tpl] Honolulu is also home to the state's long running GLBT film festival, the Rainbow Film Festival.[tpl]cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.hnlnow.com/events/index.php?com=detail&eID=10075&year=2008&month=5 |title=19th Annual Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival at Doris Duke Theatre :: Honolulu Hawaii Nightlife Event Guide |publisher=Hnlnow.com |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/05/29/features/index.html |title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Features |publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com |date=May 29, 2001 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]

==Health==

Hawaii's health care system insures 92% (2009) of residents. Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week. Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps keep the cost to employers down. Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses (measured as a percentage of state GDP) are substantially lower. Given these achievements, proponents of universal health care elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.

==Education==

===Public schools===

Hawaii has the only school system within the United States that is unified statewide. Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state Board of Education. The Board sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the state Department of Education. The Department of Education is divided into seven districts, four on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and one for each of the three other counties. The main rationale for centralization is to combat inequalities between highly populated O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and the more rural Neighbor Islands, and between lower-income and more affluent areas. In most of the United States, schools are funded from local property taxes. Educators struggle with children of non-native-English-speaking immigrants, whose cultures are different from those of the mainland (where most course materials and testing standards originate).
Public elementary, middle, and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act. Some of the gap has been attributed to the Hawaii Board of Education's requirement that all eligible students take these tests and report all student test scores (other states, Texas and Michigan for example, do not). Results reported in August 2005, indicate that of 282 schools across the state, 185 (2/3) failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in math and reading.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070318182117/http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archivedate=2007-03-18 |title=Two-Thirds Of Hawaii Schools Do Not Meet Requirements – Education News Story – KITV Honolulu |publisher=Thehawaiichannel.com |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl] On the other hand, the ACT college placement tests show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9).Honolulu Advertiser, August 17, 2005, p. B1 In the widely accepted SAT examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.

===Private schools===

Collectively, independent educational institutions of primary and secondary education have one of the highest percentages of enrollment of any state. During the 2011-2012 school year, Hawaii public and charter schools had an enrollment of 181,213,[tpl]cite web |url=http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/COMM/DOEPRESS.NSF/a1d7af052e94dd120a2561f7000a037c/81c3aa4a36044f930a257927007ab8d5?OpenDocument |title=News - Official 2011-12 Public and Charter School Enrollment |publisher=Hawai'i Department of Education |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |work=Hawaii Public Schools |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2012[/tpl] while private schools had 37,695.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hais.org/uploads/file/about_stats_hcpsenrollrpt12.pdf#page=3 |title=PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT REPORT 2011-2012 |first=Cynthia |last=Jordan |work=Hawaii Association of Independent Schools |publisher=Hawaii Association of Independent Schools |location=Honolulu, HI |date=October 10, 2011 |page=3 |accessdate=May 12, 2012[/tpl] Private schools thus educated over 17% of the students that school year, nearly three times the approximate national average of 6%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009062.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090919172601/http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009062.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-19 |title=Projections of Education Statistics to 2018 |first1=William J. |last1=Hussar |first2=Tabitha M. |last2=Bailey |work=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Home Page, a part of the U.S. Department of Education |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics |location=Washington, DC |date=September 11, 2009 |page=6 (22 out of 68)|accessdate=May 12, 2012[/tpl] It has four of the largest independent schools: [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani School, Kamehameha Schools, Mid-Pacific Institute, and Punahou School. The second Buddhist high school in the United States, and first Buddhist high school in Hawaii, Pacific Buddhist Academy, was founded in 2003. The first native controlled public charter school was the Kanu O Ka Aina New Century Charter School.
Independent and charter schools can select their students, while the regular public schools must take all students in their district. The Kamehameha Schools are the only schools in the United States that openly grant admission to students based on ancestry, and the wealthiest schools in the United States, if not the world, having over nine billion US dollars in estate assets. In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.

===Colleges and universities===

Graduates of secondary schools in Hawaii often enter directly into the work force. Some attend colleges and universities on the mainland or other countries, and the rest attend an institution of higher learning in Hawaii.
The largest is the University of Hawaii System. It consists of: the research university at Mānoa; two comprehensive campuses Hilo and West O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu; and seven Community Colleges.
Private universities include Brigham Young University–Hawaii, Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawaii Pacific University, and Wayland Baptist University.
The Saint Stephen Diocesan Center is a seminary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.
Kona hosts the University of the Nations, which is not an accredited university.

The state government of Hawaii is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from the kingdom era of Hawaiian history. As codified in the Constitution of Hawaii, there are three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial.
The executive branch is led by the Governor of Hawaii assisted by the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, both elected on the same ticket. The governor is the only state public official elected statewide; all others are appointed by the governor. The lieutenant governor acts as the Secretary of State. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the State Capitol. The official residence of the governor is Washington Place. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Hawaii State Legislature, which is composed of the 51-member Hawaii House of Representatives led by the Speaker of the House and the 25-member Hawaii Senate led by the President of the Senate. The Legislature meets at the State Capitol.
The unified judicial branch of Hawaii is the Hawai'i State Judiciary. The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Hawaii, which uses Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale as its chambers. Unique to Hawaii is the lack of municipal governments. All local governments are administered at the county level. The only incorporated area in the state is a consolidated city–county, Honolulu County, which governs the entire island of Oahu. County executives are referred to as mayors: The mayor of Hawaii County, mayor of Honolulu, mayor of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and mayor of Maui. The mayors are all elected in nonpartisan races.

===Political subdivisions===

The movement of the Hawaiian royal family from the Big Island to Maui, and subsequently to O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, explains why population centers exist where they do today. Kamehameha III chose the largest city, Honolulu, as his capital because of its natural harbor, the present-day Honolulu Harbor.
Now the state capital, Honolulu is located along the southeast coast of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu. The previous capital was Lahaina, Maui, and before that Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Some major towns are Hilo; Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe; Kailua; Pearl City; Waipahu; Kahului; Kailua-Kona. Kīhei; and Līhu[tpl]okina[/tpl]e.
Hawaii comprises five counties: Hawaii County, Honolulu County, Kauai County, Kalawao County, and Maui County.

===Federal government===

Hawaii is represented in the United States Congress by two Senators and two Representatives. All four are Democrats. Colleen Hanabusa represents the 1st congressional district in the House, representing southeastern Oahu, including central Honolulu. Tulsi Gabbard represents the 2nd congressional district, representing the rest of the state, which is mainly rural.
Brian Schatz is the senior United States Senator from Hawaii.  He was appointed to the office on the December 26, 2012, by Governor Neil Abercrombie, following the death of former Senator Daniel Inouye.  The state's junior senator is Mazie Hirono, the former Representative from the 2nd congressional district.  Hirono owns the distinction of being the first Asian American female and first Buddhist senators.  Hawaii incurred the biggest seniority shift between the 112th the 113th Congress. The Aloha state went from a delegation with senators who were first and 21st in seniority before Inouye’s death and Senator Daniel Akaka’s retirement, to senators who are 87th and 93rd.[tpl]cite web|last=Blackwell |first=Sarah |url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/01/04/the-junior-senior-senators/ |title=msnbc's The Daily Rundown, 23 December 2009, accessed 6 January 2012 |publisher=nbcnews.com |date=January 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2013[/tpl]
Federal officials in Hawaii are based at the Prince Kūhiō Federal Building near the Aloha Tower and Honolulu Harbor in Honolulu. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service and the Secret Service maintain their offices there, and the building is also the site of the federal District Court for the District of Hawaii and the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii.

====National politics====

Since gaining statehood and participating in its first election in 1960, Hawaii has supported Democrats in every presidential election but two (1972 and 1984, both landslide victories for Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan respectively). During that time, only Minnesota has supported Republican candidates fewer times in presidential elections.
In 2004, John Kerry won the state's four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, favorite son candidate Senator Hiram Fong of Hawaii sought the Republican presidential nomination, while Patsy Mink ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.
Honolulu native Barack Obama, then serving as United States Senator from Illinois, was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and was reelected for a second term on November 6, 2012. Obama had won the Hawaiian Democratic Caucus on February 19, 2008 with 76% of the vote. He was the third Hawaii-born candidate to seek the nomination of a major party and the first presidential nominee from Hawaii.[tpl]cite web|last=Rudin |first=Ken |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2009/12/todays_junkie_segment_on_totn_5.html |title=NPR's Political Junkie, 23 December 2009, accessed 30 December 2009 |publisher=Npr.org |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Heard on Tell Me More |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=96126355 |title=Asian Writer Ponders First Asian President Too |publisher=Npr.org |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl]

==Transportation==

A system of state highways encircles each main island. Only O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu has federal highways, and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed Interstate highways. Travel can be slow due to narrow winding roads, and congestion in populated places.  Each major island has a public bus system.
Honolulu International Airport (IATA:HNL), which shares runways with the adjacent Hickam Field (IATA:HIK), is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii. The commercial aviation airport offers intercontinental service to North America, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Within Hawaii, Hawaiian Airlines, Mokulele Airlines and go! use jets between the larger airports in Honolulu, Līhu[tpl]okina[/tpl]e, Kahului, Kona and Hilo, while Island Air and Pacific Wings serve smaller airports. These airlines also provide air freight service amongst the islands.
Until air passenger service became available in the 1920s,[tpl]cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-commercial-aviation/inter-island-airways-hawaiian-airlines |title=Inter-Island Airways/Hawaiian Airlines — Hawaii Aviation |first=William J. |last=Horvat |work=Hawaii's Aviation History |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher=State of Hawaii  |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] private boats were the sole means of traveling between the islands.
Seaflite operated hydrofoils between the major islands in the mid-1970s. The Hawaii Superferry operated between O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and Maui between December 2007 and March 2009, with additional routes planned for other islands. Legal issues over environmental impact statements and protests ended the service, though the company operating Superferry has expressed a wish to begin ferry service again at a future date.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090329_Aloha_Superferry |title= Aloha, Superferry Alakai leaves Hawaii to find job |location=Honolulu, HI, USA  |publisher= Black Press Group Ltd |issn=0439-5271|id=[tpl]OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098[/tpl]  |date= March 29, 2009 [/tpl] Currently there is passenger ferry service in Maui County between Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and Maui,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.molokaiferry.com/ferry.html |title=Maui Molokai Ferry on Molokai Princess and Maui Princess |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] and between Lana[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and Maui,[tpl]cite web |url= https://ssl.go-lanai.com/ |title=Expeditions: Maui - Lana[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Ferry Service |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] though neither of these takes vehicles.

===Rail===

At one time Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that helped move farm commodities as well as passengers. These railroads were all [tpl]RailGauge|3ft[/tpl] narrow gauge for the majority; although there were some [tpl]RailGauge|2ft6in[/tpl] gauge on some of the smaller islands. Standard US gauge is [tpl]RailGauge|4ft8.5in[/tpl]. The largest railroad by far was the Oahu Railway and Land Company (OR&L) which ran multiple lines from Honolulu across the western and northern part of Oahu.Hawaiian Railway Album – WW II Photographs Vol 2; Victor Norton Jr. and Gale E. Treiber; 2005; Railroad Press – Hanover, PA
The OR&L was an important player moving troops and goods during World War II. Traffic on this line was busy enough that there were signals on the lines facilitating movement of trains and wigwag signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists. The main line was officially abandoned in 1947; although part of it was bought by the US Navy and operated until 1970. Thirteen miles (21 km) of track remain and preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project aims to add elevated passenger rail on Oahu to relieve highway congestion.
