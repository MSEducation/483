A green sport event is a sporting event that stresses utilizing greener resources. Fans can do their part by riding public transportation to the event. People are being more aware of many things, like using earth friendly paper products, fertilizer and pesticides.Zeller, Tom, Jr. "Getting Sports Events to Go Green."

==Third dimension==

One week after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the XVII Olympic Winter Games to Lillehammer, national, local and regional governments decided to make the Lillehammer Games a showcase for GREEN mega-events. More than 200 different projects with environmental aspects were carried out. And at IOC's 100Â years celebration in Paris in 1994, environment was added as the Third Dimension to the Olympics in addition to Sport and Culture.
The legacy from Lillehammer has, in a global perspective, followed two paths:
- World Conferences on sport and environment, the first in Lillehammer in 1996
- Environmental requirements which have to be met by future bidders and organisers of Olympic Games.
