==History==

In 1942 the Japanese Empire invaded Dutch East Indies and ruled Java until they were defeated in 1945. Sukarno proclaimed the independence of Indonesian Republic on August 1945. In September 1945, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and Sri Paku Alam VIII promptly sent a letter to Sukarno expressing his support to the newly-born nation of Indonesia and acknowledge Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of Indonesian Republic. The Sunanate of Surakarta also doing the same, and both of the Javanese kingdoms realm are awarded special status as Special Region within Indonesian Republic. However because leftist anti-royalist uprising in Surakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta lost its special administrative status in 1946 and absorbed into Central Java Province.
Yogyakarta's support was essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). The city of Yogyakarta became the capital of the Indonesian Republic from January 1946 to December 1948 after the fall of Jakarta to the Dutch. Later, the Dutch also invaded Yogyakarta causing the Indonesian Republic's capital to be transferred again to Bukittinggi in West Sumatra on 19 December 1948. In return for Yogyakarta's support, the declaration of Special Authority over Yogyakarta was granted in full in 1950 and the region became its own region. Because of its significant contribution for the survival of the Indonesian Republic, Yogyakarta was given the status as Special Administrative Region, making Yogyakarta the only region headed by a monarchy in Indonesia.
The Special Region was struck by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake on 27 May 2006. It killed 5,782 people and injured approximately 36,000. 600,000 people were left homeless.[tpl]cite news | date = 2006-06-06 | title = Indonesia lowers quake death toll | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/indonesia.quake/ | publisher = CNN | accessdate = 2006-06-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615194254/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/05/indonesia.quake/  |archivedate = 2006-06-15[/tpl] The region of Bantul suffered the most damage and deaths.
