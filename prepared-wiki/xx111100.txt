[[Georgi–Jarlskog mass relation]]

CATEGORIES: Particle physics

In grand unified theories of the SU(5) or SO(10) type, there is a mass relation predicted between the electron and the down quark, the muon and the strange quark and the tau lepton and the bottom quark called the Georgi–Jarlskog mass relations. The relations were formulated by Howard Georgi and Cecilia Jarlskog.Georgi H., Jarlskog C. A new lepton-quark mass relation in a unified theory (1979) Physics Letters B, 86 (3-4), pp. 297-300.
At GUT scale, these are sometimes quoted as:
