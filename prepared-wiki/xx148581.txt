==Synopsis==

The plot of the movie is convoluted and rather loose. It concerns a man dressed as priest who gathers together a group of teen boys, both American and European, and takes them to a beach on the Mediterranean Sea. There he has plans to stage a play based on the biblical Book of Genesis.
Throughout the movie, the boys in question are frequently entirely nude and are shown frolicking in the surf, building shelters, driving a van and climbing up cliffs.  The storyline is largely stream-of-consciousness and starts many threads it then leaves unfinished.

==Controversy==

==Rating==

The MPAA film classification database lists an X rating for the film.MPAA  ratings database search on main page
"The Genesis Children is really a very benign film. It was only the cumulative amount of nudity and the closeup shots of the pelvic area that brought about the X decision. Even the violence of the scene in which the boys attack the bus is well within the R category," said Dr. Aaron Stern, director of MPAA's code and rating administration.Swisher, Viola Hegyi: "Generating The Genesis Children", After Dark,  September 1972, p. 18
