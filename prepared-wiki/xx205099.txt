Personal Jukebox is a compilation album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in 2000 on WEA/Warner Music.
In the Spring of 2000 Alice returned to the Sanremo music festival, nineteen years after the victory with "Per Elisa". The song she performed, Juri Camisasca's "Il giorno dell'indipendenza" ("The Day of Independence"), was also the opening track on the career retrospective Personal Jukebox, alongside two other new recordings, "Tutto Ã¨ niente" ("All Is Nothing") and an Italian language cover version of David Bowie/Pat Metheny Group's "This is Not America" with new lyrics by the singer herself.
Personal Jukebox also contains four singles from Alice's then most recent pop albums Exit (1998) and Charade (1995), the original versions of "In viaggio sul tuo viso" from 1992's Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi and "Visioni" from 1989's Il sole nella pioggia licensed from EMI, as well as new interpretations of some of her best-known songs from the 1980s, among them "Chan-son Egocentrique" (a duet with Italian alternative rock band Bluvertigo), "Prospettiva Nevski", "A Cosa Pensano", "Nomadi", "Il vento caldo dell'estate", a technofied take on "Per Elisa" and an orchestral solo version of "I treni di Tozeur".
