CATEGORIES: Pakistani Sufis, 1975 deaths, 1912 births

Mir Sikandar Khan Khoso (1912â€“1975) was a poet, politician, and well-known landowner from the Jacobabad District in Sindh, Pakistan. He was the youngest son of Mir Bahadur Khan Khoso.
He was a devout Sufi who entered politics with a vision to serve humanity after the death of his brother, Khan Sahib Shahal Khan Khoso. He was a humble man who never kept his door closed for the poor people. Whenever he was needed he served them with all his efforts. He introduced Mir Dariya Khan Khoso into politics; by defeating the political giant Mir Jafar Khan Jamali he proved his coin there.
Mir Sikandar Khan published his first book of Sufi lyrics under the name Subh Mein Punhoon Paan in 1973. The following lyrics were adapted into a kafi by the late musician Ustad Muhammad Juman in 1974 on Radio Pakistan in Hyderabad:
 
 "Ishq munjhoon izhar thee ayo nehin karey nirwar thee ayo."
