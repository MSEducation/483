Gateshead is a large town in Tyne and Wear, England and is the main settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Historically, it was part of County Durham prior to the creation of Tyne and Wear in 1974. The large urban town lies on the southern bank of the River Tyne opposite Newcastle upon Tyne and together they form the urban core of the Tyneside conurbation. Gateshead and Newcastle are joined by seven bridges across the Tyne, including the landmark Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The town is well known for its iconic architecture such as the Sage Gateshead, the Angel of the North and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art.

==History==

There has been a settlement on the Gateshead side of the River Tyne, around the old river crossing where the Swing Bridge now stands, since Roman times.
Theories of the derivation of the name 'Gateshead' include 'head of the (Roman) road' or 'goatâ€™s headland', as the River Tyne at this point was once roamed by goats.
