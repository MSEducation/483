==Biography==

Bank was born in Philadelphia; her father, a neurologist, died of leukemia in his late 50s."A Polished Act (Interview)," The Guardian (July 19, 1999). Bank attended Hobart and William Smith Colleges,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/garden/at-home-with-melissa-bank-so-familiar-so-private.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=AT HOME WITH: MELISSA BANK; So Familiar, So Private |author=Julie V. Iovine |work=The New York Times |date=1999-07-22 |accessdate=2013-05-06[/tpl] and has an MFA from Cornell University.  Bank's literary influences include Vladmir Nabokov, John Cheever, Billy Collins, and Grace Paley; her favorite nonfiction writer is Janet Malcolm.

===The Girls' Guide to Hunting And Fishing===

The Girls' Guide to Hunting And Fishing took Bank twelve years to write. Most of that time Bank worked as a copywriter, focusing on the novel in her spare time. About five years before the book was published, Bank was involved in a serious bicycle accident where she was struck by a car. She landed on her head, and even though she was wearing a helmet, she suffered post-concussion syndrome for almost two years. This condition affected her short-term memory and deprived her of the "top 10 to 15% of her vocabulary"; she was unable to order information or perform sequential thinking. Bank had to stop writing the book during this period.
Finally published in 1999, The Girls' Guide to Hunting And Fishing was a bestseller in both the United States and the United Kingdom, garnering mostly positive reviews. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Bank writes like John Cheever, but funnier.""The Best Books of 1999: The Best Fiction of 1999", Los Angeles Times (Dec. 5, 1999). Newsweek critic Yahlin Chang wrote, "Bank draws exquisite portraits of loneliness, and she can do it in a sentence."Chang, Yahlin. "A Hot Young Writer You Can Bank On," Newsweek (May 31, 1999). Others placed Bank in the school of restraint exemplified by Hemingway and Raymond Carver.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
