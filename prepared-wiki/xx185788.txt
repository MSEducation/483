In its short history, Mountain Jam has become one of the top music festivals in the U.S. and the premier festival in the Northeast.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Rolling Stone Magazine named the Mountain Jam Festival one of the Top 8 Music Festivals in the Country.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Mountain Jam was an independent music festival produced by locally owned and operated WDST/Radio Woodstock and  Warren Haynes. Mountain Jam began in 2005 as a one-day celebration of the 25th anniversary of radio station WDST-FM, based in Utopia Studios in Woodstock, New York.
The Festival had grown to feature over 60 bands on 4 stages. The two main stages are positioned next to one another, so that the music runs non-stop on these stages, without any over-lapping. An indoor stage and an Acoustic Stage also featured.
After the sale to Town Square Media, the festival has been reduced to 40 bands on three stages and many prices increased.
