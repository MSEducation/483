[[Reversing (vehicle maneuver)]]

CATEGORIES: Driving techniques

Reversing (also known as backing up) is the process of driving a vehicle in the reverse direction in order to maneuver.  Rear view mirrors are standard equipment for this endeavor.  Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras.  Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a warning beep whilst reversing.
Reversing a vehicle can serve the purpose of changing lanes in traffic when a driver wishes to change to an adjacent lane but the destination lane is relatively jammed with vehicles (backed up). This is performed by driving in the reverse direction until the vehicle can move into the adjacent lane (or adjacent lanes) at the back of the queue in the next lane.
