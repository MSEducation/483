The Colossus of Rhodes ([tpl]lang-grc|Ὁ Κολοσσὸς Ῥόδιος|Ho Kolossòs Rhódios[/tpl]) was a statue of the Greek god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. It is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was constructed to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC. Before its destruction in the earthquake of 226 BC, the Colossus of Rhodes stood over [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] high,Reynold Higgens, "The Colossus of Rhodes", The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, edited by Peter A.

==Siege of Rhodes==

In the late 4th century BC, Rhodes, allied with Ptolemy I of Egypt, prevented a massive invasion staged by their common enemy, Antigonus I Monophthalmus.
In 304 BC a relief force of ships sent by Ptolemy arrived, and Antigonus's army abandoned the siege, leaving most of their siege equipment. To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians sold the equipment left behind for 300 talentsPliny's Natural History xxxiv.18. and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god, Helios. Construction was left to the direction of Chares, a native of Lindos in Rhodes, who had been involved with large-scale statues before. His teacher, the sculptor Lysippos, had constructed a [tpl]convert|22|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] highForty cubits high, according to Pliny the Elder (Natural History xxxiv.18). bronze statue of Zeus at Tarentum.

==Construction==

The construction began in 292 BC. Ancient accounts, which differ to some degree, describe the structure as being built with iron tie bars to which brass plates were fixed to form the skin. The interior of the structure, which stood on a [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] high white marble pedestal near the Mandraki harbour entrance, was then filled with stone blocks as construction progressed.Accounts of Philo of Byzantium ca. 150 B.C. and Pliny (Plineus Caius Secundus) ca. 50 A.D. based on viewing the broken remains Other sources place the Colossus on a breakwater in the harbour. The statue itself was over [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] tall. Much of the iron and bronze was reforged from the various weapons Demetrius's army left behind, and the abandoned second siege tower may have been used for scaffolding around the lower levels during construction. Upper portions were built with the use of a large earthen ramp. During the building, workers would pile mounds of dirt on the sides of the colossus. Upon completion all of the dirt was removed and the colossus was left to stand alone. After twelve years, in 280 BC, the statue was completed. Preserved in Greek anthologies of poetry is what is believed to be the genuine dedication text for the Colossus.Anthologia Graeca 4, 171 H. Beckby (Munich 1957)
Modern engineers have put forward a plausible hypothesis for the statue construction, based on the technology of those days (which was not based on the modern principles of earthquake engineering), and the accounts of Philo and Pliny who both saw and described the remains.[tpl]cite book |title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2203-6 |chapter=Engineering Aspects of the Collapse of the Colossus of Rhodes Statue |pages=69–85 |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=tt9u67U8RW8C[/tpl]
The base pedestal was at least [tpl]convert|60|ft|m[/tpl] in diameter and either circular or octagonal. The feet were carved in stone and covered with thin bronze plates riveted together. Eight forged iron bars set in a radiating horizontal position formed the ankles and turned up to follow the lines of the legs while becoming progressively smaller. Individually cast curved bronze plates [tpl]convert|60|in|mm[/tpl] square with turned in edges were joined together by rivets through holes formed during casting to form a series of rings. The lower plates were [tpl]convert|1|in|mm|sing=on|adj=off[/tpl] in thickness to the knee and 3/4 inch thick from knee to abdomen, while the upper plates were 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick except where additional strength was required at joints such as the shoulder, neck, etc.

==Destruction==

The statue stood for 56 years until Rhodes was hit by the 226 BC Rhodes earthquake, when significant damage was also done to large portions of the city, including the harbour and commercial buildings, which were destroyed.[tpl]cite book |title=Politics and Culture in International History: From the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age |last=Bruemmer Bozeman |first=Adda |year=1994 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=1-56000-735-4 |page=108 |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=9hwwEBfJC0YC[/tpl] The statue snapped at the knees and fell over on to the land. Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians afraid that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.
The remains lay on the ground as described by Strabo (xiv.2.5) for over 800 years, and even broken, they were so impressive that many traveled to see them. Pliny the Elder remarked that few people could wrap their arms around the fallen thumb and that each of its fingers was larger than most statues.''Natural History, book 34, xviii, 41.
In 653, an Arab force under Muslim caliph Muawiyah I captured Rhodes, and according to the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor,See also Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos, De administrando imperio xx–xxi. the remains were sold to a "Jewish merchant of Edessa". The buyer had the statue broken down, and transported the bronze scrap on the backs of 900 camels to his home.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] There is compelling evidence that long before the Arab invasion all traces of the Colossus had already disappeared.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The stereotypical Arab destruction and the purported sale to a Jew possibly originated as a powerful metaphor for Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the destruction of a great statue, and would have been understood by any 7th century monk as evidence for the coming apocalypse.The Arabs and the Colossus. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 3rd ser. L.I. Conrad July 1996 pp. 165–187
The same story is recorded by Barhebraeus, writing in Syriac in the 13th century in Edessa:see E.A. Wallis Budge, The Chronography of Gregory Abu'l-Faraj, vol I, p. 98, APA – Philo Press, Amsterdam, 1932 (after the Arab pillage of Rhodes) "And a great number of men hauled on strong ropes which were tied round the brass Colossus which was in the city and pulled it down. And they weighed from it three thousand loads of Corinthian brass, and they sold it to a certain Jew from Emesa" (the Syrian city of Homs). Theophanes is the sole source of this account and all other sources can be traced to him.

==Posture==

The harbour-straddling Colossus was a figment of medieval imaginations based on the dedication text's mention of "over land and sea" twice. Many older illustrations (above) show the statue with one foot on either side of the harbour mouth with ships passing under it: "...the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land..." ("The New Colossus", a poem engraved on a bronze plaque and mounted inside the Statue of Liberty in 1903).
Shakespeare's Cassius in Julius Caesar (I,ii,136–38) says of Caesar:

Shakespeare alludes to the Colossus also in Troilus and Cressida (V.5) and in Henry IV, Part 1 (V.1).
While these fanciful images feed the misconception, the mechanics of the situation reveal that the Colossus could not have straddled the harbour as described in Lemprière's Classical Dictionary. If the completed statue had straddled the harbour, the entire mouth of the harbour would have been effectively closed during the entirety of the construction; nor would the ancient Rhodians have had the means to dredge and re-open the harbour after construction. The statue fell in 224 BC: if it had straddled the harbour mouth, it would have entirely blocked the harbour. Also, since the ancients would not have had the ability to remove the entire statue from the harbour, it would not have remained visible on land for the next 800 years, as discussed above. Even neglecting these objections, the statue was made of bronze, and an engineering analysis proved[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] that it could not have been built with its legs apart without collapsing from its own weight. Many researchers have considered alternative positions for the statue which would have made it more feasible for actual construction by the ancients.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]http://www.greatest-unsolved-mysteries.com/colossus-of-rhodes.html

==Location of the ruins==

Media reports in 1989 initially suggested that large stones found on the seabed off the coast of Rhodes might have been the remains of the Colossus; however this theory was later shown to be without merit.
Another theory published in an article in 2008 by Ursula Vedder suggests that the Colossus was never in the port, but rather was part of the Acropolis of Rhodes, on a hill today named Monte Smith, which overlooks the port area. The temple on top of Monte Smith has traditionally thought to have been devoted to Apollo, but according to Vedder, it would have been a Helios sanctuary. The enormous stone foundations at the temple site, the function of which is not definitively known by modern scholars, are proposed by Vedder to have been the supporting platform of the Colossus.P.M.

==Statue of Liberty==

There is a famous reference to the Colossus in the sonnet "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, written in 1883 and inscribed on a plaque located inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty:
