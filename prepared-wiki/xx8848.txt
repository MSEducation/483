==History==

New Malden was established entirely as a result of the arrival of the railway when what is now called New Malden railway station was opened on 1 December 1846 on the main line from Waterloo. However, when Queen Victoria visited distinguished residents in the Coombe Hill area, the royal train always continued to Norbiton station where the platform was at ground level.
Building started slowly in the area just to the north of the station, gathering pace in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with two- and three-bedroom terraced houses. Further out are larger detached and semi-detached houses from the 1930s. The name of the road up the hill to Coombe, Traps Lane, is thought to derive from a farm owned by a Mrs Trap.
Two miles (3 km) to the south is the former village of Old Malden (from which New Malden gets its name) whose origins go back to Anglo-Saxon times, the name being Old English for Mæl + duna = "the cross on the hill".
Under the District Councils Act 1895, The Maldens & Coombe Urban District Council was created (the plural relating to Old Malden and New Malden). In 1936 Malden and Coombe was granted full Borough status, with its own Mayor, and had the rare distinction of a civic mace bearing the royal insignia of King Edward VIII. In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 came into force merging the boroughs of Malden & Coombe and Surbiton with Kingston upon Thames to form the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.
New Malden is home to the offices of many large organisations, including Nestle Purina and Northrop Grumman.

==Description==

New Malden is bounded to the north by the affluent Coombe Hill and to the south and east by Raynes Park, Worcester Park and Tolworth. New Malden includes Motspur Park, home to the training ground of Fulham Football Club and also the King's College London sports ground, home to the training ground of AFC Wimbledon.
The busy A3 trunk road runs through part of New Malden. A minor tributary of the River Thames, Beverley Brook, flows through the east of the town, while its western boundary is along the Hogsmill, another Thames tributary.
The first parking meters were made in New Malden at Venners Ltd.

==Korean culture and presence in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames==

The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames has one of the largest expatriate community of South Koreans in Europe, and is said to be one of the most densely populated area of Koreans outside South Korea. According to different sources, the Korean population in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames is around 20,000. In the 2001 census, some small areas of New Malden had "Other Asian" (i.e., other than of Indian sub-continental origin, which also included Chinese) populations of "over 25%", though no whole ward reached over 20%. New Malden functions as the shopping and cultural centre for a Korean population spread more widely across South-West London and the neighbouring counties. The area has around fifteen Korean cafes and restaurants, a state-of-the-art Karaoke bar and many  supermarkets and other shops. Churches of several denominations in the area have regular Korean services with associated Korean clergy.
The size of this community has been attributed to the former residence of the South Korean ambassador in Lord Chancellor's Walk off Coombe Lane West. During the 1970s many Koreans came to the area following his example, but when house prices rose in Wimbledon, they moved to nearby New Malden. Others point to a joint-venture between what was then Decca, later Racal Avionics, now part of Thales Group, at Shannon Corner and a Korean chaebol in the 1950s as the start of the community. Samsung Electronics' UK division used to be based in New Malden, although it has now relocated its European headquarters to nearby Chertsey. A high proportion of the community are expatriate workers for Korean companies, who remain in the UK for a number of years before returning to Korea.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] Many work in finance and banking in the City of London.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
