</ref> and the city grew around [[Public administration|administration]] and tourism, initially in the form of [[big game hunting]]. As the British occupiers started to explore the region, they started using Nairobi as their first port of call. This prompted the colonial government to build several spectacular grand hotels in the city. The main occupants were British game hunters.
Nairobi continued to grow under the British and many Britons settled within the city's suburbs. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.
In February 1926, E.A.T. Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:

The continuous expansion of the city began to anger the Maasai, as the city was devouring their land to the south. It also angered the Kikuyu people, who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of World War II, this friction developed into the Mau Mau rebellion. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. Pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.
After independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and water shortages were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.
The United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaida, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.[ref]

==Geography==

The city is situated at [tpl]Coord|1|17|S|36|49|E|display=inline|name=Nairobi, Kenya[/tpl] and occupies [tpl]convert|696|km2|sqmi|-1[/tpl].
Nairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east. Both mountains are visible from Nairobi on a clear day.[tpl]cite web |last=Perceptive Travel |title=Nairobi by Degrees |publisher=perceptivetravel.com|url=http://www.perceptivetravel.com/issues/0506/hein.htm |accessdate=2007-06-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai has fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.[tpl]cite web |last=The East African |title=Karura: Are We Missing the Trees for the Forest? |publisher=nationmedia.com |date=2 November 1998|url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/EastAfrican/0211/Opinion/Opinion3.html |accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927014609/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/EastAfrican/0211/Opinion/Opinion3.html  |archivedate = 27 September 2007[/tpl]
Nairobi's western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0[/tpl].
The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Conference Centre all surround the square.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cfb).[tpl]cite web|title=Climate: Nairobi - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/541/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl] At [tpl]convert|1795|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to [tpl]convert|10|C|F|0[/tpl]. The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average the mid-twenties during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is [tpl]convert|24|C|F|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |last=United Nations|title=Travel and Visa Information |publisher=unhabitat.org |date= |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&catid=546&cid=4939|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl]
There are two rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.[tpl]cite web |last=Gaisma|title=Nairobi, Kenya – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times, table|publisher=gaisma.com |date= |url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/nairobi.html |accessdate=2007-06-22[/tpl]

===Districts and neighbourhoods===

Nairobi is divided into a series of constituencies, these are Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi.[tpl]cite web |last=Nairobi City Council|title=Councillors, Wards & Constituencies |publisher=nairobicity.org |date= |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/departments/councillors.asp?search=%25&page=1|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times.[tpl]cite web |last=Nairobi City Council|title=Living in Nairobi|publisher=nairobicity.org |date= |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/articles/default.asp?search=living|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names. Most lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed "Little Mogadishu".[tpl]cite web |last = Monsters and Critics|title=Urban Somali refugees call Nairobi's "Little Mogadishu" home |publisher=news.monstersandcritics.com |date= |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/africa/features/article_1233394.php/Urban_Somali_refugees_call_Nairobis_little_Mogadishu_home|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl]

====Kibera slum====

The Kibera slum in Nairobi, with an estimated population of 170,000 people, was thought to be Africa's second largest slum. However, recent census results have shown that Kibera is indeed much smaller than originally thought.[tpl]cite web|last=Slum|first=Kibera|title=Kibera Slum Census Result|url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/Census%20Results/KNBS%20Brochure.pdf[/tpl]
Most of Kibera slum residents live in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.00 per day. Unemployment rates are high. Persons living with HIV in the slum are many, as are AIDS cases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/video-and-audio/video-women-kibera-kenya-20090306 |title=Video: The women of Kibera in Kenya | Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl] Cases of assault and rape are common. There are few schools, and most people cannot afford an education for their children. Clean water is scarce and therefore diseases caused by related poor hygiene are prevalent. A great majority of people living in the slum lack access to healthcare.
The Government is addressing the problem, having initiated a programme to replace the slum with a residential district consisting of high rise apartments, and relocating the residents to these new buildings upon completion. The apartments are being built in phases in line with the Government's budgetary allocations, and a few apartments in phase 1 of the project have already been occupied.

===Parks and gardens===

Nairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (Freedom in Swahili language) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built-over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park.[tpl]cite web |last=The Standard|title=Kenyans must have a sustained campaign against land grabbing |publisher=eastandard.net |date= |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=4451&date=30/10/2004|accessdate=2007-06-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.
Central Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.

==Political divisions==

The City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative County.
The Nairobi province differs in several ways from other Kenyan regions. The county is entirely urban. It has only one local council, Nairobi City Council. Nairobi Province was not divided into "districts" until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a County.
Nairobi County has seventeen constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang'ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.

===Constituencies===

thumb|Co-operative Bank of Kenya headquartersNairobi is divided into seventeen constituencies and eighty five wards,[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya's largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.

==Economy==

Nairobi is home to the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE), one of Africa's largest. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.[tpl]cite web |last=Millennium IT |title=Live Trading commences at Nairobi Stock Exchange |publisher=millenniumit.com |date= |url=http://www.millenniumit.com/esp/news_7.php  |accessdate=2007-06-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, Airtel, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city.[tpl]cite web |last=Business Daily |title=General Electric moves Africa's hub to Nairobi |publisher=bdafrica.com |date= |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1291&Itemid=4744 |accessdate=2007-06-18[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Press Media Wire |title=Cisco Inaugurates East African Headquarters in Nairobi |publisher=pressmediawire.com |date= |url=http://www.pressmediawire.com/article.cfm?articleID=4153 |accessdate=2008-07-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UNEP and UN-Habitat headquarters.
Several of Africa's largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa,[tpl]cite web |title=KenGen Heads Index of Africa's Top 40 Stocks |publisher=nationmedia.com |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=3&newsid=82743 |accessdate=15 October 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa's fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.
Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear, General Motors, Toyota Motors, and Coca Cola.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]

===Central business district and skyline===

Nairobi has grown around its central business district. It takes a rectangular shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haille Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi's important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.
Most of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting a new embassy building to be built in the suburbs.
In 2011, the city was considered to be about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.[tpl]cite web |last=Nairobi City Council |title=The Beautification of Nairobi City Project |publisher=nairobicity.org |date= |url=http://www.nairobicity.org/projects/projects_full_story.asp?search=beautif |accessdate=2007-06-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.

===Upper Hill===

Today, many businesses are considering relocating and /or establishing their headquarters outside the Central Business District area. This is because land is cheaper, and better facilities can easily be built and maintained elsewhere. Two areas that are seeing a growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Central Business District and Westlands, which is also about the same distance, away from the city centre.
Companies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank and in 2007, Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill,[tpl]cite web |last=Kenya Broadcasting Corporation|title=Vice president Moody Awori urges investors to market the country |publisher=kbc.co.ke |date= |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=43359 |accessdate=2007-06-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070626195053/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=43359  |archivedate = 26 June 2007[/tpl] cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is the Rahimtulla Tower, which is primarily occupied by British firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. World Bank is also located in Upper Hill at Hill Park Building. Earlier on, they were located in View Park towers in the Central Business District. The International Finance Corporation – part of the World Bank Group focused on private sector development – is also located in Upper Hill at the CBA building.
To accommodate the large demand for floorspace in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park. Nairobi is currently being considered by a company[tpl]Which|date=June 2011[/tpl] from the Middle East interested in building a high-rise headquarters in Africa.

===Tourism===

Nairobi is the one of the few cities in the world with a national park within its boundaries, making it a prime tourist destination as well, with several other tourist attractions. The most famous is the Nairobi National Park. The national park is unique in being the only game-reserve of this nature to border a capital city, or any major city. The park contains many animals including lions, giraffes, and black rhinos. The park is home to over 400 species of birds. The Nairobi Safari Walk is a major attraction to the Nairobi National Park as it offers a rare on-foot experience of the animals.[tpl]cite web |title=Kenya Wildlife Service – Nairobi National Park |publisher=kws.org |url=http://kws.go.ke/parks/parks_reserves/NANP.html |accessdate=24 February 2011[/tpl]

Most common known food establishments include The Carnivore and The Tamarind Restaurants which have outlets in Langata, City Centre, and the Village Market. For those more discerning travellers, one can choose from a wide array of local cuisine, Mediterranean, fast food, Ethiopian, and Arabian. The city's nightlife is mostly centred along friends and colleagues meeting after work especially on Fridays – commonly known as "Furahiday" (Happy Day), theme nights, events and concerts, and of late a new trend – "herbal bubble" or "Shiisha". The most popular clubbing spots are centred in upmarket Westlands which has come to be known as "Electric Avenue", Karen, Langata, Hurlingham, and "uptown" venues in the city centre.

  text:Population of Nairobi City

Nairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the largest city in East Africa, despite being the youngest city in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is currently 4.1%.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28[/tpl] It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.Build cities to contain population explosion[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl]
These data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a current (2011) growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5 million in 2025.

==Society and culture==

Nairobi is a cosmopolitan and multicultural city. The names of some of its suburbs, including Hurlingham and Parklands reflect Nairobi's early history.
By the mid twentieth century, many foreigners settled in Nairobi from other British-occupied regions, primarily India and parts of (present-day) Pakistan. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] These immigrants were workers who arrived to construct the Kampala – Mombasa railway, settling in Nairobi after its completion, and merchants from Gujarat. Nairobi also has established communities from Somalia and Sudan. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
Nairobi has a diverse and multicultural composition, there are a number of churches, mosques, temples, and gurdwaras within the city. Prominent places of worship in Nairobi include the Cathedral Basilica of the Holy Family, All Saints Cathedral, Ismaili Jamat Khana, and Jamia Mosque.
Nairobi has two informal nicknames.

Many film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.
Perhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is Out of Africa. The book was written by Karen Blixen (pen name Isak Dinesen), and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi Area from 1917 to 1931 (the neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her).
In 1985, Out of Africa was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including 7 Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's Karen Blixen Museum.
Nairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, Kenya's foremost writer.
Nairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was The Constant Gardener (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.
