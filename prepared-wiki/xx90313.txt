tin is an open source text-based and threaded news client, used to read and post messages on the USENET global communications network.

==History==

Tin was initially used on text-only display terminals connected via a slow serial interface to a multi-user time sharing central server, where graphics were generally not supported and the mouse did not exist. At the time, tin was considered to be somewhat of a high-resource[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] program in this environment (similar to the Pine email client) due to its use of terminal cursor control and page-oriented text scrolling to make navigating usenet easier. While it did not have graphics support it does provide a visually organized browser-oriented drill-down list of groups, subjects, and then articles, as opposed to simply scrolling endless pages and menus upwards from the bottom of the screen.
Tin is available for a variety of Unix-like operating systems. It is based on the TASS newsreader, whose source code had been posted in 1991 on USENET by Rich Skrenta.
The work on tin was begun shortly afterwards by Iain Lea, who provided information for the IETF RFC 2980.
Since 1996, tin has been maintained by Urs Jan√üen.
The program is generally compared with trn or nn.
Some note that tin has the most flexible threading support.
Tin runs on any UNIX or POSIX platform. This is because tin was an early adopter of autoconf, in 1996. Older versions of tin also ran on OpenVMS;[ref]
