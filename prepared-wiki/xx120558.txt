At some time in the late 1960s, Brooklier was promoted to caporegime in charge of a crew in Orange County, where he also lived. Sometime later, he legally changed his name to Dominic Brooklier.
In early 1974, Brooklier replaced the deceased Joseph Dippolito as family underboss. On October 19, 1974, family boss Nick Licata died and Brooklier was elected the new boss.

==Bompensiero murder==

In 1975, Brooklier ordered the killing of Los Angeles mobster Frank "The Bomp" Bompensiero. Brooklier had lost trust in Bompensiero's ability to keep secrets, and was angry at his criticisms of Brooklier's leadership. However, Bompensiero, always a cautious man, proved to be an elusive target. In 1976, to allay Bompernsiero's suspicions, Brooklier appointed him consigliere of the Los Angeles family. Unknown to Brooklier, Bompensiero was now working as a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant. In March 1976, Bompensiero persuaded Brooklier to extort payments from Forex, a new company that produced pornography. However, Forex was actually created by the FBI as a sting operation. When the family discovered the sting, Fratianno immediately suspected Bompernsiero of being an informant. On February 10, 1977, Los Angeles mobster Thomas Ricciardi finally fulfilled the murder contract by shooting Bompensiero in a phone booth near his apartment."Frank Bompensiero San Diego Hitman, Boss and FBI Informant (Part Two)" Allen May, American Mafia.com

==Conflict with Fratianno==

While Brooklier was serving prison time in the mid-1970s, he appointed Jimmy Fratianno as his acting boss. Seeing a challenge to his authority, Brooklier placed a murder contract on Fratianno for what he felt was Fratianno's attempt at trying to usurp him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/birns_greene/29.html |title=Cleveland's Killer Celebrities, Part 1 |first=Fred |last=McGunagle |work=Crime Library |publisher=truTV |page=29 |accessdate=April 8, 2010[/tpl] However, Fratiano had been informed by the FBI of the contract and Fratianno agreed to turn state's evidence and testify against his Mafia associates in 1979. Fratianno now implicated Brooklier in the 1977 Bompensiero killing. 
On February 28, 1978 Brooklier was indicted on charges of racketeering, extortion, and murder charges. He was convicted of racketeering, but was acquitted of Bompensiero's murder in 1981. He was  sentenced to four years in federal prison "Chronological History of La Cosa Nostra" The Nevada Observer January 8, 2006 and began serving his time in 1983.
