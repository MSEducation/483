Eremophila gibbifolia (Coccid Emu-bush) is a shrub species which is native to Australia.
Plants are 0.3 to 0.9 metres in height and have warty leaves which are 1.5 to 5 mm long and 1 to 2 mm wide. The sessile flowers have green sepals and lilac, purple or rarely white petals and a hairy, spotted throat.
The species was first formally described in 1855 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. He gave it the name Duttonia gibbifolia. In 1859 he transferred the species into the genus Eremophila.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=Eremophila gibbifolia|title=Eremophila gibbifolia |accessdate=2010-01-09 |work= Australian Plant Name Index (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra[/tpl]
