Wayne Douglas Gretzky, CC ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɛ|t|s|k|i[/tpl]; born January 26, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed "The Great One", he has been called "the greatest hockey player ever" by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, with more assists than any other player has points, and is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season – a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his retirement in 1999, he held 61 NHL records: 40 regular-season records, 15 playoff records, and six All-Star records.[ref]For his titles, see [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/achievements/degrees/2000.html |title=University of Alberta: Honorary Degree Recipients (2000–2007) |publisher=Ualbertacentennial.ca |year=2000 |accessdate=July 1, 2010[/tpl]
Born and raised in Brantford, Ontario Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers.[tpl]cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014218.html|title='Great' and 'Gretzky' belong together|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 4, 2006[/tpl] Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. Gretzky also became known for setting up behind his opponent's net, an area that was nicknamed "Gretzky's office".[tpl]citenews|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/03/hockeyschool/graphic.shtml|title=Gretzky's office|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=April 23, 2008[/tpl]
In 1978, he signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships. His trade to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California.[tpl]cite web|last=Allen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2008-08-07-gretzky-trade-anniversary_N.htm |title=Gretzky trade remembered for 'seismic impact' |work=USA Today |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 21, 2011[/tpl] Gretzky played briefly for the St. Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New York Rangers. Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player, ten Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season, two Conn Smythe Trophies as playoff MVP, and five Lester B. Pearson Awards (now called the Ted Lindsay Award) for most outstanding player as judged by other players. He won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times, and often spoke out against fighting in hockey.
After his retirement in 1999, he was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide, making him the only player to receive this honour. He was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. Gretzky became executive director for the Canadian national men's hockey team during the 2002 Winter Olympics, in which the team won a gold medal. In 2000, he became part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the 2004–05 NHL lockout he became the team's head coach. In September 2009, following the franchise's bankruptcy, Gretzky resigned as coach and relinquished his ownership share.

==Early years==

Prior to the Russian Revolution, Gretzky's paternal grandfather Anton  (Tony) Gretzky, born in Grodno, fled the Russian Empire along with his family to Canada via the United States from what is now Ukraine.[tpl]sfn|Kukushkin|2007|p=132[/tpl] Following World War I, Anton would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from Pidhaitsi, interwar Poland (also now in Ukraine).[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11[/tpl] Tony and Mary owned a [tpl]convert|25|acre|ha|sing=on[/tpl] cucumber farm in Canning, Ontario[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=13[/tpl] where Walter Gretzky was born and raised and where he met Wayne's mother, Phyllis Leone (née Hockin).[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2265795 |title='Toughest' of the Gretzkys, Phyllis dies at 64 - NHL - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-12-20 |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=12743661 |title=Phyllis Leone Hockin Gretzky (1941 - 2005) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] They married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, Ontario, where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11[/tpl] The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=33[/tpl] Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (b. 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent. The family would regularly visit Tony and Mary's farm and watch Hockey Night in Canada together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12[/tpl] The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12[/tpl]
Gretzky's mother was of English descent,[tpl]sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148[/tpl] and was related to British General Sir Isaac Brock, a hero of the War of 1812.[tpl]sfn |Gretzky |2001 |p=31[/tpl] Gretzky's father's ancestry is typically described as either Belarusian, Ukrainian, or Polish.[tpl]sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=147[/tpl] In 1982, during a Ukrainian Heritage Day festival at Ontario Place, he sent his best wishes and memorabilia to be included in a photo exhibit on Ukrainian Canadian athletes.[tpl]cite news|last=Smindak|first=Helen|title=Ukrainian Heritage Day Draws Thousands to Ontario Place|url=http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf2/1982/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1982-38.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=19 September 1982[/tpl] In a 1999 Hockey Hall of Fame Inductee press conference, Gretzky stated "Thank God I'm Polish" when joking about another inductee's Scottish kilt.[tpl]cite web|last=Happy|first=Michael J.|title=Despite the accolades, Gretzky's still as humble as ever|publisher=CBS Sports|date=November 22, 1999 |url=http://www.cbssports.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,1618511_60,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120130100650/http://www.cbssports.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,1618511_60,00.html|archivedate=2012-01-30|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120130100650/http://www.cbssports.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,1618511_60,00.html |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl] Gretzky's father Walter grew up in a Ukrainian-speaking family,[tpl]sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148[/tpl] and in interviews has mentioned his both his parents' Belarusian[tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Phoenix/2008/02/13/4843850-sun.html|title=Family comes first|work=Ottawa Sun|date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 26, 2008[/tpl] and Polish origins.[tpl]sfn|McKenzie|1999|p=43[/tpl][tpl]verification needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Anton Gretzky has been described as having "been born in Russia with Ukrainian forebears".[tpl]sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148[/tpl]
Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum".[tpl]sfn|MacGregor|1999|pp=19–20[/tpl] Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight.[tpl]sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19[/tpl] Additionally, Walter gave the advice to "skate where the puck's going, not where it's been".[tpl]sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19[/tpl] Wayne was a classic prodigy whose extraordinary skills made him the target of jealous parents.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html|title=Top Ten Greatest Canadians – Wayne Gretzky|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=February 19, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061118073910/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html |archivedate = November 18, 2006[/tpl]
Gretzky's first team, at age six, was a team of ten-year-olds, starting a pattern where Gretzky always played at a level far above his peers through his minor hockey years.[tpl]cite news|last=Saraceno|first=Jon|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/hall04.htm|title=Gretzky nurtured for hockey fame|work=USA Today|date=November 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2008[/tpl] His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=15[/tpl] According to Martin, "Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing."[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=17[/tpl] The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=18–19[/tpl]
By the age of ten, Gretzky   had scored an astonishing 378 goals and 139 assists in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.[tpl]cite book|last=Falla|first=Jack|editor=Dan Diamond|chapterurl=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=381966|chapter=Wayne Gretzky: Greatness Ascendant |title=Total Hockey: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Hockey League|publisher=Total Sports |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |isbn=978-1-892129-85-7|year=2000[/tpl] His play now attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the Toronto Telegram in October 1971.[tpl]cite news|last=Iaboni|first=John|url=http://www.canoe.ca/GretzkyHall/nov22_hkygen.html|title=No. 9 with big No. 9 aspirations|work=Toronto Telegram|date=October 18, 1971 |accessdate=April 14, 2008[/tpl] By age 13, he had scored over 1,000 goals.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16[/tpl] His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=15[/tpl] According to Walter, the "capper" was being booed on "Brantford Day" at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in February 1975.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16[/tpl]
When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in Toronto, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play elsewhere, which was disallowed at the time.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=16–18[/tpl] The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the Toronto Nationals. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the Metro Junior B Hockey League in 1975–76, with 60 points in 28 games. The following year, as a 15-year-old, he had 72 points in 32 games with the same team, then known as the Seneca Nationals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&type=Player&page=statsawards&list=ByName|title=Wayne Gretzky Career Statistics|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=September 9, 2010[/tpl] That year, he also played three games with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey Association as an emergency call-up, and even then the Great One impressed scouts with his abilities despite his small stature and youth. In addition, he signed with his first agent, Bob Behnke.
Despite his offensive statistics, two teams bypassed him in the 1977 OMJHL Midget Draft of 16-year-olds. The Oshawa Generals picked Tom McCarthy, and the Niagara Falls Flyers picked Steve Peters second overall. With the third pick, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team that Wayne would not move to Sault Ste. Marie, a northern Ontario city that inflicts a heavy traveling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played a season in the Ontario Hockey League at the age of 16 with the Greyhounds.[tpl]cite news|last=Orr|first=Frank|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/greatone.html|title=Gretzky, only 16, carries a 'Gold-Orr' label|work=The Sporting News|date=January 17, 1978 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080119052653/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/greatone.html|archivedate=January 19, 2008[/tpl] It was with the Greyhounds that Wayne first wore the number 99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number 9—for his hockey hero Gordie Howe—but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach Muzz MacPherson's suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=384579|title=99 Reasons Why Wayne Gretzky is "The Great One"|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=November 28, 2008[/tpl]
At 16, in his single year at the major junior level, Gretzky surpassed the OMJHL single-season scoring record, winning the OMJHL Rookie of the Year and Most Sportsmanlike awards.

==World Hockey Association==

In 1978, the World Hockey Association (WHA) league was in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under the age of 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Indianapolis Racers and the Birmingham Bulls. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect,[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=221[/tpl] but it was Racers owner Nelson Skalbania who, on June 12, 1978, signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth $1.75 million US. Gretzky scored his first professional goal against Dave Dryden of the Edmonton Oilers[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=219[/tpl] in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later.[tpl]sfn|Davis|1999|p=51[/tpl] Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a deal to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.[tpl]sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192[/tpl]
Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between the Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg Jets. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked the Oilers, but the move was not that simple. On November 2, Gretzky, goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining.[tpl]cite web|title=Nation Profile: Wayne Gretzky|url=http://oilersnation.com/2012/11/2/nation-profile-wayne-gretzky|publisher=OilersNation.com|accessdate=May 6, 2013[/tpl] While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of backgammon with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=34–35[/tpl] Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=35[/tpl] Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of the Edmonton Oilers, Peter Pocklington. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=219[/tpl] The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.[tpl]sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192[/tpl]
One of the highlights of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars and Dynamo Moscow played at Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum.[tpl]cite web|title=WHA All-Star Games with MVPs|url=http://www.shrpsports.com/wha/allstar.htm|publisher=ShrpSports|accessdate=May 6, 2013[/tpl] The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and Howe's son, Mark.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=234[/tpl] In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=234[/tpl] In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=234[/tpl] The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4–3.[tpl]sfn|Surgent|2004|p=289[/tpl]
On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a 10-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth C$3 million, with options for 10 more years. Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at 110 points, behind Robbie Ftorek and Réal Cloutier.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=239[/tpl] Gretzky captured the Lou Kaplan Trophy as rookie of the year,[tpl]sfn|Willes|2004|p=219[/tpl] and helped the Oilers to first overall in the league. The Oilers reached the Avco World Trophy finals, where they lost to the Winnipeg Jets in six games. It was Gretzky's only year in the WHA, as the league folded following the season.

==NHL career==

===Edmonton Oilers (1979–1988)===

After the World Hockey Association folded in 1979, the Edmonton Oilers and three other teams joined the NHL. The other three teams to join the NHL were the New England Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Jets. Under the merger agreement the Oilers, like the other surviving WHA teams, were to be allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams. Under normal circumstances, Gretzky would have been removed from the Oilers and placed in the pool for the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, but his personal services contract prevented this.[tpl]Cite journal |last=McCurdy |first=Bruce |url=http://www.coppernblue.com/2010/1/26/1270163/happy-birthday-wayne-the-21-year |title="Happy birthday, Wayne": the 21-year, personal services contract |publisher=The Copper and Blue |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2010[/tpl]

In his second season, Gretzky won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164 points, breaking both Bobby Orr's record for assists in a season (102) and Phil Esposito's record for points in a season (152). He won his second straight Hart Trophy. In the first game of the 1981 playoffs versus the Montreal Canadiens, Gretzky had five assists. This was a single game playoff record.[tpl]sfn|Jenish|2009|p=243[/tpl]
During the 1981–82 season, he surpassed a record that had stood for 35 years: 50 goals in 50 games. Set by Maurice "Rocket" Richard during the 1944–45 NHL season and tied by Mike Bossy during the 1980–81 NHL season, Gretzky accomplished the feat in only 39 games.

The same success was not immediate when they joined the NHL, but within four seasons, the Oilers were competing for the Stanley Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=41|title=Edmonton Oilers (NHL)|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database |accessdate=April 23, 2008[/tpl] The Oilers were a young, strong team featuring, in addition to Gretzky, future Hall of Famers including forwards Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri, defenceman Paul Coffey, and goaltender Grant Fuhr. Gretzky was its captain from 1983–88. In 1983, they made it to the Stanley Cup Final, only to be swept by the three-time defending champion New York Islanders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&season=1983&leaguenm=NHL|title=1982–83 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 13, 2008[/tpl] The following season, the Oilers met the Islanders in the Final again, this time winning the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&season=1984&leaguenm=NHL|title=1983–84 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 13, 2008[/tpl]
Gretzky was named an officer of the Order of Canada on June 25, 1984, for outstanding contribution to the sport of hockey. Since the Order ceremonies are always held during the hockey season, it took 13 years and 7 months—and two Governors General—before he could accept the honour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=3905|title=Order of Canada: Wayne Gretzky, O.C.|publisher=Governor General of Canada|date=September 27, 2005 |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012155126/http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=3905 |archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] He was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2009 "for his continued contributions to the world of hockey, notably as one of the best players of all time, as well as for his social engagement as a philanthropist, volunteer and role model for countless young people".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13192|title=Governor General announces 60 new appointments to the Order of Canada|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2011[/tpl] The Oilers also won the Cup with Gretzky in [tpl]scfy|1985[/tpl], [tpl]scfy|1987[/tpl] and [tpl]scfy|1988[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/cup/champs.html|title=Stanley Cup Champions and Finalists|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=April 14, 2008[/tpl]
When the Oilers joined the NHL, Gretzky continued to play under his personal services contract with Oilers owner Peter Pocklington. This arrangement came under increased scrutiny by the mid-1980s, especially following reports that Pocklington had used the contract as collateral to help secure a $31 million loan with the Alberta government-owned Alberta Treasury Branches.[tpl]cite web|author=Skip Myslenski & Linda Kay|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-29/sports/8501060359_1_edmonton-oilers-owner-press-conference-peter-pocklington |title=Can`t get next to you, babe: Tony LaRussa was part of the... |work= Chicago Tribune  |date=1985-01-29 |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] Amid growing concern around the league that a financial institution might be able to lay claim to Gretzky's rights in the event the heavily-leveraged Pocklington were to declare bankruptcy, as well growing dissatisfaction on the part of Gretzky and his advisers, in 1987 Gretzky and Pocklington agreed to replace the personal services contract with a standard NHL contract.[tpl]cite web|author=Al Strachan, Toronto Globe and Mail. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-11-26/sports/8703290287_1_nhl-bylaws-peter-pocklington-national-hockey-league-career |title=Gretzky Escapes Legal Mess |work= Chicago Tribune|date=1987-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl]

===The Gretzky rule===

In June 1985, as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board of Governors made a decision to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called. The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL, because during the early 1980s, when better teams like the Oilers entered a four-on-four or three-on-three situation with an opponent, the stronger, faster team frequently scored one or more goals. Gretzky held a press conference one day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, criticizing the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited. The rule change became known as the Gretzky rule.[tpl]cite news|title=Gretzky criticizes change in rules|publisher=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|date=June 13, 1985 |page=27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/The-10-best-player-inspired-NHL-rules-changes?urn=nhl-263622|title=The 10 best player-inspired NHL rules changes|publisher=YahooSports|date=2010-Aug-19|author=Greg Wyshynski|accessdate=2014-Apr-26[/tpl]  The rule was changed back in the 1990s.

==="The Trade"===

Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=177–179[/tpl] Walter Gretzky had known for months, but kept it from Wayne so as not to upset him. According to Walter, Wayne was being "shopped" to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=182–183[/tpl] At first, Wayne did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call while on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall asking permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski join him as teammates in Los Angeles. After the details of the trade were finalized by McNall and Pocklington, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=183[/tpl] When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Glen Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to L.A., Sather tried to stop the deal, but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering Jimmy Carson.[ref]
</ref>
On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky, along with McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for Carson, Martin Gelinas, $15 million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989 (later traded to the New Jersey Devils – New Jersey selected Jason Miller), 1991 (Martin Rucinsky), and 1993 (Nick Stajduhar). "The Trade", as it came to be known,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/transformation_transformed_after_trade.html|title=After the Trade|publisher=OilersHeritage.com|accessdate=July 13, 2006[/tpl] upset Canadians to the extent that New Democratic Party House Leader Nelson Riis demanded that the government block it,[tpl]cite web|title=20 Years Ago: Gretzky Deal Shocked the Hockey World|publisher=The Sports Network|date=August 9, 2008 |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=245714 |accessdate=February 10, 2011[/tpl] and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside the Northlands Coliseum. Gretzky himself was considered a "traitor" by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of his wife's acting career.[tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|title=Telling it like it is|work=Edmonton Sun|date=August 12, 1988[/tpl]
In Gretzky's first appearance in Edmonton after the trade—a game that was nationally televised in Canada—he received a four-minute standing ovation.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66[/tpl] The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest crowd ever to that date.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66[/tpl] Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for Mark Messier's body check of Gretzky into the boards.[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66[/tpl] After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: "I'm still proud to be a Canadian. I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that."[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66[/tpl] After the 1988–89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside the Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head (picture shown above, to the right).[tpl]sfn|Redmond|1993|p=67[/tpl]

===Los Angeles Kings (1988–1996)===

The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular-season game.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=202[/tpl] The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight on their way to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being underdogs against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings' return from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series 4–3. He was nervous that Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were eagerly waiting for him.[tpl]cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Austin|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068306/1/index.htm|title=Dynasty Undone|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=April 24, 1989 |accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl] For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly beat out Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=HMT&year=1988-89|title=1988–89 Hart Memorial trophy Winner|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=April 15, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050829112445/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=HMT&year=1988-89 |archivedate = August 29, 2005|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In 1990, the Associated Press named him Male Athlete of the Decade.[tpl]cite journal|last=Verdi|first=Bob|title=Hockey's Babe Ruth is Athlete of the Century|journal=The Sporting News|date=January 22, 1990|page=4[/tpl]
Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and fan interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings now boasted of numerous sellouts. Many credit Gretzky's arrival with putting non-traditional U.S. hockey markets on "the NHL map"; not only did California receive two more NHL franchises (the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and San Jose Sharks) during Gretzky's tenure in L.A., but his popularity in Southern California proved to be an impetus in the league establishing teams in other parts of the U.S. Sun Belt.[tpl]cite journal |last=Roderick |first=Kevin |url=http://www.kevinroderick.com/gretzky.html |title=The Big Chill |journal=Los Angeles Magazine |date=December 2001 |accessdate=February 7, 2006[/tpl]
Gretzky was sidelined for much of the 1992–93 regular season with an upper back injury, the only year in which he did not lead his team in scoring.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/bio.htm|title=The Wayne Gretzky file|publisher=USA Today.com |date=November 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl] However, he performed very well in the playoffs, notably when he scored a hat trick in game seven of the Campbell Conference Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. This victory propelled the Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, where they faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the first game of the series by a score of 4–1, the team lost the next three games in overtime, and then fell 4–1 in the deciding fifth game where Gretzky failed to get a shot on net.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&season=1993&leaguenm=NHL|title=1992–93 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl]
The next season, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's career goal-scoring record and won the scoring title, but the team began a long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?bcid=4183|title=The History of the Los Angeles Kings|publisher=Los Angeles Kings|accessdate=April 15, 2012[/tpl] Long before then, running out of time and looking for a team with which he could win again, Gretzky had been traded from the Kings at his request.
During the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Gretzky and some friends (including Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Brett Hull, and Steve Yzerman) formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played some exhibition games in various countries.

===St. Louis Blues (1996)===

On February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the St. Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, Craig Johnson, and two draft picks (Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek). He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles.[tpl]cite news|title=After 99 trial balloons, Gretzky traded; Wayne gets his wish—if Blues are indeed contenders|work=The Ottawa Citizen|page=B1 |date=February 28, 1996[/tpl] At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands.[tpl]cite news|last=Hickey|first=Pat|date=February 28, 1996 |title=Gretzky's image suffers; Everyone's a big loser in this deal|work=The Gazette|page=E1[/tpl] Gretzky was immediately named the team's captain.

Gretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997.[tpl]cite news|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DE163AF935A15756C0A961958260|title=Rangers' Surprising Run Comes to a Finish|work=The New York Times|date=May 26, 1997 |accessdate=April 16, 2008[/tpl] The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with 10 goals and 10 assists.

In 1997, prior to his retirement, The Hockey News named a committee of 50 hockey experts (former NHL players, past and present writers, broadcasters, coaches and hockey executives) to select and rank the 50 greatest players in NHL history. The experts voted Gretzky number one. Gretzky said that he would have voted Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe as the best of all time.[tpl]cite news|last=Cole|first=Cam|title=Cole: Bobby Orr was The One, not The Great One|work=Calgary Herald|date=March 20, 2013|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Bobby+Great/8128247/story.html|accessdate=March 28, 2013[/tpl]
The 1998–99 season was his last season. He reached one milestone in this last season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring record of 1,071, which had been held by Gordie Howe. Gretzky was having difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals, contributing to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a point per game, but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined NHL/WHA career to 1,072, one more than Howe.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=216[/tpl] As the season wound down, there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire, but he refused to announce his retirement. His last NHL game in Canada was on April 15, 1999, a 2–2 tie with the Ottawa Senators, the Rangers' second-to-last game of the season.[tpl]cite news|last=Atkins|first=Harry|title=Gretzky good as gone|work=Ludington Daily News|agency=Associated Press|date=April 16, 1999 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=09ELAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0FUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6485,1529045|accessdate=September 9, 2010[/tpl] Following the contest, instead of the usual three stars announcement, Gretzky was named as all three stars.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=218[/tpl] It was only after this game, after returning to New York that Gretzky announced his retirement, before the Rangers' last game of the season.[tpl]sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=220[/tpl]
The final game of Gretzky's career was a 2–1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 18, 1999, in Madison Square Garden. Although the game involved two American teams, both national anthems were played, and with the lyrics slightly adjusted to accommodate Gretzky's departure. In place of the lyrics "O Canada, we stand on guard for thee", Bryan Adams ad-libbed, "We're going to miss you, Wayne Gretzky".[tpl]cite news|last=Brady|first=Erik|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/full38.htm|title=He loved 'every part of the game|work=USA Today|date=April 19, 1999 |accessdate=April 10, 2008[/tpl] The Star-Spangled Banner, as sung by John Amirante, was altered to include the words "in the land of Wayne Gretzky".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=384578|title=Gretzky Gets Assist in Finale|publisher=National Hockey League |date=April 18, 1999|accessdate=September 9, 2010[/tpl] Gretzky ended his career with a final point, assisting on the lone New York goal scored by Brian Leetch. At the time of his retirement, Gretzky was the second-to-last WHA player still active in professional hockey, Mark Messier, who himself attended the game along with other representatives of the Edmonton dynasty, being the last.[tpl]sfn|Cole|2004|p=133[/tpl]
Gretzky told Scott Morrison that the final game of his career was his greatest day.[tpl]sfn|Morrison|2008|p=66[/tpl] He recounted: [tpl]quote|My last game in New York was my greatest day in hockey...Everything you enjoy about the sport of hockey as a kid, driving to practice with mom Phyllis and dad Walter, driving to the game with mom and dad, looking in the stands and seeing your mom and dad and your friends, that all came together in that last game in New York.[tpl]sfn|Morrison|2008|p=66[/tpl] [/tpl]
Madison Square Garden photographer George Kalinsky's image of Gretzky waving to the crowd at the Garden, like his image of Messier after the Rangers won game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals five years earlier, would become an iconic image to the Rangers and their fans, documenting one of the greatest moments at the Garden,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msg50.com/moment.jsp?moment_id=41|title=The Great One Retires|publisher=MSG Media|accessdate=July 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.georgekalinsky.com/images/team/index5.html|title=GeorgeKalinsky.com::Images::Team Sports|publisher=GeorgeKalinsky.com|accessdate=July 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=Garden of Dreams|year=2004|publisher=Stewart, Tabori, & Chang|location=New York|isbn=1-58479-343-0|authorlink=George Kalinsky[/tpl] and even to hockey fans.

==International play==

[tpl]Medal|Country | [tpl]ih|CAN[/tpl] [/tpl]
Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior Championships in Montreal, Quebec. He was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours. His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year old in the World Junior Championships.[tpl]cite web|title=List of 16-year old World Junior Championship players|url=http://www.quanthockey.com/wjc-u20/en/player-age/16-year-old-wjc-u20-players.html|work=QuantHockey|accessdate=21 December 2013[/tpl]  Canada finished with the bronze medal.[ref]
</ref>
Gretzky debuted with the Team Canada's men's team at the 1981 Canada Cup. He led the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish to the Soviet Union, losing 8–1 in the final. Seven months later, Gretzky joined Team Canada for the 1982 World Championships in Finland. He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort in Canada's final game against Sweden to earn the bronze. Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the 1984 Canada Cup, when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals. He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star Team.
Gretzky's international career highlight arguably came three years later at the 1987 Canada Cup. Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he had played in his life.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2007|p=1[/tpl] Playing on a line with Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux, he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games. After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance in the second game, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime, to extend the tournament.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2007|p=1[/tpl] In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner. With the score tied 5–5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3–on–1 with defenceman Larry Murphy. Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.[tpl]sfn|Willes|2007|p=149[/tpl]
The 1991 Canada Cup marked the last time the tournament was played under the "Canada Cup" moniker. Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games. He did not, however, compete in the final against the United States due to a back injury. Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4–1 and 4–2. Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the World Cup in 1996. It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight games for fourth overall. The 1996 World Cup also ended Canada's winning streak at the tournament (including the Canada Cups), losing in three games of a best-of-three final.
Leading up to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time. Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997. However, Gretzky, was passed over for the captaincy, along with several other Canadian veterans including Steve Yzerman and Ray Bourque in favour of the younger Eric Lindros. Expectations were high for the Canadian team, but the team lost to the Czech Republic in the semi-finals.[ref]
