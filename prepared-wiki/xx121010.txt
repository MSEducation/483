"Die Zeiger der Uhr" ("The Hands of Time") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, performed in German by Margot Eskens.
The song was performed first on the night, preceding Denmark's Ulla Pia with "Stop - mens legen er go'". It received 7 points, placing 10th in a field of 18.
The song is a ballad, with Eskens singing about the feelings brought on by reading old love letters and seeing photographs from an old relationship. As she explains, however, "The hands of time only turn/Forwards, forwards and never backwards".
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1967 contest by Inge Br√ºck with "Anouschka".
