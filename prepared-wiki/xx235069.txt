Kamal Kumari Barooah (Assamese: কমল কুমাৰী বৰুৱা) (1899–1978) was the matriarch of the Khongiya Barooah family of Thengal, Assam. She was born to Mahendranath Mahanta and Swarnalata Mahanta at Borelengi Satra. In 1917 she got married to Siva Prasad Barooah of Khongiya Barooah family, the family that emerged as the champion of Assamese interests and repository of Assamese culture and traditions. After her husband's demise in 1938 she had to handle the huge Thengal household alone starting from running their tea-gardens to retaining the family properties for her children. In order to run their businesses she self - educated herself in English as well as in tea craft, and thus efficiently managed all those affairs.
