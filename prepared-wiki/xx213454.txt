Clianthus maximus, commonly known as Kaka beak (Kōwhai Ngutu-kākā in Māori), is a woody legume shrub native to New Zealand's North Island. It is one of two species of Clianthus (Kaka beak) and both have striking clusters of red flowers which resemble the beak of the Kākā, a New Zealand parrot.
The species is endangered in the wild, with only 153 trees found in a 2005 survey (down from over 1000 in 1996), in the East Coast and northern Hawkes Bay regions.Wild kaka beak close to extinction, New Zealand Biodiversity, 23 December 2005. Retrieved 28 July 2008.
William Colenso described C. maximus in 1885, identifying it as distinct from C. puniceus, the other Kaka beak. However Thomas Kirk reduced C. maximus to a variety of C. puniceus (C. puniceus var. maximus) in 1899. Peter Heenan reinstated C. maximus as a separate species in 2000.[tpl]cite journal |last=Heenan |first=P.B. |authorlink= |year=2000 |month= |title=Clianthus (Fabaceae) in New Zealand: a reappraisal of Colenso’s taxonomy |journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany |volume=38 |issue= |pages=361–371 |issn=0028–825X |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/media/publications-journals-nzjb-2000-018.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-14 |quote= |doi=10.1080/0028825x.2000.9512688[/tpl]
Prior to the 1990s, C. maximus was rarely cultivated, most stock available for cultivation being C. puniceus (then C. puniceus var. puniceus). C. maximus is now widespread, however,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=59 |title=Clianthus maximus|publisher=New Zealand Plant Conservation Network|accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl] and has generally replaced C. puniceus in cultivation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=13 |title=Clianthus puniceus|publisher=New Zealand Plant Conservation Network |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2010-11-14[/tpl]
