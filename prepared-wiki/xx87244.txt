The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago is a contemporary art museum near Water Tower Place in downtown Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States.  The museum, which was established in 1967, is one of the world's largest contemporary art venues.  The museum's collection is composed of thousands of objects of Post-World War II visual art.
The museum has hosted several notable debut exhibitions including Frida Kahlo's first U.S. exhibition and Jeff Koons' first solo museum exhibition.  Koons later presented an exhibit at the Museum that established the museum's current attendance record for an exhibition. Its collection, which includes Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Kara Walker, and Alexander Calder, contains historical samples of 1940s–1970s late surrealism, pop art, minimalism, and conceptual art; notable holdings 1980s postmodernism; as well as contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation, and related media.  The museum also presents dance, theater, music, and multidisciplinary arts.
The current location at 220 East Chicago Avenue is in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area.AreaG2 Address- Museum of Contemporary Art  Josef Paul Kleihues designed the current building after the museum conducted a 12-month search, reviewing more than 200 nominations.[tpl]cite web |author= |publisher= Museum of Contemporary Art |url=http://www.mcachicago.org/information/architect.php?page=iarch|title= The Architect Joseph Paul Kleihues |accessdate=2011-07-22[/tpl]  The museum opened at its new location June 21–22, 1996, with a 24-hour event that drew more than 25,000 visitors.[tpl]cite web |author= |publisher= Museum of Contemporary Art |url=http://www.mcachicago.org/information/history.php?page=ihist|title= History of the MCA |accessdate=2011-07-22[/tpl] The museum was originally located at 237 East Ontario Street, which was originally designed as a bakery.

==History==

The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago was created as the result of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, collectors and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837470,00.html|title=Museums: Contemporary in Chicago|accessdate=2009-10-15|date=1967-11-03|work=Time[/tpl] It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/arts/design/08vandermarck.html|title=Jan van der Marck, Museum Administrator, Dies at 80 |accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2010-05-06|work=New York Times|author=Grimes, William[/tpl]
Initially, the museum was conceived primarily as a space for temporary exhibitions, in the German kunsthalle model. However, in 1974, the museum began acquiring a permanent collection of contemporary art objects created after 1945.[tpl]cite web |author= Kirshner, Judith Russi |url= http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/858.html |title=Museum of Contemporary Art|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society |accessdate=2009-08-21 [/tpl]  The MCA expanded into adjacent buildings to increase gallery space; and in 1977, following a fundraising drive for its 10th anniversary, a three-story neighboring townhouse was purchased, renovated, and connected to the museum.  In 1978, Gordon Matta-Clark executed his final major project in the townhouse. In his work Circus Or The Caribbean Orange (1978), Matta-Clark made circle cuts in the walls and floors of the townhouse next-door to the first museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&int_new=22966&int_modo=2|title=Gordan Matta-Clark: You Are the Measure |accessdate=2011-06-13|year=2008|work=Artdaily[/tpl]
In 1991, the museum's Board of Trustees contributed $37 million ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|37|1991|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million today) of the expected $55 million ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|55|1991|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million) construction costs for Chicago's first new museum building in 65 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB37331CAA7AE5A&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Trustees lead effort to build art museum|accessdate=2009-08-23|date=1991-01-30|work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl]  Six of the board members were central to the fundraising as major donors: Jerome Stone (chairman emeritus of  Stone Container Corporation), Beatrice C.

In fact, none of the finalists had made any prior structures in Chicago. The selection process, which started with 209 contenders, was based on professional qualifications, recent projects, and the ability to work closely with the staff of the aspiring museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FFEFE0F22306E58&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Museum Shuns City Architects|accessdate=2009-08-23|date=1991-01-29|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Kamin, Blair[/tpl]

In 1996, the MCA opened its current museum at 220 East Chicago Avenue, which was the site of a former National Guard Armory between Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue from 1907 until it was demolished in 1993 to make way for the MCA.Eds.

===Recurring programs===

After a 10-year run, the exhibition series UBS 12x12: New Artists/New Work is moving from the second floor to the third floor, into a larger gallery space and will change its name to "Chicago Works."  The exhibition series will still feature Chicago-area artists.  Rather than each artist being displayed for one month, each exhibition in the series will now be displayed for three months.[tpl]cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-10/entertainment/ct-ae-0612-mca-main-20110610_1_madeleine-grynsztejn-michael-darling-curators | author=Viera, Lauren | date=2011-06-10 | accessdate=2011-08-05 | work=Chicago Tribune | title=MCA 2.0[/tpl]
Starting in 2002, the MCA began commissioning artists and architects to design and construct public art for the front plaza.  The goal of the program is to link the museum to its neighboring community by extending its programmatic, educational, and outreach functions.  While artists have been exhibited intermittently on the MCA plaza since 2002, the summer 2011 plaza exhibit showcasing four works by Miami-based sculptor Mark Handforth marks a revitalization of the plaza project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/galleries/6395050-421/museum-of-contemporary-art-hopes-artist-can-liven-up-the-building.html|title=Museum of Contemporary Art hopes artist can liven up the building|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2011-07-07|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Thomas, Mike[/tpl]

The new five-storey limestone and cast-aluminum structure was designed by Berlin architect Josef Paul Kleihues. The building, which opened in 1996, contains [tpl]convert|45000|sqft|m2|-2[/tpl] of gallery space (seven times the space of the old museum), a theater, studio-classrooms, an education center, a museum store, a restaurant-café, and a sculpture garden.[tpl]cite web | url=  http://www.mcachicago.org/information/bldg.php?page=ibuild | title=The Building | publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago | accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl] The MCA building was Kleihues's first American structure.

The building's main entrance, which is accessed by scaling 32 steps, uses both symmetry and transparency as themes for its large central glass walls that compose the majority of both the east and west façades of the building.  Two additional entrances—into the education center and into the museum store—are located on either side of the main staircase.  The monumental staircase with projecting bays and plinths that may be used as the base for sculpture is reminiscent of the propyleia of the Acropolis in Athens.   The main level entry hall has an adjacent [tpl]convert|55|ft|m|1|adj=on[/tpl] atrium that connects it to a restaurant in the rear of the building. Two galleries for temporary exhibitions flank the atrium.  The stairwell in the northwest corner is often cited as the buildings most interesting and dynamic artistic feature.  The elevated views of Lake Michigan are considered to be a rewarding feature of the building.  The building's [tpl]convert|56|ft|m|1|adj=on[/tpl] glass facade sits atop [tpl]convert|16|ft|m|1[/tpl] of Indiana limestone.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VVJD-cyLovwC&pg=PA47&dq=Josef+Paul+Kleihues+%22Museum+of+Contemporary+Art%22+Chicago&q=Josef%20Paul%20Kleihues%20%22Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%22%20Chicago|title=Pocket guide to Chicago architecture|page=47|author=McBrien, Judith Paine|isbn=978-0-393-73155-2|publisher=W.

The building has two two-story gallery spaces and a smaller one-story gallery space on the second floor.  The third floor has a gallery and exhibition space in its northwest section, and the forth floor has two large galleries, an exhibition space on the west side of the building, and a gallery in the southwest section.
The museum has a 296-seat multi-use theater with a proscenium-layout stage.  The seats are laid out in 14 rows with two side aisles.  The stage is [tpl]convert|52|x|34|ft|m[/tpl] and elevated [tpl]convert|36|in|m[/tpl] above the floor level of the first row of seats.  The house has a 12 degree incline.

===Critical review===

Complaining that the structure has a more fortress-like exterior than its predecessor, Kamin viewed the architectural attempt as a fumbled work.  However, he considered the interior to be serene and contemplative in a manner that complements the contemporary art and compact and organized in a manner that is an improvement on the more traditional mazelike museums.  Comparing the building to the Sullivan Center and the Art Institute of Chicago Building, Kamin describes the museum as an homage to two of Chicago's architectural influences: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Sullivan.  Other critics also note the presence of Mies van der Rohe's spirit in the architecture.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nf4qm1thuzYC&pg=RA5-PA224&dq=Josef+Paul+Kleihues+%22Museum+of+Contemporary+Art%22+Chicago&q=Josef%20Paul%20Kleihues%20%22Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%22%20Chicago|title=The architecture traveler: a guide to 250 key 20th century American buildings|publisher=W.W.

Chicago-based architect Douglas Garofalo has described the building as stark, intimidating and "incongruous with contemporary sensibilities".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ni4H4CLQt3gC&pg=PA9&dq=Josef+Paul+Kleihues+%22Museum+of+Contemporary+Art%22+Chicago#v=onepage&q=Josef%20Paul%20Kleihues%20%22Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%22%20Chicago&f=false|title=Between the museum and the city|accessdate=2009-10-18|year=2003|isbn=978-0-933856-82-0|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|author=Garofalo, Douglas|pages=11–18[/tpl]  The interior atrium, which the architect claims links the city to the lake is part of a transcendent space that benefits from the sunlight that enters through the high glass walls.  The building is said to be designed to separate the art from other distracting services and functions of the venue. Kamin was also pleased with the separate entrances on the main floor for the museum store and accessibility entrances.

==New Vision==

Announced by the Chicago Tribune in June 2011, the MCA is in the process of reinventing its identity with new curators, a new floor plan, and a new vision.  MCA Director Madeleine Grynsztejn says the museum seeks to be 50/50 artist-activated/audience-engaged.  The main floor's north and south galleries will present exhibitions showcasing the museum's permanent collection and work by post-emerging contemporary artists.  The third floor will be for the "Chicago Works" series.  The fourth floor will have gallery spaces for the MCA Screen and MCA DNA series, while the main barrel-vaulted galleries will be for special exhibitions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/ct-ae-0612-mca-main-20110610,0,6577602.story?page=1 | author=Viera, Lauren | work=Chicago Tribune | title=MCA 2.0 | date=2011-06-10 | accessdate=2011-08-05[/tpl]

===Notable Works===

During the 2008 fiscal year the MCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, which inspired gifts of works by artists such as Dan Flavin, Alfredo Jaar, and Thomas Ruff.  Additionally, the museum expanded its collection by acquiring the work of some of the artists it presented during its anniversary celebration such as Carlos Amorales, Tony Oursler, and Adam Pendleton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcachicago.org/annual_2008/curatorial.html|title=Museum of Contemporary Art Annual Report Fiscal Year 2008:Curatorial Report|accessdate=2009-09-16|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago[/tpl]
