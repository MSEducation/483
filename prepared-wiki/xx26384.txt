CATEGORIES: Trails, Types of thoroughfares

A trail (also track, byway, footpath, etc.) is normally a path with a rough beaten or dirt/stone surface used for travel. Trails may be for use only by walkers, but some are also be used for cycling, horse riding, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing, and less often for moving cattle and other livestock. A trail can also be a marked route on a navigable waterway. In some places trails are the main access route to remote settlements.

==Usage==

In modern use, the term "trail" often denotes "hiking trail".
Historically, the term was used for a route into or through wild territory used by emigrants (e.g. the Oregon Trail) in the USA. In the early years of the 20th century the term auto trail was used for a marked highway route, and trail is now also used to designate routes, including highway routes, designated for tourist interest (e.g. National Historic Trails, the Cabot Trail and Quilt Trail) in North America. The term trail has also been used by developers and urban planners for a variety of modern paved roads, highways, and boulevards, in North America. A particularly unusual use of the term is in the province of Alberta, Canada, which has multi-lane freeways called trails.
In Australia, the term track can be used interchangeably with trail, and can refer to anything from a dirt road to an unpaved pedestrian path. The term trail gained popularity during World War II, when many servicemen from the United States were stationed in Australia, which probably influenced its being adopted by elements of the Australian media at the time (see Kokoda Track).
In New Zealand, the terms track or walkway are used almost exclusively except in reference to cross-country skiing: "walkways vary enormously in nature, from short urban strolls, to moderate coastal locations, to challenging tramps hikes in the high country mountains".Government of New Zealand Walkway is used similarly in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, where the "Grand Concourse", is an integrated walkway system.Grand Concourse Authority: https://www.google.ca/#q=grand+concourse.
In the United Kingdom, the term trail is used, but mostly for longer distance walking routes through open country with rough surfacing. However, such trails are usually called a way, as in the Pennine Way, South Downs Way, etc. In England and Wales, the government-promoted, long distance paths are known collectively as National Trails. Generally the term footpath is preferred for pedestrian routes, but is used for urban paths and sometimes in place of pavement, as well as longer distance trails. Track is used for wider paths (wide enough for vehicles), often used for hiking. The terms bridleway, byway, restricted byway are all recognised legal terms and to a greater or lesser extent in general usage.
In the United States, the term trail is often used for a long-distance path not used by motor vehicles. The vehicles allowed on a trail vary depending upon the actual trail.  However, some highways continue to be officially called a trail, such as the Susquehanna Trail in Pennsylvania, a designation that varies from a two-lane road to a four-lane freeway.

==Trail types and use==

===Walking trails===

Trail use has become very popular for a wide variety of users. Some trails are designated as educational trails which are specially laid-out paths that offer information on specific natural, technological or cultural themes at various stations en route, usually by means of information boards and/or exhibits. One example is the nature trail, which is used by people learning about the natural world. Many trails are designated day trails, meaning that they are generally used by people out for a short hike, less than a day. Some trails are designated backpacking trails, or long-distance trails, and are used by both day hikers and by backpackers. Some of the trails are over [tpl]convert|1000|mi|km|spell=in[/tpl] long and may be hiked in sections by backpackers, or completed in one trip by dedicated hikers. Some trails are specifically used by other outdoor enthusiasts to gain access to another feature, such as good climbing sites. Many runners also favor running on trails rather than pavement, as giving a more vigorous work-out and better developing agility skills, as well as providing a more pleasant exercise environment.

====Stairway trails====

Stairway trails are another way to ascend higher slopes. The stairs are constructed by making cuts in the dirt, rocks, or concrete. Stairway trails are usually for walking only. Popular stairway trails include the Stairway Trails in Bernal Heights, East - San Francisco, and the stairs at many hilltop Hindu temples such as the Palani Murugan Temple located in Tirumala, used during pilgrimage & Machu Picchu.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

===Rail trails===

Rail trails/paths are shared-use paths that make use of abandoned railway corridors. They can be used for walking, cycling and horse riding. They exist throughout the world and the following is a description of trails in Australia:

Most trails have a gravel or dirt surface suitable for walking, mountain bikes and horses. In the USA the 27 mile/43Â km long Cheshire Rail Trail, in New Hampshire, can be used by hikers, horseback riders, snowmobilers, cross-country skiers, cyclists, or even a dogsledders.
In Canada, following the abandonment of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1989, the government of Prince Edward Island purchased the right-of-way to the entire railway system. The Confederation Trail was developed as a tip-to-tip walking/cycling gravel rail trail which doubles as a monitored and groomed snowmobile trail during the winter months, operated by the PEI Snowmobile Association.

===Bicycle trails===

This article is about a type of path. For the geometric parameter of bicycles, see Bicycle and motorcycle geometry.
Bicycle trails or shared-use paths may be built to a different set of standards than pedestrian-only trails (hiking trails or sidewalks). In some cases, bicycle trails require a harder surface, fewer changes in grade and slope, increased sight visibility, and fewer sharp changes in direction. On the other hand, the cross-slope of a bike trail may be significantly greater than a foot trail, and the path may be narrower in some cases. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommends different widths for different types of bicycle facilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/docs/b_aashtobik.pdf|title=Guide for the development of bicycle facilities|year=1999|publisher=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials[/tpl]  For example, a shared use path has a recommended one directional width of [tpl]convert|8|ft|m|2[/tpl], while a bidirectional path should be significantly wider ([tpl]convert|10|to|12|ft|m|2|disp=or[/tpl]) to accommodate bidirectional traffic and users.  The U.S. Department of Transportation provides additional guidance on recreational bicycle and pedestrian trail planning and design standards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/rectrails/manuals.htm|publisher=US Federal Highway Administration|title=Manuals and Guides for Trail Design, Construction, Maintenance, and Operation, and for Signs[/tpl]
