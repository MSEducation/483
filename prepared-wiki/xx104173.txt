Poimandres ([tpl]lang-el|Ποιμάνδρης[/tpl]; also known as Poemandres, Poemander or Pimander) is a chapter in the Corpus Hermeticum. Originally written in Greek, the title was formerly understood to mean "Man-Shepherd" from the words ποιμήν and ἀνήρ, but recent studies on its etymology have shown that it is actually derived from the Egyptian phrase Peime-nte-rê meaning "Knowledge of Re" or "Understanding of Re".From Poimandres to Jacob Böhme: gnosis, hermetism and the Christian tradition, pgs 47, 48Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, p 95  It is also a sort of deity or attribute of God as nous.
