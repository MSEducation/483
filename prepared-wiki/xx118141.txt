===1990s===

On January 6, 1994, 1st RPV Company merged with 3rd RPV Company to form 1st Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Company then on January 15, 1996, 1st UAV Company was re-designated Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 (VMU-1) and was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 13, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.
From June 5, through October 22, 1996, VMU-1 was deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of the NATO peacekeeping Operation Joint Endeavor and was the first 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing unit to arrive in-theater. From its base at Boyington Airfield near Tuzla, VMU-1 flew 36 sorties for 84.4 flight hours in support of Task Force Eagle.
During July 13, through August 15, 1998, VMU-1 operated from Cameron County Airport in Port Isabel, Texas in support of Joint Task Force Six drug interdiction and immigration enforcement operations. The squadron flew 35 sorties for 74.7 flight hours in coordination with the United States Coast Guard and the National Park Service.

===Global War on Terror===

On February 9, 2003 VMU-1 deployed to Ali As Salem Airbase, Kuwait in support of Operation Southern Focus. The squadron subsequently moved to Tactical Assembly Area Coyote near the Iraqi border and on February 28 commenced reconnaissance and surveillance flights over Iraq in support of I Marine Expeditionary Force.
March 19, 2003 saw the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom with VMU-1 in direct support of the 1st Marine Division. During its first combat sortie in support of the invasion, the squadron located and reported an enemy artillery battery that was subsequently destroyed by friendly artillery. On March 22, VMU-1 crossed the line of departure into Iraq and redeployed to Jalibah Airfield from where they supported Task Force Tarawa’s assault through An Nasariyah. On April 1, the squadron convoyed to Qalat Sikar to support Regimental Combat Team 1 operations in the vicinity of Al Kut. VMU-1 moved to An Numaniyah on April 4 from where one of their Pioneers was the first Marine UAV to fly over Baghdad. April 8, saw the squadron return to Qalat Sikar, once again in direct support of Task Force Tarawa. On April 10, the squadron returned to An Numaniyah, still in direct support of Task Force Tarawa. On April 25, the squadron relocated to Ad Diwaniyah in support of 1st Marine Division and remained there until May 25 when they returned to Al Kut.  VMU-1 returned to the United States on September 12, 2003 having flown 414 sorties for 1414 flight hours, relocated on eight occasions, and convoyed more than 1000 road miles. For their exceptional achievement, VMU-1 was recognized with the Marine Corps Aviation Association’s prestigious James Maguire Award for 2003.
On August 1, 2004 VMU-1 returned to Iraq. Operating the Pioneer UAV from Camp Taqaddum, Iraq, the squadron detected and reported armed enemy personnel on 93 occasions, enemy weapons systems on 37 occasions, enemy personnel emplacing improvised explosive devices on 14 occasions, and enemy personnel preparing to ambush friendly personnel on six occasions. Perhaps the squadron’s most significant achievement however was its participation in Operation Phantom Fury between 7 and 19 November 2004. During that operation, the I Marine Expeditionary Force took back  the city of Fallujah from insurgents. VMU-1 flew more than 50 sorties and 250 flight hours during the offensive and adjusted artillery, coordinated air strikes, and collected battle damage assessment against more than 50 targets in and around Fallujah. The squadron gained national attention for this effort in author Bing West’s article “Nowhere to Hide,” featured as the cover story for the February 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine. The essence of this article was later republished as a chapter in the same author’s best-selling book No True Glory, published in September 2005. VMU-1 returned to the United States on March 4, 2005 having flown 757 sorties for 3159 flight hours, a staggering total that equated to more than a decade’s worth of peacetime flight hours flown in only seven months.
VMU-1 returned to Iraq for a third time during August 2005. This deployment saw the integration of the SE-15 Scan Eagle UAV with the venerable Pioneer. Along with its Pioneer facility at Camp Taqaddum, VMU-1 fielded Scan Eagle Detachment Bravo at Camp Al Qaim near the Syrian border and Scan Eagle Detachment Charlie at Camp Al Asad.   Of particular significance during the deployment was VMU-1’s participation in Operation Steel Curtain, the Regimental Combat Team 2 offensive to kill or capture insurgents and restore order in the Western Euphrates River Valley cities of Husaybah, Karabilah, Sadah, and Ubaydi during November 2005. The Watchdogs detected and positively identified more than 20 enemy combatants who were subsequently dispatched by friendly air power and helped coordinate more than 30 fixed and rotary-wing air strikes during the two-week battle. The VMU-1 Watchhogs flew 780 Pioneer sorties for 3215 flight hours, and 573 Scan Eagle sorties for 5261 flight hours during the deployment.
In October 2007, VMU-1 became the first squadron in the Marine Corps to begin flying the RQ-7 Shadow in combat in Iraq.[ref]
