John of Patmos (also called John the Revelator, John the Divine, or John the Theologian) is the name given to the author of the Book of Revelation, the apocalyptic text forming the final chapter of the New Testament. The text of Revelation states that the author is called John and that he lives on the Greek island of Patmos, where by some, he is considered to be in exile as a result of anti-Christian persecution under the Roman emperor Domitian.Souvay, Charles.

Traditionally, the John who authored Revelation is considered to be John the Apostle, author of all the Johannine works, that is the Gospel of John, the first, second, and third epistles of John, as well as Revelation. However, many modern scholars agree that Revelation was written by a separate, otherwise unknown, author, to whom they have given the name John of Patmos.Stephen L Harris, Understanding the Bible, (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985), 355[tpl]Cite book|last=Ehrman |first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

The author of the Book of Revelation identifies himself as "John""Revelation, Book of." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 Traditionally, this named author is believed to be the same person as both John the apostle of Jesus and John the author of the Fourth Gospel. The early 2nd century writer, Justin Martyr, was the first to equate the author of Revelation with John the Apostle.Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, 81.4 However, some biblical scholars now contend that these were separate individuals.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible.

==Island of Patmos==

John is considered to be exiled to Patmos, undergoing a time of persecution under the Roman rule of Domitian.
