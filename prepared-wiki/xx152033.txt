==History==

Dareton had its genesis in 1922 with the recommendation to establish irrigation in the area. Pioneering settlers moved to the district soon after, but it was not until after World War II and the establishment of soldier settler farms that Dareton began to prosper.  Dareton is named for the then Water Conservation and Irrigation Commissioner Henry Dare, who was a strong advocate for the irrigation scheme.Wentworth Shire Council - Official website.
