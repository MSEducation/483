The Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, often shortened to Triple Crown, comprises three races for three-year-old Thoroughbred horses.  Winning all three of these Thoroughbred horse races is considered the greatest accomplishment of a Thoroughbred racehorse. The term originated in mid-19th century England and different nations where thoroughbred racing is popular each have their own Triple Crown series.

==United States Triple Crowns==

In the United States, the three races that make up the Triple Crown are:

===Triple Tiara===

There is also a national Triple Tiara (formerly known as the Filly Triple Crown):
Thus far, only one filly has won the national Filly Triple Crown:
From 1957 to 2002 and 2007 to 2009 the New York Triple Tiara consisted of the Acorn Stakes, the Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks (all three stakes races are run at Belmont Park in New York).
Eight fillies won the original New York Triple Tiara:
In 2010 the NYRA changed the configuration of the new Betfair TVG Triple Tiara it now consists of the Acorn Stakes run at Belmont Park, the Coaching Club American Oaks and the Alabama Stakes both run at Saratoga Race Course. 
Thus far, in 2010 and 2011 no filly has won the reconfigured Betfair TVG Triple Tiara.
==United Kingdom== 
In England, where the term Triple Crown originated with West Australian's three wins in 1853, it is made up of:
Since the 2,000 Guineas was first run in 1809, only fifteen horses (including three winners of substitute races at Newmarket during World War I) have ever won the English Triple Crown, including Nijinsky in 1970. Nijinsky is still the only winner of the English Triple Crown since World War II. For many years, it was considered unlikely that any horse would ever win the English Triple Crown again. In the winter of 2006/2007, however, trainer Jim Bolger was training his unbeaten colt Teofilo for the Triple Crownhttp://midas.picdar.co.uk/cgi-bin/RP?MatchIndex=20&urn=719112136&Random=-1364681031&FFAC=WM0000025265&searchid=1 and bookmaker William Hill plc was offering odds of only 12/1 against Teofilo winning the 2007 Triple Crown. However, the horse was withdrawn from the 2000 Guineas two days before the race after suffering a setback and never raced again.
Since Nijinsky, only Nashwan (1989), Sea the Stars (2009), and Camelot (2012) have won both the Guineas and the Derby. Between Reference Point in 1987 and Camelot in 2012, no Derby winner (not even the potential Triple Crown winners Nashwan and Sea the Stars) even entered the St. Leger.  This reluctance to compete in the St. Leger is said to be due to the impact it would have on a horse's stud value in a market where speed is preferred to stamina.

===Fillies Triple Crown===

There is also a Fillies Triple Crown for a filly winning the 1,000 Guineas Stakes, Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes.Craig, Dennis, Breeding Racehorses from Cluster Mares, J A Allen, London, 1964 In the past, this was not considered a true Triple Crown as the best fillies would run in the Derby and Two Thousand Guineas. As this is no longer the case, the Fillies' Triple Crown would now be considered as comparable as the original. Winners of the Fillies Triple Crown are:
