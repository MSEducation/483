The drug policy of the Netherlands officially has four major objectives:
By contrast, most other countries take the point of view that recreational drug use is detrimental to society and must therefore be outlawed. This has caused friction between the Netherlands and other countries about the policy for cannabis, most notably with France and Germany. As of 2004, Belgium seems to be moving toward the Dutch model and a few local German legislators are calling for experiments based on the Dutch model. Switzerland has had long and heated parliamentary debates about whether to follow the Dutch model on cannabis, most recently deciding against it in 2004; currently a ballot initiative is in the works on the question. A new law came into force in the Netherlands requiring people to have membership cards to gain entry to coffeeshops, these cards are only available to residents of the Netherlands who need to apply for the card, (known as a 'weed pass') this was promptly adopted by several provinces including the cities of Maastricht and Eindhoven, there were proposals for this to apply to Amsterdam in 2012, although after fierce opposition from the Mayor of Amsterdam and many coffeeshop owners in Amsterdam the Government decided to allow the individual provinces to determine their own policy, of which Amsterdam rejected the membership cards and therefore the entry to coffeeshops and the sale of cannabis remains permissible to anyone over the age of 18.http://www.amsterdam.info/coffee-shop-news/ By test, a few coffeeshops in the south of the Netherlands were already forced to handle this new law. Residents are complaining about growing criminality problems due to drug dealers in the streets.Weed pass sparks new problems. rnw.nl. 2012-05-09.
If seen to fruition, which seems likely, the new laws will reduce tourism in the Netherlands dramatically and cost the exchequer millions in lost revenue and well-established business are forecast to go bankrupt. The club owners argue that the previous law opened the door for other European nations with relaxed attitudes on cannabis to capitalize on the niche in the market and take the valuable tourist resource. Maastricht’s association of coffee shop owners lost in June 2012 in a Dutch court a legal challenge of the new rules against the city's mayor.Coffeeshop owners lose court battle against ban on tourists. The Amsterdam Herald. 11 June 2012. Amsterdam has decided to not enforce the new law and will continue to sell to tourists.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/amsterdam-ditches-controversial-weed-pass-law-article-1.1205634 | location=New York | work=Daily News[/tpl]
In the last few years drug tourism and certain strains of cannabis with higher concentrations of THC have challenged the former policy in the Netherlands and led to a more restrictive approach; for example, a ban on selling cannabis to tourists in coffee shops suggested to start late 2011.[ref]If this policy became widespread, however, the drug tourism would cease to exist.

[/ref]
In October 2011 the Dutch government proposed a new law to the Dutch parliament, that will put cannabis with 15% THC or more onto the list of hard drugs. If the law comes into effect, it would prohibit "coffee shops" from selling cannabis of that potency. The government finds motivation from its experts' assertions, that cannabis of that strength have an "unacceptable risk" associated with its usage.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] 
Today, about 80% of the "coffee shops" sell, among their products, such kind of cannabis.Zware cannabis wordt harddrug, de Rijksoforheid voor Nederland, 2011
While the legalization of cannabis remains controversial, the introduction of heroin-assisted treatment in 1998 has been lauded for considerably improving the health and social situation of opiate-dependent patients in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite journal|author= |pmc=2219559 |title=Heroin-assisted Treatment (HAT) a Decade Later: A Brief Update on Science and Politics |publisher=|date= July 2007|pmid=17562183 |doi=10.1007/s11524-007-9198-y |volume=84 |issue=4 |journal=J Urban Health |pages=552–62[/tpl]

==Public health==

Large-scale dealing, production, import and export are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, even if it does not supply end users or coffeeshops with more than the allowed amounts. Exactly how coffeeshops get their supplies is rarely investigated, however. The average concentration of THC in the cannabis sold in coffeeshops has increased from 9% in 1998 to 18% in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2006.html |title=Word Drug report, 2006, Chapter 2.3 |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl] This means that less plant material has to be consumed to achieve the same effect.  One of the reasons is plant breeding and use of greenhouse technology for illegal growing of cannabis in Netherlands.
The former minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner announced in June 2007 that cultivation of cannabis shall continue to be illegal.

==Non-enforcement==

The drug policy of the Netherlands is marked by its distinguishing between so called "soft" and "hard drugs".  An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17760130/ns/health-addictions |title=Alcohol, tobacco among riskiest drugs |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl] is legal and a soft drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a golden opportunity for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, and as a result the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2061261.ece/Call_for_end_to_distinction_between_soft_and_hard_drugs |title=Call for end to distinction between soft and hard drugs |publisher=Nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]
Cannabis remains a controlled substance in the Netherlands and both possession and production for personal use are still misdemeanors, punishable by fines. Coffee shops are also technically illegal but are flourishing nonetheless. However, a policy of non-enforcement has led to a situation where reliance upon non-enforcement has become common, and because of this the courts have ruled against the government when individual cases were prosecuted.
This is because the Dutch Ministry of Justice applies a gedoogbeleid (tolerance policy) with regard to the category "soft drugs": an official set of guidelines telling public prosecutors under which circumstances offenders should not be prosecuted. This is a more official version of a common practice in other European countries wherein law enforcement sets priorities regarding offenses on which it is important enough to spend limited resources.
According to current gedoogbeleid the possession of a maximum amount of five grams cannabis for personal use is not prosecuted. Cultivation is treated in a similar way. Cultivation of 5 plants or less is usually not prosecuted when they are renounced by the cultivator.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justitie.nl/onderwerpen/criminaliteit/drugs/softdrugs/ |title=Drugs | Rijksoverheid.nl |publisher=Justitie.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl] (in Dutch)
Proponents of gedoogbeleid argue that such a policy practices more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, it has long been determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties.[tpl]cite news | author=Marc Peeperkorn | title=Kamer voor legaliseren softdrugs| url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/den_haag/article164670.ece | work=Volkskrant | date=22 April 2003 | accessdate=31 January 2009 | language=Dutch | quote=To make the sale, trade and growth of soft drugs not punishable is currently hindered by United Nations treaties.[/tpl] A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs.

==Drug law enforcement==

Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is hard drug trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.content&sLanguageISO=EN&nNodeID=5174 |title=ELDD : Country profiles, Netherlands |publisher=Eldd.emcdda.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]  It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of any drug that affects driving ability to such an extent that you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving.  For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested.  Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while under influence of any drug, is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident). Suspension of driving license is also normal in such a case (maximum 5 years).EMCDDA: Drugs and driving, page 9, June 2003[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] Schiphol, a large international airport near Amsterdam, has long practiced a zero tolerance policy regarding airline passengers carrying drugs.

Despite the high priority given by the Dutch government to fighting illegal drug trafficking, the Netherlands continue to be an important transit point for drugs entering Europe.

In recent years, it also introduced so-called 100% checks and bodyscans at Schiphol Airport on incoming flights from Dutch overseas territories Aruba and Netherlands Antilles to prevent importing cocaine by means of swallowing balloons by mules.
Although drug use, as opposed to trafficking, is seen primarily as a public health issue, responsibility for drug policy is shared by both the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports, and the Ministry of Justice.
The Netherlands spends more than €130 million annually on facilities for addicts, of which about fifty percent goes to drug addicts. The Netherlands has extensive demand reduction programs, reaching about ninety percent of the country's 25,000 to 28,000 hard drug users. The number of hard drug addicts has stabilized in the past few years and their average age has risen to 38 years, which is generally seen as a positive trend. Notably, the number of drug-related deaths in the country remains amongst the lowest in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index64151EN.html |title=page 84 |publisher=Emcdda.europa.eu |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]
On 27 November 2003, the Dutch Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner announced that his government was considering rules under which coffeeshops would only be allowed to sell soft drugs to Dutch residents in order to satisfy both European neighbors' concerns about the influx of drugs from the Netherlands, as well as those of Netherlands border town residents unhappy with the influx of "drug tourists" from elsewhere in Europe. The European Court of Justice ruled in December 2010 that Dutch authorities can ban coffee shops from selling marijuana to foreigners. The EU court said the southern Dutch city of Maastricht was within its rights when it introduced a "weed passport" in 2005 to prevent foreigners from entering cafés that sell marijuana.EURAD: Dutch authorities can ban coffee shops from selling marijuana to foreigners[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl]
In 2010 the owner of Netherlands's largest cannabis selling coffee shop was fined 10 million euros for breaking drug laws by keeping more than the tolerated amount of cannabis in the shop. He was also sentenced to a 16 week prison term.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8587576.stm |title=Dutch coffee shop fined 10m euros for breaking drug law, BBC,25 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]

==Results of the drug policy==

Criminal investigations into more serious forms of organized crime mainly involve drugs (72%). Most of these are investigations of hard drug crime (specifically cocaine and synthetic drugs) although the number of soft drug cases is rising and currently accounts for 69% of criminal investigations.Trimbos Institute: Cannabis use stable, but treatment demand rising; National Drug Monitor Annual Report 2006 (19-06-2007) [tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl]

==Implications of international law==

The Netherlands is a party to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The 1961 convention prohibits cultivation and trade of naturally-occurring drugs such as cannabis; the 1971 treaty bans the manufacture and trafficking of synthetic drugs such as barbiturates and amphetamines; and the 1988 convention requires states to criminalize illicit drug possession:
The International Narcotics Control Board typically interprets this provision to mean that states must prosecute drug possession offenses. The conventions clearly state that controlled substances are to be restricted to scientific and medical uses. However, Cindy Fazey, former Chief of Demand Reduction for the United Nations Drug Control Programme, believes that the treaties have enough ambiguities and loopholes to allow some room to maneuver. In her report entitled The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control, she notes:
The Dutch policy of keeping anti-drug laws on the books while limiting enforcement of certain offenses is carefully designed to reduce harm while still complying with the letter of international drug control treaties. This is necessary in order to avoid criticism from the International Narcotics Board, which historically has taken a dim view of any moves to relax official drug policy. In their annual report, the Board has criticised many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis, Australia for providing injecting rooms and the United Kingdom for proposing to downgrade the classification of cannabis,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm |title=aprile 2003 |publisher=fuoriluogo.it |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl] which it has since done (although this change was reversed by the Home Secretary on 7 May 2008 against the advice of its own commissioned report)

==Recent developments==

The liberal drug policy of the authorities in the Netherlands especially led to problems in "border hot spots" that attracted "drug tourism" as well as trafficking and related law enforcement problems in towns like Enschede in the East and Terneuzen, Venlo, Maastricht and Heerlen in the South. In 2006, Gerd Leers, then mayor of the border city of Maastricht, on the Dutch-Belgian border, criticised the current policy as inconsistent, by recording a song with the Dutch punk rock band De Heideroosjes. By allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis, but not cultivation or wholesale, the government creates numerous problems of crime and public safety, he alleges, and therefore he would like to switch to either legalising and regulating production, or to the full repression that his party (CDA) officially advocates. The latter suggestion has widely been interpreted as rhetorical.http://www.maastricht.nl/maastricht/show/id=160045 Leers's comments have garnered support from other local authorities and put the cultivation issue back on the agenda.
In November 2008, Pieter van Geel, the leader of the CDA (Christian Democrats) in the Dutch parliament, called for a ban on the cafés where marijuana is sold. He said the practice of allowing so-called coffee shops to operate had failed. The CDA had the support of its smaller coalition partner, the CU (ChristenUnie), but the third party in government, PvdA (Labour), opposed. The coalition agreement worked out by the three coalition parties in 2007 stated that there would be no change in the policy of tolerance. Prominent CDA member Gerd Leers spoke out against him: cannabis users who now cause no trouble would be viewed as criminals if an outright ban was to be implemented. Van Geel later said that he respected the coalition agreement and would not press for a ban during the current government's tenure .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2055680.ece/More_pressure_on_cannabis_coffee_shops |title=More pressure on cannabis coffee shops |publisher=Nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]
By 2009, 27 coffee shops selling cannabis in Rotterdam, all within 200 metres from schools, must close down. This is nearly half of the coffee shops that currently operate within its municipality.
