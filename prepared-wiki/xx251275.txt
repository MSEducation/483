CATEGORIES: Compositions by Howard Hanson, 20th-century symphonies, 1930 compositions

The Symphony No. 2 in D-flat major, Opus 30, W45,p. 49 (1993) Perone "Romantic", was written by Howard Hanson on commission from Serge Koussevitsky for the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1930,p. 24 (2004) Cohen and published by Carl Fischer Music.
The symphony, written for a standard orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, cymbals, harp and strings, was premiered by Koussevitzky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra on November 28, 1930. Soon after Arturo Toscanini played it with the New York Philharmonic.p. 407 (1993) Canarina Hanson himself has conducted and recorded the work with the Eastman-Rochester Symphony Orchestra. Other conductors include Erich Kunzel, Sir Neville Marriner, Gerard Schwarz, Leonard Slatkin, but most performances today are by youth and amateur orchestras.p. 406 (1993) Canarina "The Second Symphony by Howard Hanson, the Third by Robert Ward and the Third of Roy Harris are within the capabilities of our American community orchestras."p. 74, Van Horn (1979) James.

The symphony is in three movements, with much thematic material shared among the movements.
The "lyrical, haunting second theme" of the first movement has become known as the "Interlochen theme"p. 24 (2004) Cohen (as it is performed at the conclusion of all concerts at the Interlochen Center for the Arts).It reappears "with greater emphasis" in the following two movements.p. 407 (1993) Canarina The slow movement was arranged for concert band by Norman Goldberg and in this form was also published by Carl Fischer.p. 49 (1993) Perone
Hanson considered himself a "perfect fifth composer" or a "major third composer," but in this symphony, it is the perfect fourth "that plays a prominent part throughout the symphony in both melody and harmony."p. 141 (2004) Cohen Despite the abundance of triplets, the Bruckner rhythm occurs only in a few spots, mainly in the horns' and trumpets' parts; the others are in the timpani in the first movement,Measure 10, p. 2 (1930) Hanson and at the end of a longer rhythmical motif in the finale.Letter G, p. 103 forward (1930) Hanson
While Hanson is deemed to have broken new ground in the symphony, he "produced a popular concert work which is the epitome of the twentieth-century symphony that could have been written by an American."p. 140 (1998) Butterworth Virgil Thomson, a contemporary of Hanson's opined of Hanson's music in general that "I have never yet found in any work of his a single phrase or turn of harmony that did not sound familiar," and of the symphony specifically "it is as standardized in expression as it is eclectic in style. Not a surprise from beginning to end, nor any adventure."p. 179 (1998) Steinberg

T.p. 6 (1994) Karlin
Hanson himself conducted the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra in a 1958 stereo recording of the symphony for Mercury Records, which was later reissued on CD and has remained in catalogues for many years.
The symphony had the distinction of being one of the very few American works that Arturo Toscanini conducted when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; however, Toscanini did not record the music, even during the many years he led the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
