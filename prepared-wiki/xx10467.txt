Keith Rupert Murdoch, AC, KSG (born 11 March 1931) is an Australian American business magnate. Murdoch became managing director of Australia's News Limited, inherited from his father, in 1952. He is the founder, Chairman and CEO of global media holding company News Corporation, the world's second-largest media conglomerate, and its successors News Corp and 21st Century Fox after the conglomerate split on 28 June 2013.[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2009/industries/145/index.html|work=CNN|title= Fortune|accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/investorrelations/Investor_Relations_Docs/Q407%20Web%20Deck%20FINAL.pdf |title=PowerPoint Presentation|format=PDF|accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/09/news/companies/disney_dreamworks.fortune/?postversion=2009020914|work=CNN|title=Why Disney wants DreamWorks|date=9 February 2009|accessdate=20 May 2010|first=Richard|last=Siklos[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscorp.com/Report2007/AnnualReport2007/HTML2/news_corp_ar2007_0069.htm |title=News Corporation – Annual Report 2007|publisher=Newscorp|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl]
In the 1950s and '60s, he acquired various newspapers in Australia and New Zealand, before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969, taking over the News of the World followed closely by The Sun. He moved to New York in 1974 to expand into the US market, but retained interests in Australia and Britain. In 1981, he bought The Times, his first British broadsheet, and became a naturalised US citizen in 1985.
In 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, he consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping, causing bitter industrial disputes. His News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989)[tpl]cite news|title=Rupert Murdoch faces authors' revolt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/analysis/61122.stm|work=BBC|accessdate=24 July 2011|date=1 March 1998[/tpl] and  The Wall Street Journal (2007).  He formed BSkyB in 1990 and during the 1990s expanded into Asian networks and South American television. By 2000 Murdoch's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries with a net worth of over $5 billion.
In July 2011 Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty and public citizens. He faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the US.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634757/Phone-hacking-David-Cameron-announces-terms-of-phone-hacking-inquiry.html|title=Phone hacking: David Cameron announces terms of phone-hacking inquiry|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Telegraph|date=13 July 2011|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Ed Pilkington in New York, Andrew Gumbel and agencies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/14/fbi-news-corp-hacking-claims?INTCMP=SRCH |title=FBI to investigate News Corporation over 9/11 hacking allegations|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=24 April 2012 |location=London[/tpl] On 21 July 2012, Murdoch resigned as a director of News International.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18940016|title=Rupert Murdoch resigns as News International director|accessdate=21 July 2012|work=BBC News|date=21 July 2012|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/world/europe/murdoch-resigns-from-british-newspaper-boards.html?_r=1|title= Murdoch Resigns From His British Papers' Boards|date= 23 July 2012|work=The New York Times|first1=John F.|last1=Burns|first2=Ravi| last2=Somaiya[/tpl] In 2014, Murdoch was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame for his contributions in the field of television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/julia-louis-dreyfus-david-e-kelley-jay-leno-rupert-murdoch-ray-dolby-brandon-stoddard-named-to-tv-academys-hall-of-fame/|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David E.

==Early  life==

Murdoch was born Keith Rupert Murdoch on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Australia to Sir Keith Murdoch (1885–1952) and Elisabeth Joy Greene (1909–2012), daughter of Rupert Greene. Rupert Murdoch is of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. His parents were also born in Melbourne. Keith Murdoch was a war correspondent and later a regional newspaper magnate owning two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia, and a radio station in a faraway mining town.The encyclopedia of the history of American management (2005) Morgen Witzel Continuum International Publishing Group p393 ISBN 978-1-84371-131-5 Later in life, Keith Rupert chose to use Rupert, the first name of his maternal grandfather.
Keith Murdoch the elder asked for a rendezvous with his future wife after seeing her debutante photograph in one of his own newspapers and they married in 1928, when she was aged 19 and he 23 years her senior. In addition to Rupert, the couple had three daughters: Janet Calvert-Jones, Anne Kantor and Helen Handbury (1929–2004.)
Murdoch attended Geelong Grammar School,[tpl]cite book|author=Sue Vander Hook|title=Rupert Murdoch: News Corporation Magnate|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MW0VHI3lumYC|year=2011|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61714-782-1|pages=19[/tpl] where he had his first experience of editing a publication, being co-editor of the school's official journal The Corian and editor of the student journal If Revived.[tpl]cite journal|journal=The Corian|date=May 1948|volume=LXXIV|issue=1|page=6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=The Corian|date=May 1950|volume=LXXVII|issue=1|page=23[/tpl] He also took his School's cricket team to the National Junior Finals. He worked part-time at the Melbourne Herald and was groomed by his father from an early age to take over the family business. Murdoch read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Worcester College, the University of Oxford in England, where he supported the Labour Party and managed Oxford Student Publications Limited, the publishing house of Cherwell Newspaper.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/pdf/OT_Michaelmas_2009.pdf|work=Oxford Today|location=Oxford|title=Oxford Today, Oxford University alumni magazine|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] After her husband's death from cancer in 1952, Elisabeth Murdoch went on to invest herself in charity work, as life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and establishing the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. At 102 (in 2011), she had 74 descendants.[tpl]cite news|last=Barnett |first=Laura |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/20/rupert-murdoch-listen-to-mother?INTCMP=SRCH |title=If only Rupert Murdoch would listen to his mother|work=The Guardian|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=24 April 2012 |location=London[/tpl]  Murdoch completed an MA before working as a sub-editor with the Daily Express for two years.

==Activities in Australia and New Zealand==

Following his father's death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of the family business News Limited, which had been established in 1923. Rupert Murdoch turned its newspaper, Adelaide News, its main asset, into a major success.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2162658.stm|title=Rupert Murdoch: Bigger than Kane|last=Walker|first=Andrew|date=31 July 2002|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=27 December 2009[/tpl] He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid, The Daily Mirror (1960). The Economist describes Murdoch as "inventing the modern tabloid",[tpl]cite news|title=Last of the moguls|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18988526?story_id=18988526|work=The Economist|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=21 July 2011[/tpl] as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.
Murdoch's first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily The Dominion. In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, Murdoch read of a takeover bid for the Wellington paper by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate, Lord Thomson of Fleet. On the spur of the moment, he launched a counter-bid.  A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful.[tpl]cite web|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/notw-phone-hacking-allegations/Profile-Rupert-Murdoch.6801177.jp |title=Profile: Rupert Murdoch|work=The Scotsman|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] Later in 1964, Murdoch launched The Australian, Australia's first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney.[tpl]Cite news|last=Cryle|first=Denis|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/welcome-antidote-to-news-limited-and-selfserving-spin-20090127-7r0g.html | title= Welcome antidote to News' limited and self-serving spin|work = The Age|date=28 January 2009|location=Melbourne[/tpl][tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid The Daily Telegraph from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him.[tpl]cite web|last=Dr  Engledow|first=Sarah|title=Vintage Cassab|url=http://www.portrait.gov.au/magazine/article.php?articleID=178&author=14|publisher=Magazine of Australian and International Portraiture.

In 1999, Murdoch significantly expanded his music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian independent label, Michael Gudinski's Mushroom Records; he merged that with Festival Records, and the result was Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch's son James Murdoch for several years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/09/1131407684176.html|title=A long way to the bottom|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 November 2005|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]

===Political activities in Australia===

Murdoch found a political ally in John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt Liberal Party. From the very first issue of The Australian Murdoch began taking McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners. (The Australian, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: "Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.") It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics. It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well.Don Garden, Theodor Fink: A Talent for Ubiquity (Melbourne University Press 1998)
After McEwen and Menzies retired,  Murdoch threw his growing power behind the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected[tpl]cite news|title=A man of selfish loyalties: Rupert Murdoch's apparent overture to Tony Blair strikes a chilling chord among Australian politicians he has supported|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/a-man-of-selfish-loyalties-rupert-murdochs-apparent-overture-to-tony-blair-strikes-a-chilling-chord-among-australian-politicians-he-has-supported-1376362.html|date=14 August 1994|work=The Independent |accessdate=24 July 2011|location=London|first=Robert|last=Milliken[/tpl] on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia's oil, gas and mineral resources. Rupert Murdoch's backing of  Whitlam turned out to be brief. Murdoch had already started his short-lived National Star newspaper in America, and was seeking to strengthen his political contacts there.Shawcross, (1987) pp. 30–39
Asked about the Australian federal election, 2007 at News Corporation's annual general meeting in New York on 19 October 2007, its chairman Rupert Murdoch said, "I am not commenting on anything to do with Australian politics. I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that." Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: "I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that – the  editors."Michael Roland, Murdoch tight-lipped on election, ABC News Online, published 20 October 2007 In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was "oversensitive".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/rudd-too-sensitive-for-own-good-murdoch/story-e6frg8zx-1225795200045 |title=Rudd too sensitive for own good: Murdoch |work=The Australian   |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010[/tpl] Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as "...more ambitious to lead the world tackling climate change than to lead Australia..." and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 as unnecessary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-national/rudd-too-sensitive-to-criticism-murdoch-20091107-i2oo.html |title=Rudd too sensitive to criticism: Murdoch |publisher=Brisbane Times |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010[/tpl] Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly  that "the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven" as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.[tpl]cite news | title=Comment: Rudd and the Murdoch Press |date=September 2009 |author=Mungo MacCallum| url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-mungo-maccallum-comment-rudd-and-murdoch-press-1945|work=The Monthly |pages=8–11 |accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl]

==Activities in the United Kingdom==

===Business activities in the United Kingdom===

In 1968 Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily broadsheet The Sun from IPC.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/jul/18/citynews.pressandpublishing | contribution = Rupert Murdoch – a lifetime of deals | title = Guardian | date = 18 July 2007 | location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers. On acquiring it, he appointed Albert 'Larry' Lamb as editor and – Lamb recalled later – told him: "I want a tearaway paper with lots of tits in it". In 1997 The Sun attracted 10 million daily readers. In 1981, Murdoch acquired the struggling Times and Sunday Times from Canadian newspaper publisher Lord Thomson of Fleet. Ownership of The Times came to him through his relationship with Lord Thomson, who had grown tired of losing money on it as a result of much industrial action that stopped publication.Harold Evans, Good Times, Bad Times, 1983 In the light of success and expansion at The Sun the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around. Harold Evans, Editor of the Sunday Times from 1967, was made head of the daily Times, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/481851.stm |title=Journalist legend calls it a day|publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 1999 |accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]"Murdoch guaranteed that editors would have control of the political policy of their newspapers ... that the editors would not be subject to instruction from the proprietor on selection and balance of news and opinion ... that instructions to journalists would be given only by their editor".  Harold Evans Good Times, Bad Times. 1984
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Murdoch's publications were generally supportive of Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Page (2003) p. 3, pp. 253–419 At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the Labour Party and its leader, Tony Blair. The closeness of his relationship with Blair and their secret meetings to discuss national policies was to become a political issue in Britain.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jul/23/newscorporation.rupertmurdoch |work=The Guardian  | location=London | title = The PM, the mogul and the secret agenda | first=Gaby | last= Hinsliff | date= 23 July 2006 | accessdate=10 April 2010[/tpl] This later changed, with The Sun, in its English editions, publicly renouncing the ruling Labour government and lending its support to David Cameron's Conservative Party, which soon afterwards formed a coalition government. In Scotland, where the Tories had yet to recover from their complete annihilation in 1997, the paper began to endorse the Scottish National Party (though not yet its flagship policy of independence), which soon after came to form the first ever outright majority in the proportionally elected Scottish Parliament. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's official spokesman said in November 2009 that Brown and Murdoch "were in regular communication" and that "there is nothing unusual in the prime minister talking to Rupert Murdoch".[tpl]Cite news|last=Mulholland|first= Hélène| title= Gordon Brown spoke to Rupert Murdoch after misspelling row|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 November 2009 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/nov/12/gordon-brown-rupert-murdoch-misspelling| location=London[/tpl]
In 1986, Murdoch introduced electronic production processes to his newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States. The greater degree of automation led to significant reductions in the number of employees involved in the printing process.  In England, the move roused the anger of the print unions, resulting in a long and often violent dispute that played out in Wapping, one of London's docklands areas, where Murdoch had installed the very latest electronic newspaper purpose-built publishing facility in an old warehouse.Page (2003), pp. 368–93 The bitter dispute at Wapping started with the dismissal of 6,000 employees who had gone on strike and resulted in street battles and demonstrations. Many on the political left in Britain alleged the collusion of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government with Murdoch in the Wapping affair, as a way of damaging the British trade union movement.[tpl]cite web | title = The Guardian | location = London| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/oct/12/rupertmurdoch.citynews1?INTCMP=SRCH | contribution = Fortress Wapping: A history | date = 12 October 2004  | first=Dominic | last=Timms [/tpl]Rt. Hon. Tony Benn cited in Hansard, 8 May 1986. 'The mounted police advanced out of the plant exactly as the tactical options manual says that they should. They ran into the crowd. They were covered by riot police who did several things. First they ran indiscriminately into the crowd and battered people who had had nothing whatsoever to do with any stones that might have been thrown...  They surrounded the bus that was acting as an ambulance.  One man had a heart attack and I appealed over the loudspeaker for the police to withdraw to allow an ambulance to come. None was allowed for 30 minutes.  When the man was put on a trestle a police horse jostled it and the man nearly fell off as he was carried out to the ambulance. The police surrounded the park where the meeting took place.  They surrounded the area so that people could not escape.'[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/07/08/uk-newscorp-wapping-idUKTRE7675GM20110708 | title = Murdoch protests come full circle 25 years on | publisher = Reuters | date = 8 July 2011 | place = UK [/tpl]  In 1987, the dismissed workers accepted a settlement of £60 million.
Murdoch's British-based satellite network, Sky Television, incurred massive losses in its early years of operation. As with many of his other business interests, Sky was heavily subsidised by the profits generated by his other holdings, but convinced rival satellite operator British Satellite Broadcasting to accept a merger on his terms in 1990.  They were quick to see the advantages of direct to home (DTH) satellite broadcasting that did not require costly cable networks and the merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market ever since.[tpl]Cite journal | publisher = OFTEL | place = UK | title = Submission to the ITC on competition issues arising from the award of digital terrestrial television multiplex licences | quote = The OFT has already found BSkyB to be dominant in the wholesale market for premium programming content (particularly certain sports and movie rights).

===Political activities in United Kingdom===

In Britain, in the 1980s, Murdoch formed a close alliance with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and The Sun credited itself with helping her successor John Major to win an unexpected election victory in the 1992 general election, which had been expected to end in a hung parliament or a narrow win for Neil Kinnock's Labour.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3654446.stm |publisher=BBC | work = News | title= Forty years of The Sun | date= 14 September 2004 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | first=Torin | last=Douglas[/tpl] In the general elections of 1997, 2001 and 2005, Murdoch's papers were either neutral or supported Labour under Tony Blair. This has led some critics to argue that Murdoch simply supports the incumbent parties (or those who seem most likely to win an upcoming election) in the hope of influencing government decisions that may affect his businesses.
The Labour Party, from when Tony Blair became leader in 1994, had moved from the Left to a more central position on many economic issues prior to 1997. Murdoch identifies himself as a libertarian, saying "What does libertarian mean? As much individual responsibility as possible, as little government as possible, as few rules as possible. But I'm not saying it should be taken to the absolute limit."[tpl]cite news | last=Shawcross|first=William|title= Rupert Murdoch|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20050911160021/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/intl/article/0,9171,1107991025-33716,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=29 November 2012|date=3 November 1999[/tpl]

Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. Soon afterwards, he founded Star, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post. On 4 September 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only US citizens were permitted to own US television stations. This resulted in Murdoch losing his Australian citizenship.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Given | first = Jock| title = Foreign Ownership of Media and Telecommunications: an Australian story| journal=Media & Arts Law Review| volume = 7| issue = 4| page = 253| date = December 2002| url = http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/cmcl/malr/7-4-1%20Foreign%20Ownership%20Formatted%20for%20web.pdf| format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title = The World's Billionaires No.73 Rupert Murdoch| newspaper=Forbes| date = 7 October 2007| url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_Rupert-Murdoch_639W.html| accessdate =8 October 2009[/tpl]
Marvin Davis sold Marc Rich's interest in 20th Century Fox to Murdoch for $250 million in March 1984. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge's Metromedia television stations.

In 1987 in Australia, he bought The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, the company that his father had once managed. By 1990 News Corporation had built up debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK). forcing Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s. In 1993, it took exclusive coverage of the National Football League (NFL) from CBS and increased programming to seven days a week.Rupert Murdoch: News Corporation Magnate (2011) Sue Vander Hook. ABDO Publishing ISBN 1-61714-782-6 pp78-9 In 1995, Murdoch's Fox Network became the object of scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), when it was alleged that News Ltd.'s Australian base made Murdoch's ownership of Fox illegal. However, the FCC ruled in Murdoch's favour, stating that his ownership of Fox was in the best interests of the public.  That same year, Murdoch announced a deal with MCI Communications to develop a major news website and magazine, The Weekly Standard. Also that year, News Corporation launched the Foxtel pay television network in Australia in partnership with Telstra. In 1996, Murdoch decided to enter the cable news market with the Fox News Channel, a 24-hour cable news station.

In 2004, Murdoch announced that he was moving News Corporation headquarters from Adelaide, Australia to the United States. Choosing a US domicile was designed to ensure that American fund managers could purchase shares in the company, since many were deciding not to buy shares in non-US companies. Some analysts believed that News Corporation's Australian domicile was leading to the company being undervalued compared with its peers.

In his testimony, Murdoch called for ending mass deportations and endorsed a "comprehensive immigration reform" plan that would include a pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants.
In the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, Murdoch has been critical of the competence of Mitt Romney's team but nonetheless has been strongly supportive of a Republican victory, tweeting: "Of course I want him Romney to win, save us from socialism, etc."[tpl]cite news | work = Los Angeles Times | first = Morgan | last= Little | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-rupert-murdoch-wants-romney-to-win-despite-criticisms-20120702,0,772977.story | title = Rupert Murdoch wants Romney to win despite criticisms | date = 2 July 2012 | accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]

The deal enables News International to broadcast from Hong Kong  to India, China, Japan and over thirty other countries in Asia, becoming one of the biggest satellite TV networks in the east. However, the deal did not work out as Murdoch had planned, because the Chinese government placed restrictions on it that prevented it from reaching most of China.

After graduating from Vassar College and marrying classmate Elkin Kwesi Pianim (the son of Ghanaian financial and political mogul Kwame Pianim) in 1993, Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, along with her husband, purchased a pair of NBC-affiliate television stations in California, KSBW and KSBY, with a $35 million loan provided by her father. By quickly re-organising and re-selling them at a $12 million profit in 1995, Elisabeth emerged as an unexpected rival to her brothers for the eventual leadership of the publishing dynasty's empire. But after divorcing her first husband in 1998 and quarrelling publicly with her assigned mentor Sam Chisholm at BSkyB, she struck out on her own as a television and film producer in London. She has since enjoyed independent success, in conjunction with her second husband, Matthew Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud (the founder of psychoanalysis) whom she met in 1997 and married in 2001.[tpl]cite web | location = UK | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/13/elisabeth-murdoch-matthew-freud-politics | contribution = Inside the court of London's golden couple | title = The Guardian | date = 13 November 2008 | first=John | last=Harris | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
It is not known how long Murdoch will remain as News Corporation's CEO. For a while the American cable television entrepreneur John Malone was the second-largest voting shareholder in News Corporation after Murdoch himself, potentially undermining the family's control.  In 2007, the company announced that it would sell certain assets and give cash to Malone's company in exchange for its stock.  In 2007, the company issued Murdoch's older children voting stock.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/business/media/02murdoch.html| title = New York Times | contribution = Wife and Ex-Wife Now Shape News Corp.'s Fate | date = 2 August 2005 | work=The New York Times | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

Murdoch has been portrayed
It has been speculated that the character of Elliot Carver, the global media magnate and main villain in the 1997 James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies, is based on Murdoch.  The writer of the film, Bruce Feirstein, has stated that Carver was actually inspired by British press magnate Robert Maxwell, who was one of Murdoch's rivals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/01/bruce-feirste-2.html | title =Bruce Feirstein: The Tao of Bond-Film Naming |date=29 January 2008|work= Vanity Fair | first= Bruce | last = Feirstein[/tpl]

In 1999, the Ted Turner owned TBS aired an original sitcom, The Chimp Channel. This featured an all-simian cast and the role of an Australian TV veteran named Harry Waller.  The character is described as "a self-made gazillionaire with business interests in all sorts of fields. He owns newspapers, hotel chains, sports franchises and genetic technologies, as well as everyone's favourite cable TV channel, The Chimp Channel." Waller is thought to be a parody of Murdoch, a long-time rival of Turner's.[tpl]Cite news | last = Lucas | first = Michael P | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/01/entertainment/ca-42906 | title=Some 'Chimp Channel' Segments Descend From Classics | work=Los Angeles Times | date = 1 June 1999 | accessdate =8 April 2010 [/tpl]

==Influence, wealth and reputation==

Murdoch's reputation and influence have been noted, both positively and negatively.
According to the 2013 list of Forbes richest Americans, Murdoch is the 33rd richest person in the US and the 91st-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $13.4 billion.
Murdoch has been listed three times in the Time 100 as among the most influential people in the world. In May 2012, Forbes ranked him as the 24th most powerful person in the world.The World's Most Powerful People, Forbes.
In connection with Murdoch's testimony to the Leveson Inquiry "into the ethics of the British press", editor of Newsweek International, Tunku Varadarajan, referred to him as "the man whose name is synonymous with unethical newspapers".[tpl]cite news | first=Tunku | last=Varadarajan | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/04/29/world-on-a-page-nationalization-and-necrophilia.html | title=Nationalization and Necrophilia.

There has been controversy in Australia surrounding the 2013 federal election, with Murdoch being accused of using his newspaper interests, (News Corp currently owns 70% of Australian Newspapers), to support the campaign of the Liberal government and influence public opinion in their favor. Front page headlines have included "Finally you now have the chance to KICK THIS MOB OUT",Daily Telegraph Newspaper 5 August 2013"I KNOW NUTHINK" with the faces of Prime-minister Kevin Rudd and Deputy PM Anthony Albanese photo-shopped into images which depict them wearing Nazi uniforms,Dailey Telegraph Newspaper 8 August 2013 and "Send in the Clown" featuring a picture of PM Kevin Rudd with Labor candidate Peter Beatty, a former Queensland Premier.Courier-Mail Newspaper 9 August 2013 The 7:30 Report program broadcast by ABC1 on 6 August 2013 featured a report by journalist Greg Hoy and led with the following, "Rupert Murdoch's tweets and his papers' headlines have generated conspiracy theories about his interest in the federal election and even prompted a response from the Prime Minister, so what is behind that interest?" The report went on to say, "Underlying this debate are claims Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has a strong vested interest in the outcome of this election. This theory revolves around major differences between the broadband plans of the Coalition and the Government and how they will impact on the value of News Corp's greatest asset in Australia, its half share and management control of the Foxtel pay TV monopoly". The Liberal Party won the majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the election on 7 September 2013, and party leader Tony Abbott is the Prime-minister elect. Potential benefits to Murdoch and News Corp include: changes to anti-siphoning legislation which regulate the broadcast of sporting events the Minister for Communications deems should be televised on a specified free to air channel; 100% acquisition of Foxtel which posted a $1 billion profit in the last reporting period; and changes to the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act which nominates ABC as the only international news service in Australia. Following the announcement of the Liberal Party victory at the polls, Murdoch tweeted "Aust. election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy. Other nations to follow in time" Twitter, RupertMurodoch@rupertmurdoch, 6:03am 7 September 2013
Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, founder and leader of the Palmer United Party, has threatened to sue Murdoch after being attacked in an article in The Australian. He was quoted saying "this foreigner Murdoch who tries to dictate what we do". "You know Rupert Murdoch's wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese Spy... she's been spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese Intelligence... that's why Rupert Murdoch got rid of her. And this guy wants to control Australian politics. He wants to control what you think".Tony Wright, "The Age" Newspaper, Federal Politics section, 5 September 2013
