The county, which is located at the Skagerrak coast, extends from Gjernestangen at Risør to Kvåsefjorden at Lillesand. The inner parts of the area includes Setesdalsheiene and  Austheiene. The majority of the population live near the coast; about 78% of the county's inhabitants live in the five coastal municipalities Arendal, Grimstad, Lillesand, Tvedestrand and Risør. The rest of the county is sparsely populated. Tourism is important, as Arendal and the other coastal towns are popular attractions.

==Name==

The meaning of the name is "(the) eastern (part of) Agder", since the word aust is the nynorsk form of "east".  (see also: the name of Vest-Agder county).
Until 1919, the name of the county was Nedenes amt. The amt was named after the old Nedenes farm (Norse Niðarnes), since this was the seat of the amtmann (County Governor).  The first element is the genitive case of the river name Nið (now  called the Nidelva) and the last element is nes which means "headland".  The meaning of the river name is unknown.[tpl]cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Nedenes amt|edition=8|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W. C.

==Coat-of-arms==

The coat-of-arms is from modern times.  They were granted in 1958.  It shows two golden bars on a red background.  They symbolize the lumber trade and the recovery of iron ore that was important for Aust-Agder's growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aa-f.kommune.no/sitepageview.aspx?articleID=1937|title=Fylkesvåpenet|publisher=Aust-Agder fylkeskommune|language=Norwegian[/tpl]

==Municipalities==

The system of municipalities, or kommuner, was established in Norway in 1837, based on previously existing parishes. Norway had been ceded to Sweden by Denmark in 1814, at which it promptly rebelled and won the right of self-rule, though nominally part of Sweden. In 1905, Norway declared total independence. Meanwhile, the kommuner did not remain the same, but new ones were formed, old ones broken up, and land was passed between kommuner. 
Aust-Agder is divided into 15 municipalities:

==Population==

Since the census of 1769, Aust-Agder has experienced a steady population growth: from 29,633 to 79,927 in 1900, and to 102,848 in 2001. There was significant emigration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century.
