==History==

In January 1997, with Martha Rodríguez Miranda as General Director and Enzo Cassella as vicepresident of programming and production, FM Center starts broadcasting their signal in Venezuela. For that time, the network owned only 5 radio stations: 88.9 (later to become "La Romántica"), HOT 94.1, Estrella 96.3, Fiesta 106.5 and 93.9 (Ciudad Bolívar). Only the latter was not located in the capital Caracas.
Already in 1998, FM Center swept with Venezuelan awards Premios Mara de Oro for their performance in the industry. This favored the expansion of the network towards the rest of the country. At the start of the 21st century, AM Center was created and the radio station 91.9 from Caracas was added in their stations portfolio as Life 91.9.
In 2000, the headquarters and major radio stations move to Centro Comercial Concresa in the southeast of the Venezuelan capital. The concept of the transformation was the construction of interactive studios where the audience could not only hear their programs, but also see them as they were recorded. In September, FM Center launches the first and only traffic service to drivers in the Capital District: Traffic Center. With Alejandro Cañizales aboard a red Bell Ranger helicopter, Traffic Center delivers instant and effective status of local transit. The show also informs drivers with alternative routes to avoid traffic and preventive campaigns about the many problems that affect Caracas transit system.
In 2007, FM Center launched an oversize trailer which wonders the roads of Venezuela called Showcenter Rodando. It was designed to produce live in site-transmissions and live concerts from its stage located in the rooftop of the vehicle.
In January 2008 Estrella 96.3, an emblematic and key station to the network ceased transmissions as the new state-owned ALBA Ciudad started broadcasting. The frequency was lost to FM Center when the Venezuelan government refused to renew the concession to the network.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.entornointeligente.com/resumen/resumen.php?id=537685|title=ALBA Ciudad Sustituyó a Estrella 96.3|accessdate=2008-01-04|publisher=Entorno Inteligente|location=Venezuela|language=spanish[/tpl] As a response, the first internet-based radio station was incorporated to the group under the name Estrella On-Line as a clear reference to Estrella 96.3, maintaining similar formats and shows. Nowadays, FM Center's radio stations are interconnected via Directv satellite.
