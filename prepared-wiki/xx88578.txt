In 2002, Celeste announced that she had secretly been ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church under the pseudonym Angela White. She was one of seven women (Danube Seven) ordained by Argentinian Independent Catholic Bishop Rómulo Antonio Braschi on a boat in the Danube River, making her the first female American Roman Catholic to call herself a priest. Celeste was subsequently excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church, which does not recognize the validity of the ordination of a woman.CBS News WebsiteNCR Online Website
