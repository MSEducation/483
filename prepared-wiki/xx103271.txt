Eddie Breckenridge (born Edward Carrington Breckenridge on November 15, 1979) is the bass guitarist of the post-hardcore band, Thrice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thrice-p472191/biography|title=Thrice|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=15 August 2011[/tpl] Breckenridge joined the band having virtually no experience playing the bass (he was a skating buddy of soon to be singer/guitarist Dustin and lead guitarist Teppei). He soon convinced his brother Riley to join as the band's drummer. Breckenridge has an elbow problem that prevents him from turning over his left hand fully (making fingering the fret board more difficult than usual).
He also enjoys surfing, skateboarding, woodwork, leathercraft, biking, and crocheting. Breckenridge has also contributed ambient noise to an experimental track on Frantic Mantis's debut album via internet collaboration.
