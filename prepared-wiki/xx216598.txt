He was also president of the Government Junta of Chile between 1973 and 1981.
Pinochet assumed power in Chile following a coup d'état on 11 September 1973 that overthrew the elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule. Several academics have stated that the support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterward.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last=Winn|first=Peter|authorlink=|editor-first=Greg & Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin & Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=Furies of the Andes|url=|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=|doi=|pages=239–275|quote=[/tpl] Pinochet had been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army by Allende on 23 August 1973, having been its General Chief of Staff since early 1972.

Under the influence of the free market-oriented neoliberal "Chicago Boys", the military government implemented economic reforms, including currency stabilization, tariff cutting, opening Chile's markets to global trade, restricting labor unions, privatizing social security, and the privatization of hundreds of state-controlled industries. These policies produced what has been referred to as the "Miracle of Chile," but critics claim the government policies dramatically increased economic inequality.[tpl]Cite book|last=Angell|first=Alan|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America, Vol. VIII, 1930 to the Present.

Pinochet's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a  controversial 1980 plebiscite, which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. In a 1988 plebiscite 56% voted against Pinochet's continuing as president, which led to democratic elections for the Presidency and Congress. After stepping down in 1990, Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution. However, Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights allegations. Following a legal battle he was released on grounds of ill-health, and returned to Chile in March 2000. In 2004, Chilean Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest. By the time of his death on 10 December 2006, about 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for numerous human rights violations during his 17-year rule, and tax evasion and embezzlement during and after his rule;[tpl]Cite news|last=Chang|first=Jack|author2=Yulkowski, Lisa|title=Vocal minority praises Pinochet at his funeral|newspaper=Bradenton Herald|date=13 December 2006|url =http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28896708_ITM|accessdate=13 April 2009[/tpl] he was accused of having corruptly amassed at least US$28 million.Larry Rohter, Colonel's Death Gives Clues to Pinochet Arms Deals, The New York Times, 19 June 2006 [tpl]en icon[/tpl]

==Early life and military career==

Pinochet was born in Valparaíso, the son of Augusto Pinochet Vera, descendant of a French Breton immigrant from Lamballe, and Avelina Ugarte Martínez, a woman of Basque descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lahoradelpueblo.blogspot.com/2006/12/augusto-pinochet-el-insulso-hijo-del.html |title=Augusto Pinochet, el insulso hijo del aduanero |publisher=Lahoradelpueblo.blogspot.com |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] Pinochet went to primary and secondary school at the San Rafael Seminary of Valparaíso, the Rafael Ariztía Institute (Marist Brothers) in Quillota, the French Fathers' School of Valparaíso, and then to the Military School in Santiago, which he entered in 1931. In 1935, after four years of study, he graduated with the rank of alférez (Second Lieutenant) in the infantry. In September 1937, Pinochet was assigned to the "Chacabuco" Regiment, in Concepción. Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of Sub-lieutenant, he moved to the "Maipo" Regiment, garrisoned in Valparaíso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940. On 30 January 1943, Pinochet married Lucía Hiriart Rodríguez, with whom he had five children: Inés Lucía, María Verónica, Jacqueline Marie, Augusto Osvaldo, and Marco Antonio.
By late 1945 Pinochet had been assigned to the "Carampangue" Regiment in the northern city of Iquique. Three years later, he entered the War Academy but had to postpone his studies because, being the youngest officer, he had to carry out a service mission in the coal zone of Lota. The following year he returned to his studies in the Academy, and after obtaining the title of Officer Chief of Staff, in 1951, he returned to teach at the Military School. At the same time, he worked as a teachers' aide at the War Academy, giving military geography and geopolitics classes. He was also the editor of the institutional magazine Cien Águilas ("One Hundred Eagles"). At the beginning of 1953, with the rank of major, he was sent for two years to the "Rancagua" Regiment in Arica. While there, he was appointed professor of the Chilean War Academy, and returned to Santiago to take up his new position.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/chile/pinochet.html|title=Augusto Pinochet: Timeline|publisher=CBS News|date=11 December 2006[/tpl]
In 1956 Pinochet and a group of young officers were chosen to form a military mission to collaborate in the organization of the War Academy of Ecuador in Quito. He remained with the Quito mission for three-and-a-half years, during which time he studied geopolitics, military geography and military intelligence. It has been alleged that, while in Quito, Pinochet had a romance with Piedad Noe and fathered a boy named Juan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=364860|title=Supuesto hijo de Pinochet en Ecuador dispuesto a prueba de ADN|language=Spanish|trans_title=Alleged son of Pinochet in Ecuador willing to test DNA|publisher=Emol|accessdate=10 March 2010[/tpl] At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in Antofagasta. The following year, he was appointed commander of the "Esmeralda" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in Santiago, and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique. In his new function, he was also appointed Intendent of the Tarapacá Province.
In January 1971, Pinochet was promoted to division general, and was named General Commander of the Santiago Army Garrison. At the beginning of 1972 he was appointed General Chief of Staff of the Army. With rising domestic strife in Chile, after General Prats resigned his position, Pinochet was appointed commander-in-chief of the Army on 23 August 1973 by President Salvador Allende just the day after the Chamber of Deputies of Chile approved a resolution asserting that the government was not respecting the Constitution. Less than a month later, the Chilean military deposed Allende.

==Military coup of 1973==

On 11 September 1973 the combined Chilean Armed Forces (the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Carabineros) overthrew Allende's government in a coup, during which the presidential palace, La Moneda, was shelled and Allende died.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Chilean president Salvador Allende committed suicide, autopsy confirms|date=20 July 2011[/tpl] While the military later claimed that he had committed suicide, controversy has surrounded Allende's death, with many claiming that he had been assassinated.
In his memoirs Pinochet said that he was the leading plotter of the coup and had used his position as commander-in-chief of the Army to coordinate a far-reaching scheme with the other two branches of the military and the national police. In later years, however, high military officials from the time have said that Pinochet reluctantly became involved only a few days before the coup was scheduled to occur, and followed the lead of the other branches (especially the Navy, under Merino) as they executed the coup.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The new government rounded up thousands of people and held them in the national stadium, where many were killed. This was followed by brutal repression during Pinochet's rule, during which about 3,000 people were killed, and more than 1,000 are still missing.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/807599.stm|work=BBC News|title=Soldier confirms Chile stadium killings|date=27 June 2000[/tpl]
In the months that followed the coup, the junta, with authoring work by historian Gonzalo Vial and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile (commonly known as El Libro Blanco, "The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile"), where they said that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged Plan Zeta, or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. United States intelligence agencies believed the plan to be untrue propaganda.El fin de un mito en Chile: el Plan Zeta, Clarín, 5 July 1999 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura CAPÍTULO III Contexto. some Chilean historians pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.[tpl]Cite news|last=Vial Correa|first=Gonzalo|title=Carlos Altamirano, el Plan Z y la "Operación Blanqueo" |publisher=La Segunda|date=23 September 2003[/tpl]

===U.S. backing of the coup===

The Church Report investigating the fallout of the Watergate scandal stated that while the U.S. tacitly supported the Pinochet government after the 1973 coup, there was "no evidence" that the US was directly involved in the coup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp#A.%20Overview:%20Cover%20Action%20in%20Chile|title=Covert Action in Chile 1963–1973|publisher=US Government Printing Office|date=18 December 1975|author=Frank Church et al.|quote=Was the United States DIRECTLY involved, covertly, in the 1973 coup in Chile? The Committee has found no evidence that it was.|accessdate=20 July 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722060530/http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp|archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl= no[/tpl] This view has been contradicted by several academics, such as Peter Winn, who writes that the role of the CIA was crucial to the consolidation of power after the coup; the CIA helped fabricate a conspiracy against the Allende government, which Pinochet was then portrayed as preventing. He states that the coup itself was possible only through a three-year covert operation mounted by the United States. He also points out that the US imposed an "invisible blockade" that was designed to disrupt the economy under Allende, and contributed to the destabilization of the regime. Author Peter Kornbluh argues in his book The Pinochet File[tpl]cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|isbn=1-56584-936-1|page=171[/tpl]  that the US was extensively involved and actively "fomented" the 1973 coup. Authors Tim Weiner, in his book, Legacy of Ashes,[tpl]cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-0-307-38900-8|page=361[/tpl]  and Christopher Hitchens, in his book, The Trial of Henry Kissinger [tpl]cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title= The Trial of Henry Kissinger |year=2001|publisher=Verso|isbn=1-85984-631-9[/tpl] similarly argue the case that US covert actions actively destabilized Allende’s government and set the stage for the 1973 coup.
The U.S. provided material support to the military government after the coup, although criticizing it in public. A document released by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2000, titled "CIA Activities in Chile", revealed that the CIA actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of Allende, and that it made many of Pinochet's officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military, even though some were known to be involved in human rights abuses.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Kornbluh|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/|title=CIA Acknowledges Ties to Pinochet’s Repression: Report to Congress Reveals U.S. Accountability in Chile|work=Chile Documentation Project|publisher=National Security Archive|date=19 September 2000|accessdate=26 November 2006|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20061128142216/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/|archivedate=28 November 2006 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The CIA also maintained contacts in the Chilean DINA intelligence service. DINA was involved in crimes against human rights, and its leaders, under Pinochet's direct command, led the multinational "anti-communism campaign" known as Operation Condor, which amongst other activities carried out assassinations of prominent politicians and activists of left-wing views, but not involved in illegal activities, in various Latin American countries, in Washington, D.C., and in Europe (see section below). In particular, CIA contact with DINA head  Manuel Contreras was established in 1974 soon after the coup, during the Junta period prior to official transfer of Presidential powers to Pinochet; in 1975, the CIA reviewed a warning that keeping Contreras as an asset might threaten human rights in the region.  The CIA chose to keep him as an asset, and at one point even paid him. In addition to the CIA's maintaining of assets in DINA beginning soon after the coup, several CIA assets, such as CORU Cuban exile militants Orlando Bosch and Guillermo Novo, collaborated in DINA operations under the Condor Plan in the early years of Pinochet's presidency.

==Military junta==

A military junta was established immediately following the coup, made up of General Pinochet representing the Army, Admiral José Toribio Merino representing the Navy, General Gustavo Leigh representing the Air Force, and General César Mendoza representing the Carabineros (national police). As established the junta exercised both executive and legislative functions of the government, suspended the Constitution and the Congress, imposed strict censorship and curfew, banned all parties and halted all political activities. This military junta held the executive role until 17 December 1974, after which it remained strictly as a legislative body, the executive powers being transferred to Pinochet with the title of President.

==Presidency==

The junta members originally planned that the presidency would be held for a year by the commanders-in-chief of each of the four military branches in turn. However, Pinochet soon consolidated his control, first retaining sole chairmanship of the military junta, and then proclaiming himself "Supreme Chief of the Nation" (de facto provisional president) on 27 June 1974. He officially changed his title to "President" on 17 December 1974. General Leigh, head of the Air Force, became increasingly opposed to Pinochet's policies and was forced into retirement on 24 July 1978, after contradicting Pinochet on that year's plebiscite (officially called Consulta Nacional, or National Consultation, in response to a UN resolution condemning Pinochet's government). He was replaced by General Fernando Matthei.
Pinochet organized a plebiscite on 11 September 1980 to ratify a new constitution, replacing the 1925 Constitution drafted during Arturo Alessandri's presidency. The new Constitution, partly drafted by Jaime Guzmán, a close adviser to Pinochet who later founded the right-wing party Independent Democratic Union (UDI), gave a lot of power to the President of the Republic—Pinochet. It created some new institutions, such as the Constitutional Tribunal and the controversial National Security Council (COSENA). It also prescribed an 8-year presidential period, and a single-candidate presidential referendum in 1988, where a candidate nominated by the Junta would be approved or rejected for another 8-year period. The new constitution was approved by a margin of 67.04% to 30.19% according to official figures;Hudson, Rex A., ed. "Chile: A Country Study". GPO for the Library of Congress. 1995. 20 March 2005 http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cltoc.html the opposition, headed by ex-president Eduardo Frei Montalva (who had supported Pinochet's coup), denounced extensive irregularities such as the lack of an electoral register, which facilitated multiple voting, and said that the total number of votes reported to have been cast was very much larger than would be expected from the size of the electorate and turnout in previous elections. Interviews after Pinochet's departure with people involved with the referendum confirmed that fraud had, indeed, been widespread.Cambio22: The great historical fraud - the constitutional plebiscite of 1980. Witnesses confirm that it was all manipulated and arranged, including the final result, Pilar Guevara, 24 June 2012 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] The Constitution was promulgated on 21 October 1980, taking effect on 11 March 1981. Pinochet was replaced as President of the Junta that day by Admiral Merino.

In a 1985 report, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that it hoped that "the case now under way will lead to the identification and punishment of the persons responsible for the execution of so culpable an act."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/85.86eng/chap.4.htm |title=Inter-American Commission on human rights Report 1986 |publisher=Cidh.org |accessdate=10 March 2010[/tpl] Eventually, six members of the police secret service were given life sentences.
According to a book by Ozren Agnic Krstulovic, weapons including C-4 plastic explosives, RPG-7 and M72 LAW rocket launchers as well as more than 3,000 M-16 rifles were smuggled into the country by opponents of the government.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=itzzT3or3noC&pg=PA147&dq=Carrizal+Bajo+m+16+fpmr&as_brr=3&cd=2#v=onepage&q=Carrizal%20Bajo%20m%2016%20fpmr&f=false |title=Pinochet S.A.: la base de la fortuna.

In September weapons from the same source were used in an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Pinochet by the FPMR. His military bodyguard was taken by surprise, and five members were killed. Pinochet's bulletproof  Mercedes Benz vehicle was struck by a rocket, but it failed to explode and Pinochet suffered only minor injuries.Emol, website of newspaper El Mercurio: Adobe Flash presentation reconstructing the September 1986 assassination attempt [tpl]es icon[/tpl]

===Suppression of opposition===

Almost immediately after the military's seizure of power, the junta banned all the leftist parties that had constituted Allende's UP coalition.[ref]
. Retrieved 10-24-2006 through Google Books.</ref>
All other parties were placed in "indefinite recess" and were later banned outright. The government's violence was directed not only against dissidents but also against their families and other civilians.
The Rettig Report concluded 2,279 persons who disappeared during the military government were killed for political reasons or as a result of political violence. According to the later Valech Report  approximately 31,947 were tortured and 1,312 exiled. The exiles were chased all over the world by the intelligence agencies. In Latin America, this was made in the frame of Operation Condor, a cooperation plan between the various intelligence agencies of South American countries, assisted by a United States CIA communication base in Panama. Pinochet believed these operations were necessary in order to "save the country from communism".Eduardo Gallardo, Pinochet Was Unrepentant to the End, ABC News (Associated Press), 11 December 2006 [tpl]en icon[/tpl] In 2011 the commission identified an additional 9,800 victims of political repression during Pinochet's rule, increasing the total number of victims to approximately 40,018, including 3,065 killed.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14584095 | work=BBC News | title=Chile recognises 9,800 more victims of Pinochet's rule | date=18 August 2011[/tpl]
Some political scientists have ascribed the relative bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system, which required extreme action to overturn. Some of the most infamous cases of human rights violation occurred during the early period: in October 1973, at least 70 people were killed throughout the country by the Caravan of Death. Charles Horman, a US journalist, "disappeared", as did Víctor Olea Alegría, a member of the Socialist Party, and many others, in 1973.
Many other important officials of Allende's government were tracked down by the DINA in the frame of Operation Condor. General Carlos Prats, Pinochet's predecessor and army commander under Allende, who had resigned rather than support the moves against Allende's government, was assassinated in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1974. A year later, the murder of 119 opponents abroad was disguised as an internal conflict, the DINA setting up a propaganda campaign to support this idea (Operation Colombo), a campaign publicised by the leading newspaper in Chile, El Mercurio.
Other victims of Condor included, among hundreds of less famous persons, Juan José Torres, the former President of Bolivia, assassinated in Buenos Aires on 2 June 1976; Carmelo Soria, a UN diplomat working for the CEPAL, assassinated in July 1976;
Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean ambassador to the United States and minister in Allende's cabinet, assassinated after his release from internment and exile in Washington, D.C. by a car bomb on 21 September 1976. This led to strained relations with the US and to the extradition of Michael Townley, a US citizen who worked for the DINA and had organized Letelier's assassination. Other targeted victims, who escaped assassination, included Christian-Democrat Bernardo Leighton, who escaped an assassination attempt in Rome in 1975 by the Italian terrorist Stefano delle Chiaie; Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party, targeted for murder in 1975 by Pinochet, along with Volodia Teitelboim, member of the Communist Party; Pascal Allende, the nephew of Salvador Allende and president of the MIR, who escaped an assassination attempt in Costa Rica in March 1976; US Congressman Edward Koch, who became aware in 2001 of relations between death threats and his denunciation of Operation Condor, etc. Furthermore, according to current investigations, Eduardo Frei Montalva, the Christian Democrat President of Chile from 1964 to 1970, may have been poisoned in 1982 by toxin produced by DINA biochemist Eugenio Berrios.Ex-Chilean leader 'was murdered', BBC, 23 January 2007
Protests continued, however, during the 1980s, leading to several scandals. In March 1985, the savage murder of three Communist Party members led to the resignation of César Mendoza, head of the Carabineros and member of the junta since its formation. During a 1986 protest against Pinochet, 21 year old American photographer Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri and 18 year old student Carmen Gloria Quintana were burnt alive, with only Carmen surviving.
In August 1989, Marcelo Barrios Andres, a 21 year-old member of the FPMR (the armed wing of the PCC, created in 1983, which had attempted to assassinate Pinochet on 7 September 1986), was assassinated by a group of military personnel who were supposed to arrest him on orders of Valparaíso's public prosecutor.
