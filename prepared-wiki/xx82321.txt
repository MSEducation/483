Although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius.Ryan N. Maue. CHAPTER 3: CYCLONE PARADIGMS AND EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION CONCEPTUALIZATIONS. Retrieved on 15 June 2008.  An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection, which warms its core.[tpl]cite web | author = Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone?|publisher = NOAA | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html[/tpl]

==Surface high pressure systems==

High pressure systems are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere.  Subsidence will generally dry out an air mass by adiabatic, or compressional, heating.Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology (2006). Appendix G: Glossary. NOAA. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.  Thus, high pressure typically brings clear skies.Jack Williams (2007). What's happening inside highs and lows. USA Today. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.  During the day, since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight, there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise.  At night, the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons.  When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a build up of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze.Myanmar government (2007). Haze. Retrieved on 2007-02-11.  If the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form.Robert Tardif (2002). Fog characteristics. NCAR National Research Laboratory.

Strong, vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses.CBC News (2009). Blame Yukon: Arctic air mass chills rest of North America. Canadian Broadcasting Centre. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.  The low, sharp inversion can lead to areas of persistent stratocumulus or stratus cloud, colloquially known as anticyclonic gloom. The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin. For example, extensions of the Azores high pressure may bring about anticyclonic gloom during the winter, as they are warmed at the base and will trap moisture as they move over the warmer oceans. High pressures that build to the north and extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed) which helps prevent clouds from forming.
On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere.Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

High-pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones.  On weather maps, high-pressure centers are associated with the letter H in English,Keith C. Heidorn (2005).

==Weather fronts==

A weather front is a boundary separating two masses of air of different densities, and is the principal cause of meteorological phenomena. In surface weather analyses, fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols, depending on the type of front.  The air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity.
Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.[tpl]cite web|author=Author unknown|title=Lesson 7: Clouds and Precipitation|year=|accessdate=2007-04-29|url=http://www.ccrc.sr.unh.edu/~stm/AS/Teaching/STEC521/STEC521_7.html|publisher=Self-published[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Cold fronts and occluded fronts generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because of the greater density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts.[tpl]cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf[/tpl]  When a front becomes  stationary, and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline.  This is most common over the open ocean.
