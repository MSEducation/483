The four tracks always available are Speed Bay, West Way, Snow Ride, and Dirt Arena. Additional tracks can be unlocked by winning races. They are Rock Forest, Lost Ruins, Great Wall and Red City. Two additional free tracks, Fun Fair and Sea of Sand, could be downloaded from the game's web site. A multiplayer option is also available, allowing two players to compete over a LAN. The single player modes include "Time Attack" and "Championship". Several cheat codes are available that can be entered upon start up of the game. The most laps a player can do is up to eight on the Practice Race.
