==Rugby career==

Williams was noted for his side stepThomas (1979), pg 46. and his inward swerve when running the touch-line was a signature move. When the 1906 touring South Africans played Cardiff, Williams managed to side step the great Arthur Marsberg to score a try. As Williams walked back Marsberg was so impressed he approached Williams and shook his hand.
Williams was first capped in 1906 against the first touring South Africa team. Although seen as one of the worst Welsh performances the selectors kept faith in Williams and he would play for Wales a further sixteen times. Williams was part of three Welsh Triple Crown winning sides, lost only two matches and scored 17 tries in his 17 games. In the 1911 game against France, Billy Trew gave the captaincy to Williams.Wales' Grand Slam Triumph, Yahoo Sport
In 1908 Williams was part of Arthur Harding's Anglo-Welsh team that toured the Antipodes. Although an unsuccessful tour Williams played well and ended as the teams top try scorer.
