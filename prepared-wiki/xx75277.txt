During World War II, Macdonald was a staunch supporter of conscription. His position is made clear in this wartime quote taken from a Canadian newspaper, "There is a victory to be won and that can be accomplished only by every Canadian taking part."  After the war, he served as Deputy Speaker (1945–1949) and then as Speaker of the House of Commons (1949–1953).
While serving as Speaker of the House of Commons Macdonald made a famous ruling banning musical instruments from being played in the Chamber on June 3, 1950. The ban came about after Daniel McIvor MP for Fort William played a flute while waiting for a vote call.[tpl]cite news|title=Bag Pipes And Tin Horns Under Ban in Commons|publisher=The Lethbridge Herald|page=1|work=Vol XLIII No. 146|date=June 3, 1950[/tpl]
