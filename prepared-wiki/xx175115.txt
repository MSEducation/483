Vice Regent (1967-1995) was a Canadian Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse and Canadaâ€™s leading sire for thirteen years. Owned and bred by E. P. Taylor, he was from Northern Dancer's second crop and out of the mare Victoria Regina, a daughter of the French multiple stakes winner Menetrier whom E. P. Taylor purchased as a sire from Francois Dupre and imported to Canada.
Vice Regent was a full brother to Viceregal who earned Canadian Horse of the Year honors as a two-year-old in 1968. As such, on his debut one year later in 1969, much was expected from Vice Regent. Conditioned by future Hall of Fame trainer Gordon J. McCann, as a result of injuries and an accident, Vice Regent raced only five times before being forced into retirement.
