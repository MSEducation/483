[[2009 Washington Nationals season]]

CATEGORIES: Washington Nationals seasons, 2009 Major League Baseball season

The Washington Nationals' 2009 season was the fifth season for the American baseball franchise of Major League Baseball in the District of Columbia, and the 41st since the original team was started in Montreal, Canada.  It involved the Nationals attempting to win the National League East Division after a disappointing 59–102 season the year before.
On July 12, manager Manny Acta was fired and replaced with bench coach Jim Riggleman, though only as an interim manager.  Under Acta, the Nationals compiled an MLB worst 26–61 record in 2009 through the All-Star break and a 158–252 record in Acta's three seasons with the Nationals.  Riggleman would be named full-time manager in November 2009.
The Nationals finished the year with a 59–103 record, worse than the year before by one loss.
Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman won a Gold Glove Award as the best defensive third baseman in the National League and a Silver Slugger Award as the best offensive third baseman in the league.

==Changed uniforms==

For this season, the Nationals have altered their uniforms.  The interlocking "DC" has been removed from the star-spangled circle and now sits alone on left sleeve of both the home and away uniforms.  It also has been removed from the alternate red jersey and replaced with the "pretzel W" from the team's cap.  A new navy alternate jersey with the interlocked "DC" on the left chest in a "stars and stripes" flag pattern, which has also been emulated on the alternate navy cap, will be worn several times in 2009.  Finally, in a tribute to the former baseball teams in the District of Columbia, a script writing of the city name has replaced the block lettering, emulating the Senators script of the 1950s and 1960s – though as those teams used "Senators" on both their home and away uniforms, this marks the first time the curled W has actually appeared as part of the word "Washington" on an MLB jersey.
The uniforms gained notoriety when on April 17 in a game against the Florida Marlins, the jerseys of Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Dunn read "Natinals" on the front of the jersey instead of "Nationals" for the first three innings of the game.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4087695 The Nationals did not catch the error as they only checked the back of the shirts, not the front, but were able to assign to Dunn and Zimmerman the correct jerseys later in the game.[tpl]cite web|title=Meet your new MLB team: The Washington Natinals |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/22361/meet-your-new-mlb-team-the-washington-natinals/|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j6aDFs3m|archivedate=August 17, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 16, 2009[/tpl] The company who manufactured the jerseys, Majestic Athletic, apologized for the error.

==Minor League System==

The future for the Nationals seems to show promise with their Gulf Coast League affiliate qualifying for the playoffs. The significance of this to the 2009 Major League team is that it demonstrates that the team is attempting to improve on its performance and has the prospects to do so.
