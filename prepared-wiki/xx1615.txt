Carl Edward Sagan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ɡ|ə|n[/tpl]; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, science popularizer and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. His contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of Venus. However, he is best known for his contributions to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages that were sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.
He published more than 600 scientific papersSome of Carl Sagan's papers are available on the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books. Sagan is known for many of his popular science books, such as The Dragons of Eden, Broca's Brain and Pale Blue Dot, and for the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which he narrated and co-wrote.  The most widely watched series in the history of American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.[tpl]cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan |work=StarChild | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl] The book Cosmos was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name.
Sagan always advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method, pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell University where he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal, the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book The Dragons of Eden, and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from myelodysplasia, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 on December 20, 1996.

==Early life==

Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York.Poundstone 1999, pp. 363–364, 374–375 His father, Samuel Sagan, was an immigrant garment worker from Kamianets-Podilskyi, Russia,[tpl]cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Sagan,Carl.html |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Internet Accuracy Project |location=Grandville, MI |accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/carl-sagan-155.php |website=The Famous People |publisher=The Famous People |accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl] in today's Ukraine. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's biological mother, Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, "the mother she never knew". Sagan graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey, in 1951.Davidson 1999
He had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in Bensonhurst, a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were Reform Jews, the most liberal of Judaism's three main groups. Both Sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother "definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple ... and served only Kosher meat".[tpl]rp|12[/tpl] During the depths of the Depression, his father had to accept a job as a theater usher.
According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's "inner war" was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways "opposites". Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had known "extreme poverty as a child" and had grown up almost homeless in New York City during World War I and the 1920s.[tpl]rp|2[/tpl] As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore "worshiped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams".[tpl]rp|2[/tpl]
However, his "sense of wonder" came from his father, who was a "quiet and soft-hearted escapee from the Czar". In his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's "tumultuous" garment industry.[tpl]rp|2[/tpl] Although he was "awed" by Carl's "brilliance, his boyish chatter about stars and dinosaurs", he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up.[tpl]rp|2[/tpl] In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl] Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:

===1939 World's Fair===

Sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the 1939 New York World's Fair when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the America of Tomorrow exhibit: "It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!"[tpl]rp|14[/tpl] At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:
He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a time capsule at Flushing Meadows, which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. "The time capsule thrilled Carl," writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—ones that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair.[tpl]rp|15[/tpl]

===World War II===

During World War II Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He writes, "Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the Holocaust. Hitler was not a popular fellow in our household ... But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war." His sister, Carol, said that their mother "above all wanted to protect Carl ... She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War II and the Holocaust".[tpl]rp|15[/tpl] Sagan's book, The Demon-Haunted World (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.

===Inquisitiveness about nature===

Soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:
At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. While there, they went to the Hayden Planetarium and walked around the museum's exhibits of space objects, such as meteorites, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:
His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.famousscientists.org/carl-saga |title=Carl Sagan |website=Famous Scientists |publisher=famousscientists.org |accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl] His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as Mars. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a "driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten."

==Education and scientific career==

He attended the University of Chicago, where he participated in the Ryerson Astronomical Society,[tpl]cite web |url=http://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/ |title=Ryerson Astronomical Society |work=Ryerson Astronomical Society (RAS) |publisher=University of Chicago Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl] received a bachelor of arts in self-proclaimed "nothing" with general and special honors in 1954, a bachelor of science in physics in 1955, and a master of science in physics in 1956 before earning a PhD in astronomy and astrophysics in 1960.[tpl]cite journal |date=November 11, 1993 |title=Graduate students receive first Sagan teaching awards |journal=University of Chicago Chronicle |volume=13 |issue=6 |publisher=University of Chicago News Office |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/931111/sagan.shtml[/tpl]Head 2006, p. xxiSpangenburg & Moser 2004, p. 28
During his time as an honors program undergraduate, Sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist H. J. Muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist H. C. Urey. He used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with planetary scientist Gerard Kuiper (thesis advisor), physicist George Gamow, and chemist Melvin Calvin. From 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/happy-belated-birthday-carl/ |title=Happy (Belated) Birthday Carl! |publisher=University of California, Berkeley The Berkeley Science Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013[/tpl] From 1962 to 1968, he worked at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the same time, he worked with geneticist Joshua Lederberg.
Sagan lectured and did research at Harvard University until 1968, when he moved to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, after being denied tenure at Harvard. It has been suggested that Sagan was denied tenure in part because of his publicised scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as being self-promotion.Morrison, David. 2007. "Carl Sagan’s Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic." Skeptical Inquirer.  He became a full professor at Cornell in 1971, and directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there. From 1972 to 1981, Sagan was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell.
Sagan was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to NASA, where one of his duties included briefing the Apollo astronauts before their flights to the Moon. Sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the Solar System, arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. He conceived the idea of adding an unalterable and universal message on spacecraft destined to leave the Solar System that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find it. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space: a gold-anodized plaque, attached to the space probe Pioneer 10, launched in 1972. Pioneer 11, also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the Voyager Golden Record that was sent out with the Voyager space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station at the expense of further robotic missions.[tpl]cite interview |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=An Interview with Carl Sagan |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF-aS169bw |program=Charlie Rose |callsign=PBS |city=New York |date=January 5, 1995 |accessdate=August 30, 2013[/tpl]
Sagan taught a course on critical thinking at Cornell University until he died in 1996 from pneumonia, a few months after finding that he was in remission of myelodysplastic syndrome.

==Scientific achievements==

Former student David Morrison describes Sagan as "an 'idea person' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and back-of-the-envelope calculations,"[tpl]cite web |title=Carl Sagan’s Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic|website=CSI|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |location=Amherst, NY |accessdate=December 3, 2013[/tpl] and Gerard Kuiper said that "Some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory; others are best in liaison between sciences. Dr. Sagan belongs in the latter group."
Sagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet Venus. In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planet's surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a Time–Life book, Planets. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated radio emissions from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of [tpl]convert|500|°C|-2[/tpl]. As a visiting scientist to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he contributed to the first Mariner missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. Mariner 2 confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962.
Sagan was among the first to hypothesize that Saturn's moon Titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that Jupiter's moon Europa might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable.Much of Sagan's research in the field of planetary science is outlined by William Poundstone. Poundstone's biography of Sagan includes an 8-page list of Sagan's scientific articles published from 1957 to 1998. Detailed information about Sagan's scientific work comes from the primary research articles. Example: [tpl]cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=C. |last2=Thompson |first2=W.R. |last3=Khare |first3=B.N. |year=1992 |title=Titan: A Laboratory for Prebiological Organic Chemistry |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=286–292 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Chemical Society |doi=10.1021/ar00019a003[/tpl] There is commentary on this research article about Titan at David J. Darling's The Encyclopedia of Science. Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft Galileo. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto Titan's surface.[tpl]cite book |last=Pafumi |first=G.R. |title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete?: Often What We Believe is not What We Observe |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ySNfuGKwfMcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA338#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Xlibris |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-1-4415-9041-1 |oclc=710798384 |page=338[/tpl]
He further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter as well as seasonal changes on Mars. He also perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect. Sagan and his Cornell colleague Edwin Ernest Salpeter speculated about life in Jupiter's clouds, given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms.
Sagan is best known, however, for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |title=Sagan, Carl Edward |url=http://www.bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |edition=Sixth |year=2001–05 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011220013/http://bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007[/tpl]
He is also the 1994 recipient of the Public Welfare Medal, the highest award of the National Academy of Sciences for "distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare".[tpl]cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.planetary.org/about/our-founders/carl-sagan.html |publisher=The Planetary Society |location=Pasadena, CA |accessdate=August 30, 2013[/tpl] He was denied membership in the Academy, reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists.[tpl]cite journal |last=Benford |first=Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Benford |year=1997 |title=A Tribute to Carl Sagan: Popular & Pilloried |journal=Skeptic |volume=13 |issue=1 |publisher=The Skeptics Society |url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/popular-and-pilloried/[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ |title=Candle in the Dark |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |website=The Works of Michael Shermer |publisher=Michael Shermer |accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl] Article originally published in November 2003 issue of Scientific American.[tpl]cite journal |last=Impey |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Impey |date=January–February 2000 |title=Carl Sagan, Carl Sagan: Biographies Echo an Extraordinary Life |journal=American Scientist |volume=88 |issue=1 |publisher=Sigma Xi |type=Book review |issn=0003-0996 |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/carl-sagan-carl-sagan-biographies-echo-an-extraordinary-life[/tpl]

==Scientific and critical thinking advocacy==

Sagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the Universe. He delivered the 1977 series of Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan |title=Christmas Lectures 1977: The Planets : Ri Channel |work=Ri Channel |publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain |location=London |accessdate=February 7, 2012[/tpl] He hosted and, with Ann Druyan, co-wrote and co-produced the highly popular thirteen-part Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage."Who Was Carl Sagan", National Geographic, March 16, 2014
Cosmos covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of our place in the Universe. The series was first broadcast by the PBS in 1980, winning an Emmy[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/cosmos |title=Cosmos |publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |accessdate=September 4, 2013[/tpl] and a Peabody Award. It has been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |title=Carl Sagan |work=EMuseum |publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankato |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100528213538/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2013[/tpl] making it the most widely watched PBS program in history.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/documentaries/cosmos/ |title=CosmoLearning Astronomy |publisher=CosmoLearning |accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl] In addition, Time magazine ran a cover story about Sagan soon after the show broadcast, referring to him as "creator, chief writer and host-narrator of the new public television series Cosmos, and takes the controls of his fantasy spaceship".[tpl]cite journal |last=Golden |first=Frederic |date=October 20, 1980 |title=The Cosmic Explainer |journal=Time |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951539,00.html[/tpl] However, Sagan was criticised for putting too much attention into the series, with several of his classes at Cornell being cancelled and complaints from his colleagues.
Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal Science and signed by 70 scientists including seven Nobel Prize winners. This was a tremendous increase in the respectability of this controversial field. Sagan also helped Frank Drake write the Arecibo message, a radio message beamed into space from the Arecibo radio telescope on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth.
Sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal Icarus for twelve years. He co-founded The Planetary Society, the largest space-interest group in the world, with over 100,000 members in more than 149 countries, and was a member of the SETI Institute Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the American Astronomical Society, as President of the Planetology Section of the American Geophysical Union, and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
At the height of the Cold War, Sagan became involved in public awareness efforts for the effects of nuclear war when a mathematical climate model suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could upset the delicate balance of life on Earth. He was one of five authors – the "S" – of the "TTAPS" report, as the research paper came to be known. He eventually co-authored the scientific paper hypothesizing a global nuclear winter following nuclear war.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Turco |first1=R.P. |authorlink1=Richard P.

Carl Sagan discussed his involvement in the political nuclear winter debates and his erroneous global cooling prediction for the Gulf War fires in his book, The Demon-Haunted World. He also co-authored the book A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race, a comprehensive examination of the phenomenon of nuclear winter.
Sagan also wrote books to popularize science, such as Cosmos, which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of A Personal Voyage and became the best-selling science book ever published in English;[tpl]cite web |url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |title=Meet Carl Sagan |work=The Science Channel |publisher=Discovery Communications |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070518042909/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |archivedate=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl] The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence, which won a Pulitzer Prize; and Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science. Sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel Contact in 1985, based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife in 1979, but he did not live to see the book's 1997 motion picture adaptation, which starred Jodie Foster and won the 1998 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.
He wrote a sequel to Cosmos, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by The New York Times. He appeared on PBS' Charlie Rose program in January 1995. Sagan also wrote the introduction for Stephen Hawking's bestseller, A Brief History of Time. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience, such as his debunking of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, David Morrison, a former student of Sagan's, recalled "Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement" in Skeptical Inquirer.[tpl]cite journal |last=Morrison |first=David |authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |date=January–February 2007 |title=Carl Sagan's Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=31.1 |pages=29–38 |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=0194-6730 |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic[/tpl]
Sagan hypothesized in January 1991 that enough smoke from the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia ..." He later conceded in The Demon-Haunted World that this prediction did not turn out to be correct: "it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4°–6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared".Sagan 1995, p. 257 A 2007 study noted that modern computer models have been applied to the Kuwait oil fires, finding that individual smoke plumes are not able to loft smoke into the stratosphere, but that smoke from fires covering a large area, like some forest fires or the burning of cities that would be expected to follow a nuclear strike, would loft significant amounts of smoke into the stratosphere.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Jost |first1=Hans-Jürg |last2=Drdla |first2=Katja |last3=Stohl |first3=Andreas |last4=Pfister |first4=Leonhard |date=June 2, 2004 |title=In-situ observations of mid-latitude forest fire plumes deep in the stratosphere |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=31 |issue=11 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Geophysical Union |format=PDF |id=CiteID L11101 |bibcode=2004GeoRL..3111101J |doi=10.1029/2003GL019253 |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |url=http://www.espo.nasa.gov/docs/crystalface/Jost2004.grl.pdf |display-authors=3[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=4755 |title=Smoke Soars to Stratospheric Heights |last1=Averill |first1=Clare |last2=Logan |first2=Jennifer |work=Earth Observatory |publisher=NASA |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Fromm |first1=Michael |last2=Alfred |first2=Jerome |last3=Hoppel |first3=Karl |last4=Hornstein |first4=John |last5=Bevilacqua |first5=Richard |last6=Shettle |first6=Eric |last7=Servranckx |first7=René |last8=Li |first8=Zhanqing |last9=Stocks |first9=Brian |date=May 1, 2000 |title=Observations of boreal forest fire smoke in the stratosphere by POAM III, SAGE II, and lidar in 1998 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=1407–1410 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Geophysical Union |bibcode=2000GeoRL..27.1407F |doi=10.1029/1999GL011200 |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=http://www.cpi.com/remsensing/midatm/smoke.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090106220611/http://www.cpi.com/remsensing/midatm/smoke.html |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |display-authors=3[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Fromm |first1=M. |last2=Stocks |first2=B. |last3=Servranckx |first3=R. |last4=Lindsey |first4=D. |year=2006 |title=Smoke in the Stratosphere: What Wildfires have Taught Us About Nuclear Winter |journal=Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union |volume=87 |issue=52 Fall Meet.

In his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for near-Earth objects that might impact the Earth.Head 2006, p. 86–87 When others suggested creating large nuclear bombs that could be used to alter the orbit of a NEO that was predicted to hit the Earth, Sagan proposed the Deflection Dilemma: If we create the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth, then we also create the ability to deflect an asteroid towards the Earth—providing an evil power with a true doomsday bomb.[tpl]cite podcast |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/silicon-valley-astronomy-lectures/taking-a-hit-asteroid-impacts-and-evolution/ |title=Taking a Hit: Asteroid Impacts & Evolution |website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |last=Morrison |first=David |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Sagan was a critic of Plato. Sagan said of Plato: "Science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans. This tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of Pythagoras named Plato."
and "He (Plato) believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world. He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by Democritus and the other Ionians."[tpl]cite episode |title=The Backbone of Night |series=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan |network=PBS |airdate=November 9, 1980 |number=7[/tpl]

===Popularizing science===

Speaking about his activities in popularizing science, Sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to explain what science is about. Naked self-interest was one because much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public had a right to know how their money was being spent. If scientists increased public excitement about science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.[tpl]cite news |title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62 |first=William |last=Dicke |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 21, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl]

===Phrase 'billions and billions'===

From Cosmos and his frequent appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Sagan became associated with the catchphrase "billions and billions". Sagan stated that he never actually used the phrase in the Cosmos series.Sagan & Druyan 1997, pp. 3–4 The closest that he ever came was in the book Cosmos, where he talked of "billions upon billions":[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Shapiro |editor-first=Fred R. |editor-link=Fred R.

However, his frequent use of the word billions, and distinctive delivery emphasizing the "b" (which he did intentionally, in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as "billions with a 'b'", in order to distinguish the word from "millions" in viewers' minds), made him a favorite target of comic performers, including Johnny Carson,[tpl]cite journal |editor-last=Frazier |editor-first=Kendrick |editor-link=Kendrick Frazier |date=July–August 2005 |title=Carl Sagan Takes Questions: More From His 'Wonder and Skepticism' CSICOP 1994 Keynote |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=29.4 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |accessdate=March 25, 2010[/tpl] Gary Kroeger, Mike Myers, Bronson Pinchot, Penn Jillette, Harry Shearer, and others. Frank Zappa satirized the line in the song "Be in My Video", noting as well "atomic light". Sagan took this all in good humor, and his final book was entitled Billions and Billions, which opened with a tongue-in-cheek discussion of this catchphrase, observing that Carson was an amateur astronomer and that Carson's comic caricature often included real science.
He is also known for expressing wonderment at the vastness of space and time, as in his phrase "The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth."
As a humorous tribute to Sagan and his association with the catchphrase "billions and billions", a [tpl]anchor |Sagan units[/tpl]sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a large number of anything.[tpl]Dictionary.com|Sagan|accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl] Jargon File 4.2.0.[tpl]cite news |title=Footprints on the Infobahn |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/17/magazine/on-language-footprints-on-the-infobahn.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 17, 1994 |accessdate=August 31, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Gresshoff |first=P.M. |year=2004 |title=Scheel D. and Wasternack C.(eds) Plant Signal Transduction |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=783–784 |publisher=Oxford University Press |format=PDF |type=Book review |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/6/783.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/aob/mch102[/tpl]

==Social concerns==

Sagan believed that the Drake equation, on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the Fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to self-destruct. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of Cosmos, called "Who Speaks for Earth?" Sagan had already resigned from the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the Vietnam War.[tpl]cite journal |last=Druyan |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Druyan |date=November 2000 |title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's 'Cosmic Connection' |journal=The Humanist |volume=60 |issue=6 |publisher=American Humanist Association |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-78889720/a-new-sense-of-the-sacred-carl-sagan-s-cosmic-connection[/tpl] Following his marriage to his third wife (novelist Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under President Ronald Reagan.
In March 1983, Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative—a multi-billion dollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles, which was quickly dubbed the "Star Wars" program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the United States and the Soviet Union, making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible.
When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons, which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the Nevada Test Site, beginning on Easter Sunday in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site.Spangenburg & Moser 2004, p. 106

==Personal life and beliefs==

Sagan was married three times.  In 1957, he married biologist Lynn Margulis, mother of Dorion Sagan and Jeremy Sagan.  After Sagan and Margulis divorced, he married artist Linda Salzman in 1968, mother of Nick Sagan.  During these marriages, Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which may have contributed to Sagan's first divorce.Morrison, David. 2007. "Carl Sagan’s Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic." Skeptical Inquirer.   In 1981, Sagan married author Ann Druyan, mother of Alexandra Rachel (Sasha) Sagan and Samuel Democritus Sagan.  Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996.
Isaac Asimov described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky.[tpl]cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |origyear=Originally published 1980; Garden City, NY: Doubleday |year=1981 |publisher=Avon |location=New York |isbn=0-380-53025-2 |oclc=7880716 |lccn=79003685 |pages=217, 302[/tpl]
Sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example:  Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.[tpl]cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science |edition=Reprint |origyear=Originally published 1979 |year=1980 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-33689-5 |oclc=428008204 |lccn=78021810 |page=330[/tpl] 
In another description of his view on the concept of God, Sagan emphatically writes:  The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying ... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_CSagan.htm |title=Quotes on Religion – Carl Sagan |website=Atheism.about.com |publisher=IAC |accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl] 
On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981:  An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.Head 2006, p. 70 
Sagan also commented on Christianity, stating "My long-time view about Christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of Paul. Thomas Jefferson attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, but it was an inspiring document."[tpl]cite book|last=Schei|first=Kenneth A.|title=An Atheist for Jesus|year=1996|publisher=Synthesis|isbn=0-926491-01-6[/tpl]
Regarding the relationship between spirituality and science, Sagan stated: "Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."[tpl]cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Jeffrey O. |last2=Donahue |first2=Megan O. |last3=Schneider |first3=Nicholas |last4=Voit |first5=Mark |title=The Cosmic Perspective |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |edition=6th (student) |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-321-63366-8 |oclc=569911190 |lccn=2009040910 |display-authors=3[/tpl]
An environmental appeal, "Preserving and Cherishing the Earth", signed by Sagan with other noted scientists in January 1990, stated that "The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science."[tpl]cite web |work=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|url=http://fore.research.yale.edu/publications/statements/preserve/|title=Preserving and Cherishing the Earth|year= 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl]

Sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic; one of his most famous quotations, in Cosmos, was, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"[tpl]Cite episode | title= Encyclopaedia Galactica | series=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan | network=PBS | airdate=December 14, 1980 | number=12 | minutes=01:24[/tpl] (called the "Sagan Standard" by some[tpl]cite web | url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ | title= Sagan's Standard |last=Rawson |first=Hugh | work=The Unwritten Laws of Life | publisher= CSBC Ltd | year=2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112045003/http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013[/tpl]).

Late in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his skeptical, naturalistic view of the world. In The Demon-Haunted World, he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method. The compilation Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium, published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a skeptic, agnostic, and freethinker.
Sagan warned against humans' tendency towards anthropocentrism. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the Cosmos chapter "Blues For a Red Planet", Sagan wrote, "If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes."Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.), p. 108

In 1994, engineers at Apple Computer code-named the Power Macintosh 7100 "Carl Sagan" in the hope that Apple would make "billions and billions" with the sale of the PowerMac 7100. The name was only used internally, but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease-and-desist letter. Apple complied, but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to "BHA" for “Butt-Head Astronomer”.Poundstone 1999, p. 364[tpl]cite news |title=This Week in Apple History: November 14–20: McIntosh, IIe Killed, Butt-Head Astronomer |first1=Owen |last1=Linzmayer |first2=Bryan |last2=Chaffin |url=http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20041120.shtml |work=The Mac Observer |publisher=The Mac Observer, Inc. |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=July 23, 2012[/tpl] Sagan then sued Apple for libel, a form of defamation, in federal court. The court granted Apple's motion to dismiss Sagan's claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand Apple was "clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way", and that “It strains reason to conclude that Defendant was attempting to criticize Plaintiff's reputation or competency as an astronomer. One does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase ‘butt-head’.”Sagan v. Apple Computer, Inc., 874 F.Supp. 1072 (USDC C.D.

In November 1995, an out-of-court settlement was reached and Apple's office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that “Apple has always had great respect for Dr. Sagan. It was never Apple's intention to cause Dr. Sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern.”Poundstone 1999, pp. 374–375 Apple's third and final code name for the project was "LAW", short for "Lawyers are Wimps".
Sagan briefly served as an adviser on Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[tpl]rp|168[/tpl] Sagan proposed that the film suggest, rather than depict, extraterrestrial superintelligence.[tpl]cite book |first=Carl |last=Sagan |others=Produced by Jerome Agel; new contributions by Freeman Dyson, Ann Druyan, and David Morrison |title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective |edition=2nd |origyear=Originally published 1973 |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-78303-8 |oclc=460747781 |lccn=00020378 |page=183 |chapter='Hello, Central Casting?

==Sagan and UFOs==

Sagan had some interest in UFO reports from at least August 3, 1952, when he wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.[tpl]rp|51–52[/tpl] He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with Jacques Vallée.[tpl]cite book |last=Westrum |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Westrum |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |editor-link=David M. Jacobs |title=UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |pages=31–55 |chapter=Limited Access: Six Natural Scientists and the UFO Phenomenon |isbn=0-7006-1032-4 |oclc=43615835 |lccn=00028970[/tpl] Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public interest in UFO reports.
Stuart Appelle notes that Sagan "wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding UFOs and the abduction experience. Sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study."[tpl]cite book |last=Appelle |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Appelle |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |title=UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |pages=7–30 |chapter=Ufology and Academia: The UFO Phenomenon as a Scholarly Discipline |isbn=0-7006-1032-4 |oclc=43615835 |lccn=00028970[/tpl]
In 1966 Sagan was a member of the Ad Hoc Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.
Sociologist Ron Westrum writes that "The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the AAAS' symposium in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as James McDonald and J. Allen Hynek but also skeptics like astronomers William Hartmann and Donald Menzel. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon." With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as UFO's: A Scientific Debate. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of Cosmos) and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.
Sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 Cosmos series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and that "some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills ... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available." He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.Sagan 1995, pp. 81–96, 99–104

==Death==

After suffering from myelodysplasia, and receiving three bone marrow transplants, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, on December 20, 1996.[tpl]cite news |first=Norma |last=Quarles |title=Carl Sagan dies at 62 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/20/sagan/ |work=CNN |date=December 20, 1996 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |quote=Sagan was a noted astronomer whose lifelong passion was searching for intelligent life in the cosmos.[/tpl]
He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Ithaca, New York.[tpl]Find a Grave|1347[/tpl]

==Posthumous recognition==

The 1997 movie Contact, based on Sagan's novel of the same name and finished after his death, ends with the dedication "For Carl". His photo can also be seen at 59:25 in the film.
In 1997 the Sagan Planet Walk was opened in Ithaca, New York. It is a walking-scale model of the Solar System, extending 1.2 km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca to the Sciencenter, a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |title=Sagan Planet Walk |website=sciencenter.org |publisher=Sciencenter |location=Ithaca, NY |accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]
The landing site of the unmanned Mars Pathfinder spacecraft was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station on July 5, 1997. Asteroid 2709 Sagan is named in his honor.
Sagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the Star Trek franchise. In an episode of Star Trek: Enterprise entitled "Terra Prime", a quick shot is shown of the relic rover Sojourner, part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, placed by a historical marker at Carl Sagan Memorial Station on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: "Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you." Sagan's student Steve Squyres led the team that landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity successfully on Mars in 2004.
On November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the Ames Research Center dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. "Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time", said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin. Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.
Sagan has at least three awards named in his honor:
August 2007 the Independent Investigations Group (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award. This honor has also been awarded to Harry Houdini and James Randi.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2006/index.html |title=The 2007 IIG Awards |website=IIG |publisher=Independent Investigations Group |location=Los Angeles |date=August 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2011[/tpl]
Beginning in 2009, a musical project known as Symphony of Science sampled several excerpts of Sagan from his series Cosmos and remixed them to electronic music. To date, the videos have received over 21 million views worldwide on YouTube.[tpl]cite AV media |people=Boswell, John |date=November 9, 2009 |title=A Glorious Dawn |medium=7-in (17.5 cm) gramophone record |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |publisher=Third Man Records |location=Nashville, TN[/tpl]
