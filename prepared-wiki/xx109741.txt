==Plot==

Wealthy heiress, Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn), is completely spoiled and accustomed to living the life of the idle and rich with her husband, Grant Stayton III (Edward Herrmann). While waiting for their yacht to be repaired in the rural hamlet of Elk Cove, Oregon, Joanna passes the time by hiring local carpenter, Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), to remodel her closet. At first, Dean puts up with Joanna's rude and demanding attitude.  However, when she refuses to pay because he didn't use cedar, the "right" type of wood according to Joanna, she shoves him overboard, along with all his tools, for demanding payment.  
Later that night as Joanna and Grant sail away from the harbor, Joanna falls overboard while searching for her wedding ring on deck, develops amnesia, is rescued by a garbage scow, and is taken to the local hospital where no one can figure out who she is or where she belongs. Once Grant realizes she's fallen overboard, he sails back to port to get her.  But after seeing her mental state and how horribly she treats the staff, he denies knowing her and returns to the yacht to embark on a spree of parties with younger women. After seeing her story on the local news, Dean, a widower living in redneck clutter with four young sons, decides to seek his revenge and remedy his own domestic problems by taking advantage of the situation. He goes to the hospital and tells Joanna that she is Annie, his wife of thirteen years and the mother of his sons. He convinces the staff of his identity by revealing a small birthmark on her behind, which he saw during the remodeling when she was wearing a revealing swimsuit. Unwillingly convinced, she reluctantly goes home with Dean.
At first, Joanna has difficulty dealing with Dean's boys and the heavy load of chores but soon adapts to her new life as a housewife and learns to cook, clean, do laundry (in a tub even), and care for the pets, all while having to sleep on the couch at night. As she masters her own responsibilities, she learns about the boys' school and family issues and that Dean is secretly working two jobs to make ends meet.  She begins to fall in love with Dean and his children and handles the boys' school issues, family matters, and money challenges with considerable wisdom and grace. Seeing Dean struggle, she makes his dream come true by helping him design a miniature golf course based on her untapped knowledge of the Seven Wonders of the World. Although Dean has also fallen in love with Joanna, he doesn't tell her the truth about her real identity for fear that she will leave. Even when he tries to come clean when she discovers a pair of monogrammed panties from her former life (which causes her to think he's having an affair), a friend, Billy Pratt (Michael G. Hagerty), says they belonged to a girl he met to get Dean off the hook.
Meanwhile, giving in to the pressure of Joanna's inquisitive mother, Edith (Katherine Helmond), Grant reluctantly returns to Elk Cove to retrieve his wife. Upon seeing him, Joanna's memory returns immediately. She is shocked and hurt when she realizes that Dean lied and has been using her for months. She returns with Grant to the yacht where her mother and Dr. Korman, the family's bumbling psychiatrist, are waiting. Joanna now finds her old lifestyle stuffy and pretentious compared to her life with Dean and his family. One evening after doing shots of Tequila with the crew, Joanna turns to Andrew (Roddy McDowall), her loyal butler, and apologizes for her poor treatment of him after all the things he had done for her in the past. Andrew replies that he is both surprised and pleased with the apology. He observes that unlike most people, Joanna has been given an opportunity to see life from a different station than that to which she was born. He does not tell her what she must do, but merely states she is the one who can decide how to use the new perspective.
Realizing how happy she was with Dean and the kids, she commandeers the yacht and turns back towards Elk Cove. When the neurotic and selfish Grant finds out, he accuses his wife of mutiny, admits he never loved her, and commandeers the ship himself. Meanwhile, Dean and the boys attempt to get Joanna back with the help of Billy's friend who is in the Coast Guard. When they catch up to the yacht, Joanna and Dean both jump overboard and are reunited in the water. An incensed Grant attempts to shoot her with a bow and arrow, accusing her of mutiny for jumping ship, only to be unceremoniously booted overboard by Andrew, who promptly gives his notice of resignation. Safely aboard the smaller vessel, Joanna, having left and unofficially divorced Grant, reveals to Dean that the yacht and the money are actually hers, not Grant's. Hours later, while the boys are making out their Christmas lists (due to their sudden wealth), Dean asks Joanna, "What could I possibly give you that you don't already have?" Joanna looks at Dean's boys and smiles, then replies, "A little girl."

But there's something nerveless and thin about it. Hawn and Russell are good, but their scenes together have a calculated spontaneity--overcute, obvious."[tpl]cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : Hawn Keeps 'Overboard' From Sinking |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=1987-12-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-18/entertainment/ca-19770_1|accessdate=2010-12-25|first=Michael|last=Wilmington[/tpl] During the 2012 Academy Awards telecast, actress Reese Witherspoon admitted that Overboard is her all-time favorite movie.
