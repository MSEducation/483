[[Nataoran language]]

CATEGORIES: Formosan languages, Languages of Taiwan

Nataoran is one of the Formosan languages of the Amis and Sakizaya, indigenous tribal peoples living along the east coast of Taiwan. The Sakizaya variety is highly divergent, and sometimes considered a separate language from Nataoran, but in recent years both have begun to converge with Central Amis, which is culturally dominant.
