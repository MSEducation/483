Yang Yun ([tpl]zh|s=杨云|t=楊雲|p=Yáng Yún[/tpl]; born December 2, 1984 in Zhuzhou, Hunan) is a Chinese gymnast. She won the bronze medal on the uneven bars at the 2000 Summer Olympics along with a fifth place finish in the all around, where a fall off the balance beam (a five tenth deduction) cost her the gold medal, finishing less than three and a half tenths behind eventual champion Simona Amânar of Romania. She was also a member of the bronze medal winning Chinese team, but the medal was stripped by the IOC in 2010 after one of the Chinese team members was found to be underage during the competition.
Currently, Yang Yun is a CCTV reporter. She is wife of Chinese gymnast Yang Wei.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://triplefull.blogspot.com/2008/11/yang-wei-and-yang-yun-get-married.html|title=Yang Wei and Yang Yun Tie the Knot... Finally|publisher=Triple Full|date=11-06-2008|accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl]

==Age Controversy==

After Yang Yun admitted being 14 when she competed in Sydney on Chinese national television, she was subject to an investigation by the International Gymnastics Federation along with teammate Dong Fangxiao.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2008/10/01/2008-10-01_chinas_golden_gymnasts_not_underage_but_.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=China's golden gymnasts not underage, but doubts about 2000 squad | first=Corky | last=Siemaszko | date=October 1, 2008[/tpl] Yang Yun was found to be innocent due to insufficient evidence in February 2010, meaning she was able to keep her bronze medal in uneven bars, but she was given a warning by the FIG. Her teammate Dong Fangxiao was found guilty and her results were canceled. On April 28, 2010, the IOC removed the Chinese team's bronze medal.
