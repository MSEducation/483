The album is dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks.

==Recording and production==

At the start of 1994, Radiohead began working on song arrangements for The Bends. They were encouraged by both the material and their producer of choice, John Leckie, who had agreed to work with them on the album.Randall, p. 124 Sessions were due to begin at London's RAK Studio in January; however, fellow Oxford band Ride asked Leckie to perform some last-minute emergency work on their forthcoming album Carnival of Light.Randall, p. 125 Radiohead agreed to postpone the start of the album's sessions to 24 February to accommodate Leckie. The band used the extra time to practice their songs, but this later proved unsatisfactory to them – Yorke said, "We had all of these songs and we really liked them, but we knew them almost too well . . . so we had to sort of learn to like them again before we could record them, which is odd."Randall, p. 126
The band found the first two months of work on the album difficult. While they were pleased with Leckie and engineer Nigel Godrich, they felt pressured to follow up the success of Pablo Honey.  The band's record label, EMI, had set an October 1994 release date for the record, which later proved unrealistic. EMI also suggested Radiohead should record the album's lead single first. No one could agree on what the lead single should be, so the band worked on four tracks they considered candidates: "Sulk", "The Bends", "Just", and "Nice Dream". The approach proved counter-productive; Leckie recalled, "Everyone was pulling their hair out saying, 'It's not good enough!' . . We were trying too hard". The recording process slowed down further as guitarist Jonny Greenwood experimented with several rented guitars and amplifiers in order to discover "a really special sound" for his instrument, despite Leckie's belief that Greenwood already had one. According to Leckie, whenever a record company representative or the group's management came to check on the album's progress, all the band would have to show them was "a drum sound or something".Randall, pp. 127-28
In an attempt to defuse tensions between Yorke and the rest of the band, which had begun over whether or not they should take a break from the sessions that April, Leckie suggested to Yorke that he record some songs by himself on guitar. The group had a tour lined up for May until mid-June, which meant that the album would not be completed by October as planned. By the end of the sessions at RAK, Radiohead had recorded several songs that would appear on the album, as well as most of the tracks that would appear on My Iron Lung extended play (EP).Randall, pp. 129-30 They resumed recording on 16 June at businessman Richard Branson's rural studio complex the Manor. Unlike the sessions at RAK, the group recorded material quickly; Leckie felt the break for the tour gave the group "confidence" in the songs again. The band completed recording the album at Abbey Road Studios in London, where Leckie also mixed some of the songs.Randall, p. 133
Due to the poor commercial performance of the My Iron Lung EP, EMI decided Pablo Honey producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie would remix the album tracks in the United States.Randall, p. 139 Leckie did not realise what was happening until EMI asked him for copies of the multi-track tapes. Leckie said EMI "had been going on about trying to get an American sound for the record from the minute I got involved". Kolderie insisted he and Slade did not lobby to remix the album, but EMI made the decision and the band supported it after hearing Pablo Honey play over a sound system during an in-store appearance. Leckie did not always like what Slade and Kolderie produced, but he has since stated that it was a sound decision to have others approach the music with a fresh approach.Randall, p. 140

==Music==

According to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke's songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band's later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs "Fake Plastic Trees" and, in particular, "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" and its b-side "Talk Show Host", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]  "Fake Plastic Trees" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while "Sulk" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre.- Mac Randall (1 September 2004). Exit Music: The Radiohead Story, 119. Google Print. ISBN 1-84449-183-8 (accessed 28 October 2005). Also available in print from Omnibus Press.  According to Yorke, "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.
The lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of "My Iron Lung", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke's alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next "rock 'n roll martyr" or suicide.[ref]

==Packaging==

The Bends was the first of the band's full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name "The White Chocolate Farm" (later shortened to Tchock). In an interview with NME, Donwood recalled: "I got a CPR mannequin and filmed it on an old-fashioned video camera with a video cassette in it."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/stanley-donwood-on-the-stories-behind-his-radiohead-album-covers | title=Stanley Donwood On The Stories Behind His Radiohead Album Covers | publisher=NME | date=27 September 2013 | accessdate=28 September 2013 | author=Jones, Lucy[/tpl]

==Reception and legacy==

The Bends met with greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a standard-bearer of "indie" Brit-rock bands.[tpl]citation| newspaper = Guardian| title = Aching Heads| date = 13 June 1997| last = Sullivan| first = Caroline[/tpl] The album was released during the height of the '90s Britpop movement; however, in the band's home country, Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called "Britpop" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01343-from-the-archives-1996-radiohead-interviewed-between-the-bends-and-ok-computer |title=A 1996 Radiohead Interview - The Bends, Britpop And OK Computer |author=Clare Kleinedler |date=23 March 2009 |publisher=The Quietus |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl]
In the US, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, Radiohead's lowest appearance on the chart. The single "High and Dry", on the other hand, reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, one of their highest chartings there. In the UK, The Bends reached number four and stayed on the chart for 160 weeks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/radiohead/ |title=Radiohead charts |publisher=Official Charts Company |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] It was certified Triple Platinum in the UK[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=BPI Certified Awards Search |publisher=British Phonographic Industry |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] Note: reader must define search parameter as "Radiohead". and Platinum in the US.[tpl]cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Searchable Database |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] Note: reader must define search parameter as "Radiohead". In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience. Many bands, including Garbage, R.E.M., and k.d. lang began to cite Radiohead as their favourite band.
The Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of "the 50 albums that changed music", saying, "Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt."[tpl]citation| title = The 50 albums that changed music| newspaper = The Observer| date = 16 July 2006| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1821230,00.html| accessdate =5 October 2008[/tpl]
The Bends took second place behind Radiohead's OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time.[tpl]Citation | title = Q Readers All Time Top 100 Albums | publisher = Q | edition = Q137 | date = February 1998[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/13644-q-readers-best-albums-ever-2006-readers-poll |title=Q Magazine's Q Readers Best Albums Ever (2006 Readers Poll) Archived by Lists of Bests |work=Q |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The Bends was the highest entry of three Radiohead albums to make the list (OK Computer and Kid A being the others), until the release of the updated version of the list in 2012, in which Kid A was moved to number 67.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/the-bends-radiohead-19691231 |title=500 Greatest Albums: The Bends – Radiohead |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl] In 2000, Virgin's "Top 1000 Albums of All Time" ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles.[tpl]citation| title = Beatles, Radiohead albums voted best ever| work = CNN.com| date = 4 September 2000| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/04/britain.albums/| accessdate =8 October 2008| format =|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522120621/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/04/britain.albums/ |archivedate = 22 May 2008[/tpl] In 2006, British Hit Singles & Albums and NME organised a poll of which, 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and The Bends was placed at number 10 on the list.[tpl]cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article670515.ece |title=Oasis album voted greatest of all time |work=The Times |date=1 Jun 2006 |accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl]
