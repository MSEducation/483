==Suburbs==

==Early port suburb division names==

From the late 1830s to 1945, the area surrounding Port Adelaide was subdivided into many small district areas as owners bought, subdivided and sold areas of land. As the areas became smaller, and more landowners named their own estates, the number of these early "suburbs" reached 90. By the 1940s this was becoming a problem, so the Port Adelaide Council moved to reduce the number of local district areas to 18, in 1945. The boundaries and names of the suburbs were further stabilised when postcodes were introduced to Australia in 1967.Couper-Smartt, 2003:167
