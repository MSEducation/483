[[Maytag Toy Racer]]

CATEGORIES: Microcars

The Maytag Toy Racer was a small 1-passenger automobile built by the Maytag Company or in some cases the Winston Corporation of Joliet, Illinois  between October 11, 1934 and December 1, 1941 and powered by Maytag Model 92 one-cylinder or, later, two-cylinder air-cooled Multi-Motor engines. 
Early versions used a cone clutch for power transmission, and later models used a double-purpose hand lever to adjust drive-belt friction and to apply braking action.
Records show that 498 Maytag Toy Racers and Winston Racers were built, and approximately 25 survivors have been located to date.
