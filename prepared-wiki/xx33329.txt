Doris May Lessing CH (née Tayler; 22 October 1919 – 17 November 2013) was a British novelist, poet, playwright, librettist, biographer and short story writer. Her novels include The Grass is Singing (1950), the sequence of five novels collectively called Children of Violence (1952–69), The Golden Notebook (1962), The Good Terrorist (1985), and five novels collectively known as Canopus in Argos: Archives (1979–1983).
Lessing was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature. In awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy described her as "that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny".[tpl]cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2007/index.html|title=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=11 October 2007[/tpl] Lessing was the eleventh woman and the oldest person ever to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.Crown, Sarah."Doris Lessing wins Nobel prize", The Guardian, 11 October 2013.

===Early life===

Lessing was born in Kermanshah, Persia (now Iran), on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler (née McVeagh), both British subjects.[tpl]cite news|last=Hazelton|first=Lesley|title=Golden Notebook' Author Lessing Wins Nobel Prize|work=Bloomberg|date=11 October 2007|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=anexY5Z5sGgw&refer=home|accessdate=11 October 2007[/tpl] Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in World War I, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital where he was recovering from his amputation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/klein-lessing.html|title=Doris Lessing|accessdate=11 October 2007|author= Carole Klein|work=The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/dlessing.htm|title=Doris Lessing|accessdate=11 October 2007|work=kirjasto[/tpl] The couple moved to Kermanshah, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia; it was there that Doris was born in 1919.[tpl]cite news|last =Hazelton| first=Lesley|title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction'|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 1982|url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/feminismcommunism.htm| accessdate=11 October 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=Author Lessing wins Nobel honour|date=11 October 2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7039100.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 October 2007[/tpl] In 1925, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to farm maize and other plants on about [tpl]convert|1000|acre[/tpl] of bush that Alfred bought. In the rough environment, Emily tried to lead an Edwardian lifestyle, which would have been easy had the family been wealthy; in reality, such a lifestyle was not feasible. The farm did not deliver any monetary value.
Lessing was educated at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in Salisbury (now Harare).Carol Simpson Stern. Doris Lessing Biography. biography.jrank.org. Retrieved on 11 October 2007. She left school at age 14, and was self-educated from then on; she left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Lessing moved to Salisbury to work as a telephone operator, and she soon married her first husband, Frank Wisdom, with whom she had two children (John, born in 1939, and Jean, born in 1943), before the marriage ended in 1943.
After her first divorce, Lessing's interest was drawn to the popular community of the Left Book Club, a communist book club which she had joined the year before.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/biography.html|title=Biography|accessdate=11 October 2007|year=1995|work=A Reader's Guide to The Golden Notebook and Under My Skin|work=HarperCollins[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5twsK0hVK2MC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=doris+lessing+left+book+club+1942#v=onepage&q=doris%20lessing%20left%20book%20club%201942&f=false|title=Brief Chronology|accessdate=29 December 2010|year=2003|work=A Home for the Highland Cattle & The Antheap|publisher=Broadview Press[/tpl] It was here that she met her future second husband, Gottfried Lessing.

Gottfried Lessing later became the East German ambassador to Uganda, and was murdered in the 1979 rebellion against Idi Amin Dada.  Gottfried was an uncle of German politician Gregor Gysi.Gregor Gysi Doris Lessings deutscher Neffe FAZ 12 October 2007. Retrieved 17 November 2013
Lessing moved to London in 1949 with her youngest son, Peter, to pursue her writing career and communist beliefs, but left the two elder children with their father in South Africa. She later said that at the time she saw no choice: "For a long time I felt I had done a very brave thing. There is nothing more boring for an intelligent woman than to spend endless amounts of time with small children. I felt I wasn't the best person to bring them up. I would have ended up an alcoholic or a frustrated intellectual like my mother."Lowering the Bar. When bad mothers give us hope. Newsweek 6 May 2010. Retrieved 9 May 2010. As well as campaigning against nuclear arms, she was an active opponent of apartheid which led in 1956 to being banned from South Africa and Rhodesia for many years. In the same year, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary, she left the British Communist Party.[tpl]cite news|last=Miller|first=Stephen|title=Nobel Author Doris Lessing Dies at 94|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304439804579203804274045712|accessdate=23 November 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=17 November 2013[/tpl]

==Fiction==

Lessing's fiction is commonly divided into three distinct phases: the Communist theme (1944–56), when she was writing radically on social issues (to which she returned in The Good Terrorist 1985); the psychological theme (1956–1969); and after that the Sufi theme, which was explored in the Canopus in Argos sequence of science fiction (or as she preferred to put it "space fiction") novels and novellas. Doris Lessing's first novel The Grass Is Singing, the first four volumes of The Children of Violence sequence, as well as the collection of short stories African Stories are set in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).
Lessing's Canopus sequence was not popular with many mainstream literary critics. For example, in the New York Times in 1982 John Leonard wrote in reference to The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 that "one of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing... She now propagandises on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz,"[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE163BF934A35751C0A964948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=The Spacing Out of Doris Lessing|first=John|last=Leonard|authorlink=John Leonard (American critic)|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 October 2008|date=7 February 1982[/tpl] to which Lessing replied: "What they didn't realise was that in science fiction is some of the best social fiction of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like Blood Music, by Greg Bear. He's a great writer."Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns, interview by Harvey Blume in Boston Book Review Unlike some authors primarily known for their mainstream work, she never hesitated to admit that she wrote science fiction and attended the 1987 World Science Fiction Convention as its Writer Guest of Honor. Here she made a speech in which she described her dystopian novel Memoirs of a Survivor as "an attempt at an autobiography.""Guest of Honor Speech", in Worldcon Guest of Honor Speeches, edited by Mike Resnick and Joe Siclari (Deerfield, IL: ISFIC Press, 2006), p. 192.
The Canopus in Argos novels present an advanced interstellar society's efforts to accelerate the evolution of other worlds, including Earth. Using Sufi concepts, to which Lessing had been introduced in the mid-1960s by her "good friend and teacher" Idries Shah, the series of novels also utilises an approach similar to that employed by the early 20th century mystic G. I. Gurdjieff in his work All and Everything. Earlier works of "inner space" fiction like Briefing for a Descent into Hell (1971) and Memoirs of a Survivor (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing's interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned."Postcolonial Nostalgias: Writing, Representation and Memory", Volume 31 of Routledge research in postcolonial literatures, Dennis Walder, Taylor & Francis ltd, 2010, p92. ISBN 9780203840382.
Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook is considered a feminist classic by some scholars,[tpl]cite news|title=Fresh Air Remembers 'Golden Notebook' Author Doris Lessing|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=245955408|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=18 November 2013[/tpl]  but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns as a means of healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in Walking in the Shade that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend Joan Rodker, the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher John Rodker.Lessing's Early and Transitional Novels: The Beginnings of a Sense of Selfhood. Retrieved 17 October 2007.
Lessing did not like being pigeonholed as a feminist author. When asked why, she explained: [tpl]Quote|What the feminists want of me is something they haven't examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, 'Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.' Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do. I've come with great regret to this conclusion.|Doris Lessing|The New York Times, 25 July 1982[/tpl]

==Doris Lessing Society==

The Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing’s work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the Doris Lessing Newsletter was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal, Doris Lessing Studies. The Society also organizes panels at the Modern Languages Association (MLA) annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in New Orleans in 2004 and Leeds in 2007.Official website

==Archive==

Lessing's largest literary archive is held by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999. Original material for Lessing's early books is assumed not to exist because she kept none of her early manuscripts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2007/lessing.html|title=Harry Ransom Center Holds Archive of Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing|accessdate=17 March 2008|publisher= hrc.utexas.edu[/tpl] Other institutions, including the McFarlin Library at the University of Tulsa, and the University of East Anglia hold smaller collections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.utulsa.edu/speccoll/collections/lessingdoris/index.htm|title=Doris Lessing manuscripts|accessdate=17 October 2007|publisher= lib.utulsa.edu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/is/archives/lessing|title=Doris Lessing Archive|accessdate=18 November 2013|publisher=University of Tulsa[/tpl]
