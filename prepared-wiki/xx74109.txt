==History==

Epworth, is situated in the Isle of Axholme. The Isle is so called because, until it was drained by the Dutch engineer Sir Cornelius Vermuyden (1627–1629), it was an inland island surrounded by rivers. A grant of the commons to the freeholders and other tenants, made by deed in 1360 by John de Mowbray, Lord of the Manor, gave privileges and freedoms.[tpl]elucidate|date=July 2011[/tpl] The deed caused repercussions[tpl]Why?|date=July 2011[/tpl] in the reign of King Charles I when Vermuyden was given the task of draining the Isle. His work was an outstanding piece of irrigation engineering.
There has been extensive drainage since, which, together with periodic warping (intentional flooding to deposit silt and enrich the land), has made this an exceptionally fertile area.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

It is maintained as a museum. It is also the site of supposed paranormal events that occurred there in 1716, while the Wesley family was living in the house.[tpl]Harvnb|Crain|2009|p=109[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=New Light on Old Ghosts | author=Hall, Trevor H.| publisher=Gerald Duckworth | year=1965 | pages=14–25|isbn=0715602314[/tpl]
Epworth's parish church is dedicated to Saint Andrew, located on a hill overlooking the town. Its architecture suggests[tpl]according to whom|date=July 2011[/tpl] that its oldest part may have been built in the late 12th century with later additions in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is probable that a church stood on the site earlier than that.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
As Epworth is said to be the 'Home of Methodism' there is a grand Methodist Church in the centre of the town. This was built in 1888 (opened for worship in 1889) and continues to be a busy hub in the centre of the community. The church (along with the town as a whole) attracts hundreds of visitors from around the world each year tracing the history of the Methodist movement.
An example of the Dutch influence on local architecture can be seen in the building now used as the Post Office, situated in the High Street.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
