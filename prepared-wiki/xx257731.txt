During World War II, Adams published four volumes on sea and air navigation that became textbooks in the armed services. He wrote more than twenty academic books during his career, and was recognised as a leader in his field.
He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1949 to 1951, and was a member of the Royal Institute of Navigation.
His children included Professor Ninian Smart and the utilitarian philosopher, Professor John Jamieson Carswell "Jack" Smart, (often known as J.J.C Smart).
