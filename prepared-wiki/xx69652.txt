Separate from diplomatic concerns, Boris was interested in converting himself and the Bulgars to Christianity to resolve the disunity within the Bulgar society. When he ascended to the throne, the Bulgars and Slavs were disparate and hostile elements within Boris' kingdom, the minority Bulgars dominating the Slavs.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Religious plurality further contributed to divisions within the society.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] The Slavs had their own polytheistic belief system while the Bulgar elite believed in Tangra, the God-Heavena. At the same time, Jewish and Muslim missionaries were spreading propaganda throughout the Bulgar state.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Boris believed that becoming a Christian ruler would persuade the Slavic people and the Bulgar nobles, the boyars, who were jealous of the khan, to accept his authority.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Thus, a solution to the disunity of the state seemed to be to enforce a common religion, namely Christianity.

There are a few other versions as to why Boris converted to Christianity. Some historians attribute it to the intervention of his sister who had already converted while being at Constantinople.  Another story mentions a Greek slave in the ruler's court.  A more mythological version is the one in which Boris is astonished and frightened by an icon of Judgement day and thus decides to adopt Christianity.

After his baptism, the first major task that Boris undertook was the baptism of his subjects and for this task he appealed to Byzantine priests between 864 and 866. [ref]
