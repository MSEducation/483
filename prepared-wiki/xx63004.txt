The tammar wallaby is a model organism for studying marsupial biology, as well as mammal biology in general. It has been used in the fields of reproductive biology, immunology, metabolism, neurobiology and many others. Its "seasonal and lactational control of its reproduction" make its reproduction particularly suited for study.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hickfield, D.; Frankenberg, S.; Renfree, M. B.|year=2009|title=The Tammar Wallaby, Macropus eugenii: A Model Kangaroo for the Study of Developmental and Reproductive Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Protocols|volume=4|issue=12|pages=1–12|doi=10.1101/pdb.emo137[/tpl] Tammars are inexpensive to keep in captivity and are easy to handle. They also breed well, especially if there is at least one male for five females. Tammars used for scientific study are generally housed in outdoor pens with access to water and shelter, which is closer to their natural habitat than a laboratory.Marsupials as models for biomedical research, September 2001,   14 (3), ANZCCART News.

The genomes of marsupials are of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics, and the study of tammars has provided much information about the genetics of marsupials and mammals in general. Marsupials are at a convenient degree of evolutionary divergence from humans; mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote.[tpl]cite journal | author=Marshall Graves, J.

E.; Belov, K.; Deakin, J.

Sequencing of the tammar genome found "innovation in reproductive and lactational genes, rapid evolution of germ cell genes, and incomplete, locus-specific X inactivation".[tpl]cite journal|author=Renfree M. B.; Papenfuss, A. T.; Deakin, J. E. et al. |title=Genome sequence of an Australian kangaroo, Macropus eugenii, provides insight into the evolution of mammalian reproduction and development.|journal=Genome Biology|year=2011|volume=12|issue=8|pages=R81|pmid=21854559|doi=10.1186/gb-2011-12-8-r81|pmc=3277949[/tpl] The researchers also found new HOX genes that control gene expression, as well as novel micro RNAs. The tammar genome appears to have more rearrangements than those of both the human and the gray short-tailed opossum, another sequenced marsupial.

===Antibiotics===

A compound in the milk of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 has the potential to be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus.[tpl]cite web | title = Fighting superbugs with milk | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025484.300-fighting-superbugs-with-milk.html | publisher = New Scientist | date = 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 7 September 2006[/tpl] Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.[tpl]cite journal|author=Wang, J.; Wong, E.

===Gut microbiota related with greenhouse effect===

The foregut of the tammar wallaby  contains species of bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, species of the Succinivibrionaceae family are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. Research suggests that this information could be used to reduce carbon production in livestock.[tpl]cite journal|author=P. B. Pope, et al.|year=2011|title=Isolation of Succinivibrionaceae Implicated in Low Methane Emissions from Tammar Wallabies|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6042|pages=646–48|doi=10.1126/science.1205760[/tpl]
