Bageis, Bagis, or Bage was a city in the former Roman province of Lydia in Asia Minor (modern Turkey).Bageis - Catholic Encyclopedia article

==History==

This name is found on Roman coins, but becomes Bagis in the Synecdemos of Hierocles and Bage in later Notitiæ gracæ episcopatuum. Bageis takes the epithet Cæsarea 'of caesar', i.e. imperial (foundation?) and names the River Hermos on its coins. Asia Minor Coins - Roman coins from ancient Bageis

==Location==

It has been placed by Keppel's inscriptions near Sirghe on the Hermos River; but the site of the city is said to be on the north bank, while Sirghe is on the south side of the river.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The episcopal see of Bagis was a suffragan of Sardis.
We know really only three bishops of Bageis:Harnack (Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten, 486) maintains that its bishop was present at the First Council of Nicaea, but this is an error caused by a confusion with Baris, another Lydian city; the lists edited by Heinrich Gelzer and C. H. Turner are silent about Bageis. 
It remains a Catholic Church titular see, under the name Bagis.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 845
