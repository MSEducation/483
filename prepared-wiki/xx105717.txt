==Misattribution and imitators==

Yankovic's official website has the following note:
Because Yankovic is arguably the most successful parody artist, songs posted to file sharing networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter.  Much to the disdain of Yankovic, this includes songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205|title="Ask Al" Q&As for October 2, 2005|accessdate=2006-08-24[/tpl]
Yankovic cites these misattributions as "his real beef with P2P sites:"
