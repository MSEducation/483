Dr. Jean McGivern Turner (born 23 December 1939 in Glasgow) is a former Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.
Prior to her election, Turner was a General practitioner in the Springburn area in Glasgow for 25 years. Before that, she was an anaesthetist for ten years. She was lured to seek political office due to an proposed cut to services at Stobhill Hospital. Turner also campaigned against Labour's treatment of the NHS. Because of this, she stood as a candidate in the Strathkelvin and Bearsden Holyrood by-election of 2001. In that race, she finished second with 7,572 votes or 18%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1378635.stm |title=SCOTLAND | Hospital campaign shakes by-election |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl]  In the 2003 Scottish parliamentary elections, she stood again in Strathkelvin and Bearsden on the same platform she used in 2001.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2305661.stm | work=BBC News | title=GP in hospitals election fight | date=7 October 2002[/tpl] This time, Turner won the seat with 10,988 votes or 31%.

 "Narrow win, big win, whatever, it is still a disappointment, but we are coming back for this seat." 
Jean Turner stood for re-election at the Scottish Parliament election, 2007 in May, but lost her seat to the Labour candidate, David Whitton.
