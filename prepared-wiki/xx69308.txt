The All-American Bowl was an annual postseason  college football bowl game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama from 1977 to 1990. The game was known as the Hall of Fame Classic from 1977 to 1985.Foldesy, Jody. "Bowls burgeon as big business", The Washington Times. December 21, 1997. Page A1.
In the spring of 1986, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame decided to relocate the Hall of Fame Bowl game to Tampa beginning in December 1986. The game in Birmingham continued for five years under a different name and organizing body. When the Southeastern Conference expanded to twelve schools and began contesting a championship game in 1992, Birmingham officials chose to host the conference title game and abandon the All-American Bowl. The SEC championship was moved to Atlanta's Georgia Dome two years later, leaving Legion Field without any Division I-A postseason college football until 2006, when the NCAA agreed to hold a new post-season game the Papajohns.com Bowl (now the BBVA Compass Bowl), proposed by ESPN.

==Teams==

The All-American Bowl played host to a number of successful teams from the premier college football conferences of the time (the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Eight (now Big 12 Conference), Big Ten Conference, Southeastern Conference and Southwest Conference). All of them placed teams in the All-American Bowl in various years. At least one of the power conferences fielded teams in the All-American Bowl in every year of its existence; often, two of those premier conferences met in the game. The Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference each placed five teams into the All-American Bowl. The Big Ten Conference proved to be the least successful conference, having never won a game despite placing teams in four different years.
