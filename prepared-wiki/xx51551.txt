[[Fumarioideae]]

CATEGORIES: Papaveraceae, Plant subfamilies

Fumarioideae is a subfamily of the family Papaveraceae (the poppy family). It was formerly treated as a separate family, the Fumariacae (the fumitory, fumewort or bleeding-heart family). It consists of about 575 species of herbaceous plants in 20 genera, native to the Northern Hemisphere and South Africa.

==Description==

===Flower shape===

Plants in the fumitory subfamily are easily recognised by their peculiar flowers with two dissimilar pairs of petals. One or both of the outer petals is usually spurred, and the inner petals are connected at tip.
There are two types of flowers. A given genus has one type or the other. Dicentra has flowers with two planes of symmetry, and Corydalis has flowers with one plane of symmetry (zygomorphic).

===Leaves===

Most species have compound leaves.

==Taxonomy==

The APG III system of 2009 (unchanged from the earlier 1998 APG system and the 2003 APG II system) includes the former family Fumariaceae within the Papaveraceae. The APG II system provided for its optional segregation as a separate family, but this option is not provided in the current APG III system.

===Genera===

There are 20 genera:
