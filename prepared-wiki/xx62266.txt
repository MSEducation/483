==History==

===Beginnings (1946–1961)===

DynCorp traces its origins from two companies formed in 1946: California Eastern Airways (CEA), an air freight business, and Land-Air Inc., an aircraft maintenance company.McCarthy, Glenda. Computer Sciences to Buy DynCorp. The Los Angeles Times. December 14, 2002. California Eastern Airways was founded by a small group of returning World War II pilots who wanted to break into the air cargo business.Baum, Dan. This Gun For Hire. Wired. February 2003. They were one of the first firms to ship cargo by air, and within a year, the firm was serving both coasts.Merle, Renae. Computer Sciences Plans to Acquire DynCorp. The Washington Post. December 14, 2002.DynCorp. Funding Universe. California Eastern Airways diversified into multiple government aviation and managerial jobs, airlifted supplies for the Korean War, and was responsible for the White Sands Missile Range (a client that DynCorp has retained for 50 years).
In 1951, Land-Air Inc., which implemented the first Contract Field Teams (teams of technicians that maintained military aircraft for the United States Air Force), was bought by California Eastern Aviation Inc.Overview. DynCorp International. DynCorp still holds the contract 50 years later, maintaining rotary and fixed-wing aircraft for all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. At this time, revenues for the company reached $6 million.
In 1952, the company, renamed to California Eastern Aviation, Inc., merged with Air Carrier Service Corporation (AIRCAR), which sold commercial aircraft and spare parts to foreign airlines and governments.

===Dynalectron (1962–1987)===

By 1961, California Eastern Aviation needed a new name to reflect the growing and diversifying company. The name "Dynalectron Corporation" was selected from 5,000 employee suggestions. In 1976, Dynalectron established their headquarters in McLean, Virginia.Fuel Hopes Spur Dynalectron; Work Begun on Process in 1963. The New York Times. June 20, 1979. Due to its growing size, the company restructured into four main operating groups: Specialty Contracting, Energy, Government Services, and Aviation Services. In the 30 years following the foundation of CEA, Dynalectron had acquired 19 companies in 30 years, had assets of $88 million, maintained a backlog of $250 million, employed 7,000, and had annual sales of $300 million.
In 1964, Dynalectron diversified into the energy services business with the acquisition of Hydrocarbon Research, Inc.Dynalectron Seeks to Buy Hydrocarbon Research Stock. The Wall Street Journal. September 13, 1963. Through this acquisition, Dynalectron developed a process called H-Coal, which converted coal into synthetic liquid fuels.Jones, William H. (July 12, 1978). "Dynalectron Has An Oil Answer; New Process For Coal Conversion." The Washington Post. The work began to attract national attention with the Arab Oil Embargos of the 1970s.Fuel Hopes Spur Dynalectron; Work Begun on Process in 1963. The New York Times. June 20, 1979. "The current petroleum shortfall and renewed interest in synthetic fuels have made the stock of Dynalectron, a small suburban Washington concern with a coal-to-oil process, one of the hottest issues on the American Stock Exchange." By the early 1980s, Texaco Inc., Ruhrkohle AG, and C. Itoh & Co. were all marketing Dynalectron's H-Oil process."Texaco to Buy Dynalectron Oil Process; Texaco Plans 50% Purchase Of Dynalectron Oil Process." The Washington Post. January 14, 1981."Dynalectron to Study Plan For Chinese Synfuel Plant." The Washington Post. December 25, 1981.
Between 1976 and 1981, the company had two public stock offerings and acquired another 14 companies.Leibovich, Mark. DynCorp Letter May Offer . . . a Hint. The Washington Post. August 4, 1988. By 1986, Dynaelectron was one of the largest defense contractors in North America.

===Dyncorp and expansion (1987–2003)===

In 1987, Dynalectron changed its name to DynCorp. In 1988, DynCorp went private to avoid a hostile takeover by Miami financier Victor Posner.Tucker, Elizabeth. "Group Raises DynCorp Bid to $ 267 Million." The Washington Post. November 10, 1987. "DynCorp, the McLean high-technology and services company that last week agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout worth $ 248 million, said yesterday that the buying group had raised its price to $ 267.3 million to top an offer from another bidder. The increased offer, made by an employe-management group led by DynCorp President Dan R. Bannister, is equal to $ 24.75 a share, the company said.... Frumberg said DynCorp's plan to go private through the Bannister group's leveraged buyout was spurred by fear that Posner could be planning a hostile takeover attempt." The bid was an employee-led initiative spearheaded by Daniel R. Bannister. Bannister, who was paid $1.65 an hour when he joined DynCorp as an electronics technician in 1953, served as DynCorp's president and CEO from 1985 to 1997.Shapiro, T. Rees. Daniel R. Bannister former president of DynCorp, dies at 80. The Washington Post. March 15, 2011.
By 1994, revenues exceeded $1 billion; by 1997, three years later, DynCorp earned $2.4 billion in annual revenue, had acquired an additional 40 companies, and employed 24,000 people. During this time, DynCorp operated missile test ranges for United States Department of Defense, developed vaccines for the National Institutes of Health, and installed security systems in U.S. embassies for the State Department. Dyncorp also supplied bodyguards to Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide in the 1990s and to Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the 2000s. In 1999, DynCorp moved their headquarters to Reston, Virginia.
With the reductions in military spending in the 1990s, DynCorp expanded their focus to the growing tech market. They bought 19 digital and network service firms, and acquired contracts with the government's information technology (IT) departments. By 2003, roughly half of DynCorp's business came from managing the IT departments of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.
In December 2000, DynCorp formed DynCorp International LLC, and transferred to it all of its international business to this entity while DynCorp Technical Services LLC continued to perform DynCorp's domestic contracts.

===Sale to CSC, IPO, and purchase by Cerberus Capital (2003-present)===

In March 2003, DynCorp and its subsidiaries were acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for approximately US$914 million. Less than two years later, CSC announced the sale of three DynCorp units (DynCorp International, DynMarine and certain DynCorp Technical Services contracts) to Veritas Capital Fund, LP for US$850 million.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.computerwire.com/industries/research/?pid=4BD38C8F-6D60-449D-901E-DD60A342337F| title=CSC Sells DynCorp Units for $850m| publisher=Datamonitor Computerwire| date=2004-12-14| accessdate=2006-10-16[/tpl]

International Police Force monitor, independently alleged that DynCorp employees in Bosnia engaged in sex with minors, and sold them to each other as slaves.[tpl]cite web|last=Capps |first=Robert |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/08/06/dyncorp/index.html |title=Sex-slave whistle-blowers vindicated |publisher=salon.com |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/jan/22/whistleblower-sex-traffickers-bosnia|title=The Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors And One Woman's Fight For Justice|author=Bolkovac, Kathryn| location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2011-01-22[/tpl] Both Johnston and Bolkovac were fired, and Johnston was later placed into protective custody before leaving several days later.
On June 2, 2000, an investigation was launched in the DynCorp hangar at Comanche Base Camp, one of two U.S. bases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all DynCorp personnel were detained for questioning.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KYLiRbLlMwoC&lpg=PA63&dq=%22He%20is%20the%20operator%20of%20a%20nightclub%20by%20the%20name%20of%20Harley's%22&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Bosnia and Herzegovina Hopes Betrayed: Trafficking of Woman and Girls to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Forced Prostitution |publisher=Human Rights Watch |pages=63–64 |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl] CID spent several weeks investigating and the results appear to support Johnston's allegations.

In 2002, Bolkovac filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal due to a protected disclosure (whistleblowing), and won.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/jan/22/whistleblower-sex-traffickers-bosnia | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Kathyrn | last=Bolkovac | title=Human trafficking,Bosnia and Herzegovina (News),World news,Law,Europe | date=2011-01-22[/tpl] Bolkovac co-authored a book with Cari Lynn titled The Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors And One Woman's Fight For Justice.

===Iraq incidents===

According to The New York Times, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) found that "DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State, billing the United States for millions of dollars of work that were not authorized and beginning other jobs without a go-ahead."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/world/middleeast/01reconstruction.html?_r=1&scp=47&sq=dyncorp+international&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Agency Finds New Waste and Fraud in Iraqi Rebuilding Projects | first=James | last=Glanz | date=2007-02-01[/tpl] The report states that the findings of DynCorp's misconduct on a $188 million job to buy weapons and build quarters for the Iraqi police were serious enough to warrant a fraud inquiry. A US government audit report of October 2007 revealed that $1.3 billion was spent on a contract with DynCorp for training Iraqi police.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7057629.stm|title=US-Iraqi contract 'in disarray'|publisher=BBC News|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=2007-11-17[/tpl] The auditors stated that the program was mismanaged to such an extent that they were unable to determine how the money was spent.
In February 2007 federal auditors cited DynCorp for wasting millions on projects, including building an unapproved, Olympic-sized swimming pool at the behest of Iraqi police officials.[tpl]cite news|last=Rosen|first=Nir|title=Riding Shotgun With Our Shadow Army in Iraq|publisher=Mother Jones|date=2007-05-01|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/05/iraq_contractors-2.html|accessdate=2007-05-15[/tpl] In April 2011, DynCorp agreed to pay $7.7 million to the US government to settle claims that it had inflated claims for construction contracts in Iraq.Bloomberg L.P., "DynCorp To Settle Over Claims For Iraq Work".

On October 11, 2007, a DynCorp security guard in a US State Department convoy killed a taxi driver in Baghdad. According to several witnesses, the taxi did not pose a threat to the security of the convoy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/world/middleeast/12contractor.html|title=Security Guard Fires From Convoy, Killing Iraqi Driver|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-17|first=James|last=Glanz[/tpl]

As a result, more than $2.5 billion in U.S. funds were vulnerable to waste and fraud, although SIGAR's Iraq reconstruction inspector noted that there was no indication that DynCorp had misspent any of the $2.5 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sigir.mil/publications/quarterlyreports/January2010.html |title=Quarterly Report from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction |publisher=Sigir.mil |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-12-03[/tpl]Capaccio, Tony.

===Mozambique incident===

On March 23, 2014, the Mozambican tax authorities seized 14 armoured personnel carriers belonging to DynCorp for violations of tax, customs, and export control laws.  DynCorp claimed to have built the vehicles as a part of a $173M project for the US Government, but the Mozambican authorities knew nothing about the effort and had not sanctioned the manufacture or transport of the vehicles in Mozambique.Armoured Vehicles Seized in Maputo (Portuguese)  The Mozambican Tax Authority impounded all of DynCorp’s armoured vehicles at the Port of Maputo until completion of an investigation into how the vehicles "entered the country, and how DynCorp began its Mozambican activities.”Tax Authority Threatens to Confiscate UN Armored Cars  The incident was sparked when DynCorp drove the armoured personnel carriers from South Africa into downtown Maputo and into the port, sparking public fears of an escalation of already tense security issues following growing violence that threatens the country’s fragile peace accords.
