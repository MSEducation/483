</ref> The most famous contribution of this manuscript was a novel proof that there is no [[Quintic equation|quintic formula]] – that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals.  Although [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] had already [[Abel-Ruffini theorem|proved the impossibility of a "quintic formula" by radicals]] in 1824 and [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois's methods led to deeper research in what is now called Galois theory. For example, one can use it to determine, for ''any'' polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.

==Contributions to mathematics==

From the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated May 29, 1832, two days before Galois's death:

Unsurprisingly, Galois's collected works amount to only some 60 pages, but within them are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics.See also:  Sophus Lie, "Influence de Galois sur le développement des mathématiques" in:  Évariste Galois, Oeuvres Mathématiques publiées en 1846 dans le Journal de Liouville (Sceaux, France:  Éditions Jacques Gabay, 1989), appendix pages 1–9. His work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel, another mathematician who died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap.

===Algebra===

While many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, it was Galois who was the first to use the word group (in French groupe) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory.  He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup.  He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup.  He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.
In his last letter to Chevalier and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:

===Galois theory===

Galois's most significant contribution to mathematics by far is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, or its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it to.

===Analysis===

Galois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions.
