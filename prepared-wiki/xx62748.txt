The Donglin Temple ([tpl]zh|s=[tpl]linktext|东|林|寺[/tpl]|t=東林寺|p=[tpl]linktext|Dōng|lín|sì[/tpl]|l=East Wood Temple[/tpl]) is a Buddhist monastery approximately [tpl]Convert|20|km|mi[/tpl] from Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, People's Republic of China. Built in 386 CE at the foot of Lushan by Hui-yuan, founder of the Pure Land Sect of Buddhism, it is well known for how long it has stood without collapsing.
The monastery reached its peak of influence during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), but was severely damaged during the Taiping Rebellion and was almost destroyed during the Republican period (1912–1949) of Chinese history. It currently houses a small community of monks supported by a small farming village in the immediate vicinity.
Various other places are named for the temple, including Donglin Academy 東林書院 and Tōrin-in 東林院.
