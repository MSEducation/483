[[2011 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles season]]

CATEGORIES: Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles seasons, 2011 NRL season by club

The 2011 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles season was the 62nd in the club's history. Coached by Des Hasler and co-captained by Jamie Lyon and Jason King, they competed in the National Rugby League (NRL) Telstra Premiership, and finished the regular season in second place (out of 16 teams). The Sea Eagles then qualified for the NRL grand final, in which they defeated the New Zealand Warriors, claiming the club's eighth first-grade premiership.

==Background==

Manly had finished eighth in the 2010 NRL season, barely qualifying for the finals series. They were defeated by the St George Illawarra Dragons in a qualifying final; the Dragons subsequently won the premiership. Manly lost four first-team players at the end of the season: first-choice halfback Trent Hodkinson, forwards Chris Bailey and Josh Perry, and utility back Ben Farrar. Joining the club were the unheralded Tim Robinson, Liam Foran and Daniel Harrison. Between them, only Foran had first-grade experience.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/des-hasler-isnt-saying-whether-brett-stewart-will-get-game-time-for-manly-against-the-warriors/story-e6frf3ou-1226012413933|title=Des Hasler isn't saying whether Brett Stewart will get game time for Manly against the Warriors|last=Otto|first=Tyson|date=26 February 2011|work=Fox Sports|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]
However, Manly's squad was boosted by the return of fullback Brett Stewart. After Manly had won the NRL premiership in 2008, Stewart missed all but six matches of the following two seasons with knee injuries and legal issues.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/its-been-a-long-road-but-stewart-is-back-where-he-belongs-20110320-1c2bw.html?skin=text-only|title=It's been a long road, but Stewart is back where he belongs|last=Walter|first=Brad|date=21 March 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]  Manly's season would also see the emergence of key youngsters such as halfback Daly Cherry-Evans, who would win the NRL's Dally M Rookie of the Year award,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/rookie-revs-up-with-another-daly-m-performance/story-e6frfgbo-1226144990261|title=Rookie revs up with another Daly M performance|last=Phelps|first=James|date=23 September 2011|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] and winger Will Hopoate, son of Manly's 1996 premiership-winner John, who would debut for New South Wales in the 2011 State of Origin series.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/hopoate-dreams-of-finals-glory-as-sabbatical-looms-20110911-1k4ct.html|title=Hopoate dreams of finals glory as sabbatical looms|last=Chammas|first=Michael|date=12 September 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]

==Season==

===Regular season===

In New Zealand, each of the Sea Eagles matches of the 2011 season were televised free-to-air by Māori Television on Monday nights, dubbed "Manly Night Football".
Manly opened their season with an 18–6 loss to the Melbourne Storm, their grand final opponents from 2007 and 2008. Daly Cherry-Evans made his first-grade debut as Manly's starting halfback, but was penalised for a "foot fault" when kicking a line dropout.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-match-report/storms-new-start-ends-well-20110312-1bsdb.html?skin=text-only|title=Storm's new start ends well|last=Hinds|first=Richard|date=13 March 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] The following week, Manly played the grand finalists from the previous season, the Sydney Roosters, without co-captains Jamie Lyon and Jason King, and Glenn Stewart and Steve Matai. Despite the losses of key players, the Sea Eagles scored their first win of the season, 27–16, thanks to performances from Cherry-Evans and his halves partner Kieran Foran that the ABC described as "outstanding".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-20/gutsy-sea-eagles-shock-roosters/2651540|title=Gutsy Sea Eagles shock Roosters|date=20 March 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] Manly won again the following weekend, defeating the Newcastle Knights 26–12. It was Manly's first match of the season at their home ground, Brookvale Oval. An aggressive physical performance from the Sea Eagles saw the Knights reduced to just 13 fit players by the second half, enough to put a full team on the field but with an empty substitutes bench.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-27/manly-beats-up-depleted-knights/2642548|title=Manly beats up depleted Knights|date=27 March 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]

Manly started the month of May with a home win over the lowly Canberra Raiders in which Brett Stewart scored his 99th, 100th and 101st tries for the Sea Eagles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-05-09/stewart-101-teaches-raiders-a-lesson/2706100?section=justin|title=Stewart 101 teaches Raiders a lesson|last=Maasdorp|first=James|date=10 May 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]  It was the first in a six-match winning streak, as Manly then defeated the Gold Coast, Brisbane, Canterbury, North Queensland and arch-rivals Parramatta.

Four Sea Eagles featured in the mid-season State of Origin series: Jason King, Anthony Watmough, Glenn Stewart, and, at the age of 19, William Hopoate, who scored a try in his first match for New South Wales and followed his father John in playing for both Manly and his state.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/will-hopoate-to-miss-state-of-origin-decider/story-e6frg7mf-1226076328461|title=Will Hopoate to miss State of Origin decider|last=Read|first=Brent|author2=McDonald, Margie|date=16 June 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] At the time, Hopoate announced that he would be leaving professional football at the end of the season to embark on a two-year mormon mission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/5107280/No-regrets-for-mormon-to-be-Hopoate|title=No regrets for mormon-to-be Will Hopoate|last=Jackson|first=Glenn|date=7 June 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]

The cost to Manly was an injury to their co-captain Jason King in the Roosters match. He would miss the remainder of the season with a torn pectoral muscle.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-08/sea-eagles-lose-king-for-season/2829614|title=Sea Eagles lose King for season|date=8 August 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]
King's loss was only the start of things to come for Manly. On Friday, 26 August 2011, Manly hosted the Melbourne Storm at Brookvale Oval for the penultimate match of the regular season. Melbourne was then on top of the NRL ladder and looking to secure the minor premiership; Manly was in second place. The two clubs had been rivals since they played 2007 and 2008 grand finals, winning one apiece. The one thing that united the club's fans was a mutual dislike for the NRL's chief executive David Gallop. Gallop had decided to strip Melbourne of its 2007 and 2009 premierships for salary cap breaches. He had also angered Manly by suspending Brett Stewart in 2009 for his behaviour at an official event; Stewart was charged with, and subsequently acquitted of, committing rape after the event. Gallop decided to attend the Friday night match, in front of a packed Brookvale Oval crowd of 20,059, leaving Manly to consider hiring security guards to protect him.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/security-for-david-gallop-at-brookvale/story-e6frg7mf-1226120765776|title=Security for David Gallop at Brookvale|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|date=24 August 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] The match that ensued earnt the name "The Battle of Brookvale". In the first half of the match, a skirmish broke out between Manly's Darcy Lussick and Melbourne's Ryan Hinchcliffe. A number of players joined the brawl, including Manly's Glenn Stewart and Melbourne's Adam Blair, who the referee decided to send to the sin bin. As Stewart and Blair left the field for their ten minutes on the sidelines, a fight broke out between them. A series of Manly and Melbourne players ran from the field and the sideline benches to join the fight, giving rise to a large brawl in front of Brookvale Oval's main stand. Stewart and Blair were both sent off for the remainder of the match, which Manly went on to win.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/battle-of-brookie-set-to-take-toll-on-big-guns-title-assault-20110826-1jeto.html|title=Battle of Brookie set to take toll on big guns' title assault|last=Jackson|first=Glenn|date=27 August 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] Manly suffered four suspensions arising from the match: Stewart and Lussick were suspended for three weeks each as the brawls' principal protagonists, while Foran and Stewart's brother Brett received lesser suspensions for their parts in the melee. Each club was fined $50,000 by the NRL. Gallop said after the match: "The sight of so many players from both teams fighting, of people running in and leaving the bench area, was an horrendous look for the game."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/live-stream-nrl-boss-david-gallop-delivers-his-verdict-on-friday-nights-battle-of-brookvale-between-manly-and-storm/story-e6frexnr-1226124470466|title=Manly Sea Eagles and Melbourne Storm fined $50,000 each and 10 players charged by NRL judiciary after 'Battle of Brookie'|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|date=29 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] The fallout from the match also claimed the scalp of Manly's long-serving media manager and former player Peter Peters, who was stood down and then sacked for making a sexist comment to a female reporter when leaving an NRL judiciary hearing for Glenn Stewart.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/national/national/sport/after-sexist-comment-peters-to-leave-manly/2281491.aspx|title=After sexist comment, Peters to leave Manly|last=Walter|first=Brad|date=5 September 2011|work=Newcastle Herald|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl] Meanwhile, Manly winger David Williams suffered a neck injury in the match that would end his season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10747888|title=NRL: Neck injury ends Williams' season|date=29 August 2011|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]
Manly thus fielded a depleted side for their final regular season match against the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium. Even though the Broncos won 18–10, Manly had already secured second place on the NRL ladder behind Melbourne; the Broncos finished third.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-04/lockyers-troops-hold-off-manly/2869950|title=Lockyer's troops hold off Manly|date=4 September 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]

====Ladder====

===Finals series===

Finishing second on the ladder gave Manly the comfort of knowing that they would not be eliminated from the finals series if they lost their opening match, and that if they won, they would move straight into the series' third and final week. Their opponents in the qualifying final were the North Queensland Cowboys. Manly were disappointed that their right to a "home final" could not be exercised at Brookvale Oval, where they had been undefeated during the regular season. The NRL forced Manly to play the match at the Sydney Football Stadium, in front of a crowd of only 13,972. Nonetheless, despite trailing the Cowboys at half-time, Manly scored 42 points in the second half to win 42–8.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-10/slick-sea-eagles-dump-cowboys/2880016|title=Slick Sea Eagles dump Cowboys|date=11 September 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]
Defeating the Cowboys put Manly one win away from the NRL grand final.  Their opponents in the preliminary final would be the Brisbane Broncos, who had defeated them three weeks earlier. Much of the focus in the week leading up to the match was on whether Brisbane's retiring captain and 355-game veteran would play after fracturing his cheekbone in the second week of the finals. Lockyer was initially named in the Brisbane team, but late in the week withdrew from the match. Lockyer's withdrawal made Manly the firm favourites,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/5666106/Extra-week-won-t-make-difference-for-Lockyer|title=Extra week won't make difference for Lockyer|last=Prichard|first=Greg|date=22 September 2011|work=TVNZ|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] and they won 26–14.[tpl]cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-league-news/manly-into-grand-final-4417762|title=Manly into grand final|date=24 September 2011|work=TVNZ|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]

===Grand final===

Manly's opponents for the grand final, held at Stadium Australia on 2 October, were the New Zealand Warriors, who had finished sixth on the NRL ladder. The Warriors had defeated the Melbourne Storm in the second qualifying final, ruining the chances of a "Battle of Brookvale" grand final re-match.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/5679278/Warriors-into-second-NRL-grand-final|title=Warriors into second NRL grand final|last=Lawton|first=Aaron|date=24 September 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] The Warriors were playing in their second first-grade grand final; it was Manly's 18th. Manly would also become the first club to play in grand finals in seven consecutive decades. Reflecting on this record, rugby league historian David Middleton said leading up to the match: "No other club has done what they have, it's a unique achievement."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/secret-to-manlys-decades-of-success/story-e6frg7mf-1226154450307|title=Secret to Manly's decades of success|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|date=1 October 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]
Manly fielded a near full strength team for the grand final. Ten of its 17-man squad had previous grand final experience. Glenn Stewart returned from his "Battle of Brookvale" suspension, while Jason King and David Williams were the only players missing through injury.  While the grand final was held in Sydney, Manly received little support from Sydneysiders other than their own fans.  Reflecting what the Irish Times observed from abroad was a long-standing "inherent hatred" for Manly, many Australians supported the foreign Warriors to win the match.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0930/1224304998326.html|title=Curiously, Aussies will be rooting for the New Zealand Warriors|last=Thornley|first=Gerry|date=30 September 2011|work=Irish Times|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]
The match was played in front of 81,988 spectators and, for the third year in a row, in the rain.  After a tight opening 30 minutes, the Warriors led 2–0.  However, Manly broke clear with two tries before half-time, the first to Brett Stewart and the second to Daly Cherry-Evans, one play after an audacious kick from forward Glenn Stewart in his own half allowed winger Michael Robertson to break free. Manly stretched its lead to 16 points after half-time following a try to Glenn Stewart, setup by a blind flick pass from William Hopoate as he was pushed out of play. The Warriors scored two unconverted tries in the final fifteen minutes to narrow the deficit to eight points; however, Manly held onto its lead and celebrated victory with a try to captain Jamie Lyon in the final minute of play. The final score was 24–10. Glenn Stewart was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the player of the match.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-02/hasler-praises-churchill-winner-stewart/3206062/?site=sport&section=all?site=sport&section=rugbyleague|title=Hasler praises Churchill winner Stewart|date=2 October 2011|work=ABC Sport|accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl]

Two Manly players were recognised in the official Dally M Awards for the NRL season.  Daly Cherry-Evans was named the best rookie in the league, for a season in which he started at half-back in every single match. Steve Menzies was the last Manly player to have won the award, in 1994.  Jamie Lyon was named in the NRL's team of the season, as the league's best centre.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-06/slater-claims-dally-m-medal/2874032|title=Slater claims Dally M Medal|date=7 September 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]

==Post-season turmoil and sacking of Des Hasler==

Even as Manly was still celebrating its grand final victory, it was struggling to hold on to some of its key people.  One winger, Michael Robertson had already decided to leave the club to play in England in 2012. Barely days after the grand final, the other grand final winger, star rookie Will Hopoate, signed to play for the Parramatta Eels upon his return from a two-year Mormon mission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/parramatta-eels-to-gain-manly-sea-eagles-prodigy-will-hopoate-but-could-lose-up-to-seven-stars/story-e6frexnr-1226160756115|title=Parramatta Eels to gain Manly Sea Eagles prodigy Will Hopoate but could lose up to seven stars|last=Nicolussi|first=Christian|date=7 October 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]
Hopoate's loss was shortly followed by that of the club's head coach, Des Hasler. Hasler had won two premierships with the club in a long playing career (in 1987 and 1996), and two as the club's coach (in 2008 and 2011). Speculation about Hasler's future had been building in the weeks leading up to the grand final, but he appeared to quash the rumours by announcing after the match that he would be at Manly for 2012, the last year of his contract. However, within days, Hasler signed an agreement to coach the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs from 2013. He agreed with Manly's board to remain as Manly's head coach for 2012, while the club would appoint Hasler's assistant Geoff Toovey from 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/des-hasler-deserts-manly-sea-eagles-signs-with-canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/story-fn2mcuj6-1226161000250|title=Des Hasler deserts Manly Sea Eagles, signs with rival NRL club Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|date=7 October 2011|work=Fox Sports|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl]
Within the following weeks, a series of Manly staff followed Hasler in signing for the Bulldogs, including the club's recruitment manager and former premiership-winner Noel Cleal, who cited "factional infighting" as his reason for leaving.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/i-was-driven-out-by-infighting-and-backstabbing-says-cleal/story-e6frg7mf-1226191885686|title=I was driven out by infighting and backstabbing, says Cleal|last=Kogoy|first=Peter|date=11 November 2011|work=The Australian|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] In early November, the Manly board suspended Hasler from his duties, alleging that he had been trying to entice fellow Manly staff to defect to the Bulldogs, which the board considered amounted to "serious breaches" of Hasler's employment contract. Ultimately, on 11 November, less than six weeks after winning the premiership, the board terminated Hasler's contract and immediately appointed Toovey as his successor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-11/manly-cuts-ties-with-hasler/3660488/?site=melbourne|title=Manly cuts ties with Hasler|date=11 November 2011|work=ABC News|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sportal.com.au/league-news-display/hasler-sacked-147137|title=Hasler sacked|last=Buttigieg|first=Luke|date=11 November 2011|work=Sportal|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] Hasler initially threatened to sue Manly for the termination of his contract; Manly's chairman Scott Penn claimed in response that the club had "verbal and email evidence that he was involved in coercing staff to leave".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/its-on-hasler-penn-take-the-gloves-off-20111111-1nbjw.html|title=It's on: Hasler, Penn take the gloves off|last=Prichard|first=Greg|date=12 November 2011|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] The 82-year-old former Manly player, coach and club secretary Ken Arthurson said: "To do what Hasler has done is beyond the pale".
