Wipeout is a racing series that features vehicles that hover over futuristic racetracks. Power-ups (or "pick-ups") are available and come in offensive ("weapon") and defensive ("item") varieties.

==History==

The Wipeout franchise began with the release of the original Wipeout in 1995. Three more Wipeout games were released by the end of the decade, all developed by Liverpool-based developer Psygnosis. In 1999, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe acquired Psygnosis and its intellectual property, including Wipeout. As part of the acquisition, the name "Psygnosis" was changed to "SCE Studio Liverpool". After the acquisition, the titles to follow experienced drastic changes in physics and gameplay - many core fans of the series believe the series hit near perfection with Wipeout XL / 2097. Five more Wipeout games were developed, two on the PlayStation 2, two for the PlayStation Portable, a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3 - Wipeout HD (which is also available on Blu-ray disc packaged with the Fury expansion), and a launch title for the PlayStation Vita - Wipeout 2048. Sony Liverpool had been working on a Wipeout game for the upcoming PlayStation 4 console when the studio was closed on 22 August 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-22-sources-sony-liverpool-was-working-on-wipeout-ps4-and-a-splinter-cell-style-game-for-ps4|title=Sony Liverpool was working on WipEout PS4 and a Splinter Cell style game for PS4|publisher=Eurogamer|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012[/tpl]
A Wipeout "arcade" game was also featured in the 1995 movie "Hackers". The actual game footage was pre-rendered CGI and the actors merely pretended they were playing the game.

==Influence==

With its use of music by contemporary electronica artists and strong, unique design elements, the series was at the forefront of the drive to make video games appealing to adults, specifically the 20-30 age group. The first game was considered a 'killer app' for the Playstation and instrumental in the tremendous success of the console.
