RCMP Academy, Depot Division (commonly known as "Depot", [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|p|oʊ[/tpl] not [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|p|oʊ[/tpl]) has been providing police training to Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) "cadets" since its establishment in 1885. The facility is located in the west part of Regina, Saskatchewan, near the airport, and consists of several buildings.

==History==

In the RCMP's early days, Depot had a full horse stable and employed veterinarians. Horsemanship is no longer part of the cadets' training since 1966, and the few horses still at the Academy are for ceremonial purposes only.
Depot is the only location where the RCMP trains its cadets. The only possible rare exceptions are Mounties trained at an Ottawa region facility in the 1950s or 1960s. A small number of members had part of their training at CFB Penhold in Alberta as well in the early 70s. At that time, due to extensive hiring, Depot could not handle the overwhelming number of candidates. Therefore, the RCMP established the additional training facility in Ontario. This training centre, now closed, was located by the present Ottawa RCMP stables, where the horses of the RCMP Musical Ride are kept off-season. The buildings of the former Ottawa training centre have become the Canadian Police College, a Canadian government institution which offers continuing-education courses for currently employed police officers.
In addition to training new RCMP regular members, Depot has also been a major continuing-education centre for police in Canada, but is currently tasked primarily with the training of new members and other training is conducted elsewhere. It delivers updated and highly specialized training to experienced RCMP officers and to members of other forces from around the world who want to improve their knowledge.
Many Canadian municipal and provincial police forces hire police officers who graduated from the RCMP Academy. No one can join the RCMP as a regular member without completing the RCMP Academy's 24-week Cadet Training Program. Candidates who are graduates of the Ontario Police College or other such institution must undergo the complete RCMP training before transferring to the RCMP. However on occasion the RCMP will hire members from municipal police forces, those new members undergo a compressed version of cadet training, lasting weeks instead of months.
The RCMP Academy has altered its curriculum due to the social and economic changes of Canadian society; the school now focuses more on knowledge relating to the multiple facets of law enforcement than on military discipline. In the early 1990s, the six-month thorough military-style RCMP training was slightly modified to face the new make-up of trainees. Cadets are now 10 years older than their 1950s or 1960s counterparts; and decade after decade, the ratio of college and university-educated future Mounties keeps increasing. The higher maturity level of trainees requires fewer disciplinary actions and enables the instructors to focus on the very demanding requirements of modern police work.
As of June 16, 2008, cadets at the RCMP Academy receive a weekly allowance of $500 to a maximum of $12,000 for the entire 24-week Cadet Training Program.
After the recruitment process, successful candidates are scheduled to attend the Academy and begin the Cadet Training Program. Cadets are grouped together in what the force calls "troops". A troop consists of a maximum of 32 men and women who follow their entire 24-week training together. The number of trainees at Depot varies in relation to the demands of the force.

==Buildings at Depot==

===The Chapel===

The oldest remaining building in Regina is the RCMP chapel, dating from the earliest establishment of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) as a guardhouse in 1883. It subsequently served as a mess hall and canteen and became a chapel in 1895. It was constructed in Ontario and moved by flat-car, steamer and ox team to Regina.
The chapel was built by Mr. John Ross, a local building contractor.  Originally a Mess Hall it was partially destroyed by fire in the spring of 1895.  After its restoration it was converted to a chapel.
The wife of the police commissioner, Mrs. Herchmer, wanted a chapel for the force members, who were located two miles (3 km) west of town. NWMP carpenters converted the mess hall to a chapel, making the altar and pews themselves. The chapel was dedicated on December 8, 1895.
The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the RCMP Museum Chapel.Stained glass at the RCMP Museum Chapel http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=81 On each side of the altar is a stained glass memorial window, each portrays a member of the force.  On the left is a constable in mourning; on the right is a trumpeter sounding reveille. The model for the windows was Constable Roy Fraser of Westville, Nova Scotia in 1943.  Fraser retired in the fall of 1978. The Memorial Project came about following the shooting of Constable Willis Edward Rhodeniser on the White Bear Reserve near Carlyle, Saskatchewan on August 26, 1939. Two more stained glass memorial windows on each side wall near the front were dedicated on November 4, 1951.  "The Resurrection" in the west window honours serving members and "The Nativity" in the east window honours ex-members of the force who gave their lives in World War II.
The chapel is one of the oldest Anglican houses of worship in the Northwest.
