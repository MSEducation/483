[[Symbiotic star]]

#REDIRECT Symbiotic nova

A star system, most usually a cataclysmic variable (interacting binary) indicated by exhibition of spectral lines of highly contrasting temperatures such as those typical of a late-sequence red giant or supergiant (~3000°K) and a dwarf companion star (~20 000°K), whose mass characteristics and proximity trigger nova-like outbursts. The transfer of mass between the pair occurs either by gravitational streaming or as stellar wind from the giant secondary star.
