The London Underground (also known as the Tube or simply the Underground) is a public metro system serving a large part of Greater London and parts of the counties of Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Essex. The system serves 270 stations and has [tpl]convert|402|km|mi[/tpl] of track, 55 per cent of which is above ground. The network incorporates the world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 and is now part of the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines; and the first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, now part of the Northern line.[tpl]sfnp|Wolmar|2004|p=135[/tpl] The network has expanded to 11 lines, and in 2012/13 carried over 1 billion passengers.
The system's first tunnels were built just below the surface using the cut and cover method. Later, circular tunnels – which give rise to its nickname the Tube – were dug through the London Clay at a deeper level. The early lines were marketed as the UNDERGROUND in the early 20th century on maps and signs at central London stations. The private companies that owned and ran the railways were merged in 1933 to form the London Passenger Transport Board. The current operator, London Underground Limited (LUL), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for most elements of the transport network in Greater London.
[tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], 91 per cent of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/tfl-annualreport-2012.pdf |title=Annual Report and Statement of Accounts 2011/12 |publisher=TfL |pages=71, 74 |quote=Fares revenue on LU was £1,981m... Operating expenditure on the Underground increased by 6.2 per cent to £2,178m |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl] The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster, an electronic ticketing system, in 2003.
Today in official publicity and in general, the term 'Tube' embraces the whole Underground system, not just the lines that run in deep-level tunnels.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|loc = Preface[/tpl] The schematic Tube map, designed by Harry Beck in 1931, was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other lines - the Docklands Light Railway and London Overground - as well as the non-rail Emirates Air Line. London Underground celebrated 150 years of operations in 2013, with various events marking the milestone.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20641351 |title= Oyster card celebrates 150th Tube anniversary |work=BBC News |date=10 December 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with some of the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=8[/tpl] and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854.[tpl]sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=19[/tpl] The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=8, 14[/tpl] It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service.[tpl]sfnp|Simpson|2003|p=16[/tpl] The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground 'inner circle' connecting London's main-line termini.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=18–24[/tpl]  The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=27–28[/tpl] built using the cut and cover method.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=10–11[/tpl] Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=26[/tpl] Uxbridge,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=33[/tpl] Richmond and Wimbledon[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=26[/tpl] and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as [tpl]rws|Verney Junction[/tpl] in Buckinghamshire, more than [tpl]convert|50|mi[/tpl] from Baker Street and the centre of London.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=32[/tpl]
For the first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, two [tpl]convert|10|ft|2|in[/tpl] diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Stockwell, under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows, nicknamed padded cells.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=40–45[/tpl] The Waterloo and City Railway opened in 1898,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=50–51[/tpl] followed by the Central London Railway in 1900, known as the "twopenny tube".[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=52–56[/tpl] These two ran electric trains in circular tunnels having diameters between [tpl]convert|11|ft|8|in[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|12|ft|2|in[/tpl],[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=50, 53[/tpl] whereas the Great Northern and City Railway, which opened in 1904, was built to take main line trains from Finsbury Park to a Moorgate terminus in the City and had [tpl]convert|16|ft[/tpl] diameter tunnels.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=60–61[/tpl]
In the early 20th century, the District and Metropolitan railways needed to electrify and a joint committee recommended an AC system, the two companies co-operating because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. The District, needing to raise the finance necessary, found an investor in the American Charles Yerkes who favoured a DC system similar to that in use on the City & South London and Central London railways. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=62–63[/tpl] Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and established the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in 1902 to finance and operate three tube lines, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (Hampstead) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, (Piccadilly), which all opened between 1906 and 1907.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=69–72, 78[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=30[/tpl] When the 'Bakerloo' was so named in July 1906, The Railway Magazine called it an undignified "gutter title".[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=30[/tpl] By 1907 the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|pp=24–28[/tpl]
A joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century included maps, joint publicity, through ticketing and UNDERGROUND signs outside stations in Central London.[tpl]sfnp|Horne|2003|p=51[/tpl] The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen's Park to join a new electric line from Euston to Watford, but World War I delayed construction and trains reached [tpl]rws|Watford Junction[/tpl] in 1917. During air raids in 1915 people used the tube stations as shelters.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=35[/tpl] An extension of the Central line east to Ealing was also delayed by the war and completed in 1920.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=33[/tpl] After the war government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network and the tunnels of the City and South London and Hampstead railways were linked at Euston and Kennington,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=94[/tpl] although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=122[/tpl] The Metropolitan promoted housing estates near the railway with the "Metro-land" brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line. Electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth, and branches opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925 and from Wembley Park to Stanmore in 1932.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=84–88[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Jackson|1986|pp=134, 137[/tpl] The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=98–103, 111[/tpl]

===London Transport===

In 1933, London's underground railways, tramway and bus operators were merged to form the London Passenger Transport Board, which became known as London Transport,[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=110[/tpl] and Harry Beck's diagrammatic tube map appeared for the first time.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=46[/tpl] The outlying lines of the former Metropolitan Railway closed, the Brill Tramway in 1935, and the line from Quainton Road to Verney Junction in 1936.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=118[/tpl] The 1935–40 New Works Programme included the extension of the Central and Northern lines and the Bakerloo line to take over the Metropolitan's Stanmore branch.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=116[/tpl] World War II suspended these plans after the Bakerloo line had reached Stanmore and the Northern line High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1941.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=131, 133–134[/tpl] During the war many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=135–136[/tpl] Following bombing in 1940 passenger services over the West London Line were suspended, leaving Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service until a District line shuttle from Earl's Court began after the war.[tpl]sfnp|Horne|2006| p=73[/tpl] After work restarted on the Central line extensions in east and west London, these were complete in 1949.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=144–145[/tpl] After Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948 the reconstruction of the main line railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the pre-war New Works Programme were shelved or postponed.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=54[/tpl]
However, the District line needed new trains and an unpainted aluminium train entered service in 1953, this becoming the standard for new trains.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|pp=56–57[/tpl] In the early 1960s the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, British Rail providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and Aylesbury.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=56[/tpl] The Victoria line was dug under central London and, unlike the earlier tubes, the tunnels did not follow the roads above. The line opened in 1968–71 with the trains being driven automatically and magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates gave access to the platforms.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=160–162, 166–168, 171[/tpl] In 1976 the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the main line railway at Finsbury Park.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|pp=55–56[/tpl]
In 1979 another new tube, the Jubilee line, named in honour of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee, took over the Stanmore branch from the Bakerloo line[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=178–181[/tpl] and was extended through to the Docklands in 1999.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=206–211[/tpl] Under the control of the Greater London Council, London Transport introduced a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare in 1981. Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained, and in the mid-1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|pp=65–66[/tpl] To comply with new safety regulations issued as a result of the King's Cross fire and to combat graffiti a train refurbishment project was launched in July 1991.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=193–194[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=474–476[/tpl] In 1984 control of London Buses and the London Underground passed to London Regional Transport (LRT), which reported directly to Secretary of State for Transport.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=186–187[/tpl] One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction until the 1980s.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=468[/tpl]
In the early years of the 21st century London Underground was reorganised in a Public-Private Partnership where private infrastructure companies (infracos) upgraded and maintained the railway. In 2003 control passed to Transport for London (TfL) that had been opposed to the arrangement.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=212–214[/tpl] One infraco went into administration in 2007 and TfL took over the responsibilities, TfL taking over the other in 2010.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=215, 221[/tpl] Electronic ticketing in the form of the contact-less Oyster card was introduced in 2003.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=216[/tpl] The East London line closed in 2007 so that it could be converted into a London Overground line,[tpl]sfnp|Rose|2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8620188.stm |title=East London line officially opens |date=27 April 2010 |work=BBC News |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl] and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7926242.stm |title=Circle Line extended to the west |work=BBC News |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=24 November 2011[/tpl]

==Transport for London==

Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for London's transport system. It replaced London Regional Transport. It assumed control of London Underground Limited in July 2003.[tpl]cite web |url= http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/history/1606.aspx |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OSaTlVSc |deadurl=no | archivedate=30 March 2014 |title=Milestones |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl] TfL is part of the Greater London Authority and is constituted as a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules. It has three subsidiaries: London Transport Insurance (Guernsey) Ltd, TfL Trustee Company Ltd and Transport Trading Ltd (TTL), and London Underground Limited is a subsidiary of TTL.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/tfl-subsidiary-organisation.pdf | title=TfL Subsidiary Company Structure | publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122190444/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/tfl-subsidiary-organisation.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014[/tpl]
The TfL Board is appointed by the Mayor of London. The Mayor also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London. However the day-to-day running of the corporation is left to the Commissioner of Transport for London. The current Commissioner is Peter Hendy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/1434.aspx|title=Chief Officers|publisher=Transport for London|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122084924/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/1434.aspx|archivedate=22 January 2014[/tpl] The Mayor is responsible for producing an integrated transport strategy for London and for consulting the GLA, TfL, local councils and others on the strategy. The Mayor is also responsible for setting TfL's budget. The GLA is consulted on the Mayor's transport strategy, and inspects and approves the Mayor's budget. It is able to summon the Mayor and senior staff to account for TfL's performance. London TravelWatch, a body appointed by and reporting to the Assembly, deals with complaints about transport in London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/home/about_us|title=About|publisher=London TravelWatch|accessdate=12 February 2011[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

===Railway===

The Underground serves 270 stations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1574.aspx |title=London Underground |publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122075359/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1574.aspx |archivedate=22 January 2014[/tpl] Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five (Amersham, Chalfont & Latimer, Chesham, and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line, and Epping on the Central line), are beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway. Of the 32 London boroughs, six (Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton) are not served by the Underground network, while Hackney has Old Street and Manor House only just inside its boundaries.
London Underground's eleven lines total [tpl]convert|402|km|mi[/tpl] in length, making it the fourth longest metro system in the world. These are made up of the sub-surface network and the deep-tube lines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1608.aspx |title=London Underground: Key Facts |publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140209144726/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1608.aspx |archivedate=9 February 2014[/tpl] The Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan lines form the sub-surface network, with railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith & City and Circle lines share stations and most of their track with each other, as well as with the Metropolitan and District lines. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels (tubes) with a diameter about [tpl]convert|11|ft|8|in[/tpl]. These lines have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with London Overground services north of Queen's Park.[tpl]cite web |url= http://carto.metro.free.fr/cartes/metro-london/ |title=Detailed London Transport Map |accessdate=1 December 2012 |work=carto.metro.free.fr[/tpl] Fifty-five per cent of the system runs on the surface, and there are [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] of cut-and-cover tunnel and [tpl]convert|93|mi[/tpl] of tube tunnel. Many of the central London underground stations on deep-level tube lines are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 33, 38, 81[/tpl] Trains generally run on the left-hand track, although in some places the tunnels are above each other, for example the Central line east of St Paul's station, or the running tunnels are on the right, for example on the Victoria line between Warren Street and King's Cross St. Pancras to allow cross-platform interchange with the Northern line between northbound and southbound trains at Euston.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=327–328[/tpl]
The lines are electrified with a four-rail DC system: a conductor rail between the rails is energised at −210 V and a rail outside the running rails at +420 V, giving a potential difference of 630 V. On the sections of line shared with mainline trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails.[tpl]cite book |author=Martin, Andrew |title=Underground, Overground: A Passenger's History of the Tube |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=vh3n5WD_YqsC&pg=PT137 |accessdate=7 December 2012 |date=26 April 2012 |publisher=Profile Books |isbn=978-1-84765-807-4 |pages=137–138 |location =London[/tpl]

===Trains===

London Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1612.aspx | title=Rolling Stock | publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122172719/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1612.aspx | archivedate=17 March 2013[/tpl] Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been electric multiple units with sliding doors[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=159[/tpl] and a train last ran with a guard in 2000.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=205[/tpl]  All lines use fixed length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo & City line that uses four cars.[tpl]cite web | archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131004231025/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf | title=Rolling Stock Data Sheet | publisher=Transport for London | date=March 2007 | archivedate=4 October 2013|url=//www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/foi/Rolling_stock_Data_Sheet_2nd_Edition.pdf[/tpl] New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars and have regenerative braking and public address systems.[tpl]cite news|title=Deep tube transformation|last=Connor|first=Piers|work=Modern Railways|date=January 2013|pages=44–47[/tpl] Since 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls.

Stock on sub-surface lines is identified by a letter (such as S Stock, used on the Metropolitan line), while tube stock is identified by the year of intended introduction[tpl]sfnp|Hardy|2002|p=6[/tpl] (for example, 1996 Stock, used on the Jubilee line).

===Ventilation and cooling===

When the Bakerloo line opened in 1906 it was advertised with a maximum temperature of [tpl]convert|60|F|disp=flip[/tpl], but over time the tube tunnels have warmed up. In 1938 approval was given for a ventilation improvement programme, and a refrigerating unit was installed in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253–254[/tpl] More recently, temperatures of [tpl]convert|47|°C|°F[/tpl] were reported in the 2006 European heat wave.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm |title=Baking hot at Baker Street |work=BBC News |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2013 |last= Griffiths |first= Emma[/tpl] It was pointed out in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1405628/Londons-Tube-unfit-for-animals.html |title=London's Tube 'unfit for animals' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl] A 2000 study reported that air quality was seventy-three times worse than at street level, with a passenger breathing the same mass of particulates during a twenty minute journey on the Northern line as smoking a cigarette.[tpl]cite web | url=http://128.40.58.147/web/ben/Tube.htm | title=Environmental Quality in Underground Railways | publisher=University College London | date=4 December 2003 | accessdate=5 November 2013 | author=Croxford, Ben[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.standard.co.uk/news/passengers-choke-on-the-tube-6304049.html |title= Passengers choke on the Tube |work=London Evening Standard |author=Murray, Dick |date=23 August 2002 |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] The main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels,[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=253–254[/tpl] and fans across the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night.[tpl]cite web |url= http://lurs.org.uk/documents/pdf%2008/jan/jan%20MEETING%20REPORT.pdf |title=Meeting Report: Cooling the tube |date=8 May 2007 |author1=Westgate, Stuart |author2=Gilby, Mark |publisher=LURS |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]
In June 2006 a groundwater cooling system was installed at Victoria station.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5058362.stm |title=Water pump plan to cool the Tube |work=BBC News |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] In 2012, air-cooling units  were installed on platforms at Green Park station using cool deep groundwater and at Oxford Circus using chiller units at the top of an adjacent building.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/22885.aspx |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OSajLoBd |deadurl=no | archivedate=30 March 2014 |title=Work begins to cool the platforms at two major central London stations |publisher=Transport for London |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl] New air-conditioned trains are being introduced on the sub-surface lines, but space is limited on tube trains for air-conditioning units and these would heat the tunnels even more. The Deep Tube Programme, investigating replacing the trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, is looking for trains with better energy conservation and regenerative braking, on which it might be possible to install a form of air-conditioning.

Originally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=26, 35, 39, 87–89[/tpl] Each lift was manned, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=540[/tpl] The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542[/tpl] The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=59[/tpl] In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=154, 546[/tpl] Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them at the end would have an extra section of moving stairway.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article6883065.ece |title= Mystery over Tube escalator etiquette cleared up by restored film |last=Malvern |first=Jack |date=21 October 2009 |work=The Times |location=London[/tpl] [tpl]Subscription required[/tpl] The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common.[tpl]sfnp|Croome|Jackson|1993|pp=114, 542[/tpl] In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|p=93[/tpl]
There are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest, at [tpl]convert|60|m[/tpl], is at Angel. The shortest, at Stratford, gives a vertical rise of [tpl]convert|4.1|m[/tpl]. There are 164 lifts, and numbers have increased in recent years due to a programme to increase accessibility.

===Wi-Fi and mobile phone reception===

In summer 2012 London Underground, in partnership with Virgin Media, tried out Wi-Fi hot spots in many stations, but not in the tunnels, that allowed passengers free internet access. The free trial proved successful and was extended to the end of 2012[tpl]cite news |work= Metro |location= London |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/915263-virgin-media-extends-free-wi-fi-on-london-underground-until-2013 |title=Virgin Media extends free wi-fi on London Underground until 2013 |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012[/tpl] whereupon it switched to a service freely available to subscribers to Virgin Media and others, or as a paid-for service.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/23939.aspx |title=Station Wifi |publisher= Transport for London |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Even without subscribing to paid-for Wi-Fi services, the free signals can be used by smartphones to alert a traveller that they have arrived at a specific station.[tpl]cite news |url= https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuberelax |title= Tube Relax (London):Have you ever missed your tube stops? |newspaper=Google Play|date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014 |author=Lei W|location =London[/tpl] It is not currently possible to use mobile phones underground, and a project to extend the network before the 2012 Olympics was abandoned due to commercial and technical difficulties.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/apr/01/mobile-network-london-underground-shelved |title=Plans for mobile network on London underground shelved |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2013 |author=Mulholland, Hélène |location =London[/tpl]

==Proposed improvements and expansions==

===New lines===

Crossrail is under construction and expected to open in 2018, providing a new underground route across central London integrated with, but not part of the London Underground system.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Crossrail |accessdate=6 February 2013 |title=A World-Class new railway for London and the South-East |url= http://www.crossrail.co.uk/benefits/[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Crossrail business case - Summary Report |publisher=Crossrail |url= http://www.crossrail.co.uk/assets/download/857 |date=July 2010 |accessdate=6 February 2013 |page=6[/tpl] Two options are being considered for the route of Crossrail 2 on a north-south alignment across London, with hopes that it could be open by 2033.[tpl]cite web |url= http://londonfirst.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/LF_CROSSRAIL2_REPORT_AW_Single_Pages.pdf |title=Crossrail 2: Supporting London's growth |publisher=London First |date=February 2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013[/tpl]

===Line extensions===

====Croxley Rail Link====

The Croxley Rail Link involves re-routing the Metropolitan line's Watford branch from the current terminus at Watford over part of the disused Croxley Green branch line to [tpl]rws|Watford Junction[/tpl] with stations at Cassiobridge, Watford Vicarage Road and [tpl]rws|Watford High Street[/tpl].

====Northern line extension to Battersea====

It is planned that the Northern line be extended to Battersea with an intermediate station at Nine Elms. In December 2012, the Treasury confirmed that it will provide a guarantee that allows the Greater London Authority to borrow up to £1 billion from the Public Works Loan Board, at a preferential rate, to finance the construction of the line.[tpl]cite news |title= Boost for Battersea as Osborne puts power station on the Tube |url= http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/boost-for-battersea-as-osborne-puts-power-station-on-the-tube-8386471.html |work=London Evening Standard |author=Murphy, Joe |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] In April 2013, Transport for London applied for the legal powers of a Transport and Works Act Order to proceed with the extension, with a decision expected in the summer of 2013. The stations could open in 2020.[tpl]cite web |year=2013 |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/21614.aspx |title=Northern line extension |publisher=Transport for London |archivedate=3 December 2013 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131203032025/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/21614.aspx[/tpl]

====Bakerloo line extension to Camberwell====

In 1931 the extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Camberwell was approved, with stations at Albany Road and an interchange at [tpl]stnlnk|Denmark Hill[/tpl]. However, with post-war austerity, the plan was abandoned. In 2006 Ken Livingstone, the then Mayor of London, announced that within twenty years Camberwell would have a tube station.[tpl]cite news |url= http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0300southwark/tm_objectid=16685898&method=full&siteid=50100&headline=tube-line--may-extend-south-within-20-years--name_page.html |title=Tube line 'may extend south within 20 years' |last=Rhys |first=Paul |date=10 February 2006 |work=ICSouthLondon |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060411184429/http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0300southwark/tm_objectid=16685898&method=full&siteid=50100&headline=tube-line--may-extend-south-within-20-years--name_page.html |archivedate = 11 April 2006[/tpl] Transport for London has indicated that extensions, possibly to Camberwell, could play a part in the future transport strategy for South London over the coming years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.camberwellonline.co.uk/2006/02/camberwell-tube-station-in-2026/ |title=CamberwellOnline Blog » Camberwell Tube Station in 2026? |publisher=Camberwellonline.co.uk |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=1 December 2013[/tpl] However, no such planning of an extension has been revealed. There have also been many other proposals to extend the line to Streatham, Lewisham, and even beyond Lewisham, taking over the suburban Hayes line via Catford Bridge to relieve some capacity on the suburban rail network.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

====Central line extension to Uxbridge====

The London Borough of Hillingdon has proposed that the Central line be extended from West Ruislip to Uxbridge via Ickenham, claiming this would cut traffic on the A40 in the area.[tpl]cite news |title= Extending Central line to Uxbridge will cut traffic |work= Uxbridge Gazette |date=17 June 2011 |author=Coombs, Dan |url= http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/local-uxbridge-news/2011/06/17/extending-central-line-to-uxbridge-will-cut-traffic-113046-28897325/ |accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl]

===Infrastructure===

The signalling system on the Northern line is being replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20 per cent by the end of 2014.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20130717210843/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/our-upgrade-plan-leaflet.pdf |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/our-upgrade-plan-leaflet.pdf |title=Upgrade plan (leaflet) |date= 17 July 2013 |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=2 March 2013 |archivedate=17 July 2013 [/tpl] Capacity can be increased further if the operation of the Charing Cross and Bank branches are separated.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18091.aspx |title=Northern line upgrade |publisher=Transport for London|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122171934/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18091.aspx |archivedate=22 January 2014[/tpl]
New S Stock trains are being introduced on the sub-surface (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and Circle) lines, and the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme to increase peak-hour capacity, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2018.[tpl]cite news |work=Modern Railways |date=January 2013 |pages=38–41 |title=Sub-surface renewal |last=Abbott |first=James[/tpl] A control room for the sub-surface network has been built in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system is to replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.

==Travelling==

===Ticketing===

The Underground uses Transport for London's zonal fare system to calculate fares. There are nine zones, zone 1 being the central zone, which includes the loop of the Circle line with a few stations to the south of River Thames. The only London Underground stations in Zones 7 to 9 are on the Metropolitan line beyond Moor Park, outside Greater London. Some stations are in two zones, and the cheapest fare applies.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20140122082038/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf |title=London Rail & Tube Services Map |publisher=Transport for London |date=December 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2014 |archivedate=22 January 2014 [/tpl] Paper tickets or the contactless Oyster card can be used for travel.

===Accessibility===

Accessibility by people with limited mobility was not considered when most of the system was built, and before 1993 fire regulations prohibited wheelchairs on the underground. The stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, opened in 2000, were designed for accessibility, but retrofitting accessibility features to the older stations is a major investment that is planned to take over twenty years.[tpl]cite web |url= http://disabilityhorizons.com/2011/07/the-london-underground-an-accessible-future/ |title=The London Underground – An accessible future? |date=24 July 2011 |publisher=disability horizons |accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl] A 2010 London Assembly Report concluded that over ten per cent of the people of London had reduced mobility,[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2010|p=11[/tpl] and with an ageing population, numbers will increase in the future.[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2010|p=9[/tpl]
TfL produces a version of the tube map that indicates stations that are step-free from street to platforms. There can also be a step from platform to train as large as [tpl]convert|12|in[/tpl] and a gap between the train and curved platforms, and these distances are marked on the map. Access from platform to train at some stations can be assisted using a boarding ramp operated by staff, and a section has been raised on some platforms to reduce the step.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/step-free-tube-guide-map.pdf |title=Step free tube guide |publisher=Transport for London|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140126145814/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/step-free-tube-guide-map.pdf |date=December 2012 |archivedate=26 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/1169.aspx|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140226055417/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/1169.aspx |title=Transport Accessiblity: Tube |publisher=Transport for London |archivedate=26 February 2014[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2012|12[/tpl] there are 66 stations with step-free access from platform to train,[tpl]sfnp|TfL|2012|p=9[/tpl] and there are plans to provide step-free access at another 28 in ten years.[tpl]sfnp|TfL|2012|p=16[/tpl] By 2016 a third of stations are to have platform humps that reduce the step from platform to train.[tpl]sfnp|TfL|2012|p=18[/tpl] New trains, such as those being introduced on the sub-surface network, have access and room for wheelchairs, improved audio and visual information systems and accessible door controls.[tpl]sfnp|TfL|2012|p=18[/tpl]

===Delays and overcrowding===

During peak hours, stations can get so crowded they need to be closed. Passengers may not get on the first train[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2009|p=55[/tpl] and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmtran/201/201.pdf |title=Overcrowding on  Public Transport |publisher=House of Commons Transport Committee |date=17 September 2003 |page=17 |accessdate=2 April 2013[/tpl] some trains having more than four passengers every square metre.[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2009|p=12[/tpl] When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health.[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2009|p=13[/tpl] Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 per cent since 2004/5.[tpl]sfnp|LA Transport Committee|2011|pp=22–23[/tpl]

==Design and the arts==

===Map===

Early maps of the Metropolitan and District railways were city maps with the lines superimposed,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=21, 28–30[/tpl] and the District published a pocket map in 1897.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=51[/tpl] A Central London Railway route diagram appears on a 1904 postcard and 1905 poster,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=52–53, 56[/tpl] similar maps appearing in District Railway cars in 1908.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=93[/tpl] In the same year, following a marketing agreement between the operators, a joint central area map that included all the lines was published.See a copy on commons[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=91[/tpl] A new map was published in 1921 without any background details, but the central area was squashed, requiring smaller letters and arrows.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=142[/tpl] Harry Beck had the idea of  expanding this central area, distorting geography, and simplifying the map so that the railways appeared as straight lines with equally spaced stations. He presented his original draft in 1931, and after initial rejection it was first printed in 1933. Today's tube map is an evolution of that original design, and the ideas are used by many metro systems around the world.[tpl]cite web |title =Design Classics: Harry Beck |publisher=Transport for London |url= http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2443.aspx |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OSapBxov |deadurl=no | archivedate=30 March 2014 |accessdate =27 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=152–153, 168–169[/tpl]

===Roundel===

While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the trademark of the London General Omnibus Company registered in 1905, it was first used on the Underground in 1908 when the UERL placed a solid red circle behind station nameboards on platforms to highlight the name.[tpl]cite web | title =History of the roundel | publisher=London Transport Museum | url =http://www.ltmcollection.org/roundel/about/detailedhistory.html | accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=86–88[/tpl] The word "UNDERGROUND" was placed in a roundel instead of a station name on posters in 1912 by Charles Sharland and Alfred France, as well as on undated and possibly earlier posters from the same period.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=67[/tpl] Frank Pick thought the solid red disc cumbersome and took a version where the disc became a ring from a 1915 Sharland poster and gave it to Edward Johnston to develop, and registered the symbol as a trademark in 1917.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=112–113[/tpl] The roundel was first printed on a map cover using the Johnston typeface in June 1919, and printed in colour the following October.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=126–127[/tpl]
After the UERL was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, it used forms of the roundel for buses, trams and coaches, as well as the Underground. The words "London Transport" were added inside the ring, above and below the bar. The Carr-Edwards report, published in 1938 as possibly the first attempt at a graphics standards manual, introduced stricter guidelines.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=155, 186[/tpl] Between 1948 and 1957 the word "Underground" in the bar was replaced by "London Transport".[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=206, 218, 226[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], forms of the roundel, with differing colours for the ring and bar, is used for other TfL services, such as London Buses, Tramlink, London Overground, London River Services and Docklands Light Railway.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/interchange/documents/tfl-interchange-signs-standard-issue04.pdf | title=Interchange signs standard | publisher=Transport for London | date=January 2009 | archivedate=21 August 2012 | location=Sections 3–7|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120821182909/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/microsites/interchange/documents/tfl-interchange-signs-standard-issue04.pdf[/tpl] Crossrail, due to open in 2018, is to be identified with a roundel.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.londonreconnections.com/2013/crossrail-gets-its-roundel/ | title=Crossrail Gets Its Roundel | publisher=London Reconnections | date=January 2009 | accessdate=12 April 2013 |author=John Bull[/tpl] The 100th anniversary of the roundel was celebrated in 2008 by TfL commissioning 100 artists to produce works that celebrate the design.[tpl]Cite press release |title=100 artists celebrate 100 years of Tube logo |publisher= Transport for London |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/9281.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20130412061154/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/9281.html |archivedate=12 April 2013 |date=4 September 2008[/tpl]

===Architecture===

Seventy of the 270 London Underground stations use buildings that are on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, and five have entrances in listed buildings.[tpl]cite web | url=http://urbandesign.tfl.gov.uk/Heritage-Library/Underground/Line.aspx | title=Heritage Library: Underground: Line | publisher=Transport for London | work=Urban Design | date=No date | accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl] The Metropolitan Railway's original seven stations were inspired by Italianate designs, with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=11, 18–19[/tpl] Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=26, 28[/tpl] The City & South London Railway opened with red-brick buildings, designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, topped with a lead-covered dome that contained the lift mechanism.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=35[/tpl] The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect, who designed its pinkish-brown steel-framed buildings with larger entrances.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=38[/tpl]
In the first decade of the 20th century Leslie Green established a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL, which were clad in ox-blood faience blocks.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=60–61, 70[/tpl] Green pioneered using building design to guide passengers with direction signs on tiled walls, with the stations given a unique identity with patterns on the platform walls.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=71–72[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/pia.402 |doi=10.5334/pia.402|journal=Papers from the Institute of Archaeology |title=Conserving Heritage Tiles on the London Underground: Challenges and Approaches|volume=22|year=2012 |pages=pp. 48–60 |publisher=Ubiquity Press |author=Fulcher, Kate |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas.[tpl]cite web | title = London Underground's Edwardian Tile Patterns | publisher=Doug Rose | url=http://www.dougrose.co.uk/ | accessdate =12 July 2007 [/tpl] Harry W. Ford was responsible for the design of at least 17 UERL and District Railway stations, including Barons Court and Embankment, and claimed to have first thought of enlarging the U and D in the UNDERGROUND wordmark.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=41, 63[/tpl] The Met's architect Charles Walter Clark had used a neo-classical design for rebuilding Baker Street and Paddington Praed Street stations before World War I and, although the fashion had changed, continued with Farringdon in 1923. The buildings had metal lettering attached to pale walls.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=38[/tpl] Clark would later design "Chiltern Court", the large, luxurious block of apartments at Baker Street, that opened in 1929.[tpl]sfnp|Green|1987|p=44[/tpl] In the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Holden designed a series of modernist and art-deco stations some of which he described as his 'brick boxes with concrete lids'.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=150–152[/tpl] Holden's design for the Underground's headquarters building at 55 Broadway included avant-garde sculptures by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Henry Moore.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=146[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBATrust/RIBALibrary/VAndAPartnership/UndergroundJourneysGalleryGuide.pdf | title=Underground  Journeys:  Charles Holden's designs  for London Transport | publisher=V&A RIBA architecture partnership | date=undated | accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
When the Central line was extended east, the stations were simplified Holden proto-Brutalist designs,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=213[/tpl] and a cavernous concourse built at Gants Hill in honour of early Moscow Metro stations.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=214[/tpl] Misha Black was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria line, contributing to the line's uniform look,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=234[/tpl] but each station had an individual tile motif.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=243[/tpl] The stations of the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line were much larger than before[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=268–269[/tpl] and designed by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins.[tpl]sfnp|Day|Reed|2010|pp=209–211[/tpl]
Many platforms have unique interior designs to help passenger identification. The tiling at Baker Street incorporates repetitions of Sherlock Holmes's silhouette and at Tottenham Court Road semi-abstract mosaics by Eduardo Paolozzi feature musical instruments, tape machines and butterflies.[tpl]sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=188–189[/tpl] Robyn Denny designed the murals on the Northern line platforms at Embankment.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2445.aspx | title=Station architecture | publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131020070920/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2445.aspx |accessdate=20 October 2013|archivedate=20 October 2013[/tpl]

===Typography===

The first posters used a number of type fonts, as was contemporary practice,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=21[/tpl] and station signs used sans serif block capitals.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=23[/tpl] The Johnston typeface was developed in upper and lower case in 1916, and a complete set of blocks, marked Johnston Sans, was made by the printers the following year.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=112[/tpl] A bold version of the capitals was developed by Johnston in 1929.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=122[/tpl] The Met changed to a serif letterform for its signs in the 1920s, used on the stations rebuilt by Clark.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=139[/tpl] However, Johnston was adopted systemwide after the formation the LPTB in 1933 and the LT wordmark was applied to locomotives and carriages.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=156[/tpl] Johnston was redesigned, becoming New Johnston, for photo-typesetting in the early 1980s when Elichi Kono designed a range that included Light, Medium and Bold, each with its italic version. The typesetters P22 developed today's electronic version, sometimes called TfL Johnston, in 1997.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=250[/tpl]

===Posters and patron of the arts===

Early advertising posters proclaimed the advantages of travelling using various letter forms.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=52[/tpl] Graphic posters first appeared in the 1890s,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/Research/Your-Research/X20L/Themes/1/1176/ | title=London Transport Posters: Frank Pick’s vision | publisher=Exploring 20th century London | accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] and it became possible to print colour images economically in the early 20th century.[tpl]sfnp|Jackson|1986|pp=238–239[/tpl] The Central London Railway used colour illustrations in their 1905 poster,[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=53[/tpl] and from 1908 the underground group, under Pick's direction, used images of country scenes, shopping and major events on posters to encourage use of the tube.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=88–89[/tpl] Pick found he was limited by the commercial artists the printers used, and so commissioned work from artists and designers such as Dora Batty,[tpl]sfnp|Artmonsky|2012|p=117[/tpl] Edward McKnight Kauffer, the cartoonist George Morrow, Herry (Heather) Perry,[tpl]sfnp|Artmonsky|2012|p=117[/tpl] Graham Sutherland, Charles Sharland[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=124–125[/tpl] and the sisters Anna and Doris Zinkeisen. According to Ruth Artmonsky, over 150 women artists were commissioned by Pick and latterly Christian Barman to design posters for London Underground, London Transport and London County Council Tramways.[tpl]sfnp|Artmonsky|2012|pp=106–111[/tpl] The Johnson Sans letter form began appearing on posters from 1917.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=124–125[/tpl] The Met, strongly independent, used images on timetables and on the cover of its Metro-land guide that promoted the country it served for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter.[tpl]sfnp|Jackson|1986|p=240[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=109[/tpl]  By the London Transport was formed in 1933 the UERL was considered a patron of the arts and over 1000 works were commissioned in the 1930s, such as the cartoon images of Charles Burton and Kauffer's later abstract cubist and surrealist images.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=160–161[/tpl]
Harold Hutchison became London Transport publicity officer in 1947, after World War II and nationalisation, and introduced the "pair poster", where an image on a poster was paired with text on another. Numbers of commissions dropped, to eight a year in the 1950s and just four a year in the 1970s,  with images from artists such Harry Stevens and Tom Eckersley.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|pp=246–247[/tpl] Art on the Underground was introduced in 1986 by Henry Fitzhugh to revive London Transport as a patron of the arts with the Underground commissioning six works a year, judged first on artistic merit. In that year Peter Lee, Celia Lyttleton and a poster by David Booth, Malcolm Fowler and Nancy Fowler were commissioned.[tpl]sfnp|Ovenden|2013|p=258[/tpl] Today commissions range from the pocket tube map cover to installations in a station.[tpl]cite web | url=http://art.tfl.gov.uk/about/history/ | title=Art on the Underground: History | publisher=Transport for London | accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] Similarly, Poems on the Underground has commissioned poetry since 1986 that are displayed in carriages.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2437.aspx| title=Poems on the Underground | publisher=Transport for London |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140122184803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2437.aspx |archivedate=22 January 2014[/tpl]
