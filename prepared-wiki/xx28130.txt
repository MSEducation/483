[[Tarshish]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible nations, Hebrew Bible places

Tarshish ([tpl]lang-he|תַּרְשִׁישׁ[/tpl]) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings. One of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the Land of Israel by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia. The Septuagint, the Vulgate and the Targum of Jonathan render this as Carthage. But other biblical commentators read it as Tartessos in ancient Hispania (Iberian Peninsula)."Tarshish" in the Jewish Encyclopedia, by Isidore Singer and M. Seligsohn. W.F. Albright (1941) and F.M. Cross (1972) suggested Tarshish was Sardinia because of the discovery of the Nora Stone or Nora Fragment. The Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone has been combined with metallic evidence from Phoenicia and ancient documentary sources (biblical, classical and Assyrian) to indicate that the Tarshish which the biblical tradition remembers as a supplier of silver to King Solomon, was a large island in the western Mediterranean Sea (Thompson and Skaggs 2013) - the biblical passages and commentaries that understand Tarshish as a location in Africa, at Tarsus or as far afield as the Tamilakkam in Southern India and Ceylon appear to be confused readings of the earlier textual sources. Tartessos in Spain was eventually equated with Tarshish in later antiquity, but Thompson and Skaggs show that Solomon's Tarshish was a large island (Sardinia), and not a hinterland (Tartessos).
