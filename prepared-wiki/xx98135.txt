Theoren Wallace "Theo" Fleury (born June 29, 1968) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, New York Rangers, and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), Tappara of Finland's SM-liiga, and the Belfast Giants of the UK's Elite Ice Hockey League. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, and played over 1,000 games in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.  
One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a junior, he was at the centre of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over 1,000 points in his career and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics, winning a gold medal in 2002. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005–06, and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.
Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a pilot for a reality television show based around it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional baseball games for the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. In 1995, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1 million for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada. 
Fleury co-wrote Playing with Fire, a best-selling autobiography released in October 2009, in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach Graham James. Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James, who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault.  Fleury has since become an advocate for sexual abuse victims and developed a career as a public speaker.

==Early life==

Fleury was born on June 29, 1968, in Oxbow, Saskatchewan, the first of Wally and Donna Fleury's three sons. Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem.[tpl]harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=27–28[/tpl] Donna was a quiet, religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=6[/tpl]  Fleury is of Métis heritage, as his grandmother Mary was Cree. The Fleurys lived in Williams Lake, British Columbia, for four years, a period that saw Theo's brother Ted born in 1970, before settling in Russell, Manitoba, by 1973, the year his youngest brother Travis was born.[tpl]harvnb|Malcolm|1997|p=29[/tpl] Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell.[tpl]harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=35–37[/tpl]
Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=7[/tpl] He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=9[/tpl] From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.
Although his mother was a Jehovah's Witness, Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic. He attended mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=11–12[/tpl] Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=19[/tpl] In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his brachial artery. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=14–17[/tpl] Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=18[/tpl] It was there that Fleury met Graham James, who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL).  James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.

==Playing career==

===Junior===

Fleury began his junior career in 1983–84 as a 15-year-old with the St. James Canadians of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, scoring 33 goals and 64 points in 22 games, an incredible pace of nearly three points per game.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10485 |title=Player profile – Theoren Fleury |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-09-19[/tpl] In 1984–85 he moved to the Moose Jaw Warriors, who had just relocated from Winnipeg, scoring 29 goals and 75 points in 71 games as a 16-year-old. He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL, culminating with a 68-goal, 92-assist season in 1987–88. Fleury's 160 points tied him for the league lead with Joe Sakic, and the two players shared the Bob Clarke Trophy as the WHL's top scorers.[tpl]harvnb|Flett|2009|pp=40–41[/tpl] Fleury's 92 assists and 160 points remain team records; he also holds the Warriors' career records for goals (201), assists (271) and points (472).[tpl]harvnb|Flett|2009|p=83[/tpl] [tpl]asof|2012[/tpl], he remains 10th all-time in WHL scoring.[tpl]Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=83[/tpl]
Always one of the smallest players in the game,[tpl]citation |last=Dreger |first=Darren |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=287047 |title=Fleury attempting NHL comeback |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-09-20[/tpl] Fleury learned early that he had to play an unpredictable style of game to survive against players much larger than he was. He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a feisty, physical game,[tpl]Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=97–98[/tpl] which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=102[/tpl] He recorded 235 penalties in minutes in his final year of junior, nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers.[tpl]harvnb|Flett|2009|p=173[/tpl]  Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career, routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage.[tpl]citation |last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/columnists/story.html?id=1bcc4e36-caa7-4d39-a430-e2956ce242d9&p=2 |title=Back in the saddle |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2009-11-01 |ref=[/tpl]

Fleury twice represented Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championships. He first joined the team for the 1987 tournament in Piešťany, Czechoslovakia. The tournament is best remembered for the "Punch-up in Piestany" on January 4, 1987, an infamous bench-clearing brawl between the Canadians and the Soviet Union. Fleury scored the first goal of the game and, as part of his celebration, used his stick to mimic firing a machine gun at the Soviet bench, a move that was criticized by Canadian officials.[tpl]Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=126[/tpl] The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4–2, when Pavel Kostichkin slashed Fleury, leading to a fight between the two. It quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice, after which the Soviet players left their bench, followed closely by the Canadians.[tpl]citation |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/clips/12742/ |title=The Punch-up in Piestany |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl] Both teams were disqualified from the tournament, costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal -– potentially the gold.[tpl]Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=148[/tpl]
The International Ice Hockey Federation suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18 months, though the bans were later reduced to 6 months on appeal. This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament in Moscow.[tpl]Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=215[/tpl] He was named captain, finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games, and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the gold medal.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.tsn.ca/World_jrs/feature/?fid=987 |title=WJHC history (gold) – 1988 |publisher=The Sports Network |accessdate=2009-09-19[/tpl]
Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in 1986–87, Fleury's small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL.[tpl]citation |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=181e67b3-032a-4b57-8b99-ff393049f5ac |title=Theoren Fleury: A timeline |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-08-08 |accessdate=2009-09-19[/tpl] The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft.[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=128[/tpl] Upon completing his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship.

===Calgary Flames===

Fleury arrived at the Flames' 1988 training camp [tpl]convert|20|lb|kg[/tpl] overweight, and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988–89 season.[tpl]citation |title=Fleury Chronology |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-03-01 |page=D9[/tpl]  He averaged nearly two points per game, recording 37 goals and 37 assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40 games.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=52[/tpl]  Mired in a slump, the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the hope he could help their offence.[tpl]citation |last=Kuzma |first=Ben |title=Fleury gets chance to renew acquaintances with Sakic |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-01-02 |page=D1[/tpl]  He played his first NHL game against the Quebec Nordiques two nights later and recorded his first points – three assists – on January 5 against the Los Angeles Kings.  He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on January 7.[tpl]citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Little brother shows 'em how |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-01-08 |page=A1 |ref=[/tpl]  Fleury continued to score, and finished with 34 points in 36 games in his NHL rookie season.  He added 11 points in the playoffs, helping the Flames to the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.
After improving to 33 goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in 1990–91, scoring 51 goals and 104 points to lead the Flames offensively.[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=150[/tpl] He played in the 1991 All-Star Game,[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=24[/tpl] scoring a goal in an 11–5 victory by the Campbell Conference over the Wales Conference.  Towards the end of the season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three shorthanded goals in one game against the St. Louis Blues. He shared the NHL Plus-Minus Award with Marty McSorley, whom he tied for the league lead with +48.[tpl]Harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=25[/tpl]  Fleury scored only two goals in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs, but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRFLUBgvzc |title=Game 6, Calgary Flames at Edmonton Oilers (04/24/91) |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (via YouTube) |accessdate=2009-09-19[/tpl] The Flames were defeated in game seven, which ended their season.[tpl]Citation |title=2009–10 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |page=258[/tpl]
Fleury fell back to 33 goals in 1991–92 as the Flames missed the playoffs.[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=149[/tpl] That season, he made his second All-Star Game appearance, recording a goal for the Campbell Conference. Fleury finished with over 100 points for the second time in his career in 1992–93 to lead the team in scoring,[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=148[/tpl] and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.[tpl]citation |last=Stewart |first=Monte |title=Flames bomb Sharks |work=Calgary Herald |date=1993-02-11 |page=E1[/tpl]
The 1994–95 NHL lockout reduced the season to 48 games from 84. During the lockout, Fleury played for Tappara in Finland's top league, the SM-liiga. He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL's labour dispute was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary. Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500 career points.
Lacking a contract prior to the 1995–96 season, Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12 million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity.[tpl]citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Loyalty over Loonies |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-09-23 |page=E1 |ref=[/tpl] He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener.[tpl]citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury pencils himself into lineup |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-10-04 |page=C1 |ref=[/tpl] Although he felt like somebody was "stabbing a knife in his gut every five minutes", Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it.[tpl]citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=Fleury battling Crohn's |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-12-28 |page=C7[/tpl] Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists and points,[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=145[/tpl] and played in his third All-Star Game, serving as Calgary's only representative.
When Joe Nieuwendyk refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role.[tpl]citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury steps down as Flames' captain |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=E3 |ref=[/tpl] He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.[tpl]citation |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/sports/hockey-wearing-hockey-s-badge-leadership-captain-s-c-carries-much-influence-ice.html |title=Wearing hockey's badge of leadership |work=New York Times |date=1997-09-28 |accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl]
The Flames struggled in 1996–97, finishing last in the Pacific Division and missing the playoffs for only the second time since their arrival in Calgary in 1980.[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=133[/tpl] Fleury again led the team in scoring, but his 29 goals were the fewest he had scored in a full season in the NHL. He was the Flames' lone representative at the 1997 All-Star Game.  He scored only 27 goals in 1997–98, but increased his point total from 67 to 78 while also leading the team with 197 penalties in minutes.[tpl]harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=143[/tpl] On November 29, 1997, Fleury scored his 315th career goal, breaking Nieuwendyk's franchise record. The same day, he was named to Team Canada for the 1998 Winter Olympics.[tpl]citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=McCarthy grounds Ducks |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-11-30 |page=B5 |ref=[/tpl] Fleury participated in his fifth All-Star Game that season, but the Flames again missed the playoffs.

Following the trade, Fleury said that any team looking to sign him to a new contract would have to pay him $7 million per year.  In his autobiography, Playing with Fire, Fleury claims that he was offered $16 million over four years by the Flames before the trade, and countered with an offer of $25 million over five years.[tpl]harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=180[/tpl]

===Colorado, New York, and Chicago===

Fleury made his debut for the Avalanche the day after the trade and was met with loud cheers from the Denver crowd.[tpl]citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Theo gets rousing Denver greeting |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-03-02 |page=C3 |ref=[/tpl] He scored a goal in a 4–3 loss to Edmonton, but also sprained his knee and missed the next two weeks.

While he stated he "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/10/09/sp-fleury-tell-all.html |title=Fleury tell-all book chronicles sexual abuse |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2009-10-10[/tpl] He blamed the abuse for turning him into a "raging, alcoholic lunatic",[tpl]citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/fleury-opens-up-about-sexual-abuse/article1319778/ |title=Fleury opens up about sexual abuse |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Fleury+pondered+suicide+autobiography+reveals/2098274/story.html |title=Fleury pondered suicide, autobiography reveals |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091016193825/http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Fleury+pondered+suicide+autobiography+reveals/2098274/story.html  |archivedate=2009-10-16[/tpl] He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women.[tpl]citation |last=MacIntyre |first=Iain |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=646adc8d-4467-4a27-886d-f96fee9091d9 |title=Smarter, fitter and sober Fleury playing with fire again |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl] Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer.
