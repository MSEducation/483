The Human Comedy is a 1943 American drama film directed by Clarence Brown and adapted by Howard Estabrook.[tpl]cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/23815/The-Human-Comedy/overview |title=Movie Review: The Human Comedy |accessdate=August 19, 2008|date=March 3, 1943|newspaper=The New York Times | first=Bosley | last=Crowther | authorlink=Bosley Crowther[/tpl] It is often thought to be based on the William Saroyan novel of the same name, but Saroyan actually wrote the screenplay first, was fired from the movie project, and quickly wrote the novel and published it just before the film was released. It stars Mickey Rooney with Frank Morgan. Also appearing are in the film are James Craig, Marsha Hunt, Fay Bainter, Ray Collins, Van Johnson, Donna Reed and Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins.
The film is the story of a teenaged Homer Macauley (Mickey Rooney) in high school, working part-time as a telegram delivery boy, in the fictional town of Ithaca, California, during World War II. The effects of the war on the "Home Front" over a year in Homer's life are depicted in sentimental scenarios involving himself, his family, friends, and neighbors, and acquaintances encountered. The storyline is directed by a narrator, Homer's deceased father (Ray Collins).

==Cast==

Robert Mitchum and Don DeFore appear uncredited in early bit parts as buddies of a soldier Barry Nelson with a night off from training, trying to meet girls and take in a movie. Carl Switzer, best known as "Alfalfa" in the Our Gang shorts, appears uncredited as Auggie, a friend of Ulysses.

==Production==

Saroyan wrote a film treatment and a screenplay that he was asked to direct. He was paid off and removed from the project when his film proved to be more than two hours long. Saroyan was not at all happy with the film as completed by Brown, and he wrote his novel from the script he produced. The novel was published at the same time as the film's release with the intent of countering the film version of the story.

Mayer, head of MGM, who suggested that this was his favorite film, also suggest a very definite "MGM house style".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_human_comedy_1943/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: The Human Comedy |accessdate=March 1, 2014|work=Rotten Tomatoes[/tpl] 

==Reception==

The New York Times reviewer praised the film's performances, especially Rooney, saying that "There is a tenderness and restraint in his characterization." But he chided the film for excessive sentimentality, saying it featured "some most charming bits of fine motion-picture expression and some most maudlin gobs of cinematic goo."
The film made $2.8 million in the US and Canada and $1.0 million elsewhere resulting in a profit of $1.5 million.

==Awards==

It won the Academy Award for Best Story and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Mickey Rooney), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, Best Director and Best Picture.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/16th-winners.html |title=The 16th Academy Awards (1944) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-10-04 |work=oscars.org | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014001522/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/16th-winners.html | archivedate= 2013-10-14 | deadurl=no[/tpl]
