Born in Qiantang (錢塘, now Hangzhou), Qu You was famous as an adolescent poet. He became a teacher-official (教諭) in Lin'an (臨安), then promoted to be the Head of Secretary (長史) of the Zhou (周) Kingdom. But at the height of his career, he was jailed for ten years.
After his release in 1425, he worked as a tutor in the household of Lord of Ying State (英國公).  He was reinstated as an official, but he resigned shortly, never returning to the world of politics again, in action.
