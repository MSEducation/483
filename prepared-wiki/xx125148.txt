How Men Are is the third album by the English synthpop group Heaven 17, released in September 1984 by Virgin Records. The album peaked at no.12 in the UK and was certified Silver (60,000 copies sold) by the BPI in October 1984.
Three singles were released from this album: "Sunset Now" (UK#24), "This is Mine" (UK#23) in 1984, and an edited remix of "...(And That's No Lie)" (UK#52) in early 1985, which was the first Heaven 17 single to fail to reach the UK Top 40 since "Let Me Go" at the end of 1982.
Although digital sample-based instruments such as the Fairlight CMI and the Linn LM-1 drum machine were still responsible for most of the album's sounds, How Men Are marked the beginning of an increased usage of acoustic instruments in Heaven 17's music.  A small orchestra is employed on three tracks, and two tracks make use of The Phenix Horns Esquire, Earth, Wind & Fire's famous brass section. Another notable contribution to this album was made by the vocal group Afrodiziak, who sang on four tracks.
In 2006, Heaven 17's first three albums were remastered and reissued with bonus tracks.
