Southwest Airlines Co. ([tpl]nyse|LUV[/tpl]) is a major U.S. airline and the world's largest low-cost carrier, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The airline was established in 1967 and adopted their current name in 1971. The airline has 44,831 employees [tpl]as of|2013|12|lc=y|df=US[/tpl] and operates more than 3,400 flights per day.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/history/fact-sheet.html |title=Fact Sheet |year=2011 |work=swamedia.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co. |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yONehPYr |archivedate=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 [/tpl] As of June 5, 2011, it carries the most domestic passengers of any U.S. airline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/ps/publications/wats-passenger-carried.htm |title=Scheduled Passengers Carried |author=International Air Transport Association |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |authorlink=International Air Transport Association[/tpl] As of January 2014, Southwest Airlines has scheduled service to 89 destinations in 42 states and Puerto Rico.
Southwest Airlines has solely operated Boeing 737s, except for a few years in the 1970s and 1980s, when they operated a few Boeing 727s. As of August 2012, Southwest is the largest operator of the 737 worldwide with over 550 in service, each operating an average of six flights per day. In May 2011, Southwest acquired AirTran Airways, with integration of the carriers expected to be complete by 2014. On March 1, 2012, the company was issued a single operating certificate, technically becoming one airline.[tpl]cite news |title=Southwest, AirTran now single carrier in FAA's eyes |author=Ben Mutzabaugh |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2012/03/faa-issues-single-operating-certificate-to-southwest-airtran/637961/1?csp=34travel |publisher=USA Today |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

Southwest Airlines traces their roots to the March 15, 1967 incorporation of Air Southwest Co. by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher to provide service within the state of Texas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southwest.com/swamedia/swa_history.html |title=Southwest Airlines – A Brief History |year=2009 |work=southwest.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |accessdate=January 6, 2011 |quote=More than 38 years ago, Rollin King and Herb Kelleher got together to start a different kind of airline.[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/1966-to-1971 |title=1966 to 1971 |year=2011 |work=swamedia.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co. |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |quote=March 15, 1967 Air Southwest Co. is incorporated.[/tpl]
Kelleher believed that by providing intrastate service within Texas, the airline could avoid federal regulation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Social/impact/SH3.htm |title=Air Travel: Its Impact on the Way We Live and the Way We See Ourselves |first=James C. |last=Kruggel |work=centennialofflight.net |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yOOoGQp7 |archivedate=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |quote=A Texas attorney named Herbert Kelleher figured out that an airline flying within one state would escape federal regulation. He founded Southwest Airlines, serving only Texas, in 1971.[/tpl] Three airlines (Braniff, Trans-Texas, and Continental Airlines) started legal action which was not resolved for three years. Air Southwest prevailed in 1970 when the Texas Supreme Court upheld Air Southwest’s right to fly within Texas.Original Court Decision Upheld, Texas International Airlines, Inc., Petitioner, v. Civil Aeronautics Board Respondent, Southwest Airlines Company, Intervenor Braniff Airways, Inc., Petitioner, v. Civil Aeronautics Board, Respondent, Southwest Airlines Company, Intervenor, 473 F.2d 1150 (United States Court of Appeals, Dec 11, 1972) The Texas decision became final on December 7, 1970 when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, without comment.Certiorari denied, 400 U.S. 943 (1970)
The story of Southwest’s legal fight was turned into a children’s book, Gumwrappers and Goggles by Winifred Barnum in 1983. In the story, TJ Love, a small jet, is taken to court by two larger jets to keep him from their hangar and to stop him from flying. In court, TJ Love’s right to fly is upheld after an impassioned plea from a character referred to as "The Lawyer". While no company names are mentioned in the book, TJ Love’s colors were those of Southwest Airlines, and the two other jets are colored in Braniff and Continental colors. The Lawyer resembles Herb Kelleher. The book was adapted into a stage musical, Show Your Spirit, sponsored by Southwest Airlines, and played only in cities served by the airline.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.poohbooli.com/bio.html |title=Winifred Barnum |accessdate=June 9, 2007[/tpl]
On March 29, 1971 Air Southwest Co. changed its name to Southwest Airlines Co. with headquarters in Dallas. Southwest began scheduled flights on June 18, 1971, Dallas to Houston and Dallas to San Antonio with three 737-200s. The OAG for 15 October 1972 shows 61 flights a week each way between Dallas and Houston Hobby, 23 each way between Dallas and San Antonio, and 16 each way between San Antonio and Houston; no flights were scheduled on Saturdays.

Southwest Airlines founder Herb Kelleher studied California-based Pacific Southwest Airlines and used many of PSA’s ideas to form the corporate culture at Southwest. Early flights used the same "Long Legs And Short Nights" theme for stewardesses on board typical Southwest Airlines flights. A committee including the same person who had selected hostesses for Hugh Hefner's Playboy jet selected the first flight attendants, females described as long-legged dancers, majorettes, and cheerleaders with "unique personalities." Southwest Airlines and Herb Kelleher dressed them in hot pants and go-go boots.Freiberg, Kevin, and Jackie Freiberg. NUTS!. Austin, Texas: Bard Press, 1996.
The New York Times wrote in 1971 that Southwest Airlines President Lamar Muse, “says frankly-and repeatedly- that Southwest Airlines has been developed from its inception around the ideas that have proven to be successful for Pacific Southwest  Airlines.”  “ We Don't mind being copycats of an operation like that,” referring to a visit he and other Southwest executives made to PSA as they assembled their operating plans.  PSA welcomed them and even sold them flight and operations training. Muse later wrote that creating the operations manuals for his upstart airline was “primarily a cut and paste procedure”, and it is said that “Southwest Airlines copied PSA so completely that you could almost call it a photocopy.”Collins, Jim and Morten T. Hansen. Great by Choice. New York, NY: HarperCollins Publishers, 2011.
The rest of 1971 and 1972 saw operating losses. One of the four 737s was sold to Frontier Airlines and the proceeds used for payroll and other expenses. Southwest continued a schedule based on four aircraft but using only three, so the "ten minute turn" was born and was the standard ground time for many years.[tpl]cite web|title=Why and how Southwest Airlines uses consultants |url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bovaird/c19/SW%20Airlines.htm |author=Libby Sartain |publisher=Journal of Management Consulting |year=1998 |accessdate=June 9, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Category/pages/major-initiatives |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: By Category |publisher=Swamedia.com |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]

====Wright Amendment====

The Wright Amendment of 1979 is a federal law that governs traffic at Dallas Love Field, the pre-1974 airport in Dallas. It originally limited most nonstop flights to destinations within Texas and neighboring states. The limits began to phase out in 1997 and 2005; in 2006, the amendment was repealed, with some restrictions intact until 2014, but added a restriction on the number of gates allowed.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
When airline deregulation came in 1978, Southwest began to plan interstate flights from Love Field, causing interest groups affiliated with Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, including the city of Fort Worth, Texas, to push the Wright Amendment through Congress to restrict such flights.[tpl]cite web|title=History of the Wright Amendment |url=http://www.setlovefree.com/historyofwright.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050507180104/http://www.setlovefree.com/historyofwright.html |archivedate=May 7, 2005 |author=Southwest Airlines |accessdate=June 10, 2007[/tpl] Under the amendment, Southwest and other airlines were barred from operating or even ticketing passengers on flights from Love Field to destinations beyond the states that border Texas. The Wright Amendment’s restrictions did not apply to aircraft with 56 or fewer seats. Southwest did not use the 56 seat loophole.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Southwest-Airlines |title=Southwest Airlines Fleet Details and History – Planespotters.net Just Aviation |publisher=Planespotters.net |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
In 1997, Southwest’s efforts began to pay off with the Shelby Amendment, which added Alabama, Mississippi, and Kansas to the allowed destination states. Southwest began nonstop service between Dallas Love Field and Birmingham, Alabama.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/1995-to-1997 |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: By Date |publisher=Swamedia.com |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]

Southwest paid US$60.5 million in stock and cash for Muse Air when Muse was on the verge of collapse in 1985. After completing the acquisition, Southwest renamed MuseAir TranStar Airlines. TranStar became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest and operated as an independent airline. Unwilling to compete in a fare war against Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air, Southwest eventually sold TranStar's assets to Lorenzo in August 1987.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-27/southwest-airlines-agrees-to-buy-airtran-for-1-4-billion-in-cash-shares.html |title=Southwest CEO Risks Keep-it-Simple Strategy to Reignite Growth |first1=Mary |last1=Schlangenstein |first2=John |last2=Hughes |date=October 28, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vh7wuxod |archivedate=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |quote=...Morris Air in 1993 for $134 million in stock and Muse Air in 1985 for $60.5 million in stock and cash....[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/05/28/303852/index.htm |title=The Chairman Of the Board Looks Back |first1=Katrina |last1=Brooker |first2=Alynda |last2=Wheat |date=May 28, 2001 |work=money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune |publisher=Cable News Network |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vh8rKNaE |archivedate=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |quote=By 1985 it was on the verge of collapse.

[tpl]as of|2006|df=US[/tpl] about 1,400 employees worked in the three story building.
In 1990, the airline registered their aircraft in Houston so they could pay aircraft taxes in Houston, even though the actual corporate headquarters were in Dallas. Southwest was not physically relocating any assets, but Texas state law allowed the airline to choose either Dallas or Houston as the city of registry of their aircraft.Ragland, James and Martin Zimmerman.

On March 16, 1995, Southwest became one of the first airlines to have a website. Originally called the "Southwest Airlines Home Gate", passengers could view schedules, a route map, and company information at Iflyswa.com.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blogsouthwest.com/2006/04/21/luv-and-the-blogoshpere/ |title=LUV and the Blogosphere |author=Brian Lusk |accessdate=June 24, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070607164649/http://www.blogsouthwest.com/2006/04/21/luv-and-the-blogoshpere/  |archivedate = June 7, 2007[/tpl] Southwest.com is the number one airline website for online revenue, according to PhoCusWright.

Southwest Airlines gained a reputation for "outside the box thinking" and proactive risk management, including the use of fuel hedging to insulate against fuel price fluctuation. Some analysts have argued against the style of profit-motivated energy trading Southwest did between 1999 and the early 2000s. They suggested that rather than hedging business risk (such as a hedge on weather to a farmer), Southwest was simply speculating on energy prices, without a formal rationale for doing so.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/30/business/fi-southwest30 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Peter | last=Pae | title=Hedge on fuel prices pays off | date=May 30, 2008[/tpl]

===2000s===

====Repealing the Wright Amendment====

In late 2004, Southwest began actively seeking the full repeal of the Wright Amendment restrictions. In late 2005, Missouri was added to the list of permissible destination states via a transportation appropriations bill. New service from Love Field to Saint Louis, Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri quickly started in December 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/2005-to-2007 |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: By Date |publisher=Swamedia.com |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
At a June 15, 2006 joint press conference held by the city of Dallas, the city of Ft. Worth, Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines, the said parties announced a tentative agreement on how the Wright Amendment was to be phased out. Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed Wright-related legislation on September 29, 2006, and it was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 13, 2006. The new law became effective on October 16, 2006, when the FAA Administrator notified Congress that any new aviation operations occurring as a result of the new law could be accommodated without adverse effect to the airspace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=92562&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=917522&highlight= |title=News Releases |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
Southwest started selling tickets under the new law on October 19, 2006. Highlights of the agreement are the immediate elimination of through-ticketing prohibitions, and unrestricted flights to domestic destinations eight years after the legislation takes effect. Because of the agreement, nationwide service became possible for Southwest; the law also defined the maximum number of gates at Love Field. Southwest controls all of the Love Field gates except for four gates controlled by Delta Air Lines and United.
Southwest remains the dominant passenger airline at Love Field, maintains its headquarters, hangars, training centers, and flight simulators adjacent thereto, and reflects its ties to Love Field in its stock exchange ticker symbol (LUV).

====2008–2009====

In 2008, Southwest contracted with Pratt and Whitney to supply the proprietary Ecopower water pressure-washing system, which allows Southwest to clean grime and contaminants off engine turbine blades while the aircraft is parked at the gate. Frequent use of the Ecopower system is estimated to improve fuel efficiency by about 1.9%.Southwest Ecopower Press Release June 11, 2008Lunsford, J. Lynn. “Airlines Dip Into Hot Water to Save Jet Fuel.” Wall Street Journal. June 11, 2008: B1.
On March 6, 2008, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors submitted documents to the United States Congress, alleging that Southwest allowed 117 of its aircraft to fly carrying passengers despite the fact that the planes were "not airworthy" according to air safety investigators.[tpl]Cite news | author=Drew Griffin and Scott Bronstein | title = Records: Southwest Airlines flew 'unsafe' planes | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/06/southwest.planes/index.html | accessdate =March 6, 2008|publisher=CNN| date=March 7, 2008[/tpl] In some cases the planes were allowed to fly for up to 30 months after the inspection deadlines had passed, rendering them unfit to fly. Records indicate that thousands of passengers were flown on aircraft deemed unsafe by federal standards. Southwest declined comment at the time, and US Representative James Oberstar advised a hearing would be held.[ref]

Southwest paid US$7.5 million to acquire certain assets from bankrupt ATA Airlines in 2008. Southwest's primary reason for making the purchase was to acquire the operating certificate and New York LaGuardia Airport landing slots formerly controlled by ATA.

On March 12, 2008, Southwest Airlines voluntarily grounded 44 planes to check if they needed further inspection. The FAA claimed that Southwest Airlines flew almost 60,000 flights without fuselage inspection. Southwest Airlines faced a $10.2 million fine if they violated FAA regulations. There have also been rumors that the FAA knew about Southwest Airlines violations but decided not to fine the airline because it would disrupt the service of Southwest.[tpl]Cite news|title= Southwest grounds planes, places three on leave|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/03/12/southwest.airlines/index.html|author=CNN|accessdate=March 12, 2008 | date=March 12, 2008|authorlink= CNN[/tpl]
On March 2, 2009, Southwest settled these claims, agreeing to pay the FAA fines of $7.5 million for these safety and maintenance issues. The original fine of $30.2 million – a sum which would have been the largest fine in the agency’s history – was lowered after a year of negotiations.

Southwest planned to initially operate Frontier as a stand-alone carrier, eventually absorbing the airline and replacing Frontier's aircraft with Boeing 737s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=comm&id=news/SWFR081009.xml |title=Southwest Offers $170 Million For Frontier |first=Andrew |last=Compart |date=August 10, 2009 |work=aviationweek.com |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vhDR09SH |archivedate=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |quote=Southwest said it submitted a bid of about $170 million for Frontier...[/tpl] Less than one month after submitting its bid, Southwest learned on August 14 that it had lost the initial bidding to Republic Airways Holdings, and elected not to counter or pursue the deal further.

===2010s===

====AirTran Airways acquisition====

Southwest Airlines first announced the acquisition on September 27, 2010, and received final approval from the United States Department of Justice on April 27, 2011. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines completed the acquisition of AirTran Airways by purchasing all of the outstanding common stock, corporate identity, and operating assets of AirTran Holdings, Inc. (former stock ticker NYSE:AAI), the former parent company of AirTran Airways. Southwest Airlines estimates the transaction's value at $3.2 billion and expects onetime costs to integrate the two airlines of $500 million, with cost synergies of approximately $400 million annually. The greatest impact on Southwest will likely be the elimination of a direct low-cost competitor, access to Atlanta, and the addition of landing slots in the New York and Washington DC areas. Southwest obtained a single operating certificate (SOC) from the United States Federal Aviation Administration on March 1, 2012, but expects that full integration of AirTran into Southwest's operations to continue until 2014.
An entity called Guadeloupe Holdings was formed by Southwest and currently acts as a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines and holding company for AirTran's current operations and assets. Southwest's organized labor groups have ceded contractual "scope" provisions pending acceptable negotiated seniority integration agreements. Operations of the two airlines will remain isolated until terms of this integration are fully negotiated (or arbitrated). Bound by federal law, such as McCaskill-Bond legislation, as well as a four-party process agreement, Southwest has confirmed that it will integrate all of the pilots in a fair and equitable manner.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/southwest-closes-airtran-acquisition-356148/ |title=Southwest closes AirTran acquisition |first=Lori |last=Ranson |date=May 2, 2011 |work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |quote=Southwest Airlines today formally closed its acquisition of AirTran Airways, setting the stage for historical consolidation in the US low cost airline industry.[/tpl]
The purchase adds 25 additional destinations previously not served by Southwest including cities in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Atlanta, Georgia, an AirTran hub and, at the time the largest U.S. city not served by Southwest. On October 10, 2011, USA Today reported that Southwest will work to no longer bank flights in Atlanta as AirTran did. AirTran's Boeing 737 orders and options will remain in place and those deliveries to the Southwest operation will occur over the coming years. AirTran 737 aircraft are in the process of being converted to Southwest's new evolve interior and canyon blue livery.
On February 14, 2013, Southwest announced that it had begun codesharing with AirTran. It took the first step on January 26, 2013 by launching shared itineraries in five markets. Southwest continued to launch shared itineraries with 39 more markets beginning February 25, 2013. As of April 2013, shared itineraries are available for travel between all Southwest and AirTran cities (domestic and international).[tpl]cite web|url=http://swamedia.com/releases/southwest-airlines-and-airtran-airways-begin-connecting-networks |title=Southwest Airlines And AirTran Airways Begin Connecting Networks - Southwest Airlines Newsroom |publisher=Swamedia.com |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2013-06-20[/tpl] Southwest anticipates that the integration will be complete in late 2014.

====2011–present====

For the tenth year in a row, Fortune magazine recognized Southwest Airlines in its annual survey of corporate reputations. Among all industries in 2004, Fortune has listed Southwest Airlines as number three among America’s Top Ten most admired corporations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Category/pages/awards |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: By Category |publisher=Swamedia.com |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]

==Corporate identity==

===Advertising===

The company has employed humor in its advertising. Slogans include "Love Is Still Our Field", "Just Plane Smart", "The Somebody Else Up There Who Loves You", "You're Now Free To Move About The Country", "THE Low Fare Airline", "Grab your bag, It's On!", and "Welcome Aboard". The airline's current slogan is "If It Matters To You, It Matters To Us".
In March 1992, shortly after Southwest started using the "Just Plane Smart" motto, Stevens Aviation, who had been using "Plane Smart" for their motto, threatened a trademark lawsuit."Malice in Dallas part 1" "Youtube" Retrieved on October 8, 2009[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freibergs.com/books/nuts-southwest-airlines-crazy-recipe-for-business-and-personal-success/excerpts/malice-in-dallas/ |title=Malice in Dallas | Kevin & Jackie Freiberg |publisher=Freibergs.com |date=1992-03-23 |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
Instead of a lawsuit, the CEOs for both companies staged an arm wrestling match. Held at the now demolished Dallas Sportatorium (the famed wrestling facility) and set for two out of three rounds, the loser of each round was to pay $5,000 to the charity of their choice, with the winner gaining the use of the trademarked phrase. A promotional video was created showing the CEOs "training" for the bout (with CEO Herb Kelleher being helped up during a sit up where a cigarette and glass of whiskey (Wild Turkey 101) was waiting) and distributed among the employees and as a video press release along with the video of the match itself. Herb Kelleher lost the match for Southwest, with Stevens Aviation winning the rights to the phrase. Kurt Herwald, CEO of Stevens Aviation, immediately granted the use of "Just Plane Smart" to Southwest Airlines. The net result was both companies having use of the trademark, $15,000 going to charity and good publicity for both companies."Malice in Dallas (Round 3 and results)" "Youtube" Retrieved on October 8, 2009

===Headquarters===

The Southwest Airlines headquarters is located on the grounds of Dallas Love Field in the Love Field neighborhood of Dallas, Texas."Southwest Airlines Corporate Headquarters, Love Field, Dallas." Southwest Airlines. Retrieved on February 18, 2010.
On September 17, 2012, Southwest broke ground on a new Training and Operational Support (TOPS) building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2012/09/17/southwest-airlines-breaks-ground-on-hq.html |title=Southwest Airlines breaks ground on $100M HQ expansion in Dallas, plans to add 1,000 employees - Dallas Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012[/tpl] The TOPS Building is across the street from its current headquarters building.

The new facilities will house 24-hour coordination and maintenance operations, customer support and services, and training. BOKA Powell was the project architect. Manhattan Construction is the general contractor. The project is scheduled for completion in late 2013, with occupancy beginning in 2014.

===Employment===

As of year end 2013, Southwest Airlines has 44,831 employees.http://southwest.investorroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1859
The President and CEO of Southwest Airlines is Gary C. Kelly. Kelly replaced former CEO Jim Parker on July 15, 2004 and assumed the title of "President" on July 15, 2008, replacing former President Colleen Barrett.
In July 2007, Herb Kelleher resigned his position as Chairman. Colleen Barrett left her post on the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in May 2008 and President in July 2008. Both are still active employees of Southwest Airlines.
In contrast to non-union competitor JetBlue Airways, Southwest maintains its profitability and low-fare, low-cost business model while being heavily unionized. The Southwest Airline Pilots' Association, a union not affiliated with the Air Line Pilots Association, represents the airline's pilots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swapa.org/ |title=SWAPA |publisher=SWAPA |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2011[/tpl] The Aircraft Maintenance Technicians are represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amfanatl.org/ |title=AMFA Home |publisher=Amfanatl.org |accessdate=August 22, 2011[/tpl] Customer Service Agents and Reservation Agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union (IAM). Flight Dispatchers, Flight Attendants, Ramp agents and Operations agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU).

===Impact on carriers===

Southwest has been a major inspiration to other low-cost carriers, and its business model has been repeated many times around the world. The competitive strategy combines high level of employee and aircraft productivity with low unit costs by reducing aircraft turn around time particularly at the gate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5[/tpl] Europe's EasyJet and Ryanair are two of the best known airlines to follow Southwest's business strategy in that continent. Other airlines with a business model based on Southwest's system include Canada's WestJet, Malaysia's AirAsia (the first and biggest LCC in Asia), Qantas's Jetstar (although Jetstar now operates three aircraft types), Philippines's Cebu Pacific, Thailand's Nok Air, Mexico's Volaris and Turkey's Pegasus Airlines. Although Southwest has been a major inspiration to many other airlines, including Ryanair, AirAsia and Jetstar, the management strategies, for example, of Ryanair, AirAsia and Jetstar differ significantly from those of Southwest. All these different management strategies can be seen as means of differentiation from other competitors in order to gain competitive advantages.Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, http://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462

===Lobbying Texas rail===

Southwest has fought against the development of a high-speed rail system in Texas.
In 1991 a plan was made to connect the Texas Triangle (Houston – Dallas – San Antonio) with a privately financed high speed train system which would quickly take passengers from one city to the next. This was the same model Southwest Airlines used 20 years earlier to break into the Texas market where it served the same three cities.
Southwest Airlines, with the help of lobbyists, created legal barriers to prohibit the consortium from moving forward and the entire project was eventually scuttled in 1994, when the State of Texas withdrew the franchise."Track 2–Corridor Programs of the Federal Railroad Administration’s High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail (HSIPR) Program, Application Form" 2009; see ftp://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot-info/stimulus/t_bone.pdf

==Destinations==

[tpl]as of|2014|5||df=US[/tpl], Southwest Airlines operates scheduled service to 89 destinations in 42 states and Puerto Rico, the newest being Pensacola, Florida, Memphis, Tennessee and Richmond, Virginia, on November 3, 2013.
Southwest does not use the more traditional "hub and spoke" flight routing system of most other major airlines, preferring instead the "Point to Point" system. It has notably large operations in certain airports. An average of 80 percent of Southwest passengers are local passengers, meaning only 20 percent of all passengers are connecting passengers. This is significantly higher than most airlines, where passengers often connect in hub cities. However, at Southwest's focus cities, the percentage of connecting passengers can reach 30 percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erau.edu/research/BA590/chapters/ch7.htm |title=Chapter 7: Flight Arrival Flow: Southwest vs. Legacy Carriers |author=Jeremy Sickler |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070409192200/http://www.erau.edu/research/BA590/chapters/ch7.htm |archivedate = April 9, 2007[/tpl] Recent numbers indicate that the number of connecting passengers is steadily rising.[tpl]cite web|last=Maxon|first=Terry|title=Factoids from Southwest Airlines’ annual report|url=http://aviationblog.dallasnews.com/2011/02/factoids-from-southwest-airlin.html/|publisher=Dallas News|accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl]
As part of its effort to control costs, Southwest sometimes uses secondary airports in cities which generally have high costs. Secondary airports generally have lower costs and may be more convenient to travelers than major airports to the same destinations. For example, Southwest flies to Chicago-Midway instead of Chicago-O'Hare.

===Top served cities===

===International service===

Southwest's first approach to international service came on April 19, 2012 when they signed a contract with the Amadeus IT Group which will initiate in 2014. This contract will give the airline the capability to begin flying to destinations outside of the United States. Before this contract was signed, Southwest's reservation system did not have the ability to serve international destinations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/releases/b3cfcefe-eea6-4b8b-90d3-df15bc52a5db |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: Releases |publisher=Swamedia.com |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl] Southwest debuted the international reservation system on January 27, 2014 with first international flights beginning July 1, 2014 to Aruba (AUA), Montego Bay, Jamaica (MBJ) and Nassau, Bahamas (NAS).
Through the integration of AirTran, by the end of 2014, Southwest will add service to Aruba (AUA), Cancun, Mexico (CUN), Mexico City, Mexico (MEX), Montego Bay, Jamaica (MBJ), Nassau, Bahamas (NAS), Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (PUJ) and San Jose Cabo, Mexico (SJD).

==Airline partnerships==

In 1997, Southwest and Icelandair entered into interline and marketing agreements allowing for joint fares, coordinated schedules, transfer of passenger luggage between the two airlines in Baltimore and connecting passengers between several U.S. cities and several European cities.[tpl]Cite news | author=Rob Kaiser | title = Southwest may add cities to Iceland deal | publisher=Baltimore Business Journal | date = February 21, 1997 | url = http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/1997/02/24/story6.html?page=1 | accessdate =June 10, 2007[/tpl] The frequent flyer programs were not included in the agreement. This arrangement lasted for several years but ended when Icelandair's service to BWI ended in January 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2007/12/10/daily11.html|title=Icelandair stopping flights out of BWI|publisher=bizjournals.com|date=December 10, 2007|first=Robert J.|last=Terry[/tpl]
In a departure from its traditional "go it alone" strategy, Southwest entered into its first domestic codesharing arrangement with ATA, which enabled Southwest Airlines to serve ATA markets in Hawaii, Washington, D.C., and New York City.
At the time of ATA's demise in April 2008, the airline offered over 70 flights a week to Hawaii from Southwest's focus cities in PHX, LAS, LAX, and OAK with connections available to many other cities across the United States. The ATA/Southwest codeshare was terminated when ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 3, 2008. Southwest ultimately acquired the operating certificate and some of the landing rights of ATA in the ensuing proceedings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/releases/e89b5d36-734b-55cc-c781-936d4b4663a0?search=ata+airlines |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: Releases |publisher=Swamedia.com |date=2008-04-03 |accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]
On July 8, 2008, Southwest Airlines officially announced the intent to begin a codeshare agreement with WestJet of Canada, giving the two airlines the ability to sell seats on each other's flights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/DN-westjet_09bus.ART0.State.Edition1.4dd5531.html |title=Southwest, WestJet sign code-sharing pact |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |date=July 9, 2008| accessdate=August 22, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] Originally, the partnership was to be finalized by late 2009, but had been postponed due to economic conditions.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssAirlines/idUSBNG49051220090525 |title=Southwest, WestJet delay codeshare |agency=Reuters |date=May 25, 2009| accessdate=August 22, 2009[/tpl]
On April 16, 2010, Southwest and WestJet airlines amicably agreed to terminate the implementation of a codeshare agreement between the two airlines.
Southwest announced its second international codeshare agreement on November 10, 2008, with Mexican low-cost carrier Volaris. The agreement allowed Southwest to sell tickets on Volaris flights.[tpl]cite web|author=Your name: * |url=http://www.blogsouthwest.com/news/swa-to-offer-online-link-to-volaris-service-on-southwestcom |title=Swa To Offer Online Link To Volaris Service On Southwest.Com | Nuts About Southwest |publisher=Blogsouthwest.com |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 22, 2011[/tpl] However on February 22, 2013, the connecting agreement was terminated.  It was said to be mutual between the airlines.  Most industry experts believe that the expansion of the subsidiary of Southwest, AirTran Airways, into more Mexican markets, as a main reason for the termination of the agreement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/southwest-and-volaris-to-end-partnership-382084/ |title=Southwest and Volaris to end partnership |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2013-06-20[/tpl]

===Codeshare agreements===

Southwest does not participate in any major global airline alliances, but the airline has a codeshare agreement with AirTran Airways. The agreement started only after Southwest acquired AirTran.

===Fleet history===

===Livery===

Southwest's original primary livery was desert gold, red and orange, with pinstripes of white separating each section of color. The word Southwest appeared in white on the desert gold portion of the tail. On the original three 737-200s, from June 1971, on the left side of the plane, the word Southwest was placed along the upper rear portion of the fuselage, with the word Airlines painted on the tail where Southwest is today N21SW. On the right side, the word Southwest was in the same place as today, but also had the word Airlines painted on the upper rear portion of the fuselage.N20SW.
Southwest introduced the current canyon blue livery on January 16, 2001, the first primary livery change in Southwest's then 30-year history. Spirit One was the first plane painted in the canyon blue fleet color scheme. The new livery replaces the former primary color, desert gold, with canyon blue and changes the Southwest text and pinstripes to gold. The orange and red stripes continue to be used. The pinstripe along the plane is drawn in a more curved pattern instead of the straight horizontal line separating the colors in the original. For aircraft equipped with blended winglets, the blended winglets are painted to include the text Southwest.com. Southwest completed repainting its entire fleet with the new Canyon Blue livery in early 2010; however, The Colleen Barrett Classic (N714CB), The Herbert D. Kelleher One (N711HK), & The Metallic Gold One (N792SW),  which are Boeing 737–700 aircraft, retain the original desert gold livery.

===Special liveries===

Some Southwest aircraft feature special liveries. Southwest gives these aircraft special names, usually ending in "One". All special liveries prior to Spirit One wore the standard Desert Gold, red and orange colors on the vertical stabilizer and rudder. Subsequent special liveries including Maryland One, Slam Dunk One and others feature tails with the canyon blue livery. All earlier specials, with the exception of Triple Crown One, have been repainted to match. Aircraft painted in special liveries have white painted blended winglets.

Southwest maintains excellent customer satisfaction ratings; for many years, according to the Department of Transportation Southwest ranked number one (lowest number of complaints) of all U.S. airlines for customer complaints. Southwest Airlines has consistently received the fewest ratio of complaints per passengers boarded of all major U.S. carriers that have been reporting statistics to the Department of Transportation (DOT) since September 1987, which is when the DOT began tracking Customer Satisfaction statistics and publishing its Air Travel Consumer Report.
Prior to 2007, Southwest boarded passengers by grouping the passengers into three groups, labeled A, B and C. Passengers would line up at their specified letter and board.[tpl]cite web|last=Lollis |first=Barbara De |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=3624856&page=1#.UEEvWkLT0fM |title=Southwest to Change Boarding Process - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 19, 2012[/tpl] In 2007, Southwest modified their boarding procedure by introducing a number.

===In-flight entertainment===

After completing a testing phase that began in February 2009, Southwest announced on August 21, 2009 that it would begin rolling out in-flight wi-fi Internet connectivity via Row 44's satellite-broadband based product.

==Rapid Rewards==

Southwest first began to offer a frequent-flyer program on June 20, 1987, calling it The Company Club. Unlike competitor's programs which were based on miles flown, The Company Club credited for trips flown regardless of distance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/1985-to-1989 |title=1985 to 1989 |year=2011 |work=swamedia.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfEfYJoF |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |quote=...Southwest introduces "The Company Club," a frequent flyer program based on total trips flown, regardless of distance...[/tpl] Southwest Airlines renamed its frequent flyer program Rapid Rewards on April 25, 1996.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Date/pages/1995-to-1997 |title=1995 to 1997 |year=2011 |work=swamedia.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfEDlww7 |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |quote="Rapid Rewards" officially takes the place of "The Company Club" as the new name for our frequent flier program.[/tpl]
The original Rapid Rewards program offered one credit per one-way flight from an origin to a destination including any stops or connections on Southwest Airlines. When 16 credits were accumulated in a 24 month period, Southwest awarded one free round-trip ticket that was valid for 12 months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southwest.com/rapid_rewards/rules_and_regs.html |title=Rapid Rewards Membership Rules |date=August 2, 2010 |work=southwest.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfAj0Car |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |quote=One credit will be given for each Southwest Airlines flight flown.[/tpl] Beginning March 1, 2011, Rapid Rewards changed to a points system based on ticket cost.[tpl]cite web |url=http://swamedia.com/releases/e7b3eef4-9551-7110-d957-0d004d252569 |title=Southwest Airlines Introduces The All-New Rapid Rewards Program! |date=2011-01-05 |work=swamedia.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfAIpWvU |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |quote=...Rapid Rewards program, the carrier’s frequent flyer program...[/tpl] Members earn and redeem points based on a three-tier fare scale multiplier and the cost of the ticket.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southwest.com/newRR/redeemPoints.do |title=Redeem Points |year=2011 |work=southwest.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfBDpOCb |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |quote=Lower fares require fewer points.[/tpl]
Customers could earn one-half credit by using a Southwest partner to book any car rental or hotel stay, regardless of whether a Southwest flight is involved. Rapid Reward members can also earn one credit for every US$1,200 charged to a Rapid Rewards branded Visa credit card, with charges from Southwest or its partners counting double by dollars spent. Members could register their credit card with Rapid Rewards Dining to receive 0.25 credits for every US$100 spent at restaurant partners. In early 2009, Southwest announced their first retail partner, TeleFlora Flower Club, from which members can earn 0.5 or 1 credit with each flower order, depending on the total cost of the order.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.southwest.com/rapid_rewards/preferred_partners.html#cars |title=Rapid Rewards Partners |year=2010 |work=southwest.com |publisher=Southwest Airlines Co |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vfCNeCFG |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |quote=Learn how to receive Rapid Rewards credit through our Partners![/tpl]
On January 6, 2011, Southwest introduced an updated version of Rapid Rewards. Changes include no blackout dates, seat restrictions or expiring credits. It also adds more options to use points.

==Controversies==

On June 22, 2011, a March 25 recording of an in-flight transmission of Southwest pilot Captain James Taylor apparently unintentionally broadcasting a conversation with his co-pilot was released to the press.

According to Southwest, the pilot was reprimanded, temporarily suspended without pay and received diversity education before being reinstated. Captain Taylor also sent an e-mail apology to all of Southwest's employees, especially the crew bases who were criticized.[tpl]Cite news|title=Southwest disciplines pilot for rant during flight|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/06/22/airline.pilot.rant/ | work=CNN | date=June 23, 2011[/tpl] CNN Travel – Retrieved June 22, 2011[tpl]Cite news|title=Southwest Airlines Pilot's Rant – Transcript, Here's What He Said|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110628012804/http://www.sure-start.com/southwest-airlines-pilots-rant-transcript-heres-what-he-said/3675417/[/tpl] Sure Start Consumer News, at web.archive.org.
