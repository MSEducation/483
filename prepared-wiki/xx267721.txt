==Plot==

Ronak Kaul (Rajeev Khandelwaal) lives, eats and breathes music. Music is his life. Having inherited the talent and passion for music from his deceased father, he wants to make sure that he doesn’t inherit one thing from his father – failure. So when he arrives in the City of Dreams, Mumbai, to make it big in the music field he pushes himself – and more – to make his dream come true. Starting as a DJ in his uncle’s (Yatin Karyekar) night club Tango Charlie, owned by Charlie (Mohan Kapoor), he soon finds himself expanding his avenues to establishing his own studio, making his own music and finally composing the same for a movie by Anurag Kashyap. But along with virtues come vices, as Ronak finds himself falling deeper into the world of alcohol, smoking and drugs as he gets into a relationship with Shonali (Mrinalini Sharma). Trouble starts when Ronak wakes up one day to realise that there’s a constant ringing sound in his ears which makes normal hearing difficult. Initially dismissing it as a temporary problem, his work schedule goes for a toss when the problem persists. Visits to doctor reveal that he has tinnitus, inherited from his father and aggravated by his lifestyle. Eventually a freak accident renders him totally deaf which pushes him into a deep state of depression. Things change when Ronak meets Gauri (Soha Ali Khan), who too is hearing impaired but has mastered the art of lip-reading. In Gauri, Ronak finds a tutor and life-partner. Also his passion for music is rekindled, as he attempts to sense sound (if not hear) and study digital waveforms of tunes he knew, to create new music. Thereby a deaf DJ becomes a renowned composer.
