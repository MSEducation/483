[[Flag of Cuba]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Cuba, National flags

The flag of Cuba consists of five blue and white alternating stripes, and a red equilateral triangle at the hoist with a white 5-pointed star. It was adopted on June 25, 1848. 

==Birth of the flag==

The Cuban flag was created by Narciso López in June 25, 1848, and put together by Emilia Teurbe Tolón.
The flag's origins date from 1848, when various movements to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule emerged, mainly among Cuban exiles in the United States. Anti-Spanish Cuban exiles under the leadership of Narciso López adopted a flag suggested by the poet Miguel Teurbe Tolón. His design incorporates three blue stripes, representing the three parts that the country was divided during the independence wars, central, occidental, and oriental areas of the country, and two white stripes symbolizing the purity of the patriotic cause. The red triangle stands for the blood shed to free the nation, which is placed where the star is, symbolizing the sky turned red from the blood shed in battle. The white star in the triangle stands for independence. López carried this flag in battle at Cárdenas (1850) and Playitas (1851). Although López was not victorious, this was the first instance of the flag being raised in Cuba.[tpl]cite book|last=Chaffin|first=Tom|title=Fatal Glory: Narciso López and the First Clandestine U.S. War Against Cuba|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LLxyiuCGEGIC&pg=PA222|accessdate=16 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807129197|pages=222–[/tpl]
At the first independence war, the Ten Years' War, there was another flag in use, the "flag of Yara" also called "flag of La Demajagua"; while the flag with the triangle and the stripes became the official Cuban flag, the Yara flag is hoisted "wherever the legislators of the Cuban people meet"; in particular it is displayed, along with the national flag, in the National Assembly.

==Subsequent use of the flag==

In April 1869, Narciso López's flag was designated the national banner by the Congress of the Republic of Cuba in Arms. López's flag was the model for the flag of Puerto Rico adopted in 1892 by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, a pro-independence group that worked under the auspices of Cuban Revolutionary Party.
After the United States seized Cuba from Spain during the Spanish-American War, the Stars and Stripes flew from January 1, 1899, until independence was granted. On May 20, 1902, the Cuban national flag was hoisted as a symbol of independence and sovereignty. It has been used ever since, remaining unchanged after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. During the revolution, Cuban president Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement created a party flag equally divided in red and black like the Angolan national flag usually in horizontal stripes and often with inscriptions, which is often flown on public buildings.
