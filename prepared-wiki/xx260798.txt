[[Church of the Virgin Mary (Prague Castle)]]

CATEGORIES: Churches in Prague

The Church of the Virgin Mary was the first known church built in the current area of the Prague Castle.  The structure was built by Prince Borivoj I between 882 - 884, making it not only the oldest church in Prague Castle but also the second oldest in Bohemia.  The church was rebuilt after a fire in the 11th century, but was eventually destroyed again in the 13th century and not rebuilt; it is known today due to excavations directly under extant administrative buildings.  The surviving foundations indicate a rectangular nave and a semicircular apse; archaeological surveys uncovered tombs for members of the royal PÅ™emyslid dynasty which was prominent in Bohemia during the early Christian era.
