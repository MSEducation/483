Manic Panic is a store chain based in New York City. The company is run by Tish and Snooky Bellomo. 

==History==

Manic Panic opened its doors for the first time in 1977, with a store in New York. Since then, the store has opened establishments in many other places, including Japan. Apart from store operations, the Manic Panic company has also gone into the hair dye manufacturing industry, becoming one of the leaders in that area.
In 2004, MTV mentioned Manic Panic in a television documentary, crediting them for beginning what would become a trend of men and women wearing different hair colors in the 1990s into the 2000s.
Marilyn Manson uses many Manic Panic products. Singer Cyndi Lauper also used Manic Panic products (Electric Sunshine).
Professional wrestler Jeff Hardy uses Manic Panic hair dye.
The NYC store's front and signage are featured prominently in a shot in the opening montage of Saturday Night Live's 1980-81 season.
In 2010, seven colors of the hair dye (Black N' Blue, Deadly Nightshade, Divine Wine, Electric Sunshine, Flaming, Plum Passion and Tiger Lily) were discontinued, reducing the number of available colors from 33 to 26. According to insiders at the company, Electric Sunshine was undergoing a reformulation, but then the colors were removed from the line-up altogether.

==Products==

Apart from hair dye, Manic Panic sells many other products geared towards punk and gothic consumers. These include nail polish, vegan boas, eyelashes, foundation, eyeshadow, t-shirts, baseball caps, and others. Some but not all of their products are vegan, containing synthetics instead of animal ingredients.
