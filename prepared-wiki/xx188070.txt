Mont Fort is a mountain of the Pennine Alps, located near Verbier in the Swiss canton of Valais. It lies on the range between the valleys of Bagnes and Nendaz, north of the Rosablanche. With a height of 3,329 metres above sea level, Mont Fort is the highest summit north of the Col de Louvie (2,921 m).
Mont Fort is surrounded by several glaciers, the largest being the Glacier de Tortin, on its northwestern side. The second largest is the Glacier du Mont Fort, located on its northeastern side. On its eastern side lies the lower summit Petit Mont Fort (3,135 m). The Glacier du Petit Mont Fort lies between the two summits. There are no glaciers on the south side of the mountain. A small lake named Lac du Petit Mont Fort (2,764 m) lies on the south flank. 
The summit of Mont Fort is easily accessible by cable car from the heights of Verbier or Nendaz. The cable cars from the two valleys converge at the intermediate station (2,894 m) north of the Col des Gentianes, the upper section reaching a height of 3,308 metres. In the winter and early spring season, the mountain, including the Glacier de Tortin, is the culminating point of the 4 Vall√©es ski area.
