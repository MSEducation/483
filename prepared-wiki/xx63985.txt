==Early life and education==

Hajjarian was born in Shiraz in 1954. He studied mechanical engineering at Tehran University. In 1977 Hajjarian was enrolled in mechanical engineering undergraduate program but then he shifted to political sciences and received his doctoral qualification from Tehran University in 2003. A young Iranian revolutionary during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, he was one of the students who took over the US embassy in Tehran in 1979.

==Career==

After the revolution, Hajjarian involved in the formation of the intelligence apparatus of the newly founded Islamic Republic. Through the 1980s, he was working in the ministry of intelligence, where his positions included vice minister for political affairs. In the late 1980s, he left the ministry, and established Center for Strategic Research under the presidency. That was where he played an important role in creating a new discourse based on democracy and rule of law for his generation of revolutionaries.
When Mohammad Khatami was elected President in 1997, he appointed Hajjarian his political advisor. In 1999, he was elected to the city council of Tehran in the first city elections after the 1979 revolution. Hajjarian was also the editor of Sobh-e Emrooz newspaper, which was a strong advocate of Khatami's reforms. He was believed to be the source of information for many articles written by the investigative journalists, Akbar Ganji and Emadeddin Baghi. These included stories about the "Chain murders" of dissident intellectuals by members of Iran's intelligence ministry.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Assassination attempt==

In March, 2000 he was shot in the face by a gunman on the doorstep of Tehran's city council.[tpl]cite news|last=Blanche|first=Ed|title='Rogue agent' convictions leave many questions unanswered|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60ROGUE+AGENT'+CONVICTIONS+LEAVE+MANY+QUESTIONS+UNANSWERED.-a071705532|accessdate=21 June 2013|newspaper=The Middle East|date=1 March 2001[/tpl] The would-be assassin fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice. The bullet entered through his left cheek and lodged in his neck, and put Hajjarian into a coma. During this time, groups of young Iranians kept vigil outside Sina hospital, where he was being treated. Hajjarian was badly paralyzed for life.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
His assailant, Saeed Asgar, a young man who was reported to be a member of the Basij militia, was later arrested and sentenced to spend 15 years in jail.[tpl]cite news|last=Sachs|first=Susan|title=2 Trials Focus Attention on Iranian Justice|work=The New York Times| accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Five Jailed Over Iran Shooting|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl] But he was released after spending only a short term in prison. Asgar was accompanied by Mohsen Morteza Majidi on a motorbike. Others, who were involved, include Mohammad Ali Moghaddami, Mehdi Rowghani, Mousa Jan Nesari, Ali Pourchaluei (possibly the one who shot Hajjarian), Saeed Golounani and  Safar Maghsoudi.[tpl]cite news|title=Agency publishes names of suspects involved in Hajjarian case| work=BBC Monitoring Middle East|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl]

===Possible cause===

His attempted assassination is thought to be associated with the exposure of the "Chain murders"  in his Sobh Emrouz daily newspaper, and the "key role" he is believed to have played "in bringing about ... damaging disclosures," both as the editor of the exposing newspaper and one of the few reformists likely to be a source of information about activity in the intelligence ministry. Consequently, "some believe that remnants" of the chain murder "intelligence killer group may have been" behind his attempted assassination.The New Yorker, "Protest Vote," 29 June 2009, p.23 Retrieved 11 July 2009

===Recovery===

Hajjarian slowly recovered somewhat from the shooting. By 2005, Hajjarian was still unable to speak with a clear voice and still using the wheelchair, although could walk with help.[tpl]cite web|last=Secor |first=Laura |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051121fa_fact4 |title=New Yorker magazine, "Fugitives, Young Iranians confront the collapse of the reform movement", Laura Secor, 21 November 2005 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2013-11-10[/tpl] As of 2009 he still spoke with difficulty and was "dependent on the constant care of doctors and family."

==Research works and viewpoints==

According to author Abbas Milani, Hajjarian argued that domination of politics by clerics was wrong, but could be gradually eroded by "mobilizing the masses and using them as bargaining chips with Iran's rulers."The New Republic, "The New Democrats"  by Abbas Milani, July 15, 2009 (not available for free online) His strategy for the reform movement was described by another journalist as extending the reformists "reach by triangulating between the mass movement they represented and the autocratic state with which they shared power. He coined the phrase that would define the reformists’ strategy: Pressure from below, negotiation at the top.”
Hajjarian argued that there is a way of combating the predominance of Valiyat al-faqih (rule of the Islamic jurist) by underlining the de facto secularization of religion by the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Khomeini. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the interests of the Islamic Republic are paramount in Islam and that zakat, salat, hajj, and everything else in Islam, are subordinant. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1177/0037768604043006[/tpl]
