[[Ceol Meadhonach]]

CATEGORIES: Bagpiping, Scottish music

Ce√≤l Meadhonach is the Gaelic-language term for "middle music," which in bagpiping includes such forms as slow airs and jigs. The genre thus includes "tunes as are neither constructed to the measure of Piobaireachd, nor adapted to the quick march or dance." Campbell, John and Archibald Campbell: "The Kilberry Book of Ceol Meadhonach." Glasgow: Peter Henderson, 1909.
