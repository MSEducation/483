McCluer North High School, founded in 1971, is a public school in Florissant, Missouri. The McCluer North campus is centrally located in the Ferguson-Florissant School District. Located in a residential area, the campus is bounded by Waterford Drive, St. Catherine and Parker Road. Facing the site is the Florissant Civic Center and its [tpl]Convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] park-like setting. Immediately adjacent is the District Administrative Offices that include services for students and families in the Community School Program, PROBE Gifted Program, comprehensive Early Education services and the Child Development Center, a professionally run day care center that operates in conjunction with McCluer North's Child Development classes. On the Parker Road side of the campus, McCluer North backs up to Parker Road Elementary School.
McCluer North was designed to provide adaptable and flexible space for a variety of instructional activities that include large-group presentations, small-group work and independent study. The multi-level building features a Student Concourse and Commons area that has a cafeteria and an outdoor plaza where staff and students can socialize. A focal point in the school is the Instructional Materials Center (IMC) which serves as a library center where students can conduct research, independent study, guided or independent reading. The Counseling Center, located in the IMC, provides a full range of services for students.
During her 2008 bid for the presidency, Senator Hillary Clinton made a campaign stop at McCluer North. Bill and Chelsea Clinton also showed up for the campaign rally, which was held in the school's gymnasium. http://interact.stltoday.com/blogzone/political-fix/political-fix/2008/01/clinton-time-returns/
