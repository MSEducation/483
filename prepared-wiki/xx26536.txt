===Homosexual meaning===

By the time "The Adventure of the Second Stain" was published, the term was starting to gain a denotation of sexual deviance, referring to homosexual and/or effeminate males. An early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in an 1894 letter by John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry.[tpl]cite book |last= Foldy|first= Michael S. |year= 1997|title= The Trials of Oscar Wilde: Deviance, Morality, and Late-Victorian Society |publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 9780300071122|page=22[/tpl] Usage of queer as a derogatory term for effeminate gay males become prominent in the 20th century.

===Reappropriation===

Beginning in the late 1980s, the label queer began to be reappropriated from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBT people. An early example of this usage by the LGBT community was by an organisation called Queer Nation, which was formed in March 1990 and circulated an anonymous flier at the New York Gay Pride Parade in June 1990 titled "Queers Read This".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this|title= Queers Read This |last1= Queer Nation |date= June 1990[/tpl] The flier included a passage explaining their adoption of the label queer:[tpl]quote|Ah, do we really have to use that word?  It's trouble. Every gay person has his or her own take on it. For some it means strange and eccentric and kind of mysterious.... And for others "queer" conjures up those awful memories of adolescent suffering... Well, yes, "gay" is great.  It has its place.  But when a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning we feel angry and disgusted, not gay.  So we've chosen to call ourselves queer. Using "queer" is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world.[/tpl]
The term may be capitalized when referring to an identity or community, rather than as an objective fact describing a person's desires, in a construction akin to the capitalized use of Deaf.
In the late 2000s (decade) and early 2010s, a number of communities started to use the term, to represent  inclusivity of forms of sexuality, gender identities and intersex status inadequately represented by the LGBT acronym.

==Inclusivity and scope==

Because of the context in which it was reclaimed, queer has sociopolitical connotations, and is often preferred by those who are activists; by those who strongly reject traditional gender identities; by those who reject distinct sexual identities such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and straight; and by those who see themselves as oppressed by the heteronormativity of the larger culture. In this usage it retains the historical connotation of "outside the bounds of normal society" and can be construed as "breaking the rules for sex and gender". It can be preferred because of its ambiguity, which allows queer-identifying people to avoid the sometimes strict boundaries that surround other labels.  In this context, queer is not strictly a synonym for LGBT as it creates a space for queer heterosexuals as well as non-queer homosexuals.
The range of what queer includes varies. In addition to referring to LGBT-identifying people, it can also encompass: pansexual, pomosexual,pomosexual at Wiktionary.org intersex, genderqueer, asexual and autosexual people, as well as gender normative heterosexuals whose sexual orientations or activities place them outside the heterosexual-defined mainstream, e.g., BDSM practitioners, or polyamorous persons.
For some queer-identified people, part of the point of the term queer is that it simultaneously builds up and tears down boundaries of identity. For instance, among genderqueer people, who do not solidly identify with one particular gender, once solid gender roles have been torn down, it becomes difficult to situate sexual identity.  For some people, the non-specificity of the term is liberating. Queerness becomes a way to make a political move against heteronormativity while simultaneously refusing to engage in traditional essentialist identity politics."Alphabet Soup: Labels and Empowerment".

In academia, the term queer and the related verb queering broadly indicate the study of literature, discourse, academic fields, and other social and cultural areas from a non-heteronormative perspective. It often means studying a subject against the grain from the perspective of gender studies.

Organizations such as the Irish Queer Archive attempt to collect and preserve history related to queer studies.
Queer theory is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Applications of queer theory include queer theology and queer pedagogy.

In India, pride parades include Queer Azaadi Mumbai and the Delhi Queer Pride Parade. The use of queer and Q is also widespread in Australia, including national counselling and support service Qlifehttps://www.qlife.org.au and Q News.
Other social movements exist as offshoots of queer culture or combinations of queer identity with other views. Adherents of queer nationalism support the notion that the LGBT community forms a distinct people due to their unique culture and customs. Queercore (originally homocore) is a  is a cultural and social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of punk expressed in a do-it-yourself style through zines, music, writing, art and film.
The term queer migration is used to describe the movement of LGBTQ people around the world often to escape discrimination or ill treatment due to their orientation or gender expression. Organizations such as the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees attempt to assist individuals in such relocations.

==Controversial nature of the term==
