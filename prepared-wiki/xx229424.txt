[[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics â€“ Men's 10,000 metres]]

CATEGORIES: Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics, 10,000 metres at the Olympics

The men's 10,000 metres event was part of the track and field athletics programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The competition was held on Sunday, July 6, 1924.
Paavo Nurmi the greatest long-distance runner at that time did not compete in this race, as the Finnish officials asked him not to start in this event. They thought he was entered in too many competitions. Only a few weeks after the Olympics on August 31 Nurmi set a new world record with 30:06.2 in Kuopio.
As for all other races the track was 500 metres in circumference.
The exact number of starters is unknown, but photographs show around 35 competitors. At least 33 - maybe 36 - long-distance runners from 16 nations competed.
