Hattersley is a residential area in the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, in Greater Manchester, England. It is 4 miles west of Glossop and 10 miles east of Manchester city centre. Historically part of Tintwistle Rural District in Cheshire until 1974, it lies on the eastern fringe of Greater Manchester. It is the site of an overspill estate built by Manchester City Council.[tpl]cite web | title=Hattersley History| work=Hattersley 2005| url=http://hattersley.org.uk/discover/history.htm | accessdate=23 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929062029/http://hattersley.org.uk/discover/history.htm  |archivedate = 29 September 2007[/tpl]

==History==

===Construction of the estate===

Between 1894 and 1936 Hattersley was a civil parish in the Tintwistle Rural District in the historical county of Cheshire. In 1936 it was annexed to the municipal borough of Hyde but remained undeveloped. In the 1960s most of the area was purchased by Manchester City Council to build a large overspill estate. Another estate was built in Gamesley. Both these estates consist primarily of council-owned houses.

===Renewal and privatisation===

Regeneration in Hattersley is coordinated by Hattersley Neighbourhood Partnership.
The city council transferred control of most of Hattersley's housing stock to Peak Valley Housing Association in 2006 after an attempt to transfer it to the Harvest Housing Group which collapsed when a £20 million gap in funding to refurbish the homes to new housing standards was identified. The transfer will bring a £40 million, seven-year improvement plan for existing housing tied to a  £140m investment from a private developer. 
Selective demolition has begun to remove some obsolete housing leaving space for redevelopment and investment in education and public services. Seven 1960s tower blocks were demolished in 2000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.connellbrothers.co.uk/hattersley.html | title=Hattersley Project Demolition of 7 Multi-storey Tower Blocks |publisher=Connell Brothers |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090420043210/http://www.connellbrothers.co.uk/hattersley.html |archivedate=20 April 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2014[/tpl] Demolition of 1960s low-rise houses on the estate took place in 2007 and 2008.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hattersley.org.uk/global-assets/pdf/3873_Exhibtion_Rev1_November07_Lowres.pdf|title=BASE Regeneration - Hattersley – Public consultion for Phase 1b and new phase 2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081203085534/http://www.hattersley.org.uk/global-assets/pdf/3873_Exhibtion_Rev1_November07_Lowres.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2008 |date=November 2007 |publisher=Taylor Young |accessdate=8 March 2014[/tpl]
In 2008 the Tameside Advertiser reported that leader of Tameside Council, Roy Oldham, claimed that a Tesco supermarket would be built on part of a site earmarked for a new district centre, causing concern to residents.

==Crime==

Moors murderers Myra Hindley and her grandmother (the actual tenant) were rehoused in Hattersley in 1964 and lived at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue. Ian Brady spent much of his time at the house with Hindley and together they carried out the killings of ten-year-old Lesley-Ann Downey and seventeen-year-old Edward Evans, at the property. The body of Lesley-Ann Downey was buried on nearby Saddleworth Moor the day after her murder on Boxing Day 1964, but the body of Edward Evans was found at the house in October 1965 before the couple could dispose of it. In October 1987, Manchester City Council demolished the house as they could not find tenants willing to live there.[tpl]cite news |title=Hindley link goes |newspaper=The Times |date=6 October 1987 |accessdate=11 February 2011[/tpl]
