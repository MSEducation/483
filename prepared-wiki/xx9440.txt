The modern Olympic Games (French: Jeux olympiques"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.", http://www.olympic.org/fr/.(..)) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions wherein thousands of athletes variously compete. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has caused several changes to the Olympic Games. Among these adjustments are creating the Winter Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has adapted to economic, political, and technological advancements, shifting the Olympics from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allow participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercializing the Games. World wars caused the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games to be cancelled. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.
The Olympic Movement comprises international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC chooses each Games' host city, and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC determined the olympic program, which comprises the sports to be contested at the Games.  There are several Olympic rituals and symbols; e.g., the Olympic flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.
The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented, creating many challenges such as boycotts, doping, bribery, and acts of terrorism. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame and the host city and country to present themselves to the world.

==Ancient Olympics==

The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.[tpl]r|Swaddling 2000 p54[/tpl] This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.[tpl]cite web|title=The Olympic Truce – Myth and Reality by Harvey Abrams|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/abrams1.html|publisher=Classics Technology Center, AbleMedia.com|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;[tpl]sfn|Young|2004|p=12[/tpl] one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games.[tpl]sfn|Richardson|1992|p=227[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Young|2004|pp=12–13[/tpl] According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games "Olympic" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labors, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honor to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a "stadion" ([tpl]lang-el|στάδιον[/tpl], Latin: stadium, "stage"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC.[tpl]cite web|title=Olympic Games|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/59589/The-ancient-Olympic-Games|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|format=registration required|accessdate=29 April 2009[/tpl] The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events.[tpl]sfn|Crowther|2007|pp=59–61[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Ancient Olympic Events|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/sports.html|publisher=Perseus Project of Tufts University|accessdate=29 April 2009[/tpl] Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion.[tpl]sfn|Golden|2009|p=24[/tpl]
The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.[tpl]sfn|Burkert|1983|p=95[/tpl] The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues.[tpl]sfn|Swaddling|1999|pp=90–93[/tpl] The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.Olympic Museum, "The Olympic Games in Antiquity", p. 2
The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.However, Theodosius' decree contains no specific reference to Olympia [tpl]harv|Crowther|2007|p=54[/tpl]. Another date commonly cited is 426 AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.[tpl]sfn|Crowther|2007|p=54[/tpl]

==Modern Games==

===Forerunners===

Various uses of the term "Olympic" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the Cotswold Games or "Cotswold Olimpick Games", an annual meeting near Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports. It was first organized by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The British Olympic Association, in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as "the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings".[tpl]citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl]
L'Olympiade de la République, a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games. The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the metric system into sport.
In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by Dr. William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock, in Shropshire, England. In 1859, Dr. Brookes changed the name to the Wenlock Olympian Games. This annual sports festival continues to this day.[tpl]sfn|Young|2004|p=144[/tpl] The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr. Brookes on 15 November 1860.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=28[/tpl]
Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.[tpl]sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=53–54[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Weiler|2004[/tpl] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[tpl]r|Girginov Parry 2005 p38[/tpl] In 1865 Hulley, Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=24[/tpl] In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized at London's Crystal Palace.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml |title= Much Wenlock & the Olympian Connection |publisher= Wenlock Olympian Society |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123183803/http://www.wenlock-olympian-society.org.uk/william-penny-brookes/index.shtml  |archivedate= 23 January 2009[/tpl]

===Revival===

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem "Dialogue of the Dead", published in 1833.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=1[/tpl] Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=14[/tpl] Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=14[/tpl]
The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|pp=2, 13–23, 81[/tpl] Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=44[/tpl] In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years. He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.[tpl]sfn|Coubertin|Philemon|Politis|Anninos|1897|p=8|loc=Part 2[/tpl] The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|pp=100–105[/tpl]

===1896 Games===

The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/Athens-1896/ |title=Athens 1896 |publisher=The International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl] Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=117[/tpl]Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa – Athens 1893, by F. MartensL'affaire Zappa – Paris 1894, by G. Streit George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=128[/tpl] The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.[tpl]sfn|Young|1996|p=128[/tpl]
Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl]

===Changes and adaptations===

After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the World's fair at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. The Games at Paris did not have a stadium; but was notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement.[tpl]cite web |url= http://proxy.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/fanguide/history?year=1904 |title= St. Louis 1904 – Overview |publisher= ESPN |accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl] The Games rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These Games are not officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/05/f-olympics-feature-1906.html |title= 1906 Olympics mark 10th anniversary of the Olympic revival |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 28 May 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl]

====Winter Games====

The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although the same country was originally intended to host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm |title= Winter Olympics History |publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation |accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl] This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

====Paralympics====

In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabitation of soldiers after World War II, organized a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics. Guttmann's event, known then as the Stoke Mandeville Games, became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the 1960 Olympic Games, in Rome, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics", which became known as the first Paralympics. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7582206.stm |title= History of the Paralympics |publisher= BBC Sport |accessdate=2 February 2009 | date=4 September 2008[/tpl] In 2001 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.[tpl]cite web|title=IPC-IOC Cooperation|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|url=http://oldwebsite.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation|accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl] The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Chairman of the London organising committee, Lord Coe, said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and Olympics in London that,

====Youth Games====

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.[tpl]cite news |last= Rice |first= John |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-07-05-2774646336_x.htm |title=IOC approves Youth Olympics; first set for 2010 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= USA Today |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2009[/tpl] The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14–26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later.[tpl]cite web|title=Innsbruck is the host city for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|date=12 December 2008|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/61888/32574/1t8ch2t/innsbruck-is-the-host-city-for.html|accessdate=30 March 2009[/tpl] These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2007-07-05-olympic-notes_N.htm |title= IOC votes to start Youth Olympics in 2010 |first= Vicky |last= Michaelis |date= 5 July 2007 |work= USA Today |accessdate=2 February 2009[/tpl]

===21st century games===

From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/london-2012-summer-olympics|title=London 2012|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=12 July 2012[/tpl] The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, Vancouver hosted 2,566 athletes from 82 nations competing in 86 events during the 2010 Winter Olympics.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.olympic.org/vancouver-2010-winter-olympics|title= Vancouver 2010 |publisher= International Olympic Committee |accessdate=12 July 2012[/tpl] During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village. This village is intended to be a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.[tpl]cite web|title=Beijing to build convenient Olympic village|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262207.shtml|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=4 May 2009[/tpl]
The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games. Examples of this include territories such as Puerto Rico, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country.[tpl]cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070003/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2009|page=61|format=PDF|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=28 July 2011[/tpl] The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nation which qualify as "an independent State recognized by the international community".[tpl]cite web|title=The Olympic Charter|url=http://www.asksam.com/ebooks/releases.asp?doc_handle=135969&file=Olympic-Charter.ask&query=recognised%20by%20the%20international%20community&search=yes|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] Therefore, it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for Sint Maarten and Curaçao when they gained the same constitutional status as Aruba in 2010, although the IOC had recognized the Aruban Olympic Committee in 1986.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/executive-board-concludes-first-meeting-of-the-new-year/112731|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|title=Executive Board concludes first meeting of the new year|publisher=olympic.org ("Official website of the Olympic movement")[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-jose-perurena?articleid=133159|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|work=Olympic.org|accessdate=3 July 2012[/tpl]

===Economic and social impact on host cities and countries===

Many economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such "mega-events" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.Rose, A. K., & Spiegel, M. M. (2011). The Olympic Effect*. The Economic Journal, 121(553), 652–677. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. "Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities." Administrative Science Quarterly, 58(1): 111–148.. The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.Glynn, M. A. (2008). "Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community." Journal of Management Studies, 45(6), 1117–1146. The 2014 Winter Games in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of $50 billion. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/economic-impact-winter-olympics-not-great-russia-sochi-stands-gain-1554153|title=The Economic Impact Of The Winter Olympics: Not Great For Russia But Sochi Stands To Gain|date=8 February 2014|agency=International Business Times|work=ibtimes.com|accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

==International Olympic Committee==

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations, recognized media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter. As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.
The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.[tpl]sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=53|loc=Rule 24[/tpl]

===Criticism===

The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization, with several members on the committee for life. The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising.[tpl]sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=52–60[/tpl] He was accused of both racism, for his handling of the apartheid issue with the South African delegation, and antisemitism.[tpl]sfn|Maraniss|2008|pp=60–69[/tpl] Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption.[tpl]cite news |title=Samaranch Defends Nominating Son for IOC Post|publisher=CBC Sports|date=18 May 2001|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2001/05/18/ioc010516.html|accessdate=4 February 2009[/tpl] Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.[tpl]cite news|title=Olympics:Barcelona Profile; Samaranch, Under the Gun Shoots Back|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=30 June 1992|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB173FF933A05755C0A964958260|accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl]
In 1998, it was uncovered that several IOC members had taken bribes from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others. The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected, to avoid similar cases in the future.[tpl]cite news |title=Judge Drops Olympic Bid Case|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=6 December 2003|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/06/sports/sp-saltlakecity6|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl]
A BBC documentary entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city.

The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.[tpl]cite news|first=Howard|last=Berkes|title=How Turin got the Games|publisher=National Public Radio|date=7 February 2006|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195274|accessdate=4 February 2009[/tpl]
In July 2012, The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics, "a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes."[tpl]cite web|title=Olympic Committee's Refusal to Honor Munich 11 Mired in 'Stubborn Insensitivity and Callousness'|url=http://archive.adl.org/PresRele/TerrorismIntl_93/Olympic-Committee-Stubborn-Munich-11.htm|publisher=ADL|accessdate=26 January 2013[/tpl]

==Commercialization==

The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.

===Budget===

During the first half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget.[tpl]sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci[/tpl] As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2 million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45 million.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=231[/tpl] When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.[tpl]sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci[/tpl]
The 1984 Summer Olympics became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organizing committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, was able to generate a surplus of US$225 million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time.[tpl]sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209[/tpl] The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies.[tpl]sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=209[/tpl] The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50 million for a four-year membership.[tpl]sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=ci[/tpl] Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=194[/tpl]

===Effect of television===

The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences.[tpl]cite web|title=Berlin 1936|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1936|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822100804/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1936|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl] The 1956 Winter Olympics were the first internationally televised Olympic Games,[tpl]cite web|title=Cortina d'Ampezzo|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1956|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822213008/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1956|archivedate=22 August 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl] and the following Winter Games had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks—CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights,[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=192[/tpl] and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) allocated US$660,000. In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=192[/tpl] The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=192[/tpl] For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the rights of the 1998 Nagano Games,[tpl]sfn|Gershon|2000|p=17[/tpl] while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.
Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of color television in 1968.Whannel, G. (1984) The television spectacular in A. Tomlinson & G. Whannel (Eds.), Five-ring circus (pp. 30–43). London: Pluto Press Global audience estimates for the 1968 Mexico City Games was 600 million, whereas at the Los Angeles Games of 1984, the audience numbers had increased to 900 million; that number swelled to 3.5 billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[tpl]sfn|Tomlinson|2005|p=14[/tpl] However, at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968.[tpl]cite news|title=World Series TV ratings slump|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/sports/main244877.shtml|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=4 May 2009 | date=27 October 2000[/tpl] This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era.[tpl]cite news|title=All fall down|last=Walters|first=Walters|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|date=2 October 2000|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429222810/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1020472/index.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2009[/tpl] A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time. With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|pp=16–18[/tpl] The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=17[/tpl] The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=17[/tpl] Finally, the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States.[tpl]sfn|Cooper-Chen|2005|p=230[/tpl] The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history.[tpl]sfn|Woods|2007|p=146[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=London Olympics 2012 Ratings: Most Watched Event In TV History|date=13 August 2012|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/london-olympics-2012-ratings-most-watched-ever_n_1774032.html|accessdate=12 July 2013[/tpl]

===Controversy===

The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=194[/tpl] Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares.[tpl]sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii[/tpl] The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games.[tpl]sfn|Buchanon|Mallon|2006|p=cii[/tpl] Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|p=194[/tpl] Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments.[tpl]sfn|Slack|2004|pp=194–195[/tpl] Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, The Olympic Effect, March 2009

==Symbols==

The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Oceania, Europe). The colored version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.
The Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius, a Latin expression meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924.  The motto was coined by Coubertin's friend the Dominican priest Henri Didon OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891."Sport athlétique", 14 mars 1891: "... dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise ‘souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours’. Il a dit qu’il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d’être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, ‘plus vite, plus haut, plus fort’.", cited in Hoffmane, Simone La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840 – 1900, Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV – Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique „citius, altius, fortius“
Coubertin's Olympic ideals are expressed in the Olympic creed:

Months before each Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games.
The Olympic mascot, an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in 1968. It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the 1980 Summer Olympics, when the Russian bear cub Misha reached international stardom.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1279748/Londons-Olympic-2012-mascots-revealed-Wenlock-Mandeville-unveiled-faces-Games.html|title=London's Olympic 2012 mascots are revealed: Wenlock and Mandeville unveiled as the 'faces' of the Games|date=23 May 2010|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire.

==Ceremonies==

===Opening===

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html |title= Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Centre |date= 8 August 2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008[/tpl]
After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.

===Closing===

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.[tpl]cite web |title=Closing Ceremony Factsheet|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|date=5 June 2012|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Closing_Ceremony_of_the_Games.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2012[/tpl] Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished.[tpl]cite web |title= Closing Ceremony |publisher= International Olympic Committee |date= 31 January 2002 |url= http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_268.pdf |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5gKmkOYeD |archivedate= 26 April 2009 |format= PDF |accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl] In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/news/feature-stories/-/38344/32574/w6rlej/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem.html |title=The Olympic Flags and Emblem |publisher=The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|accessdate=10 February 2009[/tpl] The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.
As is customary, the men's marathon medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50km cross-country skiing freestyle mass start medals (at the Winter Olympics) are presented as part of the Closing Ceremony, which take place later that day, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.

===Medal presentation===

A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals.[tpl]cite web |title= Olympic Games – the Medal Ceremonies |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |format=registration required|url= http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games |accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] After the medals are given out by an IOC member, the national flags of the three medalists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.[tpl]cite news |title= Medal Ceremony Hostess Outfits Revealed |work= China Daily |date= 18 July 2008 |url= http://english.sina.com/china/p/1/2008/0718/172118.html |accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl]
As is customary, the men's marathon medals are presented as part of the Summer Closing Ceremony, which take place later that day, in the Olympic Stadium - thus, they are the final medal presentation of the Games.

==Sports==

The Olympic Games program consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and nearly 400 events. For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class.[tpl]cite web|title=Wrestling|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/wrestling/|accessdate=25 March 2009[/tpl] The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports. Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the program as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp |title=Olympic Sports of the Past |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=10 February 2009[/tpl]
Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.[tpl]sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|pp=88–90[/tpl] There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/if/index_uk.asp |title=International Sports Federations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=8 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Olympic Charter|2007|p=87[/tpl] During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094118/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_942.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Factsheet: The sessions |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=8 February 2009[/tpl] There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing.
In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.
The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official program of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program featured just 26 sports. The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.

===Amateurism and professionalism===

The ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin.[tpl]sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123[/tpl] The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating.[tpl]sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123[/tpl] Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby.[tpl]sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123[/tpl]
The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.[tpl]cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.[tpl]cite web |title=Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/garmisch-partenkirchen-1936-winter-olympics |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl]
As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.[tpl]sfn|Eassom|1994|pp=120–123[/tpl] The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.[tpl]cite journal |last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses – from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comité International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 September 2008[/tpl] Beginning in the 1970s, amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter. After the 1988 Games, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, subject to the approval of the IFs. As of 2012, the only sports in which no professionals compete is boxing and wrestling, although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment, as some boxers and wrestlers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees.

==Controversies==

===Boycotts===

Australia, France, Great Britain, and Switzerland are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.[tpl]r|Krüger Murray 2003 p230[/tpl] There were three boycotts of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the Suez Crisis; and China (the "People's Republic of China") boycotted the Games because Taiwan was allowed to compete in the Games as the "Republic of China". In 1972 and 1976 a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist regimes. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore109/ore109h.pdf |title=Africa and the XXIst Olympiad |journal=Olympic Review |issue=109–110 |pages=584–585 |date=November–December 1976 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem as long as the name was changed.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore107/ore107i.pdf |title=Game playing in Montreal |work=Olympic Review |publisher=International Olympic Committee |pages=461–462 |issue=107–108 |date=October 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2009[/tpl] Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.
In 1980 and 1984, the Cold War opponents boycotted each other's Games. Sixty-five nations refused to compete at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81, the lowest number since 1956.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/moscow-1980-summer-olympics |title=Moscow 1980|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984, contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes.

===Politics===

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the National Socialist Party as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the 1936 Games, though they used the Games to display Aryan superiority.[tpl]sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|p=107[/tpl] Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of Aryan supremacy, but notable victories by African American Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, and Hungarian Jew Ibolya Csák, blunted the message.[tpl]sfn|Findling|Pelle|2004|pp=111–112[/tpl] The Soviet Union did not participate until the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organized an international sports event called Spartakiads. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organizations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the "bourgeois" Olympics with the Workers Olympics.[tpl]sfn|Roche|2000|p=106[/tpl] It was not until the 1956 Summer Games that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf |title=The USSR and Olympism |journal=Olympic Review |publisher=International Olympic Committee |issue=84 |pages=530–557 |date=October 1974 |format=PDF |accessdate=4 May 2009[/tpl] Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200 meters, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for human rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her head down and to the right of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.
Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian judoka, Arash Miresmaeili, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.[tpl]cite news |title=Iranian Judoka rewarded after snubbing Israeli |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC Sports |date=8 September 2004|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5942871/ |accessdate=7 February 2009[/tpl]

===Use of performance enhancing drugs===

In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve and increase their athletic abilities. In 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medalist for the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach.[tpl]cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl] The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.[tpl]cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|work=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl]
The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use.[tpl]sfn|Porterfield|2008|p=15[/tpl] The most publicized doping-related disqualification was in 1988 the Canadian Olympics where the Canadian sprinter, Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre dash) was positive for stanozolol. His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner-up Carl Lewis, who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics.[tpl]cite news |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl]
In the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, by forming the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 1999. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics. Several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate.[tpl]cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=3 September 2008[/tpl] During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

===Sex discrimination===

Women were first allowed to compete at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but at the 1992 Summer Olympics thirty-five countries were still fielding all-male delegations. This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, Bahrain sent two women competitors for the first time: Fatema Hameed Gerashi and Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli."Arab women make breakthrough at Games", CNN, 23 September 2000 In 2004, Robina Muqimyar and Fariba Rezayee became the first women to compete for Afghanistan at the Olympics."Afghan women's Olympic dream", BBC, 22 June 2004 In 2008, the United Arab Emirates sent female athletes (Maitha Al Maktoum competed in taekwondo, and Latifa Al Maktoum in equestrian) to the Olympic Games for the first time. Both athletes were from Dubai's ruling family.[tpl]cite news |title=Should Saudi Arabia be Banned from the Olympics? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-wallechinsky/should-saudi-arabia-be-ba_b_115736.html |publisher=Huffington Post |date=29 July 2008 |first=David |last=Wallechinsky[/tpl]
By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: Brunei, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would "press" these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Anita DeFrantz, chair of the IOC's Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the Qatar Olympic Committee announced that it "hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing" to the 2012 Summer Games in London.
In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: "For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organizations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination. ... While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion." In July 2010, The Independent reported: "Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. ... Should Saudi Arabia ... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games".
At the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Great Britain, for the first time in Olympic history, every country competing included female athletes[tpl]cite web|title=Saudis to send 2 women to London, make history|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/07/12/saudi-arabia-women-london-olympics.ap/index.html|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl] Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one (Maziah Mahusin, in the 400m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first female Olympians, Bahiya al-Hamad (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games."London 2012 Olympics: Saudi Arabian women to compete", BBC, 12 July 2012 Also at the 2012 Olympics, runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain became the first Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1,500m race.http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/13/232068.html
The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no "Women's Eventing", or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the program in the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men."Women's boxing gains Olympic spot", British Broadcasting Corporation, 13 August 2009 In the winter Olympics, women are still unable to compete in the Nordic Combined.  There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete: synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics.

===Terrorism and violence===

Three Olympiads had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war: the 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The South Ossetia War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao. When Nino Salukvadze of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10 meter air pistol competition, she stood on the medal podium with Natalia Paderina, a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicized event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.[tpl]cite news |title=Olympic Shooters Hug as their Countries do Battle|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/10/olympic.embrace/|accessdate=10 August 2008 | date=10 August 2008[/tpl]
Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games were held in Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September in what is now known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and 5 terrorists also perished.[tpl]cite news |title=Olympic archive|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1289-7332/sports/olympics_cbc/clip5|accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl]
Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the Summer Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta, Georgia, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph, an American domestic terrorist, who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing.[tpl]cite news |title=Olympic Park Bombing|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main|accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl] The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, took place just five months after the September 11 attacks, which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the day's events. They included the flag that flew at Ground Zero, NYPD officer Daniel Rodríguez singing "God Bless America", and honor guards of NYPD and FDNY members. The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/05/03/ioc-bin-laden-killing-no-bearing-olympic-security|title=IOC on bin Laden killing: no bearing on Olympic security|date=3 May 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl]

===Colonialism===

The Olympic Games have been criticized as upholding (and in some cases increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organizing committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused: erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production; erasure; commodificationDefinition: "…the process of transforming an object, idea, activity, or service into a commodity by capitalist economies." Beaster-Jones 2013, par. 1. and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism; theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects; further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands; and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at: the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, MO; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, BC.

====Anthropology at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, MO====

The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, MO were held in conjunction with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (also known as the St. Louis World's Fair), and were the first modern Olympic Games to be held in North America.International Olympic Committee. http://www.olympic.org/olympic-games. Retrieved 20 Feb 2013. Since the 1889 Paris Exposition, human zoos, as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, "progress," and "civilization," and this continued at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that purportedly showed them in their "natural habitats."Parezo 2008, p. 63. Another 1600 indigenous people were on display in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE),Brownell 2008, p. 32. including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School,Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith, 2008, p. 246. where Indian residential school students were compelled to demonstrate their "successful" assimilation.
According to theorist Susan Brownell, world's fairs—with their inclusion of human zoos—and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time as they "…were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity…. Anthropological exhibits illustrated the evolutionary beginnings of civilization, and the Olympic Games the superior physical achievements of civilized men."Brownell, 2008, p. 29. Taking this natural fit to the next level, two key figures at the 1904 World's Fair—William John McGee and James Edward Sullivan—devised an event that would bring anthropology and sport together: Anthropology Days.
Called "The Overlord of the Savage World" in a July 17, 1904 St. Louis newspaper,Parezo 2008, p. 112. WJ McGee was the head of the Department of Anthropology at the LPE and the founding president of the new American Anthropological Association.Brownell 2008, p. 14. McGee's theories positioned white people at the highest level of man's enlightenment,Parezo 2008, p. 64. and some indigenous groups as close to "sub-human."Parezo 2008, p. 66. The LPE's Anthropology Department was devised to "compare the physical and mental characteristics of individual races"Parezo 2008, p. 70. using white visitors as the standard, in order to learn how they had "advanced over other races."Parezo 2008, p. 70.
James E. Sullivan was the head of the Department of Physical Culture at the LPE and an extremely influential figure in American sports. Theorist Nancy Parezo describes how he had a vested interest in racial comparisons—that he wanted "the world to know that American methods of scientific training produced the best athletes in the world."Parezo 2008, p. 76. Of particular concern to him were stories of the exceptional physical abilities of some indigenous people—which would invalidate his assertions of the superior abilities of whites.Parezo 2008, p. 83. Sullivan devised the "Special Olympics" (also known as Anthropology Days) as a way of testing these theories, as well as promoting the regular Olympic Games.Parezo 2008, p. 84.
While Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program, they were closely associated with each other at the time, and in history—Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the "real" Olympic Games.Brownell 2008, p. 3. Additionally, almost all of the 400 athletic events were referred to as "Olympian,"Brownell 2008, p. 3. and the opening ceremony, which normally signals the start of the Olympics, was held in May on the "first day of the first sports event"Brownell 2008, p. 43. with dignitaries in attendance, though the official Olympic program did not begin until July 1.Brownell 2008, p. 43. And as previously noted one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.Brownell 2008, p. 34.Parezo 2008, p. 84.
Anthropology Days took place on August 11 and 12, 1904, with about 100 indigenous men enlisted from among the human zoos, Model School and the rest of the fair grounds (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included "spear and baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand."Parezo 2008, p. 59.
Participants were not directly asked to compete—organizer McGee instead communicated only through (white) agents.Parezo 2008, p. 85. According to Parezo, contests were modeled on the Olympic protocol of amateurism, so participants were not remunerated, which resulted in several people refusing to take part.Parezo 2008, pp. 86-87. Basic instructions were provided immediately before each event,Parezo 2008, p. 89. without language interpretation,Parezo 2008, p. 92. and participants were not given the opportunity to practice.Parezo 2008, p. 87. Many of the participants wanted to try the contests again once they understood the rules but this was not permitted as organizers believed it would have "‘violated' the research design…and invalidated the racial comparisons"Parezo 2008, p. 92. to white athletes (who underwent extensive training and practice). 
Participants competed against other members of their "race" in the initial trials, with the winners of each heat going on to compete against each other to "determine the fastest ‘primitive.'"—these were the results to be compared to those of white Olympic athletes.Parezo 2008, p. 92. Given the lack of preparation and training for these contests, it is not surprising that the participants largely achieved low scores. Though the racial comparisons from Anthropology Days were criticized as unscientific and a "farce,"Parezo 2008, p. 96. Sullivan disregarded these detractions and used them to prove his theories of white racial superiority. He concluded that "enlightened Americans were the best athletes in the world"Parezo 2008, p. 97. and that "Native peoples were intellectually, socially, cognitively, and morally inferior by nature."Parezo 2008, p. 97. According to Parezo, when the scores did not fit Sullivan's theories, he excluded them, such as when he omitted from his records that "all the Native participants beat the American pole-climbing record holder…by ten seconds."Parezo 2008, p. 94. Though not part of Anthropology Days, the achievements of the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team (who beat out white teams to become the LPE champions)Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith 2008, pp. 243-271. were similarly ignored by Sullivan.

====Spectacle and appropriation at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, PQ====

The 1976 Summer Olympics have been criticized for a lack of consultation and the spectacular display of indigenous people in the closing ceremony. Sport scholar Christine O'Bonsawin explains how "Montreal organizers strategically included indigenous people and imagery in the closing ceremony at a time when Canadian indigenous and government relations were operating under heightened tensions."O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 37. She is referring to then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's 1969 Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy (also called the White Paper), which was perceived by some Canadian indigenous people as a further attempt at assimilation.O'Bonsawin 2012, pp. 37-38.
O'Bonsawin describes how amid these tensions the Montreal Olympic Games' closing ceremony employed indigenous symbolism without consultation with local First Nations.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39. Hundreds of performers were enlisted to perform a "tribal" dance that was choreographed by a non-indigenous choreographer, to a musical score ("La Danse Sauvage") created by a non-indigenous composer.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40. Only 200 of the 450 performers were indigenous, with the other 250 being non-indigenous people costumed and painted in "redface"—it was these non-indigenous performers who led the indigenous people into the stadium.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39. O'Bonsawin notes that particularly problematic about this approach to including indigenous "participation," is that it became a model for future Canadian Olympic Games.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40.

====Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, AB====

The 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta reflected some lessons learned from criticism of the 1976 games, but according to critics, they still perpetuated legacies of erasure, cultural and land theft, and appropriation committed by past Games and Canadian governmental bodies. 
O'Bonsawin writes that there was significant protest from indigenous people against the use and appropriation of indigenous imagery in the 1988 Winter Games.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 41. This imagery included "indigenous sounds, sights, and images and a massive teepee" in the opening ceremony,O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 49. and medals depicting "winter sporting equipment protruding from a ceremonial headdress."O'Bonsawin 2010, p. 147. 
The 1988 Winter Games were also the subject of an international boycott called by the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation, a small community in northern Alberta. Their reasons centered around what they considered the illegal sale of their unceded lands to oil companies—unceded because they had been left out of the 1899 and 1900 treaties and the federal government was still not willing to negotiate a treaty.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42. While corporations extracted resources from their lands, the Lubicon Cree were experiencing "a 93% decline in their annual trapping income, high rates of alcoholism, a tuberculosis crisis, and malnourishment in the community."Ferreira, D.A. (1992). "Oil and Lubicons don't mix: A land claim in northern Alberta in historical perspective," Canadian Journal of Native Studies. 12(1): 1-35, cited by O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42.
The Lubicon Cree focused their boycott on a specific Olympic event: The Spirit Sings exhibit at the Glenbow Museum, part of the official cultural programming of the Games. They protested this exhibit on several grounds, including that almost half of its funding came from Shell Oil Canada—the very company drilling for oil on their unceded land.Cooper 2008, p. 22. The exhibit consisted of indigenous Canadian artifacts, art and objects gathered from collections around the world.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43. Of this, Lubicon Chief Bernard Ominayak said: "The irony of using a display of North American Indian artifacts to attract people to the Winter Olympics being organized by interests who are still actively seeking to destroy Indian people seems painfully obvious."Ominayak, Chief Bernard (1989) "Aboriginal land rights in Canada – myth and reality," NISTO – Lubicon Lake Indian Nation. http://nisto.com/cree/lubicon/, cited in O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43.
The Lubicon Cree claimed that the 665 artifacts in the exhibit had originally been stolen—expatriated from indigenous communities and displayed in Europe for public consumption and curiosity.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44. Additionally "many of the objects were sacred and not intended for public display," including a Mohawk False Face mask.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44. O'Bonsawin discusses how the Glenbow Museum committed a "second and more disgraceful wave of thievery" by returning the artifacts to the collections and museums who had loaned them, and refusing to assist indigenous groups in getting these items repatriated back to their communities.O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44. The discourse generated by the Lubicon boycott of The Spirit Sings resulted in the formation of a task force that eventually released a ground-breaking report that continues to influence how museum professionals approach working with indigenous communities.Cooper 2008, pp. 25-28.
In addition to the boycott of The Spirit Sings, the torch relay run was targeted by protestors for its sponsorship by Petro-Canada, which was "invading indigenous territories (including Lubicon lands) across Canada."O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 47. Indigenous objection was not confined to the Lubicon Cree since "protestors were present along the relay route in every province except Prince Edward Island."O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48. Of these protests, former Olympiques Calgary Olympics (OCO) chairperson later wrote: "There was no room for defiance or confrontation…."O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48.

====Land disputes, poverty and cultural appropriation at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, BC====

Again building on lessons learned from previous Olympic Games held in Canada, the 2010 Winter Games saw an unprecedented level of involvement by and collaboration with indigenous people, namely in the form of the Four Host First Nations (FHFN).O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 53. Composed of representatives from the Lil'wat, Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations from the Vancouver and Whistler areas, the FHFN was created to ensure that "their cultures and traditions are respected and showcased throughout the planning, staging, and hosting of the 2010 Winter Games."Government of Canada 2009, par, 1, 2. But former Neskonlith chief Arthur Manuel has argued that the FHFN was created to "divide and rule over indigenous peoples in Canada"Manuel 2010, par. 1. and that "Canada is deliberately trying to buy its way around its terrible human rights record by creating a media spin behind the Four Host First Nations."Manuel 2010, par. 4. Calling the FHFN a "cheap and shallow scheme,"Manuel 2010, par. 4. he points out that in 2007 Canada was one of only four countries to vote against the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Manuel 2010, par. 6.
The 2010 Winter Games were met with massive protest locally and internationally. In October 2007, 1500 indigenous delegates at the Intercontinental Indigenous Gathering in Sonora, Mexico passed a resolution stating: "We reject the 2010 Winter Olympics on sacred and stolen territory of Turtle Island – Vancouver, Canada."Revolutionary Hip-Hop Report 2010, par. 3. This launched a global boycott of the 2010 Games with indigenous protests of the 2010 Winter Games rallying under the slogan, "No Olympics on stolen Native land."Paley 2010, par. 1. In an interview with Democracy Now!, commentator and artist Gord Hill explains how the slogan refers to the lack of treaties in British Columbia: "It's illegal, and it's actually immoral, because they were bound by their own laws to make treaties before they settled on any land or any business took place on sovereign indigenous land."Lopez 2010, par. 11. The business referred to includes massive real estate developments as explained in a Dominion article:
 Vast areas of unceded land that Indigenous communities depend on for hunting, fishing and general survival are at risk. Rivers, mountains and old-growth forests are being replaced by tourist resorts and highway expansions spurred by the 2010 games. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to build new resorts and expand existing ones in order to attract and accommodate tourists, Olympic athletes and trainers.Rolbin-Ghanie 2008, par. 4. 
One such development was the Sea-to-Sky highway expansion for which the Eagle Ridge Bluffs in North Vancouver (on Squamish territory) were to be destroyed.Hill 2012, p. 61. Harriet Nahanee, a 71-year-old Pacheedaht elder who had married into the Squamish First Nation, participated in a blockade to prevent this destruction.Hill 2012, p. 61. She was arrested along with 23 other protesters and imprisoned.Hill 2012, p. 61. Nahanee's already fragile health deteriorated while in prison and she died shortly after her release on February 24, 2007.Wonders, par. 1.

The 2010 Winter Games have also been criticized for being held in a city, province and country where so many indigenous people are living in desperate social conditions, particularly in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES), which, at the time of the Vancouver Games bid, was home to the largest off-reserve Aboriginal population in Vancouver.Statistics Canada 2001. According to the International Indigenous Youth Network in 2007, pre-Olympic real estate development was causing increased homelessness in the DTES: "512 low-income housing units were lost between June 2003 and June 2005 and almost 300 low-income housing units have been lost to rent increases in the same time period."Lindsay 2007, par. 10. Kat Norris of the Indigenous Action Group further explains why this is of particular concern to First Nations people, who, as of 2007, constituted 30%Lindsay 2007, par. 11. of homeless people in the DTES: "The brutal history of residential schools coupled with present day racism and discrimination has meant that ‘a high percentage of our people rely on services in the downtown eastside of Vancouver…. Many of these services are facing funding cuts.'"Lindsay 2007, par. 11. Those funding cuts were occurring while the province was expected to spend $1.5 billion on the Games, and the federal government, $2.5 billion.Lindsay 2007, par 12.
The high incidence of violence against indigenous women is telling of Canada's treatment of indigenous peoples: 500 First Nations women are missing from across Canada, and 76 of them are from British Columbia, where the Games were being hosted.Rolbin-Ghanie 2008, par. 29. It's been estimated that of the 69 women on the official list of those missing from the DTES in Vancouver, at least a third of them are of indigenous ancestry, compared to 1.9% representation of indigenous women in the general population of Vancouver.Dean 2009, p. 8.
Indigenous people have also raised concerns about the marketing and branding of the 2010 Winter Games, starting with the selection of the official Games logo, which was based on the Inuit symbol of the inuksuk, and given the name "Ilanaaq," which translates to "friend."Miller 2005, par. 1. Several indigenous leaders criticized the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee (VANOC) for not consulting with indigenous groups on the selection of the emblem,Miller 2005, par. 7. and for choosing one that did not reflect the local First Nations of the host city.Miller 2005, par. 3, 4.Nuytten 2005, par. 7, 8. President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs Chief Stewart Phillip said: "The First Nations community at large is disappointed with the selection….The decision-makers have decided not to reflect the First Nations and the Pacific region in the design of the logo….I can't help but notice the remarkable resemblance it has to Pac-Man."National Geographic 2010, par. 4, 5. Former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq also criticized the design: "Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms;"CBC Sports 2005, par. 7. and the process: "Irniq says every inukshuk has a meaning and a reason why it was built in a certain location. He says building the structures should not be taken lightly."CBC Sports 2005, par. 6. Criticism was also directed at the fact that the logo designers were not Inuit or even First Nations.Nuytten 2005, par 6. Some Inuit people, in criticizing the adoption of "Ilanaaq," explicitly made the connection between cultural appropriation and commodificaton, "arguing that it dishonoured the traditional functions of inuksuk and risked turning them into commodities that could be sold for tourist consumption."Heyes, S. (2002). "Protecting the authenticity and integrity of Inuksuit in the Arctic milieu," Études/Inuit/Studies, 26(2): 133-56, cited in O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 54.
Though the 2010 Winter Olympic Games did consult with indigenous people more than in past Canadian Olympic Games, that collaboration does not seem to have extended to resolving outstanding land treaties nor addressing the marginalization of indigenous people in Canada.

====The Olympic Games as a colonial force and recommendations====

According to writings by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, sport and colonialism were logical companions. He called sports "a vigorous instrument of the disciplining" of colonized people, and viewed it as a calming force in the colonies.Coubertin, Pierre de (1912). "Les sports et la Colonisation," Revue Olympique (January): 7-10, cited in Schantz 2008, p. 177. O'Bonsawin writes that Olympism, as a philosophy, speaks "in truisms of equity, anti-discrimination, mutual recognition and respect, tolerance and solidarity."O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144. But she and other critics argue that in reality Olympism serves as an apologetic for a movement that is actually "deeply politicized and xenophobic."Wamsley, Kevin B. "Laying Olympism to Rest," Post-Olympism? Questioning Sport in the Twentieth-First Century, edited by John Bale and Mette Krogh Christensen, 231-42. Oxford: Berg, 2004, quoted in O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144. O'Bonsawin also argues that in encouraging Olympic participants to "cast aside everyday lived experiences…shaped by such factors as race, gender, sexuality, religion, culture, ideology, and class" Olympism itself erases the realities of marginalized peoples.O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144.
To address this erasure and the disparity between Olympism ideals and Games practice, O'Bonsawin recommends that the IOC restructure their bid evaluation process so that they can determine whether bidding countries respect the human rights and needs of marginalized peoples.O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153. Instrumental to this restructuring would be the inclusion of external consultation and evaluation.O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153.

==Citizenship==

===IOC rules for citizenship===

The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country wherefor they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country if three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country; if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period.[tpl]r|Olympic Charter 2011[/tpl] This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they need not wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC considers only issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.[tpl]sfn|Shachar|2011|pp=2114–2116[/tpl]

===Reasons for changing citizenship===

Athletes will sometimes become citizens of a different nation so they are able to compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete’s home country. About fifty athletes between 1992 and 2008 emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having competed for another nation.

===Citizenship changes and disputes===

Among the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was Zola Budd, a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa existed. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born in Britain, and British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her.[tpl]cite news|author=Rory Carroll |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/feb/24/athletics.rorycarroll |title=What Zola Budd did next | Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= 24 February 2003|accessdate=27 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl]
Among other notable examples are Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, who in May 2004 became a United States citizen. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship upon becoming another nation's citizen. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics after becoming a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardizing his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and expected not to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/3/3_1/lagat-a-runner-without-a-.shtml |title=Lagat a runner without a country |publisher=Cool Running |accessdate=27 November 2011[/tpl] Basketball player Becky Hammon was not being considered for the United States Olympic team and wanted to play in an Olympic Games; she therefore emigrated to Russia, where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason. Hammon received criticism from some Americans, among them the US national team coach, even being called unpatriotic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3427182 |title=Olympics opportunity too much for Hammon to pass up – Olympics – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2011[/tpl]

==Champions and medalists==

The athletes or teams who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics|title=St Louis 1904|publisher=Olympic Games|accessdate=3 July 2012[/tpl] From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths.[tpl]cite web |title=The Modern Olympic Games|publisher=The Olympic Museum|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_668.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl] The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success.[tpl]cite news|last=Munro|first=James|title=Britain may aim for third in 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7579901.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008[/tpl]

==Host nations and cities==

The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration. The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.
Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.
By 2016, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92 years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro will be the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.
The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games, four Summer and four Winter, more than any other nation. The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games, all Summer, more than any other city.  The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany, Australia, France and Greece. The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles, Paris and Athens. With the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, Japan and Tokyo, respectively, will hold these statuses.
In addition to the United States, nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three, while Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Japan, Canada and Italy have hosted twice. Among host cities, Lake Placid, Innsbruck and St. Moritz have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once, each holding that honor twice. The most recent Winter Games were held in Vancouver, Canada's third Olympics overall. The Winter Games in Sochi in 2014 was Russia's first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall.
