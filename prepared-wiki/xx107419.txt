[[Xanthate]]

CATEGORIES: Salts, Functional groups, Organosulfur compounds

Xanthate usually refers to a salt with the formula ROCS2-M+ (R = alkyl; M+ = Na+, K+).IUPAC does not recommend the use of the term xanthate, although it is in current use in the scientific literature: [tpl]cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/X06696.html |title=IUPAC definition[/tpl]  The name xanthates is derived from Greek ξανθός [tpl]IPA-el|ksantʰós|[/tpl], meaning “yellowish, golden”, and indeed most xanthate salts are yellow. These organosulfur compounds are important in two areas, the production of cellophane and related polymers from cellulose and secondly in mining for the extraction of certain ores.Kathrin-Maria Roy "Xanthates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28 423[/tpl]  They are also versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Xanthates also refer to esters of xanthic acid.  These esters have the structure ROC(=S)SR'.

==Formation and structure==

Xanthate salts are produced by the reaction of an alcohol with sodium or potassium hydroxide and carbon disulfide:This report gives a detailed procedure for the potassium ethyl xanthate: [tpl]OrgSynth|author=Charles C. Price and Gardner W. Stacy|year=1948|title=p-nitrophenyl sulfide|volume=28|pages=82|collvol=3|collvolpages=667|prep=CV3P0667[/tpl] 
The reaction involves the attack of the alkoxide salt.  For example, sodium ethoxide gives sodium ethyl xanthate.  Virtually any alcohol can be used in this reaction. Technical grade xanthate salts are usually of 90–95% purity.  Impurities include alkali-metal sulfide, sulfate, trithiocarbonates, thiosulfate, sulfite, or carbonate as well as residual raw material such as alcohol and alkali hydroxide. These salts are available commercially as powder, granules, flakes, sticks, and solutions are available. China is a major exporter of granules.
Some commercially important xanthate salts include:
The OCS2 core of xanthate salts and esters is characteristically planar.  The central carbon is sp2-hybridized.

==Reactions==

Xanthate salts characteristically decompose in acid:
This reaction is the reverse of the method for the preparation of the xanthate salts.  The intermediate in the decomposition is the xanthic acid, ROC(S)SH, which can be isolated in certain cases.
Xanthate anions also undergo alkylation to give xanthate esters, which are generally stable:[tpl]OrgSynth|author=Fabien Gagosz and Samir Z. Zard|year=1948|title=A Xanthate-Transfer Approach to α-Trifluoromethylamines |volume=84|pages=32|collvol=11|collvolpages=212|prep=V84P0032[/tpl]
The C-O bond in these compounds are susceptible to cleavage by the Barton–McCombie deoxygenation, which provides a means for deoxygenation of alcohols.
Analogous to their S-alkylation, xanthates bind to transition metal cations as bidentate ligands.  The neutral complexes are soluble in organic solvents.F. Galsbøl, C. E. Schäffer, "Tris (O-Ethyl Dithiocarbonato) Complexes of Tripositive Chromium, Indium, and Cobalt" Inorganic Syntheses 1967, Volume 10, pages 42–49.[tpl]DOI|10.1002/9780470132418.ch6[/tpl]
They can be oxidized to the so-called dixanthogens:

==Industrial applications==

Cellulose reacts with carbon disulfide (CS2) in presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produces sodium cellulose xanthate, which upon neutralization with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) gives viscose rayon or cellophane paper (Sellotape or Scotch Tape).
Xanthate salts are used as flotation agents in mineral processing. They are intermediates in the Chugaev elimination process and are used to control radical polymerisation under the RAFT process, also termed MADIX (macromolecular design via interchange of xanthates).

==Related compounds==

Rarely encountered, thioxanthates arise by the reaction of CS2 with thiolate salts.  For example, sodium ethylthioxanthate has the formula C2H5SCS2Na.  Dithiocarbamates are also related compounds, and are more useful.  They arise from the reaction of the amine with CS2. For example, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate has the formula (C2H5)2NCS2Na.

==Environmental impacts==

Xanthates may be toxic to aquatic biota at concentrations of less than 1 mg/L.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.05.013[/tpl] Water downstream of mining operations can be contaminated.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF02021019[/tpl]
