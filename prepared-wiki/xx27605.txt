The bombing of Tokyo, often referred to as a firebombing, was conducted as part of the air raids on Japan by the United States Army Air Forces during the Pacific campaigns of World War II. The U.S. mounted a small-scale raid on Tokyo in April 1942. Strategic bombing and urban area bombing began in 1944 after the long-range B-29 Superfortress bomber entered service, first deployed from China and thereafter the Mariana Islands. B-29 raids from those islands began on 17 November 1944 and lasted until 15 August 1945, the day Japan capitulated.Craven, Wesley Frank, and James Lea Cate, eds. The Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume Five, the Pacific: Matterhorn to Nagasaki June 1944 to August 1945. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953, page 558. The Operation Meetinghouse air raid of 9–10 March 1945 was later estimated to be the single most destructive bombing raid in history.

==Doolittle Raid==

The first raid on Tokyo was the Doolittle Raid of 18 April 1942, when sixteen B-25 Mitchells were launched from USS Hornet to attack targets including Yokohama and Tokyo and then fly on to airfields in China. The raid was the retaliation against the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid did little damage to Japan's war capability but was a significant propaganda victory for the United States.[tpl]cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Isaac|title=Edokko: Growing Up a Foreigner in Wartime Japan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HAL12lzDz40C&pg=PA115|year=2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=1-4401-4124-X|page=115[/tpl] Launched prematurely, none of the attacking aircraft reached the designated airfields, either crashing or ditching. One aircraft landed in the neutral Soviet Union where the crew was interned, but then smuggled over the border into Iran on 11 May 1943. Two crews were captured by the Japanese in occupied China and later killed in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.The Illustrated History of WWII, by Dr. John Ray, p.126, Weidenfeld & Nicolson (2003)http://www.doolittleraider.com

==B-29 raids==

The key development for the bombing of Japan was the B-29 Superfortress strategic bomber, which had an operational range of 3,250 nautical miles (6,019 km) and was capable of attacking at high altitude above [tpl]convert|30000|ft|km|0[/tpl] where enemy defenses were very weak. Almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this type of bomber. Once Allied ground forces had captured islands sufficiently close to Japan, airfields were built on those islands (particularly Saipan and Tinian) and B-29s could reach Japan for bombing missions.
The initial raids were carried out by the Twentieth Air Force operating out of mainland China in Operation Matterhorn under XX Bomber Command, but these could not reach Tokyo. Operations from the Northern Mariana Islands commenced in November 1944 after the XXI Bomber Command was activated there.
The high altitude bombing attacks using general purpose bombs were observed to be ineffective by USAAF leaders. Changing tactics to increase the damage, Curtis LeMay ordered the bombers to drop incendiary bombs to burn Japan's vulnerable wood-and-paper buildings.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KixzKor30OMC&pg=PA322 |page=322 |title=The Pacific War: The Strategy, Politics, and Players That Won the War |last=Hopkins |first=William B. |publisher=Zenith Imprint |year=2009 |isbn=0-7603-3435-8[/tpl] The first such raid was against Kobe on 4 February 1945. Tokyo was hit by incendiaries on 25 February 1945 when 174 B-29s flew a high altitude raid during daylight hours and destroyed around [tpl]convert|643|acre|ha|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] of the snow-covered city, using 453.7 tons of mostly incendiaries with some fragmentation bombs.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sr6nn47tDOUC&pg=PA33 |page=33 |title=No Strategic Targets Left |last=Bradley |first=F.J. |publisher=Turner Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=9781563114830[/tpl] At this point, LeMay ordered the B-29 bombers to attack at a relatively low altitude of [tpl]convert|5000|to|9000|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and at night, because Japan's anti-aircraft artillery defenses were weakest in this altitude range, and the fighter defenses were ineffective at night. LeMay ordered all defensive guns but the tail gun removed from the B-29s so that the aircraft would be lighter and use less fuel. On the night of 9–10 March ("Operation Meetinghouse"),http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5229.htm 334 B-29s took off to raid with 279 of them dropping 1,665 tons of bombs on Tokyo. The bombs were mostly the [tpl]convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] E-46 cluster bomb which released 38 napalm-carrying M-69 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of [tpl]convert|2000|-|2500|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The M-69s punched through thin roofing material or landed on the ground; in either case they ignited 3–5 seconds later, throwing out a jet of flaming napalm globs. A lesser number of M-47 incendiaries was also dropped: the M-47 was a [tpl]convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bomb which ignited upon impact. In the first two hours of the raid, 226 of the attacking aircraft unloaded their bombs to overwhelm the city's fire defenses.Bradley 1999, pp. 34–35. The first B-29s to arrive dropped bombs in a large X pattern centered in Tokyo's densely populated working class district near the docks; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming X. Fourteen B-29s were lost.U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II: Combat Chronology. March 1945. Air Force Historical Studies Office. Retrieved 3 March 2009. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration, which would have been classified as a firestorm but for prevailing winds gusting at [tpl]convert|17|to|28|mph|abbr=on[/tpl].Rodden, Robert M.; John, Floyd I.; Laurino, Richard (May 1965). Exploratory Analysis of Firestorms., Stanford Research Institute, pp. 39, 40, 53–54. Office of Civil Defense, Department of the Army, Washington D.C. Approximately [tpl]convert|15.8|sqmi|ha|-1[/tpl] of the city was destroyed and some 100,000 people are estimated to have died.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/17724/page5/ |last=Freeman Dyson. |title=Part I: A Failure of Intelligence |work=Technology Review |date=1 November 2006 |publisher= MIT[/tpl]David McNeill.  The night hell fell from the sky. Japan Focus, 10 March 2005. The US Strategic Bombing Survey later estimated that nearly 88,000 people died in this one raid, 41,000 were injured, and over a million residents lost their homes. The Tokyo Fire Department estimated a higher toll: 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department established a figure of 124,711 casualties including both killed and wounded and 286,358 buildings and homes destroyed. Richard Rhodes, historian, put deaths at over 100,000, injuries at a million and homeless residents at a million.Rhodes, Richard. "The Making of the Atomic Bomb". p 599.  Simon & Schuster Paperbacks (1984) ISBN 0-684-81378-5. These casualty and damage figures could be low; Mark Selden wrote in Japan Focus:
[tpl]quote|The figure of roughly 100,000 deaths, provided by Japanese and American authorities, both of whom may have had reasons of their own for minimizing the death toll, seems to me arguably low in light of population density, wind conditions, and survivors' accounts. With an average of 103,000 inhabitants per square mile (396 people per hectare) and peak levels as high as 135,000 per square mile (521 people per hectare), the highest density of any industrial city in the world, and with firefighting measures ludicrously inadequate to the task, [tpl]convert|15.8|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of Tokyo were destroyed on a night when fierce winds whipped the flames and walls of fire blocked tens of thousands fleeing for their lives. An estimated 1.5 million people lived in the burned out areas.Mark Selden.

Additional missions against Tokyo targets were carried out by twin-engine bombers and by fighter-bombers.Air Force Historical Studies Office. U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II: Combat Chronology 1941–1945.

==Results==

Damage to Tokyo's heavy industry was slight until firebombing destroyed much of the light industry that was used as an integral source for small machine parts and time-intensive processes. Firebombing also killed or made homeless many workers who had been taking part in war industry. Over 50% of Tokyo's industry was spread out among residential and commercial neighborhoods; firebombing cut the whole city's output in half.United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War), p. 18. The destruction and damage was especially severe in the eastern areas of the city.
The Imperial Palace was surrounded by areas destroyed by firebombing. The main palace itself (Kyūden), home of the Imperial General Headquarters, took heavy damage by fire, even though bombing it was specifically prohibited by USAAF order.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Emperor Hirohito's tour of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945 was the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in Japan's surrender six months later.Bradley, F. J. No Strategic Targets Left. "Contribution of Major Fire Raids Toward Ending WWII" p. 38.  Turner Publishing Company, limited edition.  ISBN 1-56311-483-6.

==Postwar recovery==

After the war, Tokyo struggled to rebuild. In 1945 and 1946, the city received a share of the national reconstruction budget roughly proportional to its amount of bombing damage (26.6%), but in successive years Tokyo saw its share dwindle. By 1949, Tokyo was given only 10.9% of the budget; at the same time there was runaway inflation devaluing the money as Japan was spending more than it was bringing in from taxes. Occupation authorities such as Joseph Dodge stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.Andre Sorensen. The Making of Urban Japan: Cities and Planning from Edo to the Twenty First Century RoutledgeCurzon, 2004. ISBN 0-415-35422-6.

==Memorials==

Between 1948 and 1951 the ashes of 105,400 people killed in the attacks on Tokyo were interred in Yokoamicho Park in Sumida Ward. A memorial to the raids was opened in the park in March 2001.Karacas (2000), pp. 521–523
After the war, Japanese author Katsumoto Saotome, a survivor of the 10 March 1945 fire bombing, helped start a library about the raid in Koto Ward called the Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage. The library contains documents and literature about the raid plus survivor accounts collected by Saotome and the Association to Record the Tokyo Air Raid.Aukema Justin, "Author sees parallels between prewar, nuclear indoctrination", Japan Times, 20 March 2012, p. 12.

==The raids in postwar Japanese politics==

In 2007, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzō apologized in print, acknowledging Japan's guilt in the bombing of Chinese cities and civilians beginning in 1938. He wrote that the Japanese government should have surrendered as soon as losing the war was inevitable, an action that would have prevented Tokyo from being firebombed in March 1945, as well as subsequent bombings of other cities.[tpl]Cite web |last=Karacas |first=Cary|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Cary-Karacas/3474 |title=Fire Bombings and Forgotten Civilians: The Lawsuit Seeking Compensation for Victims of the Tokyo Air Raids 焼夷弾空襲と忘れられた被災市民―東京大空襲犠牲者による損害賠償請求訴訟|publisher=JapanFocus.org|issn= 1557-4660 |year=2010[/tpl] However, during his second term as prime minister, in 2013 Abe's cabinet stated that the raids were "incompatible with humanitarianism, which is one of the foundations of international law", while noting that it is difficult to argue that the raids were illegal under the international laws of the time.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://japandailypress.com/japanese-government-says-1945-tokyo-bombing-was-against-humanitarian-principles-0728382/ | title = Japanese government says 1945 Tokyo bombing was 'against humanitarian principles' | agency = Mainichi Shimbun | publisher = Japan Daily News | date = 2013-05-07 | accessdate = 2013-11-22 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.47news.jp/CN/201305/CN2013050701001318.html | title = 東京大空襲で答弁書 「人道主義に合致せず」 | agency = 共同通信社 | publisher = 47NEWS | date = 2013-05-07 | accessdate = 2013-11-22 [/tpl]
In 2007, 112 members of the Association for the Bereaved Families of the Victims of the Tokyo Air Raids brought a class action against the Japanese government, demanding an apology and 1,232 million yen in compensation. Their suit charged that the Japanese government invited the raid by failing to end the war earlier, and then failed to help the civilian victims of the raids while providing considerable support to former military personnel and their families.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.47news.jp/CN/200703/CN2007030901000392.html | title = 東京大空襲、国を提訴 遺族ら12億円賠償請求 | agency = Kyodo News | publisher = 47NEWS | date = 2007-03-09 | accessdate = 2013-11-22 [/tpl] The plaintiffs' case was dismissed at the first judgement in December 2009, and their appeal was rejected.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.47news.jp/CN/200912/CN2009121401000348.html | title = 東京大空襲の賠償認めず 「救済対象者の選別困難」 | agency = Kyodo News | publisher = 47NEWS | date = 2009-12-14 | accessdate = 2013-11-22 [/tpl] The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected their case in May 2013.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.47news.jp/CN/201305/CN2013050901001267.html | title = 東京大空襲で原告敗訴が確定 最高裁が上告退ける | agency = Kyodo News | publisher = 47NEWS | date = 2013-05-09 | accessdate = 2013-11-22 [/tpl]
