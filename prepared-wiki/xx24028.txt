Romero describes the film as a "tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society"    [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl].
This film features Sherman Howard in an early appearance as Bub, and make-up artist Gregory Nicotero playing Pvt. Johnson and assisting Tom Savini with the make-up effects.

==Plot==

The movie opens with a young woman getting up to mark a day on a wall calendar with a red X (the calendar already having a number of days marked this way).  As she reaches the calendar, dead hands punch through the brick wall and reach for her. She awakens in fright,
zombies have overrun the entire world. The remaining fragments of the U.S. government and military hide out in fortified colonies, attempting to find both survivors and a solution to the zombie outbreak. Survivors Dr. Sarah Bowman (the woman from the first scene), US Army Private Miguel Salazar, and helicopter radio operator William "Bill" McDermott, and Helicopter pilot John arrive in Fort Myers, Florida, encounter a large horde of the undead, and escape to an underground Army base in the Everglades, where a small group of scientists search for a way to stop or reverse the re-animation process, assisted by a skeleton crew of soldiers. Dr. Logan, the lead scientist – also known as "Frankenstein" due to his experiments – believes that zombies can be trained to become docile, and accordingly has amassed a collection of test subjects, over the objection of base-commander Captain Henry Rhodes. The tension between soldiers and scientists is worsened by dwindling supplies, loss of communication with other survivors, and a lack of progress in research. During a zombie wrangling mission, two of the soldiers, Miller and Johnson, are killed after a zombie escapes its harness; whereupon Miguel attempts to kill the creature, but is bitten on the arm, which Sarah amputates to stop the spreading infection. Rhodes then calls off the experiment and demands all specimens to be destroyed.
Dr. Logan, meanwhile, continues his research, being especially proud of "Bub", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life. Sarah is mortified when she learns that Logan has been using the bodies of dead soldiers to examine and experiment on secretly by replacing the buried soldiers with dead zombie specimens and using the real soldiers as food to condition and reward zombies for positive behavior, and devises a plan to escape the complex with John, Miguel, and McDermott. Their plans are thwarted by Capt. Rhodes, who discovers Logan's secret about slaughtering and feeding the zombies his dead soldiers. He kills Logan; locks Sarah and McDermott inside the zombie corral; murders Dr. Fisher, a fellow scientist; and attempts to force John, their helicopter pilot, to fly them away from the complex, which he refuses.
Bub, having escaped his chain, finds the corpse of Dr. Logan, and in a display of human emotion, becomes enraged, and finds a pistol discarded on the floor when Rhodes disarmed and took Sarah, McDermott and Fisher hostage. Miguel who has become suicidal, allows the zombies to enter the complex and is devoured by the horde in the process. While Pvt Steele and Pvt Rickles investigate, John overcomes Rhodes and Torrez, steals their weapons, and goes to find Sarah and McDermott. After being left for dead by Captain Rhodes, Pvt Torrez and Pvt Rickles are brutally torn apart by the horde. While trying to kill Bub, Pvt Steele is forced into a last stand, but gets bitten and chooses to kill himself. Rhodes attempts to escape, but is shot and wounded by Bub and violently torn in half by the undead while still alive. John reunites with Sarah and McDermott and they escape to the surface. Sarah boards the helicopter, only to be attacked by a zombie inside; but wakes to find that the final undead attack on the three was only a dream and they are now living on a tropical island without infection. Sarah observes John and McDermott on the beach, before crossing off another date on her calendar, this time marking days since their escape.

===Development===

Romero originally intended the film to be "the Gone with the Wind of zombie films".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/day/filming.html|title=Home of the Dead: Day of the Dead - The Filming|publisher=homepageofthedead|accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl] Following budget disputes and the artistic need to release the film unrated, the budget of the film was cut in half, dropping from $7 million to a scant $3.5 million. This forced Romero to scale back his story, rewriting the script and adjusting his original vision to fit the smaller budget.
Filming took place in the fall of 1984 at locations in Pennsylvania and Florida. All above-ground scenes were filmed at several locations around Florida, where Romero was living at the time. The opening scene was filmed in Fort Myers, Florida.Day of the Dead Locations - Fort Myers, Florida Underground scenes were filmed in a former mine shaft located near Wampum, Pennsylvania, converted into a long-term storage facility for important documents. Though the mine maintained a constant temperature of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, its high humidity played havoc with the crew's equipment and props. Mechanical and electrical failures were a constant problem throughout filming, and caused several of special effects leader Tom Savini's props to fail during the filming. Despite these failures, Savini was nominated and won the 1985 Saturn Award for best makeup effects. The remote location also complicated the transportation of crew members and equipment. Cast and crew would often sleep in the mine overnight to avoid the time-consuming travel to and from the shooting location. "Zombie" extras were recruited from among the citizens of Pittsburgh, with preference given to those who had worked on previous Romero films. Extras were paid $1.00 for their services, and given a hat that read "I was a Zombie in Day of the Dead".
The film was given a very limited release. This is chronicled in the documentary "The Many Days of Day of the Dead" on the two-disc Anchor Bay special edition DVD of the film. Some of the original concepts and characters remain, but the film differs greatly from Romero's original script,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dayofthedead.txt|title=Romero's original Day of the Dead script|publisher=horrorlair.com|accessdate=2008-01-05[/tpl] as stated by actress Lori Cardille:

===Casting===

Joseph Pilato was cast as Rhodes, the film's antagonist. As stated by Pilato "He pretty much just gave it to me. I don't know if he auditioned other people, but it was very quick. I came in and it was like, "You got it!." Pilato had acted in two prior films directed by Romero, the first being Pilato's debut Dawn of the Dead and the second being Knightriders, in between those films he played his first lead role in a film entitled Effects. In an interview Pilato was asked if Romero "had him in mind", Pilato stated that one of the reasons why he got the role was because of the budget being scaled down from 7 to 3.5 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/day/interviews_1.html|title=Interview with Josef Pilato|publisher=homepageofthedead|accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]

==Release and reception==

Subsequent to its theatrical release, the film has grossed over 30 million dollars worldwide. Day of the Dead would earn most of its gross revenue when the film was released internationally on VHS format, and later DVD and Blu-ray.  This is in contrast to the film's poor box-office reception when it was released in domestic cinema.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/film/reviews/d/day-of-the-dead.shtml|title=Day of the Dead|publisher=Pop Matters|accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]

Campbell, who had a small role in the first remake said "We want to keep it as close to the Romero version as possible. To make sure that his fans are happy. These are not going to be zombies climbing walls and doing back flips like in World War Z."
