[[Ridiculous (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Squeeze (band) albums, 1995 albums, Albums produced by Glenn Tilbrook

Ridiculous is an album by the British New Wave group Squeeze. It is the band's eleventh studio album, and it introduces new drummer Kevin Wilkinson (no relation to bassist Keith Wilkinson). As on the previous album, Some Fantastic Place, the band recorded one song penned by Keith Wilkinson. This time, however, Keith was not permitted to perform the lead vocals. That song, "Got to Me", is the last Wilkinson would write with Squeeze. Chris Difford sings lead on two songs, "Long Face" and "Fingertips". He had not performed lead on an album cut since "Slaughtered, Gutted and Heartbroken" and "Love Circles" on the 1989 album Frank. This record was produced by Glenn Tilbrook and Peter Smith.
