==Provincial politics==

On July 12, 2007, he was nominated to run in Hamilton East—Stoney Creek in the 2007 Ontario general election. Miller campaigned on a platform of job retention and a promise to push for an increase in the minimum wage. He also wanted the province to screen companies before they set up in the area.  He defeated Hamilton city councillor Sam Merulla for the NDP nomination. On election night, October 10, 2007, Miller defeated Liberal candidate Nerene Virgin.
In April 2008, Miller introduced a private member's bill that proposed to create a severance fund for workers who were owed money when their companies closed. The fund would be used to cover severances, vacation pay and other items owed to workers. Miller said, "It would allow people ... to have a little bit of a nest egg to hold them over until they get retrained or find another job." The proposed fund which would have been financed by existing companies was criticized by Labour Minister Brad Duguid, who said the fund was "nothing short of a payroll tax" and that it was "irresponsible in this economy to jack up taxes on businesses, in particular in the manufacturing sector." The proposed bill was shelved by a government committee.[tpl]cite news |title=Committee shelves bill on severance fund for workers |first=Naomi |last=Powell |url= |newspaper=Hamilton Spectator |date=8 April 2008[/tpl]
In 2010, Miller introduced another private member's bill called the Eramosa Karst Feeder Lands Protection Act, 2010 that would protect land near the Eramosa Karst formation. Though he was a member of the NDP, Miller introduced the bill jointly with Niagara West-Glanbrook MPP (and Ontario PC Party leader) Tim Hudak. The bill would permanently protect land occupied by streams that feed into the karst formation. The land owned by the Ontario Realty Corporation was designated for possible residential development. Miller called the lands a "geological wonder". He said, "These lands are the lifeline for the Eramosa Karst... we must move now to preserve the Eramosa Karst feeder lands."[tpl]cite news |title=Unique karst threatened, MPP worries |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=Hamilton Spectator |date=27 January 2011[/tpl] The bill was passed into law in the spring of 2011.[tpl]cite news |title=Congrats on victory to protect Eramosa Karst |first=Tim |last=Hudak |url= |newspaper=The Sachem / Glanbrook Gazette |date=5 April 2011[/tpl]
