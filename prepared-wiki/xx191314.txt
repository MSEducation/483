, p. 389</ref> Taking arsenic contamination into account, it was estimated that in 2004 still 74% of the population had access to arsenic-free drinking water. Another challenge is the low level of cost recovery due to low tariffs and poor [[economic efficiency]], especially in urban areas where revenues from water sales do not even cover operating costs. In rural areas, users contribute 34% of investment costs,<ref name="Danish Evaluation"/> and at least in piped water schemes supported by the [[Rural Development Academy]] recover operating costs.
Sanitation faces its own set of challenges, with only 56% of the population estimated to have had access to adequate sanitation facilities in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=CIA World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 September 2013[/tpl] A new approach to improve sanitation coverage in rural areas, the community-led total sanitation concept that has been first introduced in Bangladesh, is credited for having contributed significantly to the increase in sanitation coverage since 2000.[ref]

The government has adopted a number of policies to remedy the challenges in the sector, including National Policies for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation, both of 1998, a National Water Policy of 1999, a National Water Management Plan, and a National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation, both of 2004, as well as a National Sanitation Strategy of 2005. Among others, these policies emphasize decentralization, user participation, the role of women, and "appropriate pricing rules". The Arsenic Mitigation Policy gives "preference to surface water over groundwater". At the operational level, there has also been a conceptual shift from single-use of water - such as through handpumps for drinking water and motorized deep tubewells for irrigation - to multiple use of water from deep tubewells since the 1990s.

==Access==

Since arsenic was discovered in Bangladeshi groundwater in 1993, the share of population with access to safe drinking water had to be adjusted downward. According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation of UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), access to an improved source of water supply increased only slightly from 77% in 1990 to 81% in 2010, whereas coverage of improved sanitation increased from 39% to 46% during the same period.
Estimates of access to an improved source of water supply is greatly affected by the presence of arsenic in groundwater, which is estimated to affect 27% of all wells and is subtracted from the figures obtained by solely measuring the level of access to infrastructure. Without taking into account the presence of arsenic, 99% of the urban population and 97% of the rural population actually had access to an improved source of water supply according to the Demographic and Health Survey of 2004, which is an unusually high level of access for a low-income country. In urban areas, access is broken down as follows:
In rural areas the breakdown is:
Rainwater harvesting, although practised in Bangladesh, was not included in the survey. The official figures of the Joint Monitoring Program, taking into account the presence of arsenic, are as follows:
In 2005, the Bangladeshi Minister for Local Government and Rural Development presented a National Sanitation Strategy that ambitiously aimed to reach universal access to sanitation by 2010. Without mentioning community-led total sanitation by name (see under innovative approaches below), the strategy incorporates important elements of this approach, such as an emphasis on participation by the whole community and the principle of not subsidizing hardware except for the "hardcore poor".[tpl]cite web|last=Government of Bangladesh|title=National Sanitation Strategy 2005|url=http://www.psu-wss.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=101&Itemid=170|accessdate=20 October 2012[/tpl]

===Continuity of supply===

Among 11 cities participating in performance benchmarking in 2006-07, none provided water continuously to all customers. According to the benchmarking data, the city was the shortest supply per day was Bagerhat with 2 hours and the city with the longest supply was Dhaka with 23 hours, followed by Manikganj and Chandpur with 20 hours.[tpl]cite web|last=Water and Sanitation Program|title=Bangladesh Water Utilities Data Book, 2006–07. Benchmarking for Improving Water Supply Delivery.|url=http://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/Bangladesh_Utilities_Report.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|pages=12|year=June 2009[/tpl] Within cities, the duration of supply often varies, as it does between seasons. Major water shortages in Bangladesh occur during the dry season.[ref]
, p. 9</ref> As of 2011, however, intermittent supply was common in at least parts of Dhaka, forcing families to purchase drinking water and use pond or river water for their other needs. Regular power cuts, which turn off well pumps, also contribute to the intermittency of supply.<ref name="Rainwater harvesting"/>

===Wastewater treatment===

In Dhaka, nearly one third of domestic effluents does not receive any kind of treatment. About 30% of the served population of the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) is covered by a sewerage system, the only one in the entire country. There is one sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 120,000 m³ per day. About 30% of the population uses conventional septic tanks and another 15% uses bucket and pit latrines. During the rainy season, sewage overflows are common.[ref]

==Water resources==

===Availability of water resources===

Bangladesh has an enormous excess of surface water during the summer monsoon (June to October) and relative scarcity towards the end of the dry season in April and May. Internal renewable water resources are about 105 km3 per year, while inflowing transboundary rivers provide another 1,100 km3 annually (average 1977-2001).World Resources Institute:Water Resources and Freshwater Ecosystems, COUNTRY PROFILE - Bangladesh Bangladesh heavily depends on the flow of the Brahmaputra, Meghna and Ganges river basins that originate in India, Nepal and China. Whereas deforestation and flood control in the upstream catchment areas increase the flood peaks in Bangladesh, water withdrawals and water diversions may result in water shortages in the dry season. The Ganges Water Sharing Treaty between India and Bangladesh, signed in 1996, allows Bangladesh to receive a minimum amount of [tpl]convert|35000|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl] during the dry season.[ref]

===Sources of drinking water===

In rural areas, more than 97% of the population relies on groundwater for its drinking water supply. In Dhaka, 82% of the water supply is abstracted from groundwater that is free of arsenic, while three surface water treatment plants provide the remaining 18%.[ref]
, p. 296</ref> Groundwater is being severely depleted in Dhaka where the groundwater levels are dropping at two to three metres every year. The city’s water table has sunk by 50 metres in the past four decades and the closest underground water is now over 60 meters below ground level.<ref name="Rainwater harvesting">[tpl]cite web|last=Wadud|first=Mushfique|title=Dhaka turns to rainwater harvesting to ease water crisis|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/dhaka-turns-to-rainwater-harvesting-to-ease-water-crisis|publisher=Alertnet|accessdate=24 August 2011|date=15 August 2011[/tpl]</ref><ref>[http://www.iwmbd.org/ Institute for Water Modelling], 2009</ref> The Asian Development Bank estimated in 2007 that by 2015 a severe supply shortage would occur if the utility did not reduce groundwater abstraction.<ref>

===Arsenic contamination of groundwater===

In 1993 it was discovered that groundwater in large parts of Bangladesh was naturally contaminated with arsenic.[ref]
