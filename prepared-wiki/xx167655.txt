Michael Lorkowski (born February 26, 1955 in Hamburg) is a former German football player and current manager. 
His greatest achievement was winning the 1992 DFB Cup with Hannover 96, while the team was still in the second flight. In an unlikely triumph, they defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach on penalties on May 23, 1992 to become the first - and thus far, only - non-Bundesliga side to lift the trophy.
He also achieved three promotions to the 2. Bundesliga with FC St. Pauli (1984 and 1986) and VfB Lübeck (1995).
In recent years, he has devoted himself more to other pursuits. He has worked as a sports teacher at diploma level and also explored his love of sailing by captaining voyages off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein.http://wwww.wsv45.de/presse.html
