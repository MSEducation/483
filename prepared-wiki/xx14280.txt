[[Microsecond]]

CATEGORIES: Orders of magnitude (time)

A microsecond is an SI unit of time equal to one millionth (10−6 or 1/1,000,000) of a second.  Its symbol is μs. One microsecond is to one second as one second is to 11.574 days.
A microsecond is equal to 1000 nanoseconds or 1/1,000 milliseconds.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, measurements of 10−5 and 10−4 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of microseconds.
