The Green Berets is a 1968 American war film featuring John Wayne, George Takei, David Janssen, Jim Hutton and Aldo Ray, nominally based on the eponymous 1965 book by Robin Moore, though the screenplay has little relation to the book.
Thematically, The Green Berets is strongly anti-communist and pro-Saigon. It was produced in 1968, at the height of American involvement in the Vietnam War, the same year as the Tet offensive against the largest cities in South Vietnam. John Wayne was prompted by the anti-war atmosphere and social discontent in the U.S. to make this film in countering that. He requested and obtained full military co-operation and matériel from President Johnson. To please the Pentagon who were attempting to prosecute Robin Moore for revealing classified information, Wayne bought Moore out for $35,000 and 5 percent of undefined profits of the film.Moore, Robin Introduction to 1999 edition The Green Berets The Green Berets: The Amazing Story of the U.S. Army's Elite Special Forces Unit 2007 Skyhorse Publishing Inc.

==Plot==

At Fort Bragg, cynical newspaper reporter George Beckworth (David Janssen) is at a Special Forces briefing about the American military involvement in the war in Vietnam. The briefing at Gabriel Demonstration Area (named for SGT Jimmy Gabriel, the first "Green Beret" soldier killed in Vietnam), includes a demonstration and explanation of the whys and wherefores of participating in the Vietnam War.
Skeptical civilians and journalists are told that multinational Communism is what the U.S. is fighting in Vietnam; proof: weapons and equipment, captured from North Vietnamese soldiers and Vietcong guerrillas, manufactured in the Soviet Union, Communist Czechoslovakia, and Communist China. Despite that, Beckworth remains skeptical about the value of intervening in Vietnam's civil war. When asked by Green Beret Colonel Mike Kirby (John Wayne) if he had ever been to Southeast Asia, reporter Beckworth replies that he had not, prompting a discourteous acknowledgement of his opinion. Realizing his ignorance, Beckworth decides to go in-country to report on what he finds there so he may better his argument that America needs to stop participating in this unwinnable war.
Colonel Kirby is posted to South Vietnam with two handpicked A-Teams of Special Forces troopers. One A-Team is to replace a team at a basecamp working with South Vietnamese and Montagnard soldiers while the other A-Team is to form a counter guerrilla Mike force. While selecting his teams, Kirby intercepts a Spc. Petersen (Hutton) from another unit who is scrounging supplies from Kirby's supply depot. Realizing Petersen's skills, Kirby promotes him and brings him onto his SF team.
Arriving In South Vietnam, they meet Beckworth whom Kirby allows to join them at the basecamp where he witnesses the humanitarian aspect (irrigation ditches, bandages, candy for children) of the Special Forces mission. Still, he remains skeptical of the U.S.'s need to be there. He changes his mind after first witnessing the aftermath of a Vietcong  terror attack on a nearby Montagnard village in which the young daughter of the village Chief he had befriended earlier, as well as the Chief and most of the male villagers are tortured and executed by the VC for cooperating with the Americans, and then a ferocious North Vietnamese Army attack upon the SF camp which is overrun and evacuated. Beckworth admits to Kirby he probably will be fired from the newspaper for filing a story supporting the American war effort in S.E. Asia.  During this period, Petersen befriends a young native boy named Hamchuck, a war orphan who has no family other than his dog and the soldiers at the basecamp.  As the battle rages, the dog is killed and the boy tearfully buries his faithful companion. The boy uses the stick he had used to dig the dog's grave as the tombstone.  Symbolically, as the soldiers rush to their defensive positions, the stick is knocked away, leaving an unmarked grave.
After that battle, Beckworth temporarily disappears from the story, while Col. Mike Kirby leads a team of Green Berets, Montagnards (Degar), and ARVN soldiers on a top-secret kidnap mission capturing a very important NVA field commander, who lives, eats, and drinks very well, in a guarded mansion, while the common people go hungry, cold, and naked. Kirby's ARVN counterpart Colonel Cai uses his sister-in-law as a honey trap bait for the General. The raid is successful with the captured general airlifted out of the area by a Skyhook device but at a high cost to the patrol – many of the men are killed and left behind, including Petersen.
Near the end of the story, Beckworth watches as Hamchuck awaits the return of the helicopters carrying the survivors of the raid. He realizes the toll of the war as Hamchuck runs crying from helicopter to helicopter, searching for Petersen. Beckworth then stages out with an infantry platoon heading to their choppers.  Kirby, in a touching moment, walks over to the boy and tells him the sad news. Hamchuck asks plaintively, "what will happen to me now?" Kirby places Petersen's green beret on him and says, "You let me worry about that, Green Beret. You're what this thing's all about." The two walk holding hands along the beach into the sunset.

==Production notes==

==Realism==

Although The Green Berets portrays the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army as sadistic tyrants, it also depicts them as a capable and willing enemy. The film shows the war as one with no front lines, meaning that the enemy can show up and attack at almost any position, anywhere. It shows the sophisticated spy ring of the VC and NVA that provided information about their adversaries. Like A Yank in Viet-Nam it gave a positive view of the South Vietnamese military forces.
The US Army objected to James Lee Barrett's initial script in several ways. The first was that the Army wanted to show that South Vietnamese soldiers were involved in defending the base camp. That was rectified. Secondly, the Army objected to the portrayal of the raid with the mission of kidnapping a general because in the original script this involved crossing the border into North Vietnam.[tpl]Citation |last=Munn |first=Michael |title=John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth |year=2004 |location=London |publisher=Robson Publishing |pages=294–295 |isbn=1-86105-722-9 [/tpl]
Wayne wished the screenplay to have more development of the characters but Warner Bros. made it clear they wanted more action than talk as The Alamo was heavily criticised for too much dialogue. Scenes shot with Vera Miles as the wife of Wayne's character were jettisoned.p. 293 Munn, Michael John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth Robson, 2004

==Critical reception==

Upon its cinema release, Chicago newspaper movie critic Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and cited extensive use of cliches, depicting the war in terms of "cowboys and indians", and being a "heavy-handed, remarkably old-fashioned film."The Green Berets – Roger Ebert's Review at rogerebert.com It is on his "Most Hated" list. In The New York Times, Renata Adler wrote, "It is vile and insane. On top of that, it is dull."[tpl]cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990ce1d8163ae134bc4851dfb0668383679ede | work=The New York Times | first=Renata | last=Adler | title=Screen: 'Green Berets' as Viewed by John Wayne: War Movie Arrives at the Warner Theater | date=20 June 1968[/tpl] Oliver Stone's acclaimed anti-war film Platoon was written partially as a reaction to The Green Berets.[tpl]cite video | people=Stone, Oliver | date=2001 | title=Platoon DVD commentary | medium=DVD | publisher=MGM Home Entertainment[/tpl] It is mocked in the Gustav Hasford novel The Short-Timers in a scene where Joker and Rafter Man find the Lusthog Squad watching it at a movie theater.
However, film commentator Emanuel Levy noted in his review that Wayne was not attempting to promote the cause of the Vietnam War as much as he was trying to portray the Special Forces in their unique role in the military: "Wayne said his motive was to glorify American soldiers as the finest fighting men 'without going into why we are there, or if they should be there.' His 'compulsion' to do the movie was based on his pride of the Special Forces, determined to show 'what a magnificent job this still little-known branch of service is doing.' ... 'I wasn't trying to send a message out to anybody,' he reasoned, 'or debating whether it is right or wrong for the United States to be in this war.'"
Levy also notes that Wayne acknowledged war is generally not popular but the soldiers are in a role of sacrifice – often against their personal will or judgment. Levy quotes Wayne: “What war was ever popular for God's sake. Those men don't want to be in Vietnam anymore than anyone else. Once you go over there, you won't be middle-of-the-road."  Emanuel Levy Cinema, "The Green Berets" Review. http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/green-berets-the-2/#sthash.blok8NTW.dpuf
Despite the poor reviews, it went on to be a commercial success, which Wayne attributed in part to the negative reviews from the press, which he saw as representing criticism of the war rather than the film.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Miami News|date=6 January 1969|title=Wayne's 'Green Berets' Is A Big Money-Maker|page=5-B[/tpl] The Green Berets earned rentals of $8.7 million in North America during 1968."Big Rental Films of 1968", Variety, 8 January 1969 p 15.

The journalist John Pilger describes his reaction to The Green Berets in a 2007 speech he gave criticising the media for its coverage of the Vietnam war. "I had just come back from Vietnam, and I couldn’t believe how absurd this movie was. So I laughed out loud, and I laughed and laughed. And it wasn’t long before the atmosphere around me grew very cold. My companion, who had been a Freedom Rider in the South, said, 'Let’s get the hell out of here and run like hell.'"[tpl]cite web|last=Pilger|first=John|title=Freedom Next Time: Resisting the Empire|url=http://play.rbn.com/?url=demnow/demnow/demand/2007/aug/video/dnB20070807a.rm&proto=rtsp&start=00:10:45|work=Speech|publisher=Democracy Now[/tpl]

==Music==

The original choice for scoring the film, Elmer Bernstein, a friend and frequent collaborator with John Wayne, turned the assignment down due to his political beliefs. As a second choice, the producers contacted Miklós Rózsa then in Rome.  When asked to do The Green Berets for John Wayne, Rózsa replied  "I don't do Westerns". Rozsa was told "It's not a Western, it's an 'Eastern'".The Green Berets (1968)  As a title song, the producers used a Ken Darby choral arrangement of Barry Sadler's hit song  Ballad of the Green Berets. Rozsa provided a strong and varied musical score including a night club vocal by a Vietnamese singer Bạch Yến;More Sonobeat Artists however, bits of Onward Christian Soldiers were deleted from the final film.
