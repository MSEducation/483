Llandinam was the family home of David Davies who was responsible for much of the development of the South Wales Valleys and the export of coal in the 19th century. The house that David Davies built, Broneirion, remains an elegant country mansion owned by Girlguiding Cymru. The parents of Murray Humphreys, one of Chicago's most feared Prohibition gangsters, emigrated to the United States from the village in the late 1890s.Russo, Gus, The Outfit: The Role of Chicago's Underworld in the Shaping of Modern America. p.23
The bridge from the main road over towards Broneirion was the first cast iron bridge constructed in the county, designed by Thomas Penson and built by Davies 1846. It spans 90 feet (27.5 m). At the east end of the bridge there is a statue of David Davies.Cragg, Roger (ed):Civil Engineering Heritage, Wales and West Central England, ISBN 0 7277 2576 9
Gordonstoun school was evacuated here for the duration of World War II. The local village school was threatened with closure in 2003 due to falling pupil numbers; thanks to a popular local campaign it was temporarily saved.
Llandinam was voted the Best Kept Village in Wales in  1986.
