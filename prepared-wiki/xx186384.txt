The Dassaretae, or Dexaroi, ([tpl]lang-el|Δασσαρέται[/tpl] or Δεξάροι) were an ancient Greek tribe of Epirus living from Mount Amyron (Mount Tomorr) to Lake Lychnitis (Lake Ohrid) on the border with Illyria.

They were the northern-most subtribe of the Chaonians.[tpl]harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|p=432[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Sakellariou|1997|p=55[/tpl]. Strabo, quoting Theopompus, wrote of fourteen tribes of Epeirotes, speakers of a strong west-Greek dialect (of which the Dexaroi were a part).Strabo. Geography, VII.7.5. The 6th century BC geographer Hecataeus of Miletus described the Dexaroi, the most northern tribe of the Chaonians, as a Greek-speaking people residing next to the Illyrian tribe of the Encheleae.[tpl]harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|loc=p. 423 (Hecataeus, FGrH I F 103)[/tpl]. Their cities were Pellion, Antipatrea, Chrysondyon, Gertus (or Gerous) and Creonion.
An Illyrian tribe of the same or similar name laid further north between the Dardani and the Ardiaei, which is often confused with that of the Dassaretae of the (Greek) Chaonian group.[tpl]harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|p=423[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=174[/tpl]. This is confirmed by the fact that Illyrius, according to Appian of Alexandria, had a daughter, Dassaro, from whom sprang the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretae (or Dasaretii).Appian. History of Rome, "The Illyrian Wars", §2.
