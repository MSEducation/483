Millstream Chichester National Park is a national park in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (Australia), and is located [tpl]convert|1190|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of the state capital, Perth.
The park is made up of the old Millstream station which is on the Millstream Creek, just before it joins Fortescue River one of the few permanent watercourses in the area and the Chichester Range.

==History==

The area is homeland of the Yinjibarndi people. Millstream Creek was named by the explorer Francis Thomas Gregory in 1861. He reported the favourable grazing prospects. The first pastoral lease was taken up on 1865. 
By 1907 the property was owned by Loton and Padbury and occupied an area of [tpl]convert|1000|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl]. It was stocked with 20,500 sheep, 1,900 cattle and 150 horses and was passed in at auction at £26,000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article90405826 |title=Station properties on the market|newspaper=Kalgoorlie Miner|location=Western Australia |date=6 September 1907|accessdate=3 November 2013|page=6|publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
The present Millstream Homestead was built in 1920. The homestead was a tavern between 1975 and 1986.
