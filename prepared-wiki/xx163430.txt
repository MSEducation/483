CATEGORIES: State highways in Washington (state), Transportation in Tacoma, Washington, Point Defiance

State Route 163 (SR 163) is a [tpl]convert|3.37|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] state highway in the U.S. state of Washington. The highway serves the city of Tacoma and the community of Ruston in Pierce County before traveling via a ferry route to the community of Tahlequah on Vashon Island in King County. SR 163 begins at an interchange with SR 16 in Tacoma and travels north as Pearl Street through Ruston to Point Defiance, where the designation continues onto the MV Chetzemoka ferry to Tahlequah.
SR 163 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering, extending from Sumner to Auburn. The highway was previously a part of the Pacific Highway during the early 20th century, but was designated as a branch of State Road 5 and Primary State Highway 5 (PSH 5) until 1964. SR 163 became SR 167 during the late 1960s and was moved to Pearl Street in 1991, with the ferry route being added in 1994.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 1,000 and 26,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly at the SR 16 interchange in Tacoma.[tpl]citation |author=Staff |year=2011 |title=2011 Annual Traffic Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/pdf/Annual_Traffic_Report_2011.pdf |format=PDF |page=148 |accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl] The Point Defiance–Tahlequah ferry carried 650,000 passengers and 383,000 vehicles in 2012, according to WSF statistics.[tpl]citation |title=WSDOT Ferries Division (WSF) - Nation’s Largest Ferry System |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation, Washington State Ferries |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0B14963D-DFE3-479A-A178-087D05E837F9/0/WSFFactSheetJanuary2013v1Web.pdf |format=PDF |date=January 2013 |accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl]
