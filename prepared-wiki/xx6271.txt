[[Lowball]]

Lowball was an early type of railway signal which indicated danger or a need to stop.  The ball signal was a light or indicator suspended from a rope, that could move upwards and downwards, held by a weighted ball.  The lowball signal was indicated when the weighted ball, and therefore signal, was at the end of its rope in the low position, indicating stop.[ref]Yoshinori Kon, "The Current Status of Signal Control Systems, and Research and Development" JR EAST Technical Review (Technology and Planning Department
