</ref> The vigilantes, calling themselves the ''Humboldt Volunteers, Second Brigade'', had been formed in early February 1860 in the inland town of [[Hydesville, California|Hydesville]], one of the ranching communities in the Nongatl area. They spent most of February "in the field" attacking Indians along the Eel River. A petition had been sent to California Governor [[John G. Downey]] asking that the ''Humboldt Volunteers'' be mustered into service and given regular pay.<ref name="TimesFeb25">[tpl]cite news |title =Humboldt Volunteers |date=25 February 1860 |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/HumboldtVolunteers.html |deadurl=no |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]</ref> Downey declined the petition, stating that the U.S. Army was sending an additional Company of Regulars to Fort Humboldt.<ref name="Rohde" />

==Consequences==

The Wiyot Tribe said their people were not allowed to return to the island or their other land and they often found their land stolen or destroyed. Soldiers from Fort Humboldt took many of the surviving Wiyot into protective custody at the fort, later transporting them to the Klamath River Reservation.[ref]
</ref> Recently, the Wiyot have been repurchasing the land in order to perform their annual World Renewal Ceremony.<ref name ="SSF">
