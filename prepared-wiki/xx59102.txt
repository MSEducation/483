The original design Galileo Galilei came up with in 1609 is commonly called a Galilean telescope. It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (plano-concave) eyepiece lens (Galileo, 1610).Sidereus Nuncius or The Sidereal Messenger, 1610, Galileo Galilei et. al., 1989, pg. 37, The University of Chicago Press, Albert van Helden tr., (History Dept. Rice University, Houston, TX), ISBN 0-226-27903-0. A Galilean telescope, because the design has no intermediary focus, results in an non inverted and upright image.
Galileo’s best telescope magnified objects about 30 times. Because of flaws in its design, such as the shape of the lens and the narrow field of view, the images were blurry and distorted. Despite these flaws, the telescope was still good enough for Galileo to explore the sky. The Galilean telescope could view the phases of Venus, and was able to see craters on the Moon and four moons orbiting Jupiter.
Parallel rays of light from a distant object (y) would be brought to a focus in the focal plane of the objective lens (F' L1 / y’). The (diverging) eyepiece (L2) lens intercepts these rays and renders them parallel once more. Non-parallel rays of light from the object traveling at an angle α1 to the optical axis travel at a larger angle (α2 > α1)  after they passed through the eyepiece. This leads to an increase in the apparent angular size and is responsible for the perceived magnification.
The final image (y’’) is a virtual image, located at infinity and is the same way up as the object.

===Keplerian Telescope===

The Keplerian Telescope, invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, is an improvement on Galileo's design.[tpl]cite book |title= Optics|last= Tunnacliffe|first= AH|authorlink= |coauthors= Hirst JG|year= 1996|publisher= |location= Kent, England |isbn= 0-900099-15-1|page= |pages= 233–7|url= [/tpl] It uses a convex lens as the eyepiece instead of Galileo's concave one. The advantage of this arrangement is that the rays of light emerging from the eyepiece are converging. This allows for a much wider field of view and greater eye relief, but the image for the viewer is inverted. Considerably higher magnifications can be reached with this design, but to overcome aberrations the simple objective lens needs to have a very high f-ratio (Johannes Hevelius built one with a [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|abbr=out|adj=on|disp=flip[/tpl] focal length, and even longer tubeless "aerial telescopes" were constructed). The design also allows for use of a micrometer at the focal plane (used to determining the angular size and/or distance between objects observed).

===Achromatic refractors===

The achromatic refracting lens was invented in 1733 by an English barrister named Chester Moore Hall, although it was independently invented and patented by John Dollond around 1758. The design overcame the need for very long focal lengths in refracting telescopes by using an objective made of two pieces of glass with different dispersion, "crown" and "flint glass",  to limit the effects of chromatic and spherical aberration.  Each side of each piece is ground and polished, and then the two pieces are assembled together. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. The era of the Great refractors in the 19th century saw large achromatic lenses culminating with largest achromatic refractor ever built, the Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900.

===Apochromatic refractors===

Apochromatic refractors have objectives built with special, extra-low dispersion materials. They are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (tertiary spectrum) can be up to an order of magnitude less than that of an achromatic lens.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] Such telescopes contain elements of fluorite or special, extra-low dispersion (ED) glass in the objective and produce a very crisp image that is virtually free of chromatic aberration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/equipbasicsref.aspx |title=Starizona's Guide to CCD Imaging |publisher=Starizona.com |accessdate=17 October 2013[/tpl] Due to the special materials needed in the fabrication, apochromatic refractors are usually more expensive than telescopes of other types with a comparable aperture.

==Technical considerations==

Refractors suffer from residual chromatic and spherical aberration. This affects shorter focal lengths more than longer ones.  A [tpl]convert|4|in|mm|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] [tpl]f/|6|link=yes[/tpl] achromatic refractor is likely to show considerable color fringing (generally a purple halo around bright objects). A [tpl]convert|4|in|mm|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] [tpl]f/[/tpl]16 has little color fringing.  
In very large apertures, there is also a problem of lens sagging, a result of gravity deforming glass. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens sags due to gravity, distorting the images it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around [tpl]convert|1|m|in|abbr=out|sp=us[/tpl]."Physics Demystified" By Stan Gibilisco, ISBN 0-07-138201-1, page 515
There is a further problem of glass defects, striae or small air bubbles trapped within the glass. In addition, glass is opaque to certain wavelengths, and even visible light is dimmed by reflection and absorption when it crosses the air-glass interfaces and passes through the glass itself. Most of these problems are avoided or diminished in reflecting telescopes, which can be made in far larger apertures and which have all but replaced refractors for astronomical research.
