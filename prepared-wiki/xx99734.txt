2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) is a psychedelic drug and a substituted amphetamine of the phenethylamine family. Despite being a substituted amphetamine, it is not a stimulant. DOI has a stereocenter and R-(-)-DOI is the more active stereoisomer. In neuroscience research, 125I-R-(-)-DOI is used as a radioligand and indicator of the presence of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. DOI's effects have been compared to LSD, although there are differences that experienced users can distinguish.  Besides the longer duration, the trip tends to be more energetic than an LSD trip, with more body load and a different subjective visual experience. The after effects include residual stimulation and difficulty sleeping, which, depending on the dose, may persist for days.[tpl]cite book|author=Shulgin, A; Shulgin, A|chapter=#67 DOI|title=PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story|publisher=Transform Press|isbn=978-0963009609|date=1990|archiveurl=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml|archivedate=2009|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal067.shtml[/tpl] It is sometimes sold as a substitute for LSD, or even sold falsely as LSD, which may be dangerous because DOI does not have the same established safety profile as LSD.[tpl]cite journal|author=DEA|date=June 2008|title=DEA Mircrogram|publisher=DEA, United States Government|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0608/mg0608.html|accessdate=12 February 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090204025435/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0608/mg0608.html| archivedate= 4 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

DOI is a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist.[tpl]cite journal|last=Canal|first=CE|author2=Morgan, D|title=Head-twitch response in rodents induced by the hallucinogen 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine: a comprehensive history, a re-evaluation of mechanisms, and its utility as a model|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|date=July 2012|volume=4|issue=7-8|pages=556–576|doi=10.1002/dta.1333|pmid=22517680|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722587/pdf/nihms-496479.pdf|format=PDF|pmc=3722587[/tpl]
DOI has also recently been shown to be an extremely potent inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, an inflammatory mediator which is an important target for current research into degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, where the disease process involves tissue damage through chronic inflammation. This could make DOI and other 5-HT2A agonists an entirely new area for development of novel treatments for these conditions.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Yu |first=B |last2=Becnel |first2=J|last3=Zerfaoui |first3=M |last4=Rohatgi |first4=R |last5=Boulares |first5=AH |last6=Nichols |first6=C.

==History==

In January 2007, British Police reported that 3 young men had fallen ill, reportedly, after taking DOI at a rave in Biggleswade, near Milton Keynes, and warned others who had taken it to seek medical attention.  This would appear to be the first indication that DOI has found more widespread use as a recreational drug in the UK.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6308895.stm |title=New drug alert as three taken ill |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2007[/tpl]
An extremely large increase of the hallucinogenic drug has been seen in sales in Adelaide, Australia. It is commonly sold as LSD or just "trips".[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/extra-strong-new-lsd-type-hallucinogenic-drug-hits-adelaide-police-warn/story-e6freo8c-1225781932681 |title=Extra-strong new LSD-type hallucinogenic drug hits Adelaide, police warn |date=October 2, 2009 |work=Adelaide Now[/tpl]
