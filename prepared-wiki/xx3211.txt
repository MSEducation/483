The film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on only a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot."[ref]

Bernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois, because it was filled with old buildings "that exist in New York now, and that have that seedy run-down quality" that the team was looking for.[tpl]cite news | last = Maronie | first = Samuel J. | coauthors = | title = From Forbidden Planet to Escape from New York: A candid conversation with SFX & production designer Joe Alves | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Starlog | date = May 1981 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 [/tpl] East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, "block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away." As well, Alves found an old bridge to double for the "69th St. Bridge". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them for a dollar, "so that they wouldn't have any liability," Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis, Missouri were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theater, both of which have since been renovated.[tpl]cite news|title=Show Me the movies|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=2005-04-17|author=Williams, Joe|page=C1[/tpl]

===Production===

Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange."
The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a spiked bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape."[tpl]cite news | last = Naha | first=Ed | title = Escape From New York | publisher = Future Life (#30) | date = November 1981 | url = http://www.theefnylapage.com/articles/Future%20Life%201981.pdf[/tpl] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, in order to utilize their then futuristic-looking rapid-transit system.[tpl]cite news|title=St. Louis Q&A|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|author=Berger, Jerry|date=1995-02-05|page=17[/tpl]
When it came to shooting in New York City, Carpenter managed to persuade federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble."[tpl]cite news | last = Osborne | first = Robert | coauthors = | title = On Location | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Hollywood Reporter | date = October 24, 1980 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/reporter801024.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 [/tpl]
Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England."
Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures.
As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. What appears on those screens was not computer-generated. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics which were very expensive at the time, even for such a simple animation. To get the animation he wanted, the effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation.[tpl]cite video|title=Escape from New York (Special Edition)|date=2003|people=Atkins, Tom; Barbeau, Adrienne[/tpl]

==Reception==

Escape from New York grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981. The film received generally positive reviews. As of April 2013, it has a rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. Newsweek magazine commented on Carpenter, saying, "has a deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility - which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however."[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = A Helluva Town | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Newsweek | date = July 27, 1981 | url = http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/newsweek810727.html | accessdate = 2007-05-30 [/tpl] In Time magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, "John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia.

Cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his novel Neuromancer. "I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot." Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the movie frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the Metal Gear series. The character Solid Snake is strongly based on Snake Plissken. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Snake actually uses the alias "Pliskin" to hide his real identity during the game.SEAL: I'm not an enemy. Calm down. My name is S... My name is Pliskin. Iroquois Pliskin, Lieutenant Junior Grade. (Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Konami, 2001). J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film Cloverfield, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for Escape from New York.[tpl]cite news|title=Commentary: Filmmakers enjoy laying waste to New York|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Eberson, Sharon|date=2008-01-04[/tpl] Empire magazine ranked Snake Plissken #71 in their "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" poll.[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The 100 Greatest Movie Characters | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Empire | date = | url = http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=71 | accessdate = 2008-12-02 [/tpl]

===DVD releases===

Escape from New York was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a High Definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 Stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, and the ten-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.[tpl]cite journal| last = Netherby| first = Jennifer| title = Escape to a special edition| journal = Video Business| volume = 23| issue = 34| pages = 8| date = 2003-08-25| publisher = Reed Business Information[/tpl]
MGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared.  The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository.  The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there."[tpl]cite journal| last = Hulse| first = Ed| title = A newfound Escape| journal = Video Business| volume = 23| issue = 47| pages = 33| date = 2003-11-24| publisher = Reed Business Information| id = ISSN: 0279-571X[/tpl] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2008-08-28|url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4592016|title= Escape From New York (UMD Video For PSP)  |publisher=Wal-Mart [/tpl]

===Novelization===

In 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk — both disillusioned war veterans — deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.[tpl]cite book| last =McQuay| first =Mike| title =Escape from New York| publisher =Bantam Books| date =May 1981| location =| pages =| isbn =0-553-25375-1[/tpl]

==Sequel==

A sequel, Escape from L.A., was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also acting as producer and co-writer.

==Remake==

In 2007 Scottish actor Gerard Butler was close to signing a deal where he would play Snake Plissken in a remake of Carpenter's movie.[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |title=Butler has Escape plan |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961020.html |publisher=Variety |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-07 [/tpl] Neal Moritz was to produce and Ken Nolan was to write the screenplay which would combine an original story for Plissken with the story from the 1981 movie, although Carpenter hinted that the film might be a prequel.[tpl]cite news | last = Epstein | first = Daniel Robert | coauthors = | title = John Carpenter | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = SuicideGirls.com | date = March 20, 2007 | url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/John+Carpenter/ | accessdate = 2007-03-23 [/tpl]
New Line Cinema (one-time video distributor of the original) acquired the rights to the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, "Snake is one of my fondest creations.

I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American."[ref]
