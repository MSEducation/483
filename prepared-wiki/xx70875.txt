Hieracium [tpl]IPAc-en|h|aɪ|.|ər|ˈ|æ|s|i|əm[/tpl],[ref]
</ref>
known by the common name hawkweed and classically as hierakion (from ancient Greek hierax 'hawk'),[ref]
</ref>  
is a genus of the sunflower (Helianthus) family Asteraceae (or Compositae), and closely related to dandelion (Taraxacum), chicory (Cichorium), prickly lettuce (Lactuca) and sow thistle (Sonchus),[ref]

</ref>
which are part of the tribe Cichorieae. Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies,[ref]

</ref> do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowers.<ref name='PFG'>

[/ref]
Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing that it is impossible to know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.

==Description==

===Flowers and flower-heads===

Hieracium or hawkweeds, like others in the Asteraceae family, have mostly yellow,[ref]

</ref> 
tightly packed flower-heads of numerous small flowers
but, unlike daisies and sunflowers in the same family, they have not two kinds of florets but only strap-shaped (spatulate) florets, each one of which is a complete flower in itself, not lacking stamens,
and joined to the stem by leafy bracts.  As in other members of the tribe Cichorieae, each ray corolla is tipped by 3 to 5 teeth.

===Bracts, stems and leaves===

Erect single, glabrous or hairy stems, sometimes branched away from the point of attachment, sometimes branched throughout.
The hairiness of hawkweeds can be very complex: from surfaces with scattered to crowded, tapered, whiplike, straight or curly, smooth to setae; "stellate-pubescent" or surfaces with scattered to crowded, dendritically branched (often called, but seldom truly, "stellate") hairs; and "stipitate-glandular" or surfaces with scattered to crowded gland-tipped hairs mostly. Surfaces of stems, leaves, peduncles, and phyllaries may be glabrous or may bear one, two, or all three of the types of hairs mentioned above.[ref]

</ref>
Like the other members of the Chicory tribe, hawkweeds contain a milky latex.

==Ecology==

The Large Yellow Underwing (Noctua pronuba) feeds on Hieracium species.

==Distribution==

Hieracium species are native to Africa,Asia, Europe, North America,[ref]
