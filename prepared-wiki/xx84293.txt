[[Archetype (Fear Factory album)]]

CATEGORIES: Fear Factory albums, 2004 albums

Archetype is the fifth studio album by Los Angeles industrial metal band Fear Factory. It was released on April 19, 2004 through Liquid 8. This album is not a concept album like the previous three studio albums. The music on this album returns to the style of the Demanufacture era which pleased many fans. Archetype was also issued in a Limited Edition Digipak with a bonus DVD. Depending on where the digipak was obtained, the bonus DVD is either for their "Australian Tour 2004" and the video for "Cyberwaste" or one based around The Making of Archetype. Some, though not all, versions of the bonus digipak also included a gold ticket that gave the owner a chance to meet Fear Factory live.
