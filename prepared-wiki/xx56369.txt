The [tpl]Nihongo|Hankyu Kyoto Main Line|阪急京都本線|Hankyū Kyōto Honsen[/tpl] is a railway line in Japan operated by the private railway operator Hankyu Railway. It links Umeda Station, northern junction of Osaka and Kawaramachi Station with Kyoto.

==Definition==

The Kyoto Main Line is often called the [tpl]Nihongo|Kyoto Line|京都線|Kyōto-sen[/tpl] for short, and in a broader sense two branch lines, the Senri Line and the Arashiyama Line, are included to the Kyoto Line by historical, geographical and structural reasons. The other two networks of Hankyu, the Kobe Line and the Takarazuka Line are called the [tpl]Nihongo||神宝線|Shinpōsen[/tpl] as a whole.
Officially, the Kyoto Main Line is from Jūsō to Kawaramachi, however, all trains run over Jūsō to Umeda terminal, using eastern dual track of the Takarazuka Line exclusively. Hankyu treats the Kyoto Main Line in the same way as the passengers do as the line between Umeda and Kawaramachi except for in special occasions like governmental procedures.

In the table below, service types that stop at the station are shown by the abbreviations (see the section above). Blank means that the service type passes the station. In addition to the types shown here, local trains stop at all stations (not including Higashi-Suita Signal Stop, where only a garage of Osaka Subway cars exists).
No trains stop at [tpl]Ja-stalink|Nakatsu||Hankyu[/tpl] which is served by Local trains on the Kobe Line and the Takarazuka Line, because of the absence of platform, thus, in operation, there is no Nakatsu Station on the Kyoto Line. There are also through trains to the Senri Line from Awaji Station and the Osaka Municipal Subway Sakaisuji Line. Sakaisuji Semi-Express trains are routed from Tengachaya Station to Kawaramachi Station and operated on weekday rush hours and Saturdays and holidays.
The starting point of the distances (km) shown is Jūsō Station, which is officially the starting point of the Kyoto Main Line.

Prior to the merger of Hankyu Railway (then Hanshin Kyūkō Railway) and Keihan Electric Railway in 1943, the line and its branches were owned by the latter and called the Shin-Keihan (New Keihan) Line. In the breakup of the merger in 1949, the line was not ceded to Keihan and became a competitor of the Keihan Main Line.
