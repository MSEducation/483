Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water, and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesives, sealants, pigments, foods (source of Zn nutrient), batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, and first-aid tapes.  It occurs naturally as the mineral zincite, but most zinc oxide is produced synthetically.Marcel De Liedekerke,  "2.3. Zinc Oxide (Zinc White): Pigments, Inorganic, 1" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a20_243.pub2[/tpl]
In materials science, ZnO is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of the II-VI semiconductor group (since oxygen was classed as an element of VIA group (the 6th main group, now referred to as 16th) of the periodic table and zinc, a transition metal, as a member of the IIB (2nd B), now 12th, group). The native doping of the semiconductor (due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials)[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1992666|title=A comprehensive review of ZnO materials and devices|year=2005|author=Özgür, Ü.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=98|pages=041301|last2=Alivov|first2=Ya.

This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties are used in emerging applications for transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, in energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and in electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.

==Chemical properties==

ZnO occurs as a white powder.  The mineral zincite usually contains manganese and other impurities that confer a yellow to red color.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1002/cphc.200700002|title=ZnO: Material, Physics and Applications|year=2007|author=Klingshirn, C.|journal=ChemPhysChem|volume=8|pages=782–803|pmid=17429819|issue=6[/tpl]
Crystalline zinc oxide is thermochromic, changing from white to yellow when heated and in air reverting to white on cooling.[tpl]cite book|author=Wiberg, E. and Holleman, A. F.|year=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-12-352651-5[/tpl] This color change is caused by a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800 °C, x = 0.00007.
Zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide. It is nearly insoluble in water, but it is soluble in (degraded by) most acids, such as hydrochloric acid:[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd[/tpl]
Bases also degrade the solid to give soluble zincates:
ZnO reacts slowly with fatty acids in oils to produce the corresponding carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1004327018497|title=The chemistry of cements formed between zinc oxide and aqueous zinc chloride|year=1998|author=Nicholson, J.

ZnO also forms cement-like material when treated with phosphoric acid; related materials are used in dentistry. A major component of zinc phosphate cement produced by this reaction is hopeite, Zn3(PO4)2·4H2O.[tpl]cite journal|title=Setting reaction and resultant structure of zinc phosphate cement in various orthophosphoric acid cement-forming liquids|author=Park C.-K., Silsbee M.

ZnO decomposes into zinc vapor and oxygen at around 1975 °C with a standard oxygen pressure. In a carbothermic reaction, heating with carbon converts the oxide into zinc vapor at a much lower temperature (around 950 °C).[tpl]cite book|author=Greenwood, N.

It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give the sulfide. This reaction is used commercially.

===Structure===

Zinc oxide crystallizes in two main forms, hexagonal wurtzite[tpl]cite book|last=Fierro|first=J. L. G|title=Metal Oxides: Chemistry & Applications|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=182|isbn=0824723716[/tpl] and cubic zincblende.  The wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common. The zincblende form can be stabilized by growing ZnO on substrates with cubic lattice structure. In both cases, the zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral, the most characteristic geometry for Zn(II).  ZnO converts to the rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 GPa.
Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no inversion symmetry (reflection of a crystal relative to any given point does not transform it into itself). This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of hexagonal ZnO.
The hexagonal structure has a point group 6 mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 is close to the ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633.[tpl]cite book|title=Landolt-Bornstein, New Series, Group III|volume=Vol. 17B, 22, 41B|editor=Rossler, U. |publisher=Springer, Heidelberg|year=1999[/tpl] As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2–) with the corresponding radii of 0.074 nm for Zn2+ and 0.140 nm for O2–. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure,[tpl]cite book|author1=Claus Franz Klingshirn|author2=Bruno K. Meyer|author3=Andreas Waag|coauthors=Axel Hoffmann, Johannes M. M. Geurts|title=Zinc Oxide: From Fundamental Properties Towards Novel Applications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TYXinw6pKk4C&pg=PA9|accessdate=9 December 2011|date=1 August 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-10576-0|pages=9–10[/tpl] as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained yet.[tpl]cite journal|format=free download pdf|author=Baruah, S. and Dutta, J.|title=Hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanostructures|journal=Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater.|volume=10|year=2009|page=013001|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/10/1/013001|bibcode = 2009STAdM..10a3001B |last2=Dutta[/tpl]

===Mechanical properties===

ZnO is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2007.11.013|title=CuO, ZrO2 and ZnO nanoparticles as antiwear additive in oil lubricants|year=2008|author=Hernandezbattez, A|journal=Wear|volume=265|pages=422|last2=Gonzalez|first2=R|last3=Viesca|first3=J|last4=Fernandez|first4=J|last5=Diazfernandez|first5=J|last6=MacHado|first6=A|last7=Chou|first7=R|last8=Riba|first8=J|issue=3–4[/tpl] Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN. The high heat capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics. 
ZnO exhibits a very long lived optical phonon E2(low) with a lifetime as high as 133 ps at 10 K [tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.3387843[/tpl][tpl]clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it has been stated that ZnO has the highest piezoelectric tensor, or at least one comparable to that of GaN and AlN.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.50.10715|title=Ab initio study of piezoelectricity and spontaneous polarization in ZnO|year=1994|last1=Dal Corso|first1=Andrea|journal=Physical Review B|volume=50|pages=10715|last2=Posternak|first2=Michel|last3=Resta|first3=Raffaele|last4=Baldereschi|first4=Alfonso|issue=15|bibcode = 1994PhRvB..5010715D [/tpl] This property makes it a technologically important material for many piezoelectrical applications, which require a large electromechanical coupling.

===Electrical properties===

ZnO has a relatively large direct band gap of ~3.3 eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4 eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.
Most ZnO has n-type character, even in the absence of intentional doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible.
Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0248(01)01972-8|title=Growth and characterization of Ga-doped ZnO layers on a-plane sapphire substrates grown by molecular beam epitaxy|year=2002|author=Kato, H|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=237–239|page=538|bibcode=2002JCrGr.237..538K|last2=Sano|first2=Michihiro|last3=Miyamoto|first3=Kazuhiro|last4=Yao|first4=Takafumi[/tpl]
Reliable p-type doping of ZnO remains difficult. This problem originates from low solubility of p-type dopants and their compensation by abundant n-type impurities. This problem is observed with GaN and ZnSe. Measurement of p-type in "intrinsically" n-type material is complicated by the inhomogeneity of samples.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1557/JMR.2008.0300|title=Positive Hall coefficients obtained from contact misplacement on evident n-type ZnO films and crystals|year=2008|author=Ohgaki, Takeshi|journal=Journal of Materials Research|volume=23|pages=2293|last2=Ohashi|first2=Naoki|last3=Sugimura|first3=Shigeaki|last4=Ryoken|first4=Haruki|last5=Sakaguchi|first5=Isao|last6=Adachi|first6=Yutaka|last7=Haneda|first7=Hajime|issue=9|bibcode = 2008JMatR..23.2293O [/tpl]
Current limitations to p-doping does not limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; as well as copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.
Electron mobility of ZnO strongly varies with temperature and has a maximum of ~2000 cm2/(V·s) at 80 K.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3697(74)80026-0|title=Halleffekt und anisotropie der beweglichkeit der elektronen in ZnO|year=1974|author=Wagner, P|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=35|pages=327|last2=Helbig|first2=R|bibcode=1974JPCS...35..327W|issue=3[/tpl] Data on hole mobility are scarce with values in the range 5–30 cm2/(V·s).[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1590423|title=Properties of arsenic-doped p-type ZnO grown by hybrid beam deposition|year=2003|author=Ryu, Y. R.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=83|pages=87|last2=Lee|first2=T. S.|last3=White|first3=H. W.|bibcode = 2003ApPhL..83...87R [/tpl]

==Production==

For industrial use, ZnO is produced at levels of 105 tons per year by three main processes:[tpl]cite book|author=Porter, F.|title=Zinc Handbook: Properties, Processing, and Use in Design|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=0-8247-8340-9[/tpl]

===Indirect process===

In the indirect or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907 °C (typically around 1000 °C). Zinc vapor reacts with the oxygen in the air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.

===Direct process===

The direct or American process starts with diverse contaminated zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with a source of carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process as compared to the indirect one.

===Wet chemical process===

A small amount of industrial production involves wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions of purified zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The precipitate is then filtered, washed, dried and calcined at temperatures around 800 °C.

===Laboratory synthesis===

A large number of specialised methods exist for producing ZnO for scientific studies and niche applications. These methods can be classified by the resulting ZnO form (bulk, thin film, nanowire), temperature ("low", that is close to room temperature or "high", that is T ~ 1000 °C), process type (vapor deposition or growth from solution) and other parameters.
Large single crystals (many cubic centimeters) can be grown by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis,[tpl]cite journal|journal = Journal of Crystal Growth|volume = 310|year =2008|page= 1832|title = Inductively heated Bridgman method for the growth of zinc oxide single crystals|author= Schulz, D.|doi = 10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2007.11.050|issue = 7–9|bibcode = 2008JCrGr.310.1832S |author2 = and others|displayauthors = 1|last3 = Klimm|first3 = Detlef|last4 = Struve|first4 = Karin[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/2/025009|format= free download pdf|title=Growth of ZnO nanowires on nonwoven polyethylene fibers|year=2008|author=Baruah, Sunandan|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|pages=025009|last2=Thanachayanont|first2=Chanchana|last3=Dutta|first3=Joydeep|issue=2|bibcode = 2008STAdM...9b5009B [/tpl] or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.
Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide.

===ZnO nanostructures===

Nanostructures of ZnO can be synthesized into a variety of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.stam.2007.02.012|format=free download pdf|title=Synthesis, microstructure and photoluminescence of well-aligned ZnO nanorods on Si substrate|year=2007|author=Miao, L.|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=8|pages=443|last2=Ieda|first2=Y.|last3=Tanemura|first3=S.|last4=Cao|first4=Y.G.|last5=Tanemura|first5=M.|last6=Hayashi|first6=Y.|last7=Toh|first7=S.|last8=Kaneko|first8=K.|issue=6|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..443M [/tpl]
Rodlike nanostructures of ZnO can be produced via aqueous methods, which are attractive for the following reasons: They are low cost, less hazardous[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl], and thus capable of easy scaling up; the growth occurs at a relatively low temperature, compatible with flexible organic substrates; there is no need for the use of metal catalysts, and thus it can be integrated with well-developed silicon technologies. In addition, there are a variety of parameters that can be tuned to effectively control the morphology and properties of the final product. Wet chemical methods have been demonstrated as a very powerful and versatile technique for growing one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures.[tpl]cite journal|author=Xu, S.; Wang, ZL.|journal=Nano Res.|volume=4|year=2011|pages=1013–1098|title=One-dimensional ZnO nanostructures: Solution growth and functional properties|doi=10.1007/s12274-011-0160-7|issue=11[/tpl] The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90 °C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment.

==History==

Zinc compounds were probably used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is mentioned in the Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before.[tpl]cite book|page=27|chapter=Zinc in India|author=Craddock|title=2000 years of zinc and brass|publisher=British Museum|year=1998|isbn=0-86159-124-0|author-separator=|author2= P. T.|author3=and others|displayauthors=2[/tpl] Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.)[tpl]cite book|pages=111–112|chapter=Mining and Metallurgy, chapter 4 |author=Craddock, P.

Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.[tpl]Cite book|title=Breast Cancer: Cause – Prevention – Cure|first=Fred John|last=Harding|publisher=Tekline Publishing|year=2007|isbn=0-9554221-0-8|page=83|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0h2gDLv3MOEC&pg=PT83[/tpl]
The Romans produced considerable quantities of brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) as early as 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide."zinc." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009 Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 10 March 2009 The zinc oxide is thought to have been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10853-008-2942-1|title=The origins and inspirations of zinc smelting|year=2009|last1=Craddock|first1=Paul Terence|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=44|pages=2181|issue=9|bibcode = 2009JMatS..44.2181C [/tpl] Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from the second half of the first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.
From the 12th to the 16th century zinc and zinc oxide were recognized and produced in India using a primitive form of the direct synthesis process. From India, zinc manufacture moved to China in the 17th century. In 1743, the first European zinc smelter was established in Bristol, United Kingdom.General Information of Zinc from the National Institute of Health, WHO, and International Zinc Association accessed 10 March 2009
The main usage of zinc oxide (zinc white) was again paints and additive to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a watercolor by 1834 but it did not mix well with oil. This problem was quickly solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so "clean" it is very valuable for making tints with other colors; however, it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years.Zinc zhite accessed 10 March 2009
In the recent times, most zinc oxide was used in the rubber industry (see applications above). In the 1970s, the second largest application of ZnO was photocopying. High-quality ZnO produced by the "French process" was added into the photocopying paper as a filler. This application was however soon displaced.

==Applications==

The applications of zinc oxide powder are numerous, and the principal ones are summarized below. Most applications exploit the reactivity of the oxide as a precursor to other zinc compounds. For material science applications, zinc oxide has high refractive index, high thermal conductivity, binding, antibacterial and UV-protection properties. Consequently, it is added into materials and products including plastics, ceramics, glass, cement,[tpl]cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pescador|first=R|coauthors=Brown, JT; Roberts, M; Urdea, MS|title=The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetM from Ureaplasma urealyticum.|journal=Nucleic acids research|date=Feb 11, 1988|volume=16|issue=3|pages=1216–7|pmid=3344217|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3344217/|accessdate=8 April 2014[/tpl] rubber, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesive, sealants, concrete manufacturing, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, etc.

===Ceramic industry===

Ceramic industry consumes a significant amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.

===Medicine===

Zinc oxide as a mixture with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is called calamine and is used in calamine lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been historically called calamine. When mixed with eugenol, a ligand, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry.[tpl]cite book|author=van Noort, Richard|year=2002|title=Introduction to Dental Materials, 2d Edition|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7234-3215-5[/tpl]

Zinc oxide nanoparticles can enhance the antibacterial activity of Ciprofloxacin. It has been shown that nano ZnO which has the average size between 20 nm and 45 nm can enhance the antibacterial activity of Ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in Vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration-dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein. NorA is a protein which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluroquinolones from a cell. Second, Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein.

===Coatings===

Paints containing zinc oxide powder have long been utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.
ZnO highly n-type doped with Al, Ga, or In is transparent and conductive (transparency ~90%, lowest resistivity ~10−4 Ω·cm[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70078-0|title=ZnO – nanostructures, defects, and devices|year=2007|author=Schmidtmende, L|journal=Materials Today|volume=10|pages=40|last2=MacManusdriscoll|first2=J|issue=5[/tpl]). ZnO:Al coatings are used for energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation back into the room (energy saving) or does not let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), depending on which side of the window has the coating.

==Potential applications==

===Electronics===

ZnO has wide direct band gap (3.37 eV or 375 nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common potential applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as TCO layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037444|title=ZnO – GaN Hybrid Heterostructures as Potential Cost Efficient LED Technology|year=2010|author=Bakin, A. |journal=IEEE (Invited Paper for a special volume), Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=98|pages=1281–1287|issue=7|author2=and others|displayauthors=1[/tpl] Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and to wet chemical etching.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0921-5107(00)00604-8|title=Recent advances in ZnO materials and devices|year=2001|author=Look, D|journal=Materials Science and Engineering B|volume=80|pages=383[/tpl] Radiation resistance[tpl]cite journal|author=Kucheyev|title=Ion-beam-produced structural defects in ZnO|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.67.094115|journal=Phys.

===Zinc oxide nanorod sensor===

Zinc oxide nanorod sensors are devices detecting changes in electrical current passing through zinc oxide nanowires due to adsorption of gas molecules. Selectivity to hydrogen gas was achieved by sputtering Pd clusters on the nanorod surface. The addition of Pd appears to be effective in the catalytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen, increasing the sensitivity of the sensor device. The sensor detects hydrogen concentrations down to 10 parts per million at room temperature, whereas there is no response to oxygen.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1949707|title=Hydrogen-selective sensing at room temperature with ZnO nanorods|year=2005|author=Wang, H.

===Spintronics===

ZnO has also been considered for spintronics applications: if doped with 1–10% of magnetic ions (Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc.), ZnO could become ferromagnetic, even at room temperature. Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO:Mn has been observed,[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2007864|title=Magnetic property investigations on Mn-doped ZnO Layers on sapphire|year=2005|author=Mofor, A.

The piezoelectricity in textile fibers coated in ZnO have been shown capable of fabricating "self-powered nanosystems" with everyday mechanical stress from wind or body movements.
In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology reported producing an electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires. This mini-generator creates an oscillating voltage up to 45 millivolts, converting close to seven percent of the applied mechanical energy into electricity. Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3 mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.[tpl]cite web|title=New Small-scale Generator Produces Alternating Current By Stretching Zinc Oxide Wires|date=November 10, 2008|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081109193342.htm|publisher=Science Daily[/tpl]

==Safety==

As a food additive, zinc oxide is on the U.S. FDA's list of generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, substances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnDetailNavigation.cfm?rpt=scogsListing&id=372|title=Database of Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) Reviews|accessdate=2009-08-03[/tpl]
Zinc oxide itself is non-toxic; however it is hazardous to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass is close to the boiling point of zinc.Gray, Theodore. The Safety of Zinc Casting Access date January 25, 2009. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.Calvert, J. B. Zinc and Cadmium Last modified August 20, 2007. Access date January 25, 2009.
