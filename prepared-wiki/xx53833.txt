==History==

The SCIAC was founded in 1915 with five member schools with the goals to promote amateurism in athletics.  The five founding members, all of whom are still members, are California Institute of Technology, Occidental College, Pomona College, the University of Redlands, and Whittier College.  Although all five original charter members are still affiliated with the SCIAC, only two, Occidental and Redlands, have had uninterrupted membership.
On May 12, 2011, the SCIAC announced that Chapman University would become the ninth member, beginning with the 2011â€“12 academic year.  The addition of Chapman marks the first expansion of the conference since California Lutheran University joined in 1991.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.thesciac.org/general_news/2010-11/CU_Welcome_Release |title=Chapman University Welcomed as the Ninth Member of the SCIAC |accessdate=2011-07-23[/tpl] At one time, most of the colleges were the Southern California affiliates of various Christian sects such as the Quakers and the Presbyterians.  Today, only California Lutheran University maintains an affiliation with a church.
There are three former members of the SCIAC: University of California, Los Angeles, San Diego State University and University of California, Santa Barbara.  All former members now compete in NCAA Division I athletics.
