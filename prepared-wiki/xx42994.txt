Stone responded that his "purpose in making the film, ''Nixon'' was neither malicious nor defamatory", and was an attempt to gain "a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon &mdash; the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world".<ref name= "weinraub2"/> [[Walt Disney]]'s daughter, [[Diane Disney Miller]], wrote a letter to Nixon's daughters saying that Stone had "committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history".<ref name= "associated">

Some critics took Stone to task for portraying Nixon as an alcoholic, though Stone says that was based on information from books by Stephen Ambrose, Fawn Brodie, and Tom Wicker. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for how it took "on the resonance of classic tragedy. Tragedy requires the fall of a hero, and one of the achievements of Nixon is to show that greatness was within his reach".[ref]
