Subsequent albums include: When the Pawn... (1999), Extraordinary Machine (2005), and The Idler Wheel... (2012).
Apple's vocal range is alto.San Diego Arts Though most of her lyrics are sung in a straightforward pop contralto, she judiciously adds vibrato, sudden jumps into her head voice, and rapid reiterations of the same pitch (what academics in the classical music field call a "Monteverdi vibrato"). Her musical style contains elements of jazz and alternative rock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rookiemag.com/2012/03/literally-the-best-thing-ever-fiona-apple/|work=Rookie|title=Literally the Best Thing Ever: Fiona Apple|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2013|quote=The music that accompanies all these feelings is jazzy and moody[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.details.com/blogs/daily-details/2012/06/a-pair-of-trailblazing-divas-return.html|title=Fiona Apple & Neneh Cherry: A Pair of Divas Return|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2013|work=Details[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/when-the-pawn-hits-the-conflicts-he-thinks-like-a-king-mw0000035134 |title=When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King... - Fiona Apple | Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1999-11-09 |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl]

==Career==

===1994–1998: Career beginnings and Tidal===

Apple was introduced to the music industry in 1994, when she gave a demo tape containing the songs "Never Is a Promise", "Not One of Those Times", and "He Takes a Taxi" to her friend who was the babysitter of music publicist Kathryn Schenker.Luck, Otto. "Fiona Apple Suffers for Her Sins (and So Do We)". NY Rock. November 1997. Retrieved September 23, 2005. Schenker then passed the tape along to Sony Music executive Andy Slater.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/features/fiona.htm |title=Images - Fiona Apple |publisher=Imagesjournal.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2011[/tpl] Apple's abilities captured his attention, and Slater signed her to a record deal.New Yorker Apple’s robust contralto, though sometimes heavy on vibrato, gave her line readings a pleasingly sinister feel.
In 1996, Apple's debut album, Tidal, was released by Work Records and Columbia Records. The album sold 2.7 million copies and was certified three times platinum in the U.S."Gold and Platinum Searchable Database"[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl].

"Criminal", the third single, became a hit and the song reached the top forty on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song's controversial Mark Romanek-directed music video played on MTV.Spin, October 1997. Other singles from Tidal included "Shadowboxer", "Sleep to Dream", and "Never Is a Promise".

During this period, Apple also made recordings of The Beatles' "Across the Universe" and Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone to Love" for the soundtrack of the film Pleasantville. She later canceled the last twenty-one dates on a tour in support of her album due to "personal family problems".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424968/fiona-apple-cancels-tour.jhtml |title=News - Articles - 1424968 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=March 3, 1998 |accessdate=September 2, 2011[/tpl]

===1999–2002: When the Pawn... and hiatus===

Apple's second album, When the Pawn..., was released in 1999. Its full title is a poem Apple wrote after reading letters that appeared in Spin regarding an article that had cast her in a negative light in an earlier issue.iTunes Originals Interview, 2006 The title's length earned it a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for 2001. However, as of October 2007, it no longer has the longest album title, as Soulwax released Most of the Remixes, a remix album whose title surpasses When the Pawn’s length by 100 characters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kevinenjoyce.com/soulwax/ |title=soulwax.info |publisher=Kevinenjoyce.com |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2013[/tpl] When the Pawn was cultivated during Apple's relationship with film director Paul Thomas Anderson. When the Pawn, which was produced by Jon Brion, used more expressive lyrics, experimented more with drum loops, and incorporated both the Chamberlin and drummer Matt Chamberlain. The album received a positive reception from publications such as The New York Times and Rolling Stone. It did not fare as well commercially as her debut, though it was an RIAA-certified platinum album and sold one million copies in the U.S. The album's lead single, "Fast as You Can", reached the top twenty on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart and became Apple's first Top 40 hit in the UK. The videos for two follow-up singles, "Paper Bag" and "Limp" (directed by then-boyfriend Anderson), received very little play.
After performing for forty minutes in a set hampered by equipment issues to 3,000 audience members at the New York City Roseland Ballroom, a frustrated Apple left the stage without returning. Her performance saw Apple appearing distraught at the sound quality, apologizing numerous times for the sound and crying.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/fiona-apple-breaks-down-at-nyc-concert-871408.story#/news/fiona-apple-breaks-down-at-nyc-concert-871408.story |title=Fiona Apple Breaks Down At NYC Concert |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2011[/tpl] The incident was described by AOL as "music's most infamous on-stage meltdown".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/11/10/fiona-apple-onstage-meltdown/ |title=Fiona Apple Onstage Meltdown |publisher=Spinner |date=April 30, 2000 |accessdate=September 2, 2011[/tpl] After completing a concert tour in support of her second album in 2000, Apple relocated to Los Angeles. During her hiatus, Apple contemplated retiring from her recording career. Apple sang with Johnny Cash on a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "Bridge over Troubled Water" that ended up on his album American IV: The Man Comes Around and was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Country Collaboration with Vocals". She also collaborated with Cash on Cat Stevens's "Father and Son", which was included in his 2003 collection Unearthed.

===2002–2010: Extraordinary Machine===

Apple's third album, Extraordinary Machine, was originally produced by Jon Brion. In spring 2002, Apple and Jon Brion, her longtime friend and producer on When the Pawn, met for their weekly lunch meeting. Brion reportedly "begged" Apple to make another album. Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, Epic Records, with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. Recording sessions began in 2002, at Ocean Way studios in Nashville, Tennessee, but later moved to the Paramour Mansion in Los Angeles. Work on the album continued until 2003, and in May of that year it was submitted to Sony executives. In 2004 and 2005, tracks were leaked on the Internet in MP3 format and played on U.S. and international radio. Subsequently, MP3s of the entire album went online. Although a Web site distributing the album was quickly shutdown, it soon reached P2P networks and was downloaded by fans.Biography: "Fiona Apple". Retrieved August 25, 2010 A fan-led campaign supported the album's official release.
Mike Elizondo, who had previously played bass on Pawn, was brought back as co-producer to complete the tracks he had begun with Brion and Apple. Spin later reported the following: "Fans erroneously thought that Apple's record label, Epic, had rejected the first version of Extraordinary Machine... in reality, according to Elizondo, Apple was unhappy with the results, and it was her decision to redo the record, not her label's."Fiona Apple's Machine Finally Turned On Spin.

Two of the eleven previous leaked tracks were relatively unchanged, and one new song was also included.New York Times "Fiona Apple Retools Her Leaked Album". Retrieved August 15, 2005. Despite suggestions that the album had caused a rift between Brion and Apple, they regularly perform together at Largo, a club in Los Angeles, including a joint appearance with Elizondo on bass just before the news broke of an official release.Music: "Fiona Apple". Retrieved August 25, 2010 Extraordinary Machine debuted at number seven and was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Pop Vocal Album". It was eventually certified gold and sold 600,000 copies in the U.S., though its singles ("Parting Gift", "O' Sailor", "Not About Love" and "Get Him Back") failed to enter any Billboard charts.Cohen, Jonathan.
