Lympstone Village railway station serves the village of Lympstone in Devon, England.

==History==

Lympstone station was opened with the railway on 1 May 1861.  It was renamed Lympstone Village in the 1990s to avoid confusion with the new Lympstone Commando railway station that had opened on 3 May 1976.[tpl]cite book |last = Mitchell |first = Vic|coauthors = Smith, Keith |title = Branch Lines to Exmouth |publisher = Middleton Press |year = 1992 |location = Midhurst|isbn = 1-873793-00-6[/tpl]
Following the privatisation of British Rail it was operated by Wales and West, latterly Wessex Trains, until 31 March 2006 when the franchise was taken over by First Great Western.

==Description==

It is situated on an embankment, with a single platform; a disused second platform is now heavily overgrown. To the south the line crosses the village on a low viaduct. 
The station is unstaffed and has very limited facilities.
