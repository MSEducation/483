The origins are uncertain. Some scholars and historians trace the foundation around the 4th-5th century BC in the area of Salentino hamlet, a few kilometers from the modern town, on a hill overlooking a fertile plain area. Probably the greater fertility of the land in the valley, the abundance of spring water that flowed into the ground a few feet from the surface, or some devastation were the causes that led the people of Salentino to move to the current city center.
The city's prosperity has been historically connected to its large underground aquifer. In the early Christian era it was an episcopal see, but was later destroyed by foreign invasions.
