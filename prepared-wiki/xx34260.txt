Louis Barbarin (October 24, 1902 â€“ May 12, 1997) was a New Orleans jazz drummer.  He studied under the famed drummer, Louis Cottrell, Sr.
Louis was the younger brother of Paul Barbarin.  He spent most of his life playing in his home town of New Orleans, never achieving the fame of his brother, but many of his fellow musicians considered him equal or better as a drummer than Paul.
He worked with bands of Armand J. Piron, Papa Celestin, Papa French, Preservation Hall, and others until he retired in the mid-1980s due to hearing problems.
