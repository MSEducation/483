==Reception==

Reception for the single has been mostly positive with many liking Levon's transition from dance/club anthems to a more organic sound. David from 'Pop On And On' gave the single a positive review stating that the song "...begins with piano driven beauty before soaring into head boppin’, drum bangin’ heights on the chorus. The execution here is flawless, her vocals are on point and the production holds all the right elements without trying too hard. I’m so ready for Levon to make some waves stateside.http://poponandon.com/perfect-pop-elen-levon-wild-child Pop On And On.
