The Chicago Sockers were an American soccer team, originally founded in 1995 as the Chicago Stingers. The team was a member of the United Soccer Leagues (USL) and played at the professional level in the USISL Pro League, USISL Select League and USISL D-3 Pro League until 1999.  The club would be re-named Sockers and self-relegate to the amateur USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American soccer pyramid, for the 1999 season.
The Sockers were one of the most successful amateur teams in the late 1990s, winning three national titles including back-to-back PDL Championships in 1999 and 2000, reaching two divisional playoffs, and getting to both the quarterfinal and semifinal of the US Open Cup prior to 2000. Following the 2000 season, despite being reigning PDL Champions, the Sockers folded. However, the club survives as a youth soccer organization under the same name.
The Sockers played their home games at Olympic Park in the village of Schaumburg, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The team's colors were blue and white.

==History==

The Chicago Stingers were founded in 1995 as a professional club to play in the United Soccer Leagues (USL). The club would play in various transitional professional leagues in the USL, including the USISL Pro League, USISL Select League and USISL D-3 Pro League, which at the time represented the second or third tier of professional soccer in the American soccer pyramid under Major League Soccer (MLS).
For the 1999 season, the club would be renamed Chicago FC Sockers (or Chicago Sockers) and self-relegated to the amateur USL Premier Development League (PDL), considered the top national amateur league and the fourth tier in the pyramid. The Sockers would have a very successful first season in the PDL, finishing second in the Great Lakes Division and going on to defeat Spokane Shadow 3-1 in the PDL Championship.
The Sockers would repeat as Champions in 2000 after a move to the Heartland Division, finishing first in the regular season and defeating the Mid-Michigan Bucks 1-0 in the Championship final.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/aboutusl/history/285800.html | title=2000 PDL Season in Review | publisher=USLsoccer.com | accessdate=February 21, 2014[/tpl]
