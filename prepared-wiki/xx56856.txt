Dream of the Red Chamber ([tpl]zh|first=t|t=紅樓夢|s=红楼梦|p=Hóng Lóu Mèng|w=Hong2 Lou2 Meng4[/tpl]), also called Story of the Stone ([tpl]zh|t=石頭記||s= 石头记|p = Shitou ji[/tpl]), composed by Cao Xueqin, is one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. It was written sometime in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty. It is considered a masterpiece of Chinese literature and is generally acknowledged to be the pinnacle of Chinese fiction. "Redology" is the field of study devoted exclusively to this work.Jonathan Spence, The Search for Modern China (New York: Norton, 1990), 106–110.
The title has also been translated as Red Chamber Dream and  A Dream of Red Mansions.  The novel circulated in manuscript copies with various titles until its print publication, in 1791. While the first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, Gao E, who prepared the first and second printed editions with his partner Cheng Weiyuan in 1791-2, added 40 additional chapters to complete the novel.David Hawkes, "Introduction," The Story of the Stone Volume I (Penguin Books, 1973), pp. 15–19.
Red Chamber is believed to be semi-autobiographical, mirroring the rise and decay of author Cao Xueqin's own family and, by extension, of the Qing Dynasty.Jonathan D. Spence, Ts'ao Yin Yin and the K'ang-Hsi Emperor: Bondservant and Master (New Haven,: Yale University Press,  1966) is a study of Cao's grandfather. As the author details in the first chapter, it is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. The novel is remarkable not only for its huge cast of characters and psychological scope, but also for its precise and detailed observation of the life and social structures typical of 18th-century Chinese aristocracy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-92,pageNum-2.html |title=CliffsNotes, About the Novel: Introduction |publisher=Cliffsnotes.com |accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl]

==Language==

The novel is composed in written vernacular rather than Classical Chinese. Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-wenyan style, while the novel's dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardized language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/features.php?searchterm=019_vale.inc&issue=019|title=Vale: David Hawkes, Liu Ts'un-yan, Alaistair Morrison|publisher=China Heritage Quarterly of the Australian National University[/tpl]

==Themes==

The novel is most often titled Hóng Lóu Mèng (紅樓夢), literally "Red Chamber Dream". "Red chamber" is an idiom with several definitions; one in particular refers to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of prominent families reside.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/cd/ci/6/ZdicE7ZdicBAZdicA2305233.htm |title=词语"红楼"的解释 汉典 |publisher=Zdic.net |accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl] It also refers to a dream in Chapter 5 that Baoyu has, set in a "red chamber", where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. "Chamber" is sometimes translated as "mansion" because of the scale of the Chinese word "樓". However the word "mansion" is thought to neglect the flavour of the word "chamber" according to scholar Zhou Ruchang.[tpl]cite book |last= Zhou |first= Ruchang |title= 红楼夺目红 |publisher= 作家出版社 |isbn= 7-5063-2708-2| page=4 [/tpl]
The novel's tone is both metaphysical and realistic, and was constructed in a way that reality and illusion are often hinted side by side and difficult to differentiate.  It has been hailed as one of the most complex and psychologically penetrating works in all of world literature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/cchenna/DRC%20-%20syllabus%20S09.pdf|title=CHT 4111, "Dream of the Red Chamber"|author=Chennault, Cynthia|publisher=University of Florida[/tpl]  The novel also provides great insight in its depiction of the Chinese culture of the time, including description of the era's "manners, expectations, and consequences." Many aspects of Chinese culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, painting, classic literature, the Four Books, are vividly portrayed.  Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.[tpl]cite book|title=Reflections on Dream of the red chamber|author=Liu, Zaifu and Yunzhong Shu|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2008|isbn=1-60497-524-5|page=115[/tpl]
Two major themes that are prevalent throughout the novel are the nature of "reality" and of the "truth."[tpl]cite book|title=Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human|author=Boellstorff, Tom|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|page=35|isbn=0-691-14627-6[/tpl]  The name of the main family, Jia (賈, pronounced jiǎ), is a homophone with the Chinese character jiǎ 假, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored by another family that has the surname Zhen (甄, pronounced zhēn), a homophone for the word "real" (真). It is suggested that the novel's family is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or "dream" version of Cao's own family.

==Plot summary==

The novel provides a detailed, episodic record of the two branches of the wealthy and aristocratic  Jia (賈) clan—the Rongguo House (榮國府) and the Ningguo House (寧國府)—who reside in two large, adjacent family compounds in the capital.  Their ancestors were made Dukes and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the two houses are among the most illustrious families in the city.  One of the clan’s offspring was made an Imperial Consort, and a lush landscaped garden was built to receive her visit. The novel describes the Jias’ wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias’ fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones.  Eventually the Jia clan falls into disfavor with the Emperor, and their mansions are raided and confiscated.
In the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, abandoned by the goddess Nüwa when she mended the heavens aeons ago, begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to bring it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (while in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), was then given a chance to learn from the human existence, and enters the mortal realm.
The main character of the novel is the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Jia Baoyu.  He was born with a magical piece of  "jade" in his mouth.  In this life he has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry.  Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplifies an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes forms the main story in the novel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/orientalia/tsots.htm|title=The Story of the Stone (The Dream of the Red Chamber)|publisher=Complete review[/tpl]

==Characters==

Dream of the Red Chamber contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly forty are considered major characters, and there are almost five hundred additional ones.[ref]

==Versions and textual challenges==

The textual problems of the novel are extremely complex and have excited much critical scrutiny, debate and conjecture in modern times. Cao did not live to publish his novel, and it is believed by some scholars that the original version of this novel consists of 110 or 108 chapters; however, for unknown reasons, only about 80 chapters were later circulated. Only hand-copied manuscripts survived after Cao's death, until 1791, when the first printed version was published.  This printed version, presented by Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E, contains edits and revisions not authorised by the author.A convenient summary of this scholarship is David Hawkes, "Introduction," The Story of the Stone Volume I (Penguin Books, 1973), pp. 15–19. The pioneering discussion in English is Shih-Ch'ang Wu, On the Red Chamber Dream : A Critical Study of Two Annotated Manuscripts of the 18th Century (Oxford: The Clarendon Press,  1961). It is possible that Cao personally destroyed the last 30 chapters of the novel;[tpl]cite web|url=http://q.ifeng.com/group/article/5845.html|title=曹雪芹自己销毁了110回《红楼梦》的后30回 (Cao Xueqin himself destroyed the 110 chapter Dream of the Red Chambers' last 30 chapters)|publisher=ifeng.com of Phoenix Television|date=2008-02-04[/tpl] or that at least parts of Cao's original ending were incorporated into the 120 chapter Cheng-Gao versions,Maram Epstein, "Reflections of Desire: The Poetics of Gender in Dream of the Red Chamber," Nan Nu 1.1  (1999): 64. and it was done with Gao E's "careful emendations" of original manuscripts.[tpl]cite book|title=Men and women in Qing China: gender in the Red Chamber Dream|author=Louise P. Edwards|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8248-2468-7|pages=11, 64[/tpl]

===Rouge versions===

Up until 1791, the novel circulated merely in scribal transcripts. These early hand-copied versions end abruptly at the latest at the 80th chapter.  The earlier ones furthermore contain transcribed comments and annotations in red ink from unknown commentators. These commentators' remarks reveal much about the author as a person, and it is now believed that some of them may even be members of Cao Xueqin's own family.  The most prominent commentator is Rouge Inkstone (脂硯齋), who revealed much of the interior structuring of the work and the original manuscript ending, now lost.  These manuscripts are the most textually reliable versions, known as Rouge versions (脂本).  Even amongst some 12 independent surviving manuscripts, small differences in some of the characters, rearrangements and possible rewritings cause the texts to vary a little.
The early 80 chapters brim with prophecies and dramatic foreshadowings that give hints as to how the book would continue. For example, it is obvious that Lin Daiyu will eventually die in the course of the novel; that Baoyu and Baochai will marry; that Baoyu will become a monk.
Most modern critical editions use the first 80 chapters, based on the Rouge versions.

===Cheng-Gao versions===

In 1791, Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan brought together the novel's first printed edition.  This was also the first "complete" edition of The Story of the Stone, which they printed as Dream of the Red Chamber (繡像紅樓夢).  While the original Rouge manuscripts have eighty chapters, the 1791 edition completed the novel in 120 chapters.  The first 80 chapters were edited from the Rouge versions, but the last 40 were newly published.
In 1792, Cheng and Gao published a second edition correcting "typographical and editorial" errors of the 1791 version.  In the 1791 prefaces, Cheng claimed to have put together an ending based on the author's working manuscripts.
The debate over the last 40 chapters and the 1791-2 prefaces continues to this day. Many modern scholars believe these chapters were a later addition. Hu Shih, in his 1921 essay Proofs on A Dream of the Red Chamber, argued that the ending was actually written by Gao E, citing the foreshadowing of the main characters' fates in Chapter 5, which differs from the ending of the 1791 Cheng-Gao version.  However, during the mid-20th century, the discovery of a 120 chapter manuscript that dates well before 1791 further complicated the questions regarding Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan's involvement—whether they simply edited or actually wrote the continuation of the novel. Though it is unclear if the last 40 chapters of the discovered manuscript contained the original works of Cao, Irene Eber found the discovery "seems to confirm Cheng and Gao's claim that they merely edited a complete manuscript, consisting of 120 chapters, rather than actually writing a portion of the novel."Irene Eber, "Riddles in the Dream of the Red Chamber," in Galit Hasan-Rokem, and David Dean Shulman, eds. Untying the Knot : On Riddles and Other Enigmatic Modes (New York: Oxford University Press,  1996), p. 237.
The book is normally published and read in Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E's 120 chapter version.  Some editions move the last 40 chapters to an appendix. Also, some modern editions (like that of Zhou Ruchang's) do not include the last 40 chapters at all.

==Reception and influences in modern era==

In the late 19th century, Hong Lou Meng's influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel Water Margin as "incitement to robbery and lust," and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible.Leo Ou-fan Lee,  "Literary Trends I: The Quest for Modernity, 1895–1927,"  in John K. Fairbank, ed., Cambridge History of China Vol. 12 Republican China 1912–1949 Pt I (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983): 455. Scholar Wang Guowei, however, used them for solace. In the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work's author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals.Haun Saussy, "The Age of Attribution: Or, How the "Honglou Meng" Finally Acquired an Author," Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR) 25 (2003):  119–132.  Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei's investigations of the printing history of the early editions  to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao's Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.
In the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed Hongxue, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China's greatest works of literature.Dr. Li Zhisui,The Private Life of Chairman Mao (New York: Random House, 1994), p. 82. The influence of the novel's themes and style are evident in such works as Ba Jin's  novel, Family (1931), and Moment in Peking (1939) by Lin Yutang. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller.Editor's Preface, Ruchang Zhou, Between Noble and Humble: Cao Xueqin and the Dream of the Red Chamber (New York: Peter Lang,  2009), xiv. http://books.google.com/books?id=1ROFO8h-e6IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false. But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his "bourgeois idealism" in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of "feudal" society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu's ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.Joey Bonner, "Yü P'ing-Po and the Literary Dimension of the Controversy over Hung Lou Meng," The China Quarterly.67  (1976):  546–581; Merle Goldman, Literary Dissent in Communist China (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,  1967).
During the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies. In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E's editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to announce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate Gao E's emendations and restore Cao's original text.Conspiracy of the Red Mansions. Danwei (December 6, 2006).

==Translations and reception in the West==

It is a major challenge to translate Cao's prose, which utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel.[ref]
