==NASA career==

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. After two years of training and evaluation, she qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she has also served as lead Astronaut Office Representative for Payloads and in the Astronaut Office EVA branch.

===STS-115 - Atlantis (September 9–21, 2006)===

Stefanyshyn-Piper flew her first mission on STS-115, aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis (launched September 9, 2006, and returned September 21), as a Mission Specialist and became only the 8th woman to perform a spacewalk (out of 180 total spacewalkers). Stefanyshyn-Piper participated in two of the mission's three EVAs for a total of 12 hours, 8 minutes made her the second most experienced female spacewalker. She also became the first Minnesota woman to go into space.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://wcco.com/topstories/Heidemarie.Stefanyshyn.Piper.2.361065.html|title=Astronaut First Minnesota Woman In Space|accessdate=November 20, 2008 |publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc|year=2006|author=Associated Press[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] She also was the first person to faint twice before a public audience while trying to confess that she had witnessed an unknown phenomenon outside the shuttle, without being able to describe precisely what it was.

During her pre-flight interview, she described her philosophy about human exploration of space:

===NEEMO 12 (May 7–18, 2007)===

Stefanyshyn-Piper was commander of the 12th expedition of NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), a NASA program for studying human survival in the Aquarius underwater laboratory in preparation for future space exploration.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/history.html|title=NEEMO History|accessdate=May 10, 2011|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2006|author=NASA[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2007-05-07-robot-undersea-test_N.htm|title=Aquanauts test robotic surgeons in undersea lab|accessdate=May 10, 2011|publisher=USAToday|author=USAToday|date=May 7, 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/3819-space-station-astronaut-calls-undersea-lab.html|title=Space Station Astronaut Calls Undersea Lab|accessdate=May 10, 2011|publisher=Space.com|year=2007|author=Space.com[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://mtbeurope.info/news/2007/703013.htm|title=NASA undersea mission to test space medicine|accessdate=May 10, 2011|publisher=Medical Technology Business Europe|year=2007|author=Medical Technology Business Europe[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/3823-undersea-nasa-expedition-success.html|title=Undersea NASA Expedition a Success|accessdate=May 10, 2011|publisher=Space.com|year=2007|author=Space.com[/tpl]

===STS-126 - Endeavour (November 14–30, 2008)===

Stefanyshyn-Piper flew as a Mission Specialist on STS-126, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour (launched November 14, 2008, and returned November 30), during which she participated in and was Lead Spacewalker on three of four spacewalks. The mission ended when Endeavour landed successfully at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Following Stefanyshyn-Piper's third spacewalk during STS-126, her fifth overall, her total time in EVA became 33 hours, 42 minutes, putting her in twenty-fifth place for total time in EVA.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts126/081122fd9/index4.html|title=Spacewalk No. 3 ends|accessdate=November 22, 2008 |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com|year=2008|author=William Harwood for CBS News[/tpl]

====Lost tool bag during spacewalk====

During the first EVA of STS-126 on November 18, 2008, as Stefanyshyn-Piper was preparing to begin work on the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, she noticed a significant amount of grease in her tool bag. "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/rss_feed_above_snip_collection_archive_1.html|title=Astronauts Resume Spacewalk After Tools Lost|accessdate=November 18, 2008 |publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA RSS[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts126/081118fd5/index2.html|title=Bag of tools escapes from spacewalker and floats away|accessdate=November 18, 2008 |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com|year=2008|author=William Harwood for CBS News[/tpl] Mission Control managers instructed Stefanyshyn-Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, she accidentally pushed aside the bag. "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," Stefanyshyn-Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. The bag and its contents entered Low Earth Orbit as space debris, where it eventually burned-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere west of Mexico on August 3, 2009.Tariq Malik, Managing Editor, Space.com "Tool Bag Lost In Space Meets Fiery End" August 3, 2009http://www.space.com/news/090803-space-tool-bag-burns-up.html  When in orbit, it was visible from the ground using a telescope.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.p2pnet.net/story/17699|title=Kevin Fetter videos astronaut’s lost tool bag|accessdate=December 17, 2008 |publisher=People to People|year=2008|author=p2pnet news[/tpl]
After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed. The estimated value of the equipment lost is US$100,000.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7741582.stm|title=Nothing lost in space - this time|accessdate=November 21, 2008 |publisher=bbc.co.uk|author=bbc.co.uk | date=November 21, 2008[/tpl]
During the Mission Status Briefing, lead International Space Station Flight Director Ginger Kerrick said that there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose. "We don't know that this incident occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don't know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag," Kerrick said. "You've got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/18018286/detail.html?rss=orlc&psp=news|title=Astronaut Who Lost Tool Bag Admits Mistake|accessdate=November 20, 2008 |publisher=WFTV|year=2008|author=Associated Press[/tpl]  Said Stefanyshyn-Piper of the incident, "that definitely was not the high point of the EVA. It was very disheartening to watch it float away."

==Retirement from NASA==

In July 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper retired from NASA's Astronaut Corps to return to her Navy duties.
Fellow astronaut Steven Lindsey, Chief of the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, stated on her retirement: "Heide has been an outstanding astronaut, contributing significantly to the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs. In particular, her superb leadership as lead spacewalker during the STS-126 mission resulted in restoring full power generation capability to the International Space Station. We wish her the best of luck back in the Navy – she will be missed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/09/09/Astronaut-leaves-NASA-returns-to-the-Navy/UPI-69231252525393/|title=Astronaut leaves NASA, returns to the Navy|last=UPI|publisher=UPI|accessdate=2011-04-28[/tpl]
She was awarded two NASA Space Flight Medals, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. 
In August 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to the Naval Sea Systems Command as the Chief Technology Officer.

==Commanding the NSWCCD==

On May 20, 2011 Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper became commander of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland.[tpl]cite web|title=NSWCCD Division Commander Press Release|url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/pub/who/leadership/div_cmdr.aspx|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl]
