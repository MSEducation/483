Namesake is a term used to characterize a person, place, thing, quality, action, state, or idea that has the same, or a similar, name to another[tpl]cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2009|edition=3rd[/tpl] - especially (but not exclusively) if the person or thing is actually named after, rather than merely sharing the name of another.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/namesake|title=Namesake|year=2008|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=August 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Namesake|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=namesake&submit.x=54&submit.y=35|work=American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=10 November 2012[/tpl]
For example, if a person, place, or thing has the same name as another - especially if they are named after another person, place, or thing, then the name target is said to be the namesake of the name source. The earliest use reported in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1635. Dictionaries suggest that the word probably comes from "name's sake", "for one's name('s) sake", for "name sake".

==History==

The term namesake was first recorded in 1635, referring to a place with the same name as another. Among other recordings, a 1646 usage was carried through in an 1806 publication, entitled A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary, and Expositor of the English Language.[tpl]cite book |title= A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary, and Expositor of the English Language|last=Walker |first= John|year= 1806|publisher= J.

==Usage==

Naming a child after a relative, friend, or well-known person is a fairly common practice. In the case of sons named for their father this can necessitate "Jr.", "III", and other name suffixes in order to distinguish - especially when both father and son become famous. Use of a namesake's name in a leadership position may indicate certain things, usually referring to certain traits of the namesake, such as in the use of papal regnal names.
Some commercial entities and products are named after their creators, such as the Trump Tower and Ford Motor Company. Items are also named after people associated with them, such as the teddy bear.  This is especially the case with scientific discoveries and theories, such as Gibbs free energy. When the target name merely is derived from the source name without an additional "sake" connection, such usage more accurately may be called an eponym rather than a namesake.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Discrepancies in meaning (US usage)===

There has been some discrepancy as to whether the name source or the name target takes the term namesake. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, a namesake is a person or thing named after another.Kyff, Rob. October 3, 2007. The Word Guy: "Don't Forsake Meaning of Namesake" Accessed: August 12, 2008 In other words, the name target takes the term namesake, as in  "I was named after my grandfather. I am his namesake." 
or  "Julian's Castle, Julian's namesake restaurant." 
The Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary are not so restrictive. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a namesake is a person or thing having the same name as another. Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines "namesake" as "one that has the same name as another; especially one who is named after another or for whom another is named", allowing the usage of:  "I met a person who happened to have the same name as me. We are namesakes." 
By "for whom another is named", Merriam-Webster's Dictionary allows the term namesake to be used in reference to the name source as in, "I was named after my grandfather. He is my namesake."  Both usages of namesake are correct. This ambiguity sometimes may be resolved by the term eponym or "namegiver", which refers to the name source as providing the name to the name receiver.The American Heritage Dictionary "eponym"  Accessed: April 15, 2012
