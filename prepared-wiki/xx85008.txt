In geology, a lode is a deposit of metalliferous ore that fills or is embedded in a fissure (or crack) in a rock formation or a vein of ore that is deposited or embedded between layers of rock.[tpl]Cite book|author=Thompson, Joseph Wesley|year=1913|chapter=Lode Locations|title=Abstracts of Current Decisions on Mines and Mining, March to December, 1914|series=Bulletin 79, Law Serial 2|publisher=Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior|page=13|oclc=29112728[/tpl] The generally accepted hydrothermal model of lode deposition posits that metals dissolved in hydrothermal solutions (hot spring fluids) deposit the gold or other metallic minerals inside the fissures in the pre-existing rocks.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Fournier, R.O.|year=1999|title=Hydrothermal processes related to movement of fluid from plastic into brittle rock in the magmatic environment|journal=Economic Geology and the Society of Economic Geologists|volume=18|pages=486–497[/tpl] Lode deposits are distinguished primarily from placer deposits, where the ore has been eroded out from its original depositional environment and redeposited by sedimentary forces.[tpl]Cite web|author=McGregor, Tisha et al.|year=2000|title=Mining the Motherlode: Lode vs. Placer Mining|publisher=Wells Historical Society|location=Wells, California|url=http://wells.entirety.ca/lode.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020529192125/http://wells.entirety.ca/lode.htm|archivedate=29 May 2002|deadurl=no[/tpl] A third process for ore deposition is as an evaporite.
A stringer lode is one in which the rock is so permeated by small veinlets that rather than mining the veins, the entire mass of ore and the enveined country rock is mined. It is so named because of the irregular branching of the veins into many anastomosing stringers, so that the ore is not separable from the country rock.[tpl]Cite book|editor=Wood, George McLane|year=1916|title=Suggestions to authors of papers submitted for publication by the United States Geological Survey with directions to typewriter operators|publisher=United States Geological Survey|location=Washington, DC|page=35|oclc=7678360[/tpl]
