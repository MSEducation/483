Go-Ichijō's reign spanned the years from 1016 through 1036.Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukanshō, pp. 307–310; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki. p. 195-196; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [tpl]Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|Annales des empereurs du Japon, pp. 156–159.|page=156[/tpl]
This 11th century sovereign was named after Emperor Ichijō and go- (後), translates literally as "later;" and thus, he is sometimes called the "Later Emperor Ichijō". The Japanese word "go" has also been translated to mean the "second one;" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Ichijō, the second."

==Traditional narrative==

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina)Brown, pp. 264; prior to Emperor Jomei, the personal names of the emperors were very long and people did not generally use them.  The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign. was Atsuhira-shinnō (敦成親王).Varley, p. 195  He was also known as Atsunari-shinnō.Titsingh, p. 156; Brown, p. 307.
Atsuhira was the second son of Emperor Ichijō.  His mother, Fujiwara no Akiko/Shōshi (藤原彰子) (988–1074), was a daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga. In her later years, Ichijō's chūgo consort was known as Jōtō-mon In (上東門院).Titsingh, p. 156; Brown, p. 309.

===Events of Go-Ichijō's life===

Atsuhira-shinnō was used as a pawn in Imperial court politics when he was only a child.
Atsuhira became emperor at the age of 8, upon the abdication of his first cousin once removed, Emperor Sanjō.
During the initial years of Go-Ichijō's reign, Fujiwara no Michinaga actually ruled from his position as sesshō (regent).Brown, pp. 308–309; Varley, p. 195.
The actual site of Go-Ichijō's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.
The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Ichijō's mausoleum.  It is formally named Bodaijuin no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 421.

[tpl]Nihongo|Kugyō|公卿[/tpl] is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Ichijō's reign, this apex of the ''Daijō-kan included:
