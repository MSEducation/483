Prism Comics is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) creators, stories, characters, and readers in the comics industry.
Prism Comics incorporated in April 2003 in the state of Georgia, and received its 501(c)(3) charitable status shortly thereafter. The organization was initially composed of a small number of comics fans and professionals from across the United States who had volunteered on an annual publication called Out in Comics, which was a listing of LGBT creators in comics that ran for three issues. These volunteers decided to form a nonprofit organization to provide services above and beyond an annual listing—feature articles and interviews, original art and content, expanded convention appearances and programming, and a full-featured website—and to pursue even more ambitious goals.
