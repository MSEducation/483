The Caulfield Cup, one of Australia's richest Thoroughbred horse races and the richest of its type in the world (2,400 metre or metric mile-and-a-half handicap) is held annually by the Melbourne Racing Club.  The race is a handicap like the Melbourne Cup, which means that horses that compete in the Caulfield Cup are capable of running on the first Tuesday of November as well. Performances in the Caulfield Cup are one of the possible qualification methods for a run in the Melbourne Cup. The race is open to horses three-years-old and over.

==Race history==

A horse that has won both Caulfield and Melbourne Cups in the same year has been said to have won the 'cups double'.
Eleven horses have achieved this - Poseidon (1906), The Trump (1937), Rivette (1939), Rising Fast (1954), Even Stevens (1962), Galilee (1966), Gurner's Lane (1982), Letâ€™s Elope (1991), Doriemus (1995), Might and Power (1997) and Ethereal (2001).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/Are-You-Ready-for-The-Caulfield-Cup-/543589 |title=Article Dashboard |publisher=Article Dashboard. |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11[/tpl]
