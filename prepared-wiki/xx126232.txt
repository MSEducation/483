Classical gut-string guitars had little projection, and so were unable to displace banjos until innovations increased their volume.
Two important innovations were introduced by the American firm, Martin Guitars. First, Martin introduced steel strings. Second, Martin increased the area of the guitar top; the popularity of Martin's larger "dreadnought" body size amongst acoustic performers is related to the greater sound volume produced. These innovations allowed guitars to compete with and often displace the banjos that had previously dominated jazz bands. The steel-strings increased tension on the neck; for stability, Martin reinforced the neck with a steel truss rod, which became standard in later steel-string guitars.[tpl]harvtxt|Denyer|1992|pages=44–45[/tpl]
An acoustic guitar can be amplified by using various types of pickups or microphones. However, amplification of acoustic guitars had many problems with audio feedback. In the 1960s, Ovation's parabolic bowls dramatically reduced feedback, allowing greater amplification of acoustic guitars.[tpl]harvtxt|Denyer|1992|page=48[/tpl] In the 1970s, Ovation developed thinner sound-boards with carbon-based composites laminating a thin layer of birch, in its Adamas model, which has been viewed as one of the most radical designs in the history of acoustic guitars. The Adamas model dissipated the sound-hole of the traditional soundboard among 22 small sound-holes in the upper chamber of the guitar, yielding greater volume and further reducing feedback during amplification. Another method for reducing feedback is the use of a rubber or plastic disc which fits into the soundhole.
The most common type of pickups used for acoustic guitar amplification are piezo and magnetic pickups. Piezo pickups are generally mounted under the bridge saddle of the acoustic guitar and can be plugged into a mixer or amplifier. A Piezo pickup made by Baldwin was incorporated in the body of Ovation guitars, rather than attached by drilling through the body;[tpl]harvtxt|Carter|1996|pp=48–52[/tpl] the combination of the Piezo pickup and parabolic ("roundback") body helped Ovation to lead the market during the 1970s.DenyerOvation Magnetic pickups are generally mounted in the sound hole of the acoustic guitar and are very similar to those found in electric guitars.  An acoustic guitar with pickups for electrical amplification is known as an acoustic-electric guitar.
In the 2000s, new types of pickups have been introduced to try to amplify the full sound of these instruments. This includes body sensors such as the Taylor Guitars Expression System®,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/features/electronics/expression-system|title=Taylor Guitars Expression System|publisher=Taylor Guitars|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl] and systems that include an internal microphone along with the body sensors or under-the-saddle pickups.

==Types==

Historical and modern acoustic guitars are extremely varied in their design and construction, far more so than electric guitars. Some of the most important varieties are the classical guitar (nylon-stringed), steel-string acoustic guitar and lap steel guitar. A more complete list is given below, refer to the individual articles for more specific detail.
