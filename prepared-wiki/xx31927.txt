</ref> In 1907 he began work with [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[University of Manchester]] and in 1909, along with [[Ernest Marsden]], conducted the famous [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] called the "gold foil experiment". Rutherford and Geiger created the Rutherford-Geiger tube, later to become the Geiger Counter.<ref>[tpl]cite journal |author1=Rutherford E. |author2=Geiger H. |year=1908 |title=An electrical method of counting the number of α particles from radioactive substances |journal=Proc.

In 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger–Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford's atomic model.H. Geiger and J.M.

In 1928 Geiger and his student Walther Müller created an improved version of the Geiger counter, the Geiger–Müller counter.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Geiger |author2=Müller W. |year=1928 |title=Elektronenzählrohr zur Messung schwächster Aktivitäten (Electron counting tube for the measurement of the weakest radioactivities) |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften (The Sciences) |volume=16 |issue=31 |pages=617–618 |doi=10.1007/BF01494093 |issn=0028-1042 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin/Heidelberg|bibcode = 1928NW.....16..617G [/tpl][ref]See also:  
He was a member of the Uranium Club. Geiger never expressed himself in public about the Nazis. There are reports both about him helping, and rejecting, Jewish colleagues. Geiger died in Potsdam, Germany a few months after World War II ended. He had four siblings: three sisters and one brother that were all younger than him.  His brother, Rudolph, was very interested in meteorology and climatology.?
