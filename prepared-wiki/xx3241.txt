[[Erg]]

CATEGORIES: Units of energy, Centimetre–gram–second system of units

An erg (short for ergon, a Greek word meaning "work/task"Oxford English Dictionary) is a unit of energy and mechanical work equal to 10−7 joules. It originated in the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units, symbol "erg". It is not an SI unit.
An erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimeter.  In the CGS base units, it is equal to one gram centimeter-squared per second-squared (g·cm2/s2).  It is thus equal to 10−7 joules or 100 nanojoules (nJ) in SI units. An erg is approximately the amount of work done (or energy consumed) by one common house fly performing one "push up", the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up.Filippenko, Alex, Understanding the Universe (of The Great Courses, on DVD), Lecture 44, time 24:30, The Teaching Company, Chantilly, VA, USA, 2007  
1 erg = 10−7 J = 100 nJ  
1 erg = 10−10sn·m  = 100 psn·m = 100 picosthène-metres

1 erg = 1 dyne cm = 1 g·cm2/s2

==History==

In 1864, Rudolf Clausius proposed the Greek word ([tpl]lang|el|ἐργον[/tpl]) ergon for the unit of energy, work and heat.[ref][tpl]cite book|last=Clausius|first=Rudolf|title=The Mechanical Theory of Heat, With Its Applications to the Steam-engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies.|date=1867|publisher=J.
