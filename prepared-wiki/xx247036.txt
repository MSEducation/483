Kayamkulam vaal (meaning Kayamkulam sword) is a double-edged sword that was used by the rulers and soldiers of Nair aristocracy (mostly in Travancore), in the Kayamkulam princely state of India. An example is on display at the Krishnapuram Palace Museum in Kayamkulam.[tpl]Cite news |title=A window to the past|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/05/stories/2005040507530500.htm |date=5 April 2005 |first= A |last=Harikumar |publisher=The Hindu |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] The museum has a large number of antiques, which were used by the kings who ruled the erstwhile Kayamkulam State. The most important among them is the Kayamkulam sword. Unlike the common sword, this one has both its edges sharp.
It is said to have been used by the Kayamkulam Rajas in the 18th century.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://archaeology.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=18|title=Krishnapuram Palace |accessdate=20 March 2011|publisher=Archaeology Department of Government of Kerala[/tpl]
