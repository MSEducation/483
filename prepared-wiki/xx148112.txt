Alban Préaubert (born 20 September 1985 in Grenoble, France) is a French figure skater. He is a five-time (2006, 2008–2011) French bronze medalist.

==Early years==

Alban Préaubert's father hoped to have his son ski, but this did not prove successful, so his father decided to take son to the rink to try skating to improve his balance. The younger Préaubert was immediately attracted to skating.
In his early career, he trained with Elena Issatchenko, champion of the USSR in 1965 and 1966, at Charleville-Mezieres. He later moved to work with coach Annick Dumont.
Préaubert had some success as a junior skater, winning the French junior national title and a medal on the junior Grand Prix circuit. He skated at both junior and senior events in 2004-5 before moving on to the senior ranks.

==Senior career==

Préaubert had a successful season in his first full year as a senior, with a podium finish at the 2006 French nationals, a 6th place showing at his first Europeans, and an 8th place in his World Championships debut.
For the 2006-7 Grand Prix season, Préaubert was assigned to 2006 Skate America and the 2006 Trophée Eric Bompard; he won the bronze and silver medals, respectively, qualifying him for the Grand Prix Final, where he finished fourth. He again finished sixth at the European Championships, but dropped out of the top ten at Worlds.
In 2007-8, Préaubert was again assigned to Skate America and the Trophée Eric Bompard; a fifth place finish at Skate America dropped him out of contention for the Grand Prix final. He was tenth at the European Championships and was forced to withdraw from Worlds due to a back injury.
Préaubert began the 2008-9 season by defeating his countryman Brian Joubert at the French Masters and winning his third Trophée Eric Bompard medal, a bronze. He also won the bronze at the Cup of Russia and was an alternate for the Grand Prix Final. He finished third at French Nationals and was selected to go to Europeans, where he finished in fifth place, but was only third among the French skaters. As a result, Préaubert was not chosen to compete at the World Championships.
In the 2009-10 season, Préaubert again medalled on the Grand Prix circuit, winning bronze at Skate Canada. He again finished third at French nationals. The French men were competing for only two spots at the Olympics, and Préaubert, along with runner-up Yannick Ponsero, were selected for the European Championships only. There, Préaubert came in 7th. In March 2010, he participated in a French federation test skate to determine the second entry for the World Championships; Brian Joubert was eventually chosen.
Préaubert finished fifth and sixth at his two Grand Prix assignments in 2010-11, and followed this with his fifth bronze medal at French nationals.

==Personal life==

Préaubert continued his studies during his skating career, focusing on economy and management. He graduated with an MBA from ESCP Europe in May 2010. He has stated that he may be involved in sports management in the future. As of 2011, he works for an asset management company in Paris.
He also plays tennis, basketball (a member of local league team), and has a red belt in judo.
