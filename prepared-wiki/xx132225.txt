Akshay Venkatesh (born 21 November 1981) is an Indian Australian mathematician. His research interests are in the fields of counting, equidistribution problems in automorphic forms and number theory, in particular representation theory, locally symmetric spaces and ergodic theory.Clay Mathematics Institute He is the only Australian to have won medals at both the International Physics Olympiad and International Mathematics Olympiad, which he did at the age of 12.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amt.edu.au/olympian.html|title=Former Australian IMO Team Members|publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust|accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201107153742/awards-and-prizes/maths-boy-wonder-shows-how-stack-oranges|title=Maths boy wonder shows how to stack oranges|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=2011-07-15|accessdate=2013-05-07[/tpl]

==Early years==

Raised in Perth, Western Australia, where he attended Scotch College, Venkatesh attended extracurricular training classes for gifted students in the state mathematical olympiad program.memoirs In 1993, whilst aged only 11, he competed at the 24th International Physics Olympiad in Williamsburg, Virginia, winning a bronze medal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yalcineli.com/yeni_sayfa_15.htm|title=XXIV International Physics Olympiad Williamsburg|year=1993|accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl] The following year in 1994, he switched his attention to mathematics, and after placing second in the Australian Mathematical Olympiad,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amt.edu.au/amo1994.html|title=Highest AMO scorers, 1994|publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust|accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl] he won a silver medal in the 6th Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amt.edu.au/apmo1994.html|title=Results of 6th Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad 1994|publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust|accessdate=2013-06-07[/tpl] before winning a bronze medal in the International Mathematics Olympiad held in Hong Kong that year. He completed his secondary education that year, turning 13 at the end of the year. He entered the University of Western Australia the following year as the youngest ever student at the institution and was awarded First Class Honours in Pure mathematicshttp://202.38.126.65/mirror/www.maths.uwa.edu.au/general/graduates/honours.php in 1997, the youngest ever to achieve this feat, as well as being awarded the J. A. Woods Memorial Prize for being the leading graduating student of the year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

==Research career==

Venkatesh commenced his PhD at Princeton University in 1998 under Peter Sarnak, which he completed in 2002, producing the thesis Limiting forms of the trace formula. He was supported by the Hackett Fellowship for postgraduate study. He was then awarded a postdoctoral position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he served as a C.L.E. Moore instructor, until his selection as a Clay Research Fellow in 2004. He was awarded the Salem Prize and the Packard Fellowship in 2007. His research interests are the enumeration of arithmetic objects using upper bounds for the number of rational points on algebraic varieties, and also the analytic theory of automorphic forms, with an interest in quantum chaos and geodesic flows, L-functions, and applications to spectral theory and equidistribution.http://www.claymath.org/fas/research_fellows/Venkatesh/research.pdf
He also won the 2008 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize. The $10,000 prize was given at the International Conference on Number Theory and Modular Forms, held at SASTRA University, Kumbakonam, Ramanujanâ€™s hometown.
Venkatesh has made far-reaching contributions to a wide variety of areas in mathematics, including number theory, automorphic forms, representation theory, locally symmetric spaces and ergodic theory, by himself, and in collaboration with several mathematicians.
Venkatesh provides a very novel and more direct way of establishing sub-convexity in numerous cases, going beyond the foundational work of Hardy-Littlewood-Weyl, Burgess, and Duke-Friedlander-Iwaniec that dealt with important special cases.
Venkatesh held a Clay Research Fellowship from the Clay Mathematics Institute from 2004 to 2006, and was an associate professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.Preprints Since September 1, 2008, he has been a professor at Stanford University.
