It was founded in 1972 by a group of employees from Look after the magazine ceased publication.[tpl]cite news |url= http://libhip.desmoineslibrary.com:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=12114P56RD298.2010&profile=main&uri=full=3100001~!916098~!1&ri=1&aspect=subtab14&menu=search&source=~!comres |title= Good Idea Grows out of Tragedy |work=The Des Moines Register |date= October 26, 1997 |page= 1G-2G |last= Elbert |first= David |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] The company employs over 2,500 individuals worldwide and has locations on three continents: North America, Europe and Australia.

==History==

In late 1971, Look ceased publication due to factors such as a staggering economy and rising postal rates.[tpl]cite news |title= Cowles Closing Look Magazine After 34 Years |work= The New York Times |date= September 17, 1971 |page= 1[/tpl] Two months prior, the circulation department had completed the development of its new computer system that stored the names and addresses of customers on magnetic tape. 
This new fulfillment system gave rise to the idea for a new business, with six Look employees looking for their first client. Edward Downe, Jr., publisher of Ladies' Home Journal and The American Home, agreed to not only be the company’s first client, but also its owner – if the company was named after him. Thus, on April 1, 1972, Downe Computer Services opened with 172 employees and one client.
In 1977, the Charter Company in Jacksonville, Florida, started buying Downe Communications’ stock. This led to the buying out of Downe’s stock in 1978, and the changing of the company name to Charter Data Services (CDS).
Hearst Corporation acquired two Charter Company properties, Redbook and CDS, in 1982. After acquisition, Hearst changed the name of Charter Data Services to Communications Data Services. In 2007, the company’s name was changed to CDS Global.
