A herbaceous perennial plant 0.5–1.5 metres tall, the Wild Peony has leaves which are divided into three segments and large red flowers in late spring and early summer.

Ideal conditions are light (sandy) soils although and most peonies can grow in heavy clay soil. The Wild Peony prefers acid and neutral soils, can grow in semi-shade and tolerates drought.
The Wild Peony was introduced to the island of Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel, possibly by monks.The Peony Society: Steep Holm 37 plants were taken to nearby Flat Holm island by Frank Harris, the farmer at the time, in the 1930s, many of which died during the World War II occupation and fortification of the island. One remaining plant was reintroduced by the Flat Holm Warden in 1982 and is protected by fencing near the path to the lighthouse. A few plants grown from seed also survive in the farmhouse garden.Cardiff Council Flat Holm Project records accessed 2008-05-08

==Flowering Cycle==

Paeonia mascula flowers for just one week of the year normally in May or June and the seedpods (at one stage referred to as jester's hats develop during the summer before bursting open to scatter seeds in August or September.[tpl]Citation | title = Flat Holm Island | publisher = Cardiff Council | pages = 46–47 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-902466-14-3 [/tpl] The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.
The islands are the only known place in the UK where the Wild Peony has naturalised.  The likely reason for this is that the islands provide a habitat which is similar to the Mediterranean islands where the plants originate from and the relative isolation allows them some protection.

==Etymology==

The peony is named after Paeon, a physician to the gods who obtained the plant on Mount Olympus from the mother of Apollo.  According to the legend, the peony needed to be left alone and punished those who try to move it by not flowering again for several years. Once established, however, it blooms each year for decades.[tpl]Citation | last1 = Pickles| first1 =  Sheila | title = The Language of Flowers| publisher = | year = 1990 [/tpl]
