James Patrick "Jimmy" Page, [tpl]post-nominals|OBE[/tpl] (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and leader of the rock band Led Zeppelin.
Page began his career as a studio session musician in London and, by the mid-1960s, he had become the most sought-after session guitarist in England. He was a member of the Yardbirds from 1966 to 1968. In late 1968, he founded Led Zeppelin.
Page is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time.[tpl]sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=773[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Gulla|2009|p=151[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-page-mn0000089021|title=Jimmy Page Biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] Rolling Stone magazine has described Page as "the pontiff of power riffing" and ranked him number 3 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". In 2010, he was ranked number two in Gibson's list of "Top 50 Guitarists of All Time" and, in 2007, number four on Classic Rock's "100 Wildest Guitar Heroes". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995). Page has been described by Uncut as "rock's greatest and most mysterious guitar hero." Los Angeles Times magazine voted Jimmy Page the 2nd Greatest Guitarist of all time.

==Early life==

Jimmy Page was born to James Patrick Page and Patricia Elizabeth Page (née Gaffikin)[tpl]Sfn|Davis|1985[/tpl] in the west London suburb of Heston, which today forms part of the London Borough of Hounslow. His father was an industrial personnel manager and his mother, who was of Irish descent,[tpl]Sfn|Case|2007|p=5[/tpl] was a doctor's secretary. In 1952, they moved to Feltham and then to Miles Road, Epsom in Surrey, which is where Page came across his first guitar. "I don't know whether guitar was left behind by the people the house before us, or whether it was a friend of the family's—nobody seemed to know why it was there."Charles Shaar Murray, "The Guv'nors", Mojo, August 2004, p. 67. First playing the instrument at age twelve,[tpl]cite web|last=Crowe|first=Cameron|authorlink=Cameron Crowe|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-durable-led-zeppelin-19750313|title=The Durable Led Zeppelin|work=Rolling Stone|date=13 March 1975|accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl] he took a few lessons in nearby Kingston, but was largely self-taught:
 When I grew up there weren't many other guitarists ... There was one other guitarist in my school who actually showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously it was a very personal thing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1283481|title=Guitar Legend Jimmy Page|work=NPR|date=2 June 2003|accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl] 
Among Page's early influences were rockabilly guitarists Scotty Moore and James Burton, who both played on recordings made by Elvis Presley. Presley's song "Baby Let's Play House" is cited by Page as being his inspiration to take up the guitar.[tpl]cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003340.html|title=1977 Jimmy Page Interview|work=Modern Guitars|date=25 May 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110105123043/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003340.html|archivedate=5 January 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl] Although he appeared on BBC1 in 1957 with a Hofner President, Page states that his first guitar was a second-hand 1959 Futurama Grazioso, later replaced by a Fender Telecaster.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schulps|first=Dave|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|work=Trouser Press|issue=October 1977|accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl]
Page's musical tastes included skiffle (a popular English music genre of the time) and acoustic folk playing, and the blues sounds of Elmore James, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Freddie King and Hubert Sumlin.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_93.gw|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|journal=Guitar World|issue=May 1993|accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl] "Basically, that was the start: a mixture between rock and blues."
At 13, Page appeared on Huw Wheldon's All Your Own talent quest programme in a skiffle quartet, one performance of which aired on BBC1 in 1957. The group played "Mama Don't Want to Skiffle Anymore" and another American-flavoured song, "In Them Ol' Cottonfields Back Home." When asked by Wheldon what he wanted to do after schooling, Page said, "I want to do biological research" to find a cure for "cancer, if it isn't discovered by then."
In an interview with Guitar Player magazine, Page stated that "there was a lot of busking in the early days, but as they say, I had to come to grips with it and it was a good schooling." Page took a guitar to school each day only to have it confiscated and returned to him after class.[tpl]Sfn|Kendall|1981|p=11[/tpl] Although interviewed for a job as a laboratory assistant, he ultimately chose to leave Danetree Secondary School, West Ewell, to pursue music.[tpl]Sfn|Kendall|1981|p=11[/tpl]
Initially, Page had difficulty finding other musicians with whom he could play on a regular basis. "It wasn't as though there was an abundance. I used to play in many groups ... anyone who could get a gig together, really." Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet Royston Ellis at the Mermaid Theatre between 1960–61,[tpl]sfn|Case|2007|p=294[/tpl] and singer Red E. Lewis, he was asked by singer Neil Christian to join his band, The Crusaders, after Christian had seen a fifteen-year-old Page playing in a local hall. Page toured with Christian for approximately two years and later played on several of his records, including the 1962 single, "The Road to Love."
During his stint with Christian, Page fell seriously ill with glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) and could not continue touring. While recovering, he decided to put his musical career on hold and concentrate on his other love, painting, and enrolled at Sutton Art College in Surrey. As he explained in 1975:

==Early 1960s: session musician==

While still a student, Page often performed on stage at The Marquee with bands such as Cyril Davies' All Stars, Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated and fellow guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard & the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for Columbia Graphophone Company, including "The Worrying Kind". Mike Leander of Decca Records first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording "Diamonds" by Jet Harris and Tony Meehan, which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.
After brief stints with Carter-Lewis and the Southerners, Mike Hurst and the Method and Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. Page was mainly called into sessions as "insurance" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. "It was usually myself and a drummer", he explained, "though they never mention the drummer these days, just me ... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim Sullivan or myself." He stated that "In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything."[tpl]cite journal|last=Paul|first=Du Noyer|title=Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?|work=Q magazine|issue=August 1988|pages=5–7[/tpl]
Page was the favoured session guitarist of record producer Shel Talmy. As a result, he secured session work on songs for the Who and the Kinks.[tpl]cite web|last=Kingsmill|first=Richard|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1402502.htm|title=Led Zeppelin Triple J Music Specials|work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=12 July 2000[/tpl] Page is credited with playing acoustic twelve string guitar on two tracks on the Kinks' debut album "I'm a Lover Not a Fighter" and "I've Been Driving on Bald Mountain"Booklet of the The Kinks Deluxe Edition Sanctuary Records 2011 and possibly on the b-side "I Gotta Move".Booklet of the Kinks' Picture Book boxset Sanctuary Records 2008 He played rhythm guitar on the sessions for the Who's first single "I Can't Explain" (although Pete Townshend was reluctant to allow Page's contribution on the final recording, Page also played lead guitar on the B-side "Bald Headed Woman").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewho.com/index.php?module=discography&discography_item_id=90 |title=Official Discography |publisher=The Who|date=13 September 1971 |accessdate=14 January 2013[/tpl] Page's studio gigs in 1964 included Marianne Faithfull's "As Tears Go By", The Nashville Teens' "Tobacco Road", The Rolling Stones' "Heart of Stone" (released on Metamorphosis), Van Morrison & Them's "Baby Please Don't Go" and "Here Comes the Night", Dave Berry's "The Crying Game" and "My Baby Left Me", Brenda Lee's "Is It True," and Petula Clark's "Downtown".
In 1965 Page was hired by Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham to act as house producer and A&R man for the newly formed Immediate Records label, which allowed him to play on and/or produce tracks by John Mayall, Nico, Chris Farlowe, Twice as Much and Clapton. Page also formed a brief songwriting partnership with then romantic interest, Jackie DeShannon. He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not the classical guitarist John Williams) album The Maureeny Wishful Album with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on Donovan Leitch's Sunshine Superman (1966) and the Johnny Hallyday albums Jeune Homme (1968) and Je Suis Né Dans La Rue (1969), the Al Stewart album Love Chronicles (1969) and played guitar on five tracks of Joe Cocker's debut album, With a Little Help from My Friends. Over the years since 1970 Page played lead guitar on 10 Roy Harper tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.
When questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that "I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session ... I was able to fit all these different roles."
Although Page recorded with many notable musicians, a lot of these early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's "Little Queen of Spades". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, Jimmy Page: Session Man. Page also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called "Scarlet" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe: "I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called "Scarlet." I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album"
Page left studio work when the increasing influence of Stax Records on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars. He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:

==Late 1960s: The Yardbirds==

In late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend. In February 1965 Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but because he was unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and because he was still worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend, Jeff Beck.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|journal=Hit Parader|issue=April 1966|title=Jeff Beck Interview (PDF)|accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl] On 16 May 1966, drummer Keith Moon, bass player John Paul Jones, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Jeff Beck and Page recorded "Beck's Bolero" in London's IBC Studios. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new supergroup featuring Beck, along with The Who's John Entwistle on bass and Keith Moon on drums. However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name "Led Zeppelin" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.
Within weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at Oxford. After the show he went backstage where Paul Samwell-Smith announced that he was leaving the group. Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when Chris Dreja moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago". (While Page and Jeff Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the ARMS charity concerts in 1983.)
After Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, Little Games. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at only number 80 on the Billboard 200.  Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of "Dazed and Confused".
After the departure of Keith Relf and Jim McCarty in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. As he said:
To this end, Page recruited vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham, and he was also contacted by John Paul Jones, who asked to join.Dominick A. Miserandino, Led Zeppelin – John Paul Jones, TheCelebrityCafe.com. During the Scandinavian tour the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle. Page stuck with that name to use for his new band. Peter Grant changed it to "Led Zeppelin", to avoid a mispronunciation of "Lead Zeppelin."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jimmypageonline.com/11318/42826.html |title=(unofficial website) |publisher=Jimmy Page Online |accessdate=11 September 2010[/tpl]

==1968–80: Led Zeppelin==

Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording—various sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums worldwide. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.
Led Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.
Page explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:

==Post-Led Zeppelin career==

Led Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer John Bonham at Page's home, The Old Mill House at Clewer in Berkshire. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.David Cavanagh, "http://www.uncut.co.uk/led-zeppelin/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-interview", Uncut. Thereafter, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands the Firm, the Honeydrippers, reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.

===1980s===

Page made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the Hammersmith Odeon.[tpl]sfn|Case|2007|p=164[/tpl] Also in 1981, Page joined with Yes bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White to form a supergroup called XYZ (for ex-Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's "Fortune Hunter" and Yes songs "Mind Drive" and "Can You Imagine?". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, Germany, playing "I'm Down".
In 1982 Page collaborated with director Michael Winner to record the Death Wish II soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the Death Wish III soundtrack (1985), were recorded and produced at his recording studio, The Sol in Cookham, which he had purchased from Gus Dudgeon in the early 1980s.
In 1983 Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for Multiple sclerosis) charity series of concerts which honoured Small Faces bassist Ronnie Lane, who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the Death Wish II soundtrack (with Steve Winwood on vocals) and an instrumental version of "Stairway to Heaven". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed "Midnight Moonlight" which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of "Layla" that reunited Page with Yardbirds guitarists Beck and Clapton. According to the book Hammer of the Gods, it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.
Page next linked up with Roy Harper for the 1984 album Whatever Happened to Jugula? and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984 Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album The Honeydrippers: Volume 1 and with John Paul Jones on the film soundtrack Scream for Help.
Page subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name The Firm. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled The Firm. Popular songs included "Radioactive" and "Satisfaction Guaranteed". The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard pop albums chart and went gold in the US.  It was followed by Mean Business in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.
Various other projects followed, such as session work for Graham Nash, Stephen Stills and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single "One Hit (to the Body)"). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his ex-Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the Box of Frogs album Strange Land.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm |title=Report |publisher=BBC News|date=4 August 2004 |accessdate=11 September 2010[/tpl] Page released a solo album entitled Outrider in 1988 which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant's solo album Now and Zen, which was released the same year.
Throughout these years Page also reunited with the other former bandmates of Led Zeppelin to perform live on a few occasions, most notably in 1985 for the Live Aid concert with both Phil Collins and Tony Thompson filling drum duties. However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul.[tpl]sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=139[/tpl] Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham's son Jason, performed at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.[tpl]sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=139[/tpl]

===1990s===

In 1990, a Knebworth concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform "Misty Mountain Hop", "Wearing and Tearing" and "Rock and Roll". Page also performed with the band's former members at Jason Bonham's wedding.
Page also embarked on a collaboration with David Coverdale in 1993 entitled Coverdale Page.
In 1994, Page reunited with Plant for the penultimate performance in MTV's "Unplugged" series. The 90-minute special, dubbed Unledded, premiered to the highest ratings in MTV's history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the CD No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded and in 2004 as the DVD No Quarter Unledded. Following a highly successful mid-'90s tour to support No Quarter, Page and Plant recorded 1998's Walking into Clarksdale.
Page was heavily involved in remastering the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the Action for Brazil's Children Trust (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. In the same year, Page played guitar for rap singer/producer Puff Daddy's song "Come with Me", which heavily samples Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir" and was included in the soundtrack of Godzilla. The two later performed the song on Saturday Night Live.
In October 1999, Page teamed up with The Black Crowes for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The concert was recorded and released as a double live album, Live at the Greek in 2000. In 2001 he made an appearance on stage with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst and Wes Scantlin of Puddle of Mudd at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards in Frankfurt, where they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's "Thank You".[tpl]cite web| url = http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457 | title = Led Zep's Page Joins Limp Bizkit's Durst And Puddle of Mudd's Scantlin On Stage | accessdate =17 February 2007 |date=11 October 2001 | publisher=Yahoo[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]

In November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The television broadcasting of the event consisted of an introduction to the band by various famous admirers (including Roger Taylor, Slash, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Jack White and Tony Iommi), a presentation of an award to Jimmy Page and then a short speech by the guitarist. After this, rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin, playing the song "Communication Breakdown".[tpl]cite web|url=http://werksman.blogspot.nl/2006/09/wolfmother-live-at-led-zeps-induction.html |title=Wolfmother live at Led Zep's induction |accessdate=13 November 2013 |author=Hans Werksman|date=21 September 2006 |format=weblog |work=Here Comes The Flood |publisher=Hans Werksman[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5338196.stm|title=Led Zeppelin make UK Hall of Fame |accessdate=10 December 2007|date=23 May 2006 |publisher=BBC News [/tpl]
In 2006, Page attended the induction of Led Zeppelin to the UK Music Hall of Fame. During an interview for the BBC for said event, he expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying: "It's an album that I really need to get out of my system ...there's a good album in there and it's ready to come out" and "Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon."[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/jimmy_page_talks_on_new_album.html | title = Jimmy Page Talks On New Album|accessdate=9 January 2009 |date=16 November 2006|work=Ultimate Guitar | publisher=Ultimate Guitar[/tpl]

==Legacy and influence==

Page's experiences both in the studio and with the Yardbirds were very influential in contributing to the success of Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. As a record producer, songwriter, and guitarist he helped make Led Zeppelin a prototype for countless future rock bands and was one of the major driving forces behind the rock sound of that era, influencing a host of other guitarists."Their Time is Gonna Come", Classic Rock Magazine, December 2007 Allmusic states that "just about every rock guitarist from the late '60s/early '70s to the present day has been influenced by Page's work with Led Zeppelin". For example, Dictators bassist Andy Shernoff states that Jimmy Page's sped up, downstroke guitar riff in "Communication Breakdown", an influential song that contained elements of protopunk,[tpl]cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/led-zeppelin/albumguide|title=Led Zeppelin: Album Guide|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Hoskyns|2006[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] was an inspiration for Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone's downstroke guitar style.Everett, True, Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of The Ramones (2002): 13 Ramone, who has described Page as "probably the greatest guitarist who ever lived",[tpl]cite web|last=Robert|first=Jones|url=http://www.robertjonesphoto.com/johnnyramone.html|title=Conservative Punk's Interview with Johnny Ramone|date=2 April 2003|accessdate=2 December 2010[/tpl] stated in the documentary "Ramones: The True Story" that he improved at his down-stroke picking style by playing the song over and over again for the bulk of his early career.[tpl]cite video |title = Ramones: The True Story |publisher=Classic Rock Legends |id = B000CRSF6W [/tpl] Brian May of Queen, who was also influenced by Page,[tpl]cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13633|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Brian May at Allmusic |publisher=AllMusic|date=19 July 1947 |accessdate=11 September 2010[/tpl] has said: "I don't think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page – he's one of the great brains of rock music."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006190/bio|title=Brian May: Personal Quote|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] Tom Scholz of Boston was heavily influenced by Jimmy Page and credits the dual guitar harmonies in Led Zeppelin's "How Many More Times" as the inspiration for Boston's distinctive sound.Cocks, Jay.

==Equipment and recording techniques==

===Guitars===

For the recording of most of Led Zeppelin material from Led Zeppelin's second album onwards, Page used a Gibson Les Paul guitar (sold to him by Joe Walsh) with Marshall amplification. A Harmony Sovereign H-1260 was used in-studio on Led Zeppelin III and Led Zeppelin IV and on-stage from 5 March 1971 to 28 June 1972. During the studio sessions for Led Zeppelin and later for recording the guitar solo in "Stairway to Heaven", he used a Fender Telecaster (a gift from Jeff Beck).Charles Shaar Murray, "21st century digital man", Classic Rock Magazine: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin, 2008, p. 56. He also used a Danelectro 3021, tuned to DADGAD, most notably on live performances of "Kashmir".
Page also plays his guitar with a cello bow,[tpl]sfn|Case|2007|p=294[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Lewis|2004|p=67[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fast|2001|p=210[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Coelho|2003|p=119[/tpl] as on the live versions of the songs "Dazed and Confused" and "How Many More Times". This was a technique he developed during his session days. On MTV's Led Zeppelin Rockumentary, Page said that he obtained the idea of playing the guitar with a bow from David McCallum, Sr. who was also a session musician. Page used his Fender Telecaster and later his Gibson Les Paul for his bow solos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/joomla/studio-and-live-gear/327|title=Cello Bow|work=led-zeppelin.org|accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl]

====Signature models====

Gibson released Jimmy Page Signature Les Paul, discontinued in 1999, then released another version in 2004, which was also discontinued. The 2004 version included 25 guitars signed by Page, 150 aged by Tom Murphy (an acknowledged ageing "master") and 840 "unlimited" production guitars. The Jimmy Page Signature EDS-1275 has been produced by Gibson. Recently, Gibson reproduced Page's 1960 Les Paul Black Beauty, the one stolen from him in 1970, with modern modifications. This guitar was sold in 2008 with a run of 25, again signed by Page, plus an additional 500 unsigned guitars.
In December 2009, Gibson released the 'Jimmy Page "Number Two" Les Paul'.[tpl]cite web|title=9.6 Rating Jimmy Page "Number Two" Les Paul|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-Custom/Jimmy-Page-Number-Two-Les-Paul.aspx|publisher=Gibson|accessdate=4 July 2011[/tpl] This is a re-creation of Page's famous number 2 Les Paul used by him since about 1974. The model includes the same pick-up switching setup as devised by Page, shaved-down neck profile, Burstbucker pick-up at neck and "Pagebucker" at the bridge. A total of 325 were made in three finishes: 25 Aged by Gibson's Tom Murphy, signed and played by Page ($26,000), 100 aged ($16,000) and 200 with VOS finish ($12,000).

===Amplifiers and effects===

He usually recorded in studio with a Vox AC30, Fender and Orange amplification. The first Led Zeppelin albumwas played on a Fender Telecaster through a Supro amplifier.[tpl]cite news|title=10 Things You Gotta Do To Play Like Jimmy Page|last=Gress|first=Jesse|date=July 2011|work=Guitar Player|pages=74–88[/tpl]

===Music production techniques===

Jimmy Page is credited for the innovations in sound recording he brought to the studio during the years he was a member of Led Zeppelin,[tpl]cite journal|last=Tolinski |first=Brad |coauthors=Greg Di Bendetto |date=January 1998 |title=Light and Shade |journal=Guitar World |url=http://trublukris.tripod.com/inter/jp-history.html |accessdate=10 December 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070915171903/http://trublukris.tripod.com/inter/jp-history.html| archivedate = 15 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2008[/tpl]"Rock's sonic architect", Classic Rock Magazine, December 2007 many of which he had initially developed as a session musician:Ian Fortnam, "Dazed & confused", Classic Rock Magazine: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin, 2008, p. 41.
 This apprenticeship ... became a part of learning how things were recorded. I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room ... And so bit by bit I was learning really how not to record. 
He developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed microphones directly in front of amplifiers and drums, resulting in the sometimes "tinny" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to Guitar World magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular "sounded like cardboard boxes." Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, Sun Studios being a particular favourite. In the same Guitar World interview, Page remarked: "Recording used to be a science" and "engineers used to have a maxim: distance equals depth." Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's "ambient sound" – the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.
For the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as "Whole Lotta Love" and "You Shook Me", Page additionally utilised "reverse echo" – a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single "Ten Little Indians"). This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.
Page has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the audio engineers on Led Zeppelin albums, from Glyn Johns for the first album, to Eddie Kramer for Led Zeppelin II, to Andy Johns for Led Zeppelin III and later albums. He explained: "I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me."
John Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:
In an interview that Page himself gave to Guitar World magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:

==Personal life==

French model Charlotte Martin was Page's partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her "My Lady". Together they have a daughter, Scarlet Page (born in 1971), who is a photographer.
From 1986 to 1995 Page was married to Patricia Ecker, a model and waitress. They have a son, James Patrick Page III (born April 1988). Page later married Jimena Gómez-Paratcha, whom he met in Brazil on the No Quarter tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abctrust.org.uk/whoweare.html |title=ABC Trust History: Who We Are |publisher=Abctrust.org.uk |accessdate=1 January 2012[/tpl] He adopted her oldest daughter Jana (born 1994) and they have two children together: Zofia Jade (born 1997) and Ashen Josan (born 1999).[tpl]sfn|Case|2007|p=227[/tpl] Page and Paratcha divorced in 2008.
In 1972 Page bought, from Richard Harris, the home that William Burges (1827–1881) designed for himself in London, The Tower House. "I had an interest going back to my teens in the pre-Raphaelite movement and the architecture of Burges," he said. "What a wonderful world to discover." The reputation of Burges rests on his extravagant designs and his contribution to the Gothic revival in architecture in the nineteenth century.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/3730777.stm | title = Rock legend's pilgrimage to castle | accessdate =17 February 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=20 May 2004[/tpl]

From 1980 to 2004 Page owned the Mill House, Mill Lane, Windsor, which was formerly the home of actor Michael Caine. Fellow Led Zeppelin band member John Bonham died at the house in 1980.
From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, Page owned the Boleskine House, the former residence of occultist Aleister Crowley.James Jackson, Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's good times, bad times and reunion rumours, The Times, 8 January 2010 .[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/biography|title= Led Zeppelin Biography|accessdate=14 January 2013|work=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Sections of Page's fantasy sequence in the film The Song Remains the Same were filmed at night on the mountain side directly behind Boleskine House.
According to Sunday Times Rich List, Page's assets are worth £75 million as of 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/richlist/article1024783.ece|title=Music millionaires|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl] He resides in Sonning, Berkshire in Deanery Garden, a house designed by Edwin Lutyens for the owner of Country Life magazine, Edward Hudson. Page also previously owned Plumpton Place in Sussex, also formerly owned by Edward Hudson and with certain parts of the house also designed by Edwin Lutyens. This house features in the Zeppelin film The Song Remains The Same where Jimmy is seen sitting on the lawn playing a hurdy gurdy.

===Recreational drug use===

Page has acknowledged heavy recreational drug use throughout the 1970s. In an interview with Guitar World magazine in 2003, he stated: "I can't speak for the members of the band, but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end."Tolinski, Brad. "The Greatest Show on Earth, Guitar World, July 2003; re-published in Guitar Legends Magazine, Winter 2004, p. 72. After the band's 1973 North American tour, Page told Nick Kent: "Oh, everyone went over the top a few times. I know I did and, to be honest with you, I don't really remember much of what happened."Case, George, "Jimmy Page: Magnus, Musician, Man", Hal Leonard Books 2007; excerpt printed in Guitar World, May 2007, p. 52.
In 1975, Page began to use heroin, a claim attributed to Richard Cole, who stated that Page (in addition to himself) was taking the drug during the recording sessions of the album Presence in that year and that Page admitted to him shortly afterwards that he was addicted to the drug.[tpl]sfn|Cole|1992|pp=322–326[/tpl]
By Led Zeppelin's 1977 North American tour, Page's heroin addiction was beginning to hamper his guitar playing performances.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |work=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print |accessdate=9 December 2007 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Davis |first=Stephen |title = Power, Mystery and the Hammer of the Gods: The Rise and Fall of Led Zeppelin |work=Rolling Stone |issue=451 |date=4 July 1985 |url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/articles/story/17537975/power_mystery_and_the_hammer_of_the_gods |accessdate=15 January 2008 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] By this time the guitarist had lost a noticeable amount of weight. His onstage appearance was not the only obvious change; his addiction caused Page to become so inward and isolated it altered the dynamics between him and Plant considerably.[tpl]sfn|Fast|2001|p=47[/tpl] During the recording sessions for In Through the Out Door in 1978, Page's diminished influence on the album (relative to bassist John Paul Jones) is partly attributed to his heroin addiction, which resulted in his absence from the studio for long periods of time.Aizelwood, John. "Closing Time", Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003, p. 94.
Page reportedly kicked his heroin habit in the early 1980s.[tpl]sfn|Davis|1985|pp=316–317[/tpl] In a 1988 interview with Musician magazine, Page took offence when the interviewer noted that heroin had been associated with his name and insisted: "Do I look as if I'm a smack addict? Well, I'm not. Thank you very much."Du Noyer, Paul. "Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?", Q magazine, August 1988, p. 6.
In an interview he gave to Q magazine in 2003, Page responded to a question as to whether he regrets getting so involved in heroin and cocaine:

===Interest in the occult===

The appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin's fourth album has been linked to Page's interest in the occult.Jimmy Page interview, Guitar World, January 2008. The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page's own so-called "Zoso" symbol originated in Ars Magica Arteficii (1557) by Gerolamo Cardano, an old alchemical grimoire, where it has been identified as a sigil consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils by Fred Gettings.[tpl]sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl]
[/ref]
During tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the "Zoso" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with zodiac symbols. These were visible most notably on his "Dragon Suit", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.
The artwork inside the album cover of Led Zeppelin IV is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby MOM, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called "The Hermit". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting. Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film The Song Remains the Same.
In the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, in Kensington High Street, London, eventually closing it as the increasing success of Led Zeppelin occupied his time. The company published a facsimile of English occultist's Aleister Crowley's 1904 edition of The Goetia.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Page has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:
Page was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film Lucifer Rising by Crowley admirer and underground movie director Kenneth Anger. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of "droning". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a "dabbler" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack, Guitar World, October 2006. Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on "Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks". Side one contained "Lucifer Rising - Main Track", whilst side two contained the tracks "Incubus", "Damask", "Unharmonics", "Damask - Ambient", and "Lucifer Rising  - Percussive Return". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story "Jimmy Page Looks Back", Page said: "...there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it."
Although Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a Thelemite nor was he ever initiated into the O.T.O. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.
In her 2001 autobiography Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey, Bebe Buell, a one-time love interest of Page's, recounts his interest in the occult in depth as part of her portrait of him.
