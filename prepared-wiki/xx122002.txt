==History==

The area that makes up Olentangy West was originally designated as part of the United States Military Lands. This area was set aside as payment for soldiers who served in the American Revolutionary War. Shortly after Franklin County was established, the area became part of Clinton and Perry Townships. Simon and Alexander Shattuck were major landholders in the area, having moved to Ohio from Groton, Massachusetts. They farmed the land and established a settlement called "Shattucksburg" near the current site of the Marburn subdivision. A small schoolhouse was built nearby in 1856, which was later converted to a private residence. Union Cemetery was established in 1847, having previously been used as a burial site for the Hess family, and is now one of the largest cemeteries in Columbus. thumb|left|1856 Schoolhouse located on Olentangy River Road, now a private residence.
Olentangy River Road was constructed in 1828 and connected the area to Franklinton and Delaware. The railroad came to the area in 1876 with the completion of the Columbus and Toledo Railroad. This track is still in service today as a freight line operated by CSX. In 1939, a bridge was built across the Olentangy River that extended North Broadway from High Street to Olentangy River Road.
In the late 1940s, John D. Kraus set up OSU's first Radio telescope in the west campus farm fields next to Ackerman Run.http://www.bigear.org/ohsmarkr/History_OSURO.htm This was the first iteration of what would later be called the Big Ear. However, when more space was needed for an expansion, the project moved adjacent to Perkins Observatory in Delaware in 1961. Though the site has long since been abandoned, the ruins of the original control building and the antenna footings remain.
Urban development in the area began in earnest in the 1950s, as the city of Columbus grew outward and baby boomers desired new houses away from the crowded conditions of the inner city. Olentangy River Road was expanded from two to four lanes north of Ackerman in 1956, and the University City Shopping Center was built in 1961, catering to the new families in the area as well as those in Clintonville and Old North Columbus.[ref]
