==Synopsis==

During both World War I and World War II, the Women's Land Army was set up in the United Kingdom, to recruit women to work at farms where men had left to go to war. Women in the WLA were nicknamed "land girls".
Set in 1941 in the Dorset countryside, three "land girls" arrive on a remote farm. They are an unlikely trio: hairdresser Prue (Anna Friel) is vivacious and sexy, Cambridge University graduate Ag (Rachel Weisz) is quiet and more reserved, and dreamy Stella (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Philip, a dashing Royal Navy officer. Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.
