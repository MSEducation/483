Hypoxia (also known as Hypoxiation or Anoxemia) is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. Hypoxia may be classified as either generalized, affecting the whole body, or local, affecting a region of the body. Although hypoxia is often a pathological condition, variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during hypoventilation trainingWoorons, Xavier, Hypoventilation training, push your limits! Arpeh, 2014, 164p. (ISBN 978-2-9546040-1-5) or strenuous physical exercise.
Hypoxia differs from hypoxemia in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient, whereas hypoxemia refers specifically to states that have low arterial oxygen supply.[tpl]cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Pulmonary Pathophysiology: The Essentials |year=1977 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |pages=22 |isbn=0-683-08936-6[/tpl] Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as "anoxia".
Generalized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to high altitude, where it causes altitude sickness leading to potentially fatal complications: high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).[tpl]cite journal |author=Cymerman, A; Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments. A Handbook for Medical Officers |publisher=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |volume=USARIEM-TN94-2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7976 |accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl]  Hypoxia also occurs in healthy individuals when breathing mixtures of gasses with a low oxygen content, e.g. while diving underwater especially when using closed-circuit rebreather systems that control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air.  A mild and non-damaging intermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during altitude trainings to develop an athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular level.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gore CJ, Clark SA, Saunders PU |title=Nonhematological mechanisms of improved sea-level performance after hypoxic exposure |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1600–9 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17805094 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180de49d3 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-9131&volume=39&issue=9&spage=1600[/tpl]
Hypoxia is also a serious consequence of preterm birth in the neonate. The main cause for this is that the lungs of the human fetus are among the last organs to develop during pregnancy. To assist the lungs to distribute oxygenated blood throughout the body, infants at risk of hypoxia are often placed inside an incubator capable of providing continuous positive airway pressure (also known as a humidicrib).

==Signs and symptoms==

===Generalised hypoxia===

The symptoms of generalized hypoxia depend on its severity and acceleration of onset.
In the case of altitude sickness, where hypoxia develops gradually, the symptoms include light-headedness / fatigue, numbness / tingling of extremities, nausea and anorexia.[tpl]cite book |last1=Robinson first1=Grace |last2=Strading first2=John |last3=West first3=Sophie |title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=880 |isbn=0199545162[/tpl] In severe hypoxia, or hypoxia of very rapid onset, ataxia, confusion / disorientation / hallucinations / behavioral change, severe headaches / reduced level of consciousness, papilloedema, breathlessness,[tpl]cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Grace |last2=Strading |first2=John |last3=West |first3=Sophie |title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=880 |isbn=0199545162[/tpl] pallor,[tpl]cite book |last1=Illingworth |first1=Robin |last2=Graham |first2=Colin |last3=Hogg |first3=Kerstin |title=Oxford Handbook of Emergency Medicine |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=768 |isbn=0199589569[/tpl] tachycardia and pulmonary hypertension eventually leading to the late signs cyanosis, bradycardia / cor pulmonale and hypotension followed by death.[tpl]cite book |last1=Hillman |first1=Ken |last2=Bishop |first2=Gillian |title=Clinical Intensive Care and Acute Medicine |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=685 |isbn=1139449362[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Longmore |first1=J. |last2=Longmore |first2=Murray |last3=Wilkinson |first3=Ian |last4=Rajagopalan |first4=Supraj |title=Mini Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=874 |isbn=0198570716[/tpl]
Because haemoglobin is a darker red when it is not bound to oxygen (deoxyhaemoglobin), as opposed to the rich red color that it has when bound to oxygen (oxyhaemoglobin), when seen through the skin it has an increased tendency to reflect blue light back to the eye.[tpl]cite book |last1=Ahrens |first1=Thomas |last2=Rutherford |first2=Kim |last2=Kimberley |first2=Basham |title=Essentials of Oxygenation: Implication for Clinical Practice |year=1993 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |pages=194 |isbn=0867203323[/tpl] In cases where the oxygen is displaced by another molecule, such as carbon monoxide, the skin may appear 'cherry red' instead of cyanotic.[tpl]cite book |last1=Ramrakha |first1=Punit |last2=Moore |first2=Kevin |title=Oxford Handbook of Acute Medicine |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=990 |isbn=0198520727[/tpl]

===Local hypoxia===

If a tissue is not being perfused properly, it may feel cold and appear pale; if severe, hypoxia can result in cyanosis, a blue discoloration of the skin. If hypoxia is very severe, a tissue may eventually gangrene.
Extreme pain may also be felt at or around the site.

==Cause==

Oxygen passively diffuses in the lung alveoli according to a pressure gradient. Oxygen diffuses from the breathed air, mixed with water vapour, to arterial blood, where its partial pressure is around 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa).[tpl]cite web | author=Kenneth Baillie and Alistair Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/oxygen_levels.php | publisher= Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10[/tpl] – Online interactive oxygen delivery calculator. In the blood, oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. The binding capacity of hemoglobin is influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment, as described in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. A smaller amount of oxygen is transported in solution in the blood. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In peripheral tissues, oxygen again diffuses down a pressure gradient into cells and their mitochondria, where it is used to produce energy in conjunction with the breakdown of glucose, fats and some amino acids. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Hypoxia can result from a failure at any stage in the delivery of oxygen to cells. This can include decreased partial pressures of oxygen, problems with diffusion of oxygen in the lungs, insufficient available hemoglobin, problems with blood flow to the end tissue, and problems with breathing rhythm.
Experimentally, oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting (and lethal) when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) or below. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

===Ischemia===

Ischemia, meaning insufficient blood flow to a tissue, can also result in hypoxia. This is called 'ischemic hypoxia'. This can include an embolic event, a heart attack that decreases overall blood flow, or trauma to a tissue that results in damage. An example of insufficient blood flow causing local hypoxia is gangrene that occurs in diabetes. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Diseases such as peripheral vascular disease can also result in local hypoxia. For this reason, symptoms are worse when a limb is used. Pain may also be felt as a result of lactic acid created as a result of anaerobic metabolism.

===Hypoxemic hypoxia===

This refers specifically to hypoxic states where the arterial content of oxygen is insufficient.[tpl]cite book |last=West |first=John B. |title=Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=La Jolla |year=2008 |pages=88–89 |edition=8th[/tpl] This can be caused by alterations in respiratory drive, such as in respiratory alkalosis, physiological or pathological shunting of blood, diseases interfering in lung function resulting in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, such as a pulmonary embolus, or alterations in the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment or lung alveoli, such as may occur at altitude or when diving.

===Problems with hemoglobin===

Almost all the oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin, so interfering with this carrier molecule limits oxygen delivery to the periphery. Hemoglobin increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood by about 40-fold,[tpl]cite book|last=Martin|first=Lawrence|title=All you really need to know to interpret arterial blood gases|year=1999|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-683-30604-9|edition=2nd ed.[/tpl] with the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment, a relationship described in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. When the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen is interfered with, a hypoxic state can result.[tpl]cite book|first=the editors Nicki R. Colledge, Brian R. Walker, Stuart H. Ralston ; illustrated by Robert Britton|title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine.|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3085-7|edition=21st ed.[/tpl][tpl]rp|997–999[/tpl]

====Anemia====

Hemoglobin plays a substantial role in carrying oxygen throughout the body, and when it is deficient, anemia can result, causing 'anaemic hypoxia' if tissue perfusion is decreased. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. As iron is used in the synthesis of hemoglobin, less hemoglobin will be synthesised when there is less iron, due to insufficient intake, or poor absorption.[tpl]rp|997–999[/tpl]
Anemia is typically a chronic process that is compensated over time by increased levels of red blood cells via upregulated erythropoetin. A chronic hypoxic state can result from a poorly compensated anaemia.[tpl]rp|997–999[/tpl]

====Carbon monoxide poisoning====

Carbon monoxide competes with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin molecules. As carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin hundreds of times tighter than oxygen, it can prevent the carriage of oxygen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Douglas|first=CG|coauthors=Haldane, JS, Haldane, JB|title=The laws of combination of hemoglobin with carbon monoxide and oxygen.|journal=The Journal of physiology|date=Jun 12, 1912|volume=44|issue=4|pages=275–304|pmid=16993128|pmc=1512793[/tpl]  
CO has a second toxic effect, namely removing the allosteric shift of the oxygen dissociation curve and shifting the foot of the curve to the left.  In so doing, the hemoglobin is less likely to release its oxygens at the peripheral tissues.[ref]

[/ref]  Certain abnormal hemoglobin variants also have higher than normal affinity for oxygen, and so are also poor at delivering oxygen to the periphery.

====Cyanide poisoning====

Histotoxic hypoxia results when the quantity of oxygen reaching the cells is normal, but the cells are unable to use the oxygen effectively, due to disabled oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. This may occur in Cyanide poisoning. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

====Other====

Hemoglobin's function can also be lost by chemically oxidizing its iron atom to its ferric form.  This form of inactive hemoglobin is called methemoglobin and can be made by ingesting sodium nitriteRoueché, Berton (1953) Eleven blue men, and other narratives of medical detection. Boston: Little, Brown. as well as certain drugs and other chemicals.[tpl]which|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Physiological compensation==

===Acute===

If oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand (hypoxia), hydrogen will be shifted to pyruvic acid converting it to lactic acid.  This temporary measure (anaerobic metabolism) allows small amounts of energy to be released.  Lactic acid build up (in tissues and blood) is a sign of inadequate mitochondrial oxygenation, which may be due to hypoxemia, poor blood flow (e.g., shock) or a combination of both.[tpl]cite journal | last=Hobler |first=K.E. |coauthors=L.C. Carey | title=Effect of acute progressive hypoxemia on cardiac output and plasma excess lactate | journal=Ann Surg | year=1973 | pages=199–202 | volume=177 | issue=2 | pmid= 4572785 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-197302000-00013 | pmc=1355564[/tpl]  If severe or prolonged it could lead to cell death.

In humans, hypoxia is detected by chemoreceptors in the carotid body. This response does not control ventilation rate at normal p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl], but below normal the activity of neurons innervating these receptors increases dramatically, so much so to override the signals from central chemoreceptors in the hypothalamus, increasing p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] despite a falling p[tpl]CO2[/tpl]
In most tissues of the body, the response to hypoxia is vasodilation. By widening the blood vessels, the tissue allows greater perfusion.
By contrast, in the lungs, the response to hypoxia is vasoconstriction. This is known as "Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction", or "HPV". [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==Treatment==

To counter the effects of high-altitude diseases, the body must return arterial p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] toward normal. Acclimatization, the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes, only partially restores p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] to standard levels. Hyperventilation, the body’s most common response to high-altitude conditions, increases alveolar p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] by raising the depth and rate of breathing. However, while p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] does improve with hyperventilation, it does not return to normal. Studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] with full acclimatization, yet the p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[tpl]cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=2004 |title=The Physiologic Basis of High-Altitude Diseases |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=141 |pages=789–800 |issue=10 |pmid=15545679 |author2=American College Of Physicians |author3=American Physiological Society |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-141-10-200411160-00010[/tpl] In addition, there are complications involved with acclimatization. Polycythemia, in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation, thickens the blood, raising the danger that the heart can’t pump it.
In high-altitude conditions, only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia. By increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air, the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial p[tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] is restored toward normal capacity. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 4000 m, raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000 m, which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude.[tpl]cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=1995 |title=Oxygen Enrichment of Room Air to Relieve the Hypoxia of High Altitude |journal=Respiration Physiology |volume=99 |pages=225–32 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G |issue=2 |pmid=7777705[/tpl] In a study of astronomers working in Chile at 5050 m, oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent (that is, from 21 percent to 27 percent). This resulted in increased worker productivity, less fatigue, and improved sleep.
Oxygen concentrators are uniquely suited for this purpose. They require little maintenance and electricity, provide a constant source of oxygen, and eliminate the expensive, and often dangerous, task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas. Offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms, in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level. Oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.
