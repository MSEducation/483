In his earliest Swamp Thing appearances, the character is drawn with a marked resemblance to Sting, and in ''Swamp Thing'' #51, Constantine appears on a boat with the name "The Honorable [[Gordon Sumner]]" on the bow.
John Constantine's official debut was not until Swamp Thing #37 when he was drawn by Rick Veitch and John Totleben. Moore describes the creation of Constantine as being drawn from a number of "really good ideas... about serial killers, the Winchester House, and... wanting to draw Sting in a story.""Alan Moore On (Just About) Everything", The Comics Journal #106 (March 1986), p. 42 Calling these disparate strands a "big intellectual puzzle", Constantine was the result of "fitting it all together." Initially created "purely to get Sting into the story", by the time of the 1985 San Diego ComicCon, Moore stated that "it's turning into something more than that now." Veitch's contribution was to give Constantine an earring, something he considered risque for 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050228/NEWS/502280387&SearchID=73201566900517 |title=Vermont-Hollywood 'Synchronicity' : Rutland Herald Online |publisher=Rutlandherald.com |date=2005-02-28 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]
Asked in 1985 about the similarities between John Constantine and the character Baron Winters (from Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan's Night Force), Moore revealed that he was a "big fan" of Wolfman and Night Force, but that there was "no intention to rip off Baron Winters." He stated
Constantine and Winters met each other during Moore's run on Swamp Thing and again during Gaiman's The Books of Magic.
Speaking to comics magazine Wizard in 1993, Moore elaborated:
In 1988, Constantine was given his own title, Hellblazer, published by DC Comics.  In 1993, at the launch of DC's Vertigo Comics imprint, Hellblazer was made an official Vertigo publication.  It was the longest continuously published Vertigo title.[tpl]Cite book  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Milligan began writing Justice League Dark while also writing the Vertigo's Hellblazer series, being a writer of both series at the same time. In an interview, Milligan told Newsarama,
[tpl]cquote|Yeah. Sorry about that. I felt pretty bad and it was quite strange, sitting on a few panels and then having a few interviews where I couldn’t actually say that I'd be writing Constantine for DCU. I have to say, though, that that didn't change what I said, which I still stand by. Namely that as far as I'm concerned, it's important that the Vertigo Constantine and the DCU Constantine are kept separate, with no cross-over things going on. The DCU Constantine has to be the guy we know and love, with his same failings—otherwise what's the point of using him? But as I'm writing him he's younger and has perhaps been through a bit less than the battered aging old sod we meet in Vertigo. Unlike my Vertigo Constantine, the guy we see in JLA Dark is definitely not married! I also said and believe that the average DC reader—Vertigo and DCU—is sophisticated enough to be able to read both versions without getting confused.[tpl]cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html |title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan |publisher=Newsarama |date=9 June 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2011 [/tpl][/tpl]
Beginning in Justice League Dark issue #9, Jeff Lemire assumed writing duties on the series, replacing Milligan who had remained on the Vertigo title. Speaking with CBR News exclusively, Lemire said he considers Justice League Dark his dream gig at DC Comics because Constantine is one of his all-time favorite characters not just in comics, but in all fiction. Lemire also teased that while Constantine, Zatanna and Deadman would remain on the roster, the team would change in his opening arc and expand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2012/01/31/jeff-lemire-takes-on-justice-league-dark DC Comics.com|title=Jeff Lemire takes on Justice League Dark|publisher=DC Comics[/tpl]

===Characterization===

Although a compassionate humanist who struggles to overcome the influence of both Heaven and Hell over humanity and despite his occasional forays into heroism, Constantine is a foul-mouthed, disillusioned, British cynic who pursues a life of sorcery and danger. His motivation has been attributed to an adrenaline addiction that only the strange and mysterious can sate. He also seems to be something of a "Weirdness Magnet" (a term also used to describe Blue Devil).
Constantine is shown to be someone with a wide and international circle of contacts and allies, and is adept at making friends. He has had many girlfriends as well, and one story mentions past boyfriends too.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article1289712.ece |title=Hellblazer’s sassy controller|work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=2009-02-15 |date=7 January 2007  | location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Smith |first=John| title=Hellblazer: Counting to Ten| issue=51| date=March 1992| year=1992| publisher= Vertigo / DC Comics|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=AfterElton.com|title=Ten Best Gay and Bisexual Science Fiction Characters|date=20 January 2008[/tpl] At the same time, his close friends inevitably suffer or are outright killed simply by being in his life; this has left a severe mark on him. In #69, when the King of Vampires killed the man next to him and casually asked if he'd been a friend, John replied "Must be. He's dead." Constantine also has a reputation as being one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world.[tpl]cite book|title=The Laughing Magician|author=Andy Diggle|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40121-853-9[/tpl]
Although being a powerful sorcerer, Constantine rarely uses magic, instead choosing to use his wits to trick his opponents. Constantine is also referred to as "The Constant One" because of his whole family tree being somewhat connected to the occult. Many of his ancestors are sorcerers from different eras of history, and somewhat has taken part in many known historical events. Some of his ancestors have roles in other works outside Hellblazer, such as Batman: The Order of Beasts, The Sandman, and Books of Magic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qusoor.com/hellblazer/familytree.htm|title=The Constantine Family Tree[/tpl]
While Constantine has worn many clothes over the years he was originally portrayed as often wearing a blue pin-stripe suit, tan trench coat and occasionally gloves.  As the series progressed his trademark attire became a grungier (or perhaps the same just older) trench coat, white shirt and black tie, but has recently returned more to his earlier fashion. Constantine smokes Silk Cut cigarettes, consuming thirty or so a day.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Ennis | first=Garth | title=Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits | publisher=Vertigo (DC Comics) | date=1 March 1994 | isbn=1-56389-150-6 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] John also occasionally breaks the fourth wall, where he talks to the reader and narrates the story himself.[tpl]cite book|title=Hellblazer: Son of Man|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=1-40120-202-0[/tpl]

===Real time aging===

Constantine is unusual among comic book characters in that he has aged in real time since his creation.[ref]
