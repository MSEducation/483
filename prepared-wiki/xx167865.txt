The Light on the Island, by Helene Glidden, recounts her early years in the lighthouse on Patos Island in Washington State's San Juan Islands. Set during Edward Durgan's eight-year term as lighthouse keeper from 1905â€“1913, it offers a child's perspective on a number of adult themes, including death, murder, strong language, and smugglers.
