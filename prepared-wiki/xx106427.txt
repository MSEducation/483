[[Lilley, Hertfordshire]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hertfordshire, Civil parishes in Hertfordshire

Lilley is a small village and civil parish in Hertfordshire which stands between Hitchin and Luton in England, on the highest ground and within some of the most striking scenery in the area. Telegraph Hill is just over 600 feet above sea level. 

The church, rebuilt in the 19th century, contains some original features and a fine Elizabethan heraldic memorial.  Lilley lies within the parliamentary constituency of Hitchin and Harpenden currently represented by Peter Lilley. It until recently had two Public Houses, The Silver Lion and The Lilley Arms.  The recent closure and conversion of the Silver Lion leaves The Lilley Arms as the village's only pub. The low-lying land to the south of Lilley is called Lilley Bottom.
The village has a football team, although they presently do not play in Lilley due to lack of facilities.  The village cricket club is one of the oldest in Hertfordshire, with fixtures dating back to the mid-1890s.  The cricket club plays at the Geoff Banks-Smith Memorial Cricket Ground, between St Peter's Church and the village hall and are currently in North Herts League Division 2.
