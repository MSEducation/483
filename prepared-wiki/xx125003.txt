==Main characters==

In writing the series both Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly agreed that the main roles needed to be female and have the funny lines.

Horgan: "There was nothing out there for me; I had to give myself a break! Peep Show has very funny female characters but they're generally girlfriends or incidental women who are just helping the story along."

Kelly: "When we were writing Pulling, we wanted to make sure the comedy was with the women. Even with comedies that are about women, it's often the blokes who get the funnies. In Pulling we even err too much the other way and make the men too two-dimensional. But it was important for the women to get the funny lines."

==Cancellation==

Despite having good ratings, very good reviews and a BAFTA nomination, the BBC did not commission a third series of the sitcom in 2007. Both  Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly claim to not know why another series was not commissioned and Dennis Kelly claims the pair "cried and threw ourselves at their feet" asking for another series. The BBC then agreed to a one hour special to at least wrap up the storylines.

==2009 episode==

First broadcast on BBC Three on 17 May 2009, this was an hour-long special intended to wrap up the storylines and bring things to a close.
Louise returns from travelling for six months with a new man in tow - she detests him but he saved her life when she nearly drowned in mud, so she stays with him out of guilt.  Karen also has a new boyfriend who has turned her into a quiet, homely girlfriend who doesn't wear make up and thinks women's rights are overrated - and before long she bumps in to ex boyfriend Billy who is very ill and is making himself feel better with drink and narcotics.  Donna is seeing a rich businessman who only cares about his money (her birthday treat is having sex on a bed laid out with £4500 in £10, £20 and £50 notes), but she is too shallow to leave him.  Karl is back from Italy with a new Italian girlfriend, and much to Donna's horror, they share an open relationship.  And lastly, Tanya and Oleg have become engaged, but they share a very volatile relationship that is based upon passion and sex.
By the end of the episode, each of the main characters reach some sort of resolution. Louise, initially distraught at having to stick with a relationship out of guilt is overjoyed when her current boyfriend ends up in a coma, and she finds contentment in doting on him. Karen is quickly tempted back to her former ways by Billy, but it is dismayed when she discovers he has been lying about being terminally ill. Nonetheless, the return to her old ways prompts her to cut ties with her current, controlling partner and in the final scene of the episode she is seen marrying Billy whilst intoxicated. Donna and Karl meanwhile make a kind of reconciliation when Donna finally dumps the arrogant Stefan and Karl's new fiance is revealed to be cheating on him.

==Home media==

Both series have been released on DVD, although the final episode has only been released as a digital download.
