==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Alperovich was born in Banda del Río Salí to Marta León, an Argentine Jew, and León Alperovich, a Russian Jew from Lithuania whose parents had settled in one of the numerous Jewish agricultural colonies in Argentina. His father relocated to Tucumán Province and later established León Alperovich S.A., one of the most important auto dealerships in Tucumán.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsigloweb.com/nota.php?id=69655|title=Murió León Alperovich, el padre del Gobernador de Tucumán|work=El Siglo[/tpl]
He enrolled at the University of Tucumán, graduated as an accountant, and married Beatriz Rojkés, with whom he had four children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contexto.com.ar/vernota.php?id=36186|title=La tucumana Beatriz de Alperovich está entre los 10 senadores más ricos|publisher=Contexto[/tpl] Alperovich was a member of the centrist Radical Civic Union until in 1999 he was approached by the then-Governor of Tucumán, Julio Miranda, to be provincial economy minister. He joined the Justicialist Party, was elected to the Senate in 2001, and as governor in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/1-55415-2011-08-29.html|title=El juramento sobre la Torá|work=Página/12[/tpl]
Some commentators had speculated that Alperovich would not be able to become governor if elected because of the provincial law that required him to give an oath on the Christian Bible. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's amendment of Tucuman's Constitution allowed Alperovich to take the oath using the Hebrew Torah, helping preventing future religious discrimination against potential candidates.
