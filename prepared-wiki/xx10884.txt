 ml = message length in bits (always a multiple of the number of bits in a character).
 <span style="color: green;">''Pre-processing:''</span>
 append the bit '1' to the message i.e. by adding 0x80 if characters are 8 bits. 
 append 0 â‰¤ k &lt; 512 bits '0', thus the resulting message length (in ''bits'')
