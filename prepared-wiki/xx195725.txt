==Plot==

The story is set in a utopia-like world made up of only women, under the benevolent rule of a woman called the Mamamega.  The Mamamega possesses a magic item called the Astro Star, which absorbs evil from the world outside the paradise they live in.  Eventually, when the Astro Star becomes saturated with evil thoughts and desires, the Mamamega has to perform a ceremony to purify the Astro Star, and then she hands over the position of Mamamega to her successor.
As the story begins, the soon-to-be Mamamega chooses Lilith as her first miko (shrine maiden) and tasks Lilith with finding two other mikos, who will serve as guards/attendants to the new Mamamega.  But as Lilith goes to try and recruit two others to help her, they cross paths with a group that has other plans for the Astro Star and wants to take over the Paradise they live in...
