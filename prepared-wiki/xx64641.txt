Relationship of Command is the third and final studio album by the post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, and was released in September 2000. The band reached mainstream success through the album, if only for a short time before their break-up in 2001.
The album combines a hardcore aggressive edge with a melodic drive and harmonious, emotive and surreal vocals and lyrics.[tpl]cite web|last=Butler |first=Blake |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/relationship-of-command-japan-bonus-tracks-r957102/review |title=Relationship of Command Bonus Tracks – At the Drive-In |publisher=AllMusic |date=September 12, 2000 |accessdate=October 17, 2011[/tpl] While the album continues in the alternative style of At the Drive-In's previous albums, Relationship of Command is seen as a more well-rounded album than its predecessors. Initially, the album was received positively by critics, and the album is now seen not only as one of the most influential post-hardcore albums of the decade[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=274771 |title=At the Drive-In – Relationship of Command – Album Review |publisher=AbsolutePunk |accessdate=October 17, 2011[/tpl] but also as one of the most accomplished recent works in the wider rock spectrum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/jjpn |title=Music - Review of At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06[/tpl] Relationship of Command was voted 12th out of 50 in the Albums of the Decade by NMENME The Story Of The Decade 10 Years In Music 21 November 2009 and the 37th most influential album of all time by Kerrang![tpl]cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:YDSA-3RVqL4J:www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/kerrang.html+relationship+of+command+kerrang&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk |title=Rocklist.net...Kerrang!

==Background==

Relationship of Command was recorded over a seven-week period starting on January 17, 2000, following a tour supporting Rage Against the Machine. The album was recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California, and was produced by Ross Robinson and mixed by Andy Wallace. Known for his unorthodox production methods, Robinson at one point took bass player Paul Hinojos for a drive in his SUV through the hills of Malibu to get his adrenaline going prior to recording. He also brought Iggy Pop to the studio for a guest appearance; Omar Rodriguez commented: "Ross had been talking to Iggy because they were gonna work together. I don’t know if they ever did, but they’d sort of been chatting, so Ross had passed him our previous records and he liked them. So, of course I brought up the idea, “Why not Iggy come and do something on the album?” Ross mentioned it to Iggy, and he was completely open to it. He came down to the studio for a whole day in which he sang "Rolodex Propaganda" and did the ransom note "Enfilade"".[tpl]cite web|title=The Class of 2000: Omar Rodriguez-Lopez on At The Drive-In’s "Relationship Of Command"|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/the_class_of_2000_omar_rodriguez-lopez_on_at_the_drive-ins_relationshi/|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl]
The album's cover artwork (including the covers for the singles "One Armed Scissor," "Invalid Litter Dept." and "Rolodex Propaganda"), illustrated by Damon Locks, all revolve around imagery of the Trojan War, and the Trojan Horse in particular.

===Legacy===

Following the release of the album, At the Drive-In gained brief mainstream critical and commercial success, with the album being their only album to reach the Billboard 200, and also appearing in critics' end-of-year lists such as the Los Angeles Times and Rolling Stone, as well as making appearances on shows such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman. However despite this success, the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001, with the members splitting to form The Mars Volta and Sparta.
In an interview with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" Rodriguez replied: "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done is the way that record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandioise thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix.  I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." The board mix of the album will be released by the band in 2013 on their 21st Chapter Records label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-omar-rodriguez-lopez-on-bosnian-rainbows-and-at-the-drive-ins-dramatic-reunion-20130502 |title=Q&A: Omar Rodriguez-Lopez on Bosnian Rainbows and At the Drive-In's Dramatic Reunion |author=Appleford, Steve |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=June 1, 2013[/tpl]
