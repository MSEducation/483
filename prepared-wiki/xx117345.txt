Violent Revolution is the tenth studio album by the German thrash metal band Kreator. It was released on September 25, 2001. After almost a decade of musical experimentation with their metal sound (starting with Renewal), with this album the band returned to their 1980s thrash metal style, although it does make use of Gothenburg metal elements.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
