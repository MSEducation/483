==Model organisms==				
Model organisms have been used in the study of SGOL1 function.

Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion.[tpl]cite journal| author=van der Weyden L, White JK, Adams DJ, Logan DW| title=The mouse genetics toolkit: revealing function and mechanism. | journal=Genome Biol | year= 2011 | volume= 12 | issue= 6 | pages= 224 | pmid=21722353 | doi=10.1186/gb-2011-12-6-224  | pmc=3218837[/tpl]  Twenty six tests were carried out on mutant mice and three significant abnormalities were observed. No homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation, and thus none survived until weaning. The remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice and a decreased regulatory T cell number was observed in male animals.
