==Corporate history==

Lycos is a university spin-off that began as a research project by Michael Loren Mauldin of Carnegie Mellon University's main Pittsburgh campus in 1994. Lycos Inc. was formed with approximately US $2 million ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|2|1994|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million today) in venture capital funding from CMGI. Bob Davis became the CEO and first employee of the new company in 1995, and concentrated on building the company into an advertising-supported web portal. Lycos enjoyed several years of growth during the 1990s and became the most visited online destination in the world in 1999, with a global presence in more than 40 countries.[tpl]cite web|last=Thackray|first=Neil|title=Lycos|url=http://www.themediabriefing.com/companies/lycos|publisher=Briefing Media LTD|accessdate=April 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Worlock|first=David|title=Paradigm Lost|url=http://www.davidworlock.com/2010/08/|accessdate=April 14, 2013|date=August 20, 2010[/tpl]
