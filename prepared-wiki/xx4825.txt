==History==

Ingvar Kamprad founded IKEA in 1943 as a mostly mail-order sales business. It began to sell furniture five years later. The first Möbel-IKÉA store was opened in Älmhult, Småland, in 1958, while the first stores outside Sweden were opened in Norway (1963) and Denmark (1969). The stores spread to other parts of Europe in the 1970s, with the first store outside Scandinavia opening in Switzerland (1973), followed by Germany (1974).
Amid a high level of success, the company's German executives accidentally opened a store in Konstanz in 1973 instead of Koblenz. Later that decade, stores opened in other parts of the world, such as Japan (1974), Australia and Hong Kong (1975), Canada (1976), and Singapore (1978).[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] IKEA further expanded in the 1980s, opening stores in countries such as France and Spain (1981), Canada (1982), Belgium (1984), the United States (1985), the United Kingdom (1987), and Italy (1989).[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The company then expanded into more countries in the 1990s and 2000s. Germany, with 44 stores, is IKEA's biggest market, followed by the United States, with 37 stores. At the end of the 2009 financial year, the IKEA group operated 267 stores in 25 countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/facts_and_figures/index.html|title= IKEA facts and Figures|publisher=ikea.com|date=|accessdate=April 2010[/tpl] The first IKEA store in Latin America opened on 17 February 2010 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikeasantodomingo.com/|title=Bienvenido a IKEA Santo Domingo|publisher=ikeasantodomingo.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias_det.php?id=232067|title=Ikea abrirá el 17 de febrero; presentan catálogo de artículos|publisher=DiarioLibre.com|date=|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] As of July 2013, the company's presence in developing countries remains minimal.

==Store design==

===Layout===

Older IKEA stores are usually very large blue buildings with yellow accents (also Sweden's national colours) and few windows. They are often designed in a one-way layout, leading customers counter clockwise along what IKEA calls "the long natural way" designed to encourage the customer to see the store in its entirety (as opposed to a traditional retail store, which allows a customer to go directly to the section where the goods and services needed are displayed). There are often shortcuts to other parts of the showroom. Newer IKEA stores, like the one in Mönchengladbach, Germany, make more use of glass, both for aesthetics and functionality. Skylights are also now common in the self-serve warehouses; natural lighting reduces energy costs, improves worker morale and gives a better impression of the product.
The sequence first involves going through furniture showrooms making note of selected items. The customer then collects a shopping cart and proceeds to an open-shelf "Market Hall" warehouse for smaller items, then visiting the "Self Serve" furniture warehouse to collect previously noted showroom products in flat pack form. Sometimes, they are directed to collect products from an external warehouse on the same site or at a site nearby after purchase. Finally, customers pay for their products at a cash register.
Today, most stores follow the same layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the cost of building a 2-level store, such as the Saarlouis, Germany and Haparanda, Sweden locations. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.
Most IKEA stores offer an "as-is" area at the end of the warehouse, just before the cash registers. Returned, damaged and formerly showcased products are displayed here and sold with a significant discount, but also with a no-returns policy. Most IKEA stores communicate the IKEA policy on environmental issues in this part of the store.  The area, which is painted red, is named according to local customs, in the United Kingdom this is referred to as "Bargain Corner", in Sweden "FYND" (Bargains) and in Denmark, "Rodebutikken" (Rummage boutique).
In Hong Kong, where shop space is limited and costly, IKEA has opened three outlets across the city, most of which have the one-way layout. They are part of shopping malls, and while being tiny compared to common store design, are huge by Hong Kong standards.
The vast majority of IKEA stores are located outside of city centres, primarily because of land cost and traffic access. Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past (the "midi" concept in the early '90s, which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with [tpl]convert|9,300|m2|ft2|abbr=on[/tpl], or a "boutique" shop in Manhattan). A new format for a full-size, city centre store was introduced with the opening of the Coventry (United Kingdom) store in December 2007.  The store has seven floors and a different flow from other Ikea stores. IKEA's Southampton store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store.  IKEA built these store in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres.http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html
Another feature of IKEA stores is their long opening hours. Many stores are in operation 24 hours a day with restocking and maintenance being carried out throughout the night. Public opening hours tend to be much longer than most other retailers, with stores open well into the evening in many countries. In the UK, almost all stores are open past 8pm and open around 9am to 10am. IKEA Saudi Arabia stores have some of the longest opening hours worldwide being open from 10am to midnight, 7 days a week. The IKEA in Paramus, USA is the only store not open on Sundays due to local laws.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ikea.com/us/en/store/paramus |title=IKEA Paramus Home Page |accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|reason=The IKEA site confirms that this store is not open, but does not say whether *all* others are open.|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Food markets===

Every store includes a restaurant serving traditional Swedish food, including potatoes with Swedish meatballs, cream sauce and lingonberry jam, although there are variations. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia the usual boiled potatoes have been switched to French fries. Besides these Swedish foods, hot dogs and drinks are also sold, along with a few varieties of the local cuisine, and beverages such as lingonberry juice. Also items such as prinsesstårta (princess cake) are sold as desserts. IKEA stores in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates serve chicken shawarma at the exit café as well as beef hot dogs, while in United Kingdom, a Quorn hot dog is available in the exit café.[tpl]cite web|title=IKEA Bistro|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/ikea_food/ikea_bistro.html|work=IKEA United Kingdom[/tpl]
In many locations, the IKEA restaurants open daily before the rest of the store and serve an inexpensive breakfast. In Canada, this breakfast includes eggs, sausage and hash browns and various add-ons like bacon and pancakes at additional costs. In the United States, the local variation serves scrambled eggs, bacon, country potatoes and choice of Swedish pancakes or French toast sticks. In the Netherlands, it consists of a croissant, a small bread roll, butter or margarine, jam, a slice of cheese, a boiled egg and coffee or tea. In Australia, it consists of hash brown, bacon, scrambled eggs, a sausage and tomato, with a vegetarian option with baked beans which omits the sausage and bacon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/au/en/store/homebush/restaurant|title=IKEA Restaurant|publisher=IKEA.com|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/au/en/store/richmond/restaurant|title=IKEA Restaurant|publisher=IKEA.com|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/au/en/store/logan/restaurant|title=IKEA Restaurant|publisher=IKEA.com|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] In Germany, this breakfast consists of two bread rolls, one slice of smoked salmon, one slice of cheese, one slice of salami, two portions of butter, one portion of jam, and coffee. Refills of coffee, tea, and soft drinks are, as is traditional in Sweden, free of charge, even in countries where this is uncommon. In Austria, IKEA restaurants offer a free refill policy for soft drinks, a practice that is otherwise unknown in Austria.
Every store also has a Swedish Food Market that, until 2011, sold branded Swedish prepared specialist foods, for example as meatballs, packages of gravy, lingonberry jam, various biscuits and crackers, as well as salmon and fish roe spread. Later IKEA replaced most of the branded foods together extended its product range with the introduction of the IKEA food label. The new label has various different foods including chocolates, meatballs, jams, pancakes, salmon and various drinks. All IKEA food products are based on Swedish recipes and traditions. The majority of the food production still takes place in Sweden by small, medium and large manufacturers, like Gunnar Dafgård AB, which make its meatballs.

===Småland===

Every store has a play area, named Småland (Swedish for small lands; it is also the Swedish province where Kamprad was born). Parents drop off their children at a gate to the playground, and pick them up after they arrive at another entrance. In some stores, parents are given free pagers by the on-site staff, which the staff can use to summon parents whose children need them earlier than expected; in others, staff summon parents through announcements over the in-store public address system.

==Products and services==

===Furniture===

Rather than being sold pre-assembled, much of IKEA's furniture is designed to be self-assembled. The company claims that this helps reduce costs and use of packaging by not shipping air; the volume of a bookcase, for example, is considerably less if it is shipped unassembled rather than assembled. This is also practical for many of the chain's European customers, where public transport is commonly used, and the flat-pack methods allowing for easier transport via public transportation.
IKEA contends that it has been a pioneering force in sustainable approaches to mass consumer culture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]. Kamprad calls this "democratic design," meaning that the company applies an integrated approach to manufacturing and design (see also environmental design). In response to the explosion of human population and material expectations in the 20th and 21st century, the company implements economies of scale, capturing material streams and creating manufacturing processes that hold costs and resource use down, such as the extensive use of MDF (medium-density fiberboard). MDF, often called "particle board", is engineered wood fibre glued under heat and pressure to create a building material of superior strength which is resistant to warp. IKEA uses cabinet-grade and furniture-grade MDF in all of its MDF products, such as PAX wardrobes and kitchen cupboards. IKEA also uses wood, plastic, and other materials for furniture and other products. The intended result is flexible, adaptable home furnishings, scalable both to smaller homes and dwellings as well as large houses.
Not all furniture is stocked at the store level, such as particular sofa colours needing to be shipped from a warehouse to the customer's home (for a delivery charge). The item can also be shipped from the warehouse to the store. Some stores charge an extra fee for this service, but not all.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2009[/tpl]

===Houses and flats===

IKEA has also expanded its product base to include flat-pack houses, in an effort to cut prices involved in a first-time buyer's home. The product, named BoKlok was launched in Sweden in 1996 in a joint venture with Skanska. Now working in the Nordic countries and in the UK, sites confirmed in England include London, Ashton-under-Lyne, Leeds, Gateshead, Warrington and Liverpool.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://shopping.guardian.co.uk/household/story/0,1587,1403793,00.html|title=Buying a house?

At the end of September 2013, the company announced that solar panel packages for houses will be sold at 17 UK stores by the end of July 2014. The decision followed a successful pilot project at the Lakeside IKEA store, whereby one photovoltaic (PV) system was sold almost every day. The panels are manufactured by a Chinese company named Hanergy Holding Group Ltd.[tpl]cite news|title=Ikea to sell solar panels in UK stores|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/30/ikea-sell-solar-panels-uk-stores|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 September 2013|author=Reuters[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/latest-appliance-ikea-solar-power-panels-060800233.html | title=The latest appliance from IKEA: Solar power panels | publisher=The Week Newspaper | date=1 October 2013 | accessdate=1 October 2013 | author=Lobello, Carmel[/tpl]

===Family Mobile===

On 8 August 2008, IKEA UK launched Family Mobile, a virtual mobile phone network, running on T-Mobile.

===Manufacturing===

Although IKEA household products and furniture are designed in Sweden, they are largely manufactured in developing countries to keep costs down. China accounts for about 2½ times as much supply as Sweden. For most of its products, the final assembly is performed by the end-user (consumer).
Swedwood, an IKEA subsidiary, handles production of all of the company's wood-based products, with the largest Swedwood factory located in Southern Poland. According to the subsidiary, over 16,000 employees across 50 different sites in 10 countries manufacture the 100 million pieces of furniture that IKEA sells annually. IKEA furniture uses the hardwood alternative particle board and Hultsfred, a factory in southern Sweden, is the company's sole supplier.[tpl]cite news|title=IKEA uses a staggering 1% of the world's wood every year|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357216/IKEA-uses-staggering-1-worlds-wood-year.html|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=6 July 2013|author=Ryan Gorman|location=London[/tpl]

===Product names===

IKEA products are identified by one-word (rarely two-word) names. Most of the names are Scandinavian in origin. Although there are some exceptions, most product names are based on a special naming system developed by IKEA.[tpl]cite web|title=The IKEA Dictionary|url=http://lar5.com/ikea/index.html|author=Lars Petrus[/tpl]
For example, DUKTIG (meaning: good, well-behaved) is a line of children's toys, OSLO is a name of a bed, BILLY (a Swedish masculine name) is a popular bookcase, DINERA (meaning: (to) dine) for tableware, KASSETT (meaning: cassette) for media storage. One range of office furniture is named EFFEKTIV (meaning: efficient, effective), SKÄRPT (meaning: sharp or clever) is a line of kitchen knives.
A notable exception is the IVAR shelving system, which dates back to the early 1970s. This item is named after the item's designer.
Some of IKEA's Swedish product names have amusing or unfortunate connotations in other languages, sometimes resulting in the names being withdrawn in certain countries. Notable examples for English include the "Jerker" computer desk (discontinued several years ago as of 2013), "Fukta" plant spray, "Fartfull" workbench,'Fartfull' workbench, 'Jerker' desk: Is Ikea hiding a grin?Chicago Sun-Times, 17 August 2004 and "Lyckhem" (meaning bliss). Kitchen legs are called FAKTUM (called AKURUM in the United States). The latest addition is the new "Askholmen" outdoor suite. Similar blunders happen with other multinational companies.[tpl]Cite news|author=From correspondents in London|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23142815-5003501,00.html|title='Lolita' bed set for girls withdrawn|publisher=News.com.au|date=1 February 2008|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Company founder Kamprad, who is dyslexic, found that naming the furniture with proper names and words, rather than a product code, made the names easier to remember.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/04/shopping.retail|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Do you speak Ikea?|first=Jon|last=Henley|date=4 February 2008|accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl] IKEA uses a sales technique called "bulla bulla" in which a bunch of items are purposefully jumbled in bins, to create the impression of volume, and therefore, inexpensiveness.

===Catalogue===

IKEA publishes an annual catalogue, first published in Swedish in 1951.[tpl]cite web|title=IKEA History|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_AU/about_ikea/the_ikea_way/history/1940_1950.html[/tpl] IKEA published 197 million catalogues in 2010, in twenty languages and sixty-one editions.

According to Canadian broadcaster, CTV, "IKEA's publications have developed an almost cult-like following online. Readers have found all kinds of strange tidbits, including mysterious cat pictures, apparent Mickey Mouse references and weird books wedged into the many shelves that clutter the catalogues."
The 2013 catalogue is smartphone compatible, containing videos and photo galleries that can be accessed via an app by scanning the catalogue's pages, while the 2014 catalog incorporates an augmented reality app that projects an item into a real-time photograph image of the user's room. The augmented reality app also provides an indication of the scale of IKEA objects in relation to the user's living environment.[tpl]cite web|title=Virtually Furnish a Room With IKEA's Augmented Reality Catalog|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/06/ikea-augmented-reality/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=6 August 2013|author=Luisa Rollenhagen|date=6 August 2013[/tpl]

===IKEA Family loyalty card===

In common with some other retailers, IKEA has launched a loyalty card called "IKEA family". The card is free of charge and can be used to obtain discounts on a special range of products found in each IKEA store. In conjunction with the card, IKEA also publishes and sells a printed quarterly magazine titled IKEA Family Live which supplements the card and catalogue. The magazine is already printed in thirteen languages and an English edition for the United Kingdom was launched in February 2007.

==Corporate structure==

IKEA is owned and operated by a complicated array of not-for-profit and for-profit corporations. The corporate structure is divided into two main parts: operations and franchising. Most of IKEA's operations, including the management of the majority of its stores, the design and manufacture of its furniture, and purchasing and supply functions are overseen by INGKA Holding, a private, for-profit Dutch company. Of the IKEA stores in 36 countries, 301 are run by the INGKA Holding. The remaining 47 stores are run by franchisees outside of the INGKA Holding, with the exception of IKEA Delft which is not franchised.[tpl]cite web|title=The IKEA franchising|url=http://franchisor.ikea.com/franchising.html[/tpl]
INGKA Holding is not an independent company, but is wholly owned by the Stichting Ingka Foundation, which Kamprad established in 1982 in the Netherlands as a tax-exempt, not-for-profit foundation. The Ingka Foundation is controlled by a five-member executive committee that is chaired by Kamprad and includes his wife and attorney.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6919139|title=IKEA: Flat-pack accounting|work=The Economist|date= 11 May 2006|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl]
While most IKEA stores operate under the direct purview of Ingka Holding and the Ingka Foundation, the IKEA trademark and concept is owned by an entirely separate Dutch company Inter IKEA Systems. Every IKEA store, including those run by Ingka Holding, pays a franchise fee of 3% of revenue to Inter IKEA Systems. The ownership of Inter IKEA Systems is exceedingly complicated and not publicly known. Inter IKEA Systems is owned by Inter IKEA Holding, a company registered in Luxembourg. Inter IKEA Holding, in turn, belongs to an identically named company in the former Netherlands Antilles that is run by a trust company based in Curaçao. In 2009 the company in Curaçao was liquidated and the company responsible for this liquidation traces back to the Interogo Foundation in Liechtenstein[tpl]cite news|url=http://svt.se/2.150075/1.2304474/granskningen_av_ikea_ett_brett_samarbetsprojekt|title=Granskningen av Ikea ett brett samarbetsprojekt|publisher=SVT.se|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl] Ingvar Kamprad has confirmed that this foundation owns Inter IKEA Holding S.A. in Luxembourg and is controlled by the Kamprad family.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://svt.se/2.150075/1.2308083/ingvar_kamprad_bekraftar_stiftelsen_i_mejl_till_tt|title=Ingvar Kamprad bekräftar stiftelsen i mejl till TT|publisher=SVT.se|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl] The IKEA food concessions that operate in IKEA stores are still directly owned by the Kamprad family and represent a major part of the family's income.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In Australia, IKEA is operated by two companies. Stores located on the East Coast including Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria are owned by INGKA Holding. Stores elsewhere in the country including South Australia and Western Australia are owned by Cebas Pty Ltd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cebas.ikea.com.au/Template3.asp?page_id=63970300051041&se_id=22&site_id=30005|title=Disclaimer|author=Cebas Pty Ltd|accessdate=10 April 2007[/tpl] Like elsewhere, all stores are operated under a franchise agreement with Inter IKEA Systems.The Economist, "The secret of IKEA's success", 24 February 2011, pp. 67–68.
In June 2013, Ingvar Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down, the 87-year-old founder explained, "I see this as a good time for me to leave the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the generation shift that has been ongoing for some years." Mathias and his two older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the corporation's overall vision and long-term strategy.[tpl]cite news|title=IKEA’s new chairman likes PAX wardrobes, and that’s about all we know|url=http://qz.com/91159/ikeas-new-chairman-likes-pax-wardrobes-and-thats-about-all-we-know/|accessdate=6 June 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=5 June 2013|author=Gina Chon[/tpl]

===Profits===

The net profit of IKEA Group (which does not include Inter IKEA systems) in fiscal year 2009 (after paying franchise fees to Inter IKEA systems) was €2.538 billion on sales of €21.846 billion. Because INGKA Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation, none of this profit is taxed. The foundation's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly, but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems.
Inter IKEA Systems collected €631 million of franchise fees in 2004, but reported pre-tax profits of only €225 million in 2004. One of the major pre-tax expenses that Inter IKEA systems reported was €590 million of "other operating charges". IKEA has refused to explain these charges, but Inter IKEA Systems appears to make large payments to I.I. Holding, another Luxembourg-registered group that, according to The Economist, "is almost certain to be controlled by the Kamprad family." I.I. Holding made a profit of €328 million in 2004.
In 2004, the Inter IKEA group of companies and I.I. Holding reported combined profits of €553m and paid €19m in taxes, or approximately 3.5 percent. In 2013 the Daily Mail media publication reported that the IKEA subsidiary Swedwood had grown between 20-25% per year since its inception in 1991.
The Berne Declaration, a non-profit organisation in Switzerland that promotes corporate responsibility, has formally criticised IKEA for its tax avoidance strategies. In 2007, the Berne Declaration nominated IKEA for one of its Public Eye "awards", which highlight corporate irresponsibility and are announced during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.evb.ch/en/p11676.html|title=Berne Declaration Public Eye Awards, 2007 Nominations[/tpl]www.evb.ch/en/index.cfm
In a company statement emailed on 14 October 2013, Ikea's full-year sales rose 3.1 percent due in part to growth in Russia and China. Ikea's revenue total rose to US$37.9 billion (27.9 billion euros), with significant growth also recorded in North America.[tpl]cite news|title=Ikea Full-Year Sales Gain 3.1% Helped by Growth in Russia, China|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-10-14/ikea-full-year-sales-gain-3-dot-1-percent-helped-by-growth-in-russia-china|accessdate=14 October 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=14 October 2013|author=Katarina Gustafsson[/tpl]

===Control by Kamprad===

Along with helping IKEA make non-taxable profit, IKEA's complicated corporate structure allows Kamprad to maintain tight control over the operations of Ingka Holding, and thus the operation of most IKEA stores. The Ingka Foundation's five-person executive committee is chaired by Kamprad. It appoints the board of Ingka Holding, approves any changes to Ingka Holding's bylaws, and has the right to preempt new share issues. If a member of the executive committee quits or dies, the other four members appoint his or her replacement.
In Kamprad's absence the foundation's bylaws include specific provisions requiring it to continue operating the Ingka Holding group and specifying that shares can be sold only to another foundation with the same objectives as the Ingka Foundation.

===Charitable giving===

The INGKA Foundation is officially dedicated to promoting "innovations in architecture and interior design." With an estimated net worth of $36 billion, the foundation is unofficially the world's largest charitable organisation, ahead of the much better known Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has a net worth of approximately $33 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/MediaCenter/FactSheet/|title=Foundation Fact Sheet|publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=9 March 2007[/tpl] However, most of the Group's profit is spent on investment; the foundation expects to spend €45 million on charitable giving in 2010 (compare the Gates Foundation, which made gifts of more than $1.5 billion in 2005.)
IKEA is involved in several international charitable causes, particularly in partnership with UNICEF, including:
IKEA also supports American Forests to restore forests and reduce pollution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/about_ikea/plant_trees.html|title=Plant Trees|publisher=IKEA|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanforests.org/planttrees/af_info.php?campaign=ikea|title=American Forests|publisher=American Forests|accessdate=27 September 2010[/tpl]

==IKEA Social Initiative==

In September 2005, IKEA Social Initiative was formed to manage the company's social involvements on a global level. IKEA Social Initiative is headed by Marianne Barner.
The main partners to IKEA Social Initiative are UNICEF[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/corporate_partners/index_25092.html|title=UNICEF's corporate partnerships|publisher=Unicef.org|accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] and Save the Children.International Save the Children Alliance[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl]
On 23 February 2009, at the ECOSOC event in New York, UNICEF announced that IKEA Social Initiative has become the agency's largest corporate partner, with total commitments of more than US$180 million.UNICEF (23 February 2009) IKEA social initiative adds $48 million to UNICEF's child health programmeReuters India (23 February 2009) Ikea gives UNICEF $48 mln to fight India child labour
Examples of involvements:
In 2009, Sweden's largest television station, SVT, revealed that IKEA's money—the three per cent collection from each store—does not actually go to a charitable foundation in the Netherlands, as IKEA has said. Inter IKEA is owned by a foundation in Liechtenstein, called Interogo, which has amassed twelve billion dollars, is controlled by the Kamprad family.

==Environmental performance==

After initial environmental issues like the highly publicized formaldehyde scandals in the early 1980s and 1992,[tpl]cite web|title=IKEA and formaldehyde|url=http://www.peterre.info/ikea/formaldehyde/|publisher=unknown (2003 to 6 February 2004)|accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Formaldehyde and other VOC's|url=http://www.ikeafans.com/forums/articles/5107-formaldehyde-other-vocs.html|publisher=By IKEAFANS.com (February 1998)|accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Eco Etiquette: Should I Freak Out About Formaldehyde In Baby Furniture?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-grayson/eco-etiquette-should-i-fr_b_814096.html#s230152title=Giggle_Harper_Crib|publisher=By Jennifer Grayson of The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=26 January 2011[/tpl] IKEA took a proactive stance on environmental issues and tried to prevent future incidents through a variety of measures.See Bartlett, Dessain, Sjöman (2006) – IKEA's Global Sourcing Challenge: Indian Rugs and Child Labour (A) in Harvard Business School In 1990, IKEA invited Karl-Henrik Robèrt, founder of the Natural Step, to address its board of directors. Robert's system conditions for sustainability provided a strategic approach to improving the company's environmental performance. In 1990, IKEA adopted the Natural Step framework as the basis for its environmental plan.Owens, Heidi (1998) IKEA: A Natural Step Case Study. Oregon Natural Step Network. Retrieved on: 6 April 2008. This led to the development of an Environmental Action Plan, which was adopted in 1992. The plan focused on structural change, allowing IKEA to "maximize the impact of resources invested and reduce the energy necessary to address isolated issues." The environmental measures taken include the following:
In 2000 IKEA introduced its code of conduct for suppliers, called the IKEA way of purchasing.... shortened to IWAY. Today IWAY is a totally integrated part of IKEA's purchasing model. IWAY covers social, safety and environmental questions. Today IKEA has around 60 IWAY auditors that performs hundreds of supplier audits every year. The main purpose with IWAY is to make sure that the IKEA suppliers follows the law in each country where they are based. Most IKEA suppliers fulfill the law today with exceptions for some special issues, one being excessive working hours in Asia, in countries such as China and India.
More recently, IKEA has stopped providing plastic bags to customers, but offers reusable bags for sale. The IKEA restaurants also only offer reusable plates, knives, forks, spoons, etc. Toilets in some IKEA WC-rooms have been outfitted with dual-function flushers. IKEA has recycling bins for compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), energy saving bulbs and batteries.
In 2001 IKEA was one of the first companies to operate its own cross-border goods trains through several countries in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.com/banverket/ikea-leads-the-way-on-deregulated-european-railways|title=Banverket – press release|publisher=Cision Wire|date=29 June 2001[/tpl]
In August 2008, IKEA also announced that it had created IKEA GreenTech, a €50 million venture capital fund. Located in Lund (a college town in Sweden), it will invest in 8–10 companies in the coming five years with focus on solar panels, alternative light sources, product materials, energy efficiency and water saving and purification. The aim is to commercialise green technologies for sale in IKEA stores within 3–4 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://futurethinktank.com/2008/08/07/ikea-sets-its-sights-on-the-sun/|title=IKEA Sets its Sights on the Sun|publisher=Futurethinktank.com (futurethink's innovation weblog)|date=7 August 2008|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greenvc.org/ikea_greentech/|title=IKEA GreenTech|publisher=Green VC|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl]
In order to make IKEA a more sustainable company, a product life cycle was created. For the idea stage, products should be flat-packed so that more items can be shipped at once; products should also be easier to dismantle and recycle. Raw materials are used, and since wood and cotton are two of IKEA's most important manufacturing products, the company works with environmentally friendly forests and cotton, whereby the excessive use of chemicals and water is avoided.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Manufacturing is third in the life cycle and includes IWAY, IKEA's code of conduct for manufactures and suppliers that formulates and enforces requirements for working conditions, social and environmental standards, and what suppliers can expect from IKEA in return. Marketing is another part of IKEA's life cycle and a portion of the paper used for its catalogues is sourced from responsibly managed forests. The catalogue is also smaller, so that less paper is required, less waste is produced and more catalogues can be shipped per load.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
IKEA stores recycle waste and many run on renewable energy with the use of energy-saving bulbs and sensors. All employees are trained in environmental and social responsibility, while public transit is one of the priorities when the location of stores is considered. Also, the coffee served at IKEA stores is certified organic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The last stage of the life cycle is the end of life. Most IKEA stores recycle light bulbs and drained batteries, and the company is also exploring the recycling of sofas and other home furnishing products. According to IKEA's 2012 "Sustainability Report", 23%, of all wood that the company uses meets the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council, and the report states that IKEA aims to double this percentage by 2017. The report also states that IKEA does not accept illegally logged wood and supports 13 World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) projects.
On 17 February 2011, IKEA announced its plans to develop a wind farm in Dalarna County, Sweden, furthering its goal of using only renewable energy to fuel its operations.[tpl]cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20032930-54.html|title=(IKEA building its own personal wind farm)|publisher=CNET|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=17 February 2011[/tpl] As of June 2012, 17 United States (US) IKEA stores are powered by solar panels, with 22 additional installations in progress.[tpl]cite web|title=IKEA U.S. Solar Plans near 89% with Two More Installations Proposed; Distribution Centers in Perryville, MD and Westampton, NJ Will Be among Country's Largest Projects|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ikea-us-solar-plans-near-89-with-two-more-installations-proposed-distribution-centers-in-perryville-md-and-westampton-nj-will-be-among-countrys-largest-projects-2012-06-12|publisher=Business Wire|date=Jue 12, 2012[/tpl]
In 2011, the company examined its wood consumption and noticed that almost half of its global pine and spruce consumption was for the fabrication of pallets. The company consequently started a transition to the use of paper pallets and the "Optiledge system".[tpl]cite web|title=IKEA Phases Out Wood Pallets|url=http://packagingrevolution.net/ikea-phases-out-wood-pallets/|publisher=Packaging Revolution|date=3 November 2011[/tpl] The OptiLedge product is totally recyclable, made from 100% virgin high-impact copolymer polypropylene (PP). The system is a "unit load alternative to the use of a pallet. The system consists of the OptiLedge (usually used in pairs), aligned and strapped to the bottom carton to form a base layer upon which to stack more product. Corner boards are used when strapping to minimize the potential for package compression." The conversion began in Germany and Japan, before its introduction into the rest of Europe and North America.[tpl]cite web|title=The OptiLedge Offers Efficiencies for International Shipments|url=http://packagingrevolution.net/the-optiledge-offers-efficiencies-for-international-shipments/|publisher=Packaging Revolution|date=8 December 2011[/tpl] The system has been marketed to other companies, and IKEA has formed the OptiLedge company to manage and sell the product.[tpl]cite web|title=OptiLedge|url=http://www.optiledge.com/|publisher=Inter IKEA Systems B.V.|year=2012[/tpl]

==Negative community impact==

IKEA's goals of sustainability and environmental design in their merchandise have sometimes been at odds with the impact a new IKEA store can have on a community.

==Criticisms==

===Accusation of price gouging===

The company has also been criticised by Citytv in Canada for charging as much as twice the price in their Canadian stores for the same items sold in their American stores, this despite the Canadian dollar reaching parity with the U.S. dollar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_16470.aspx/|title=CityNews: "Ikea confronted over Canadian–U.S. price differences"|date=5 November 2007|accessdate=19 June 2008[/tpl]

===Biased branding and advertising accusations===

===Errors and recalls===

===Labor issues===

====Use of forced labor, 1980s====

During the 1980s, IKEA kept its costs down by using production facilities in East Germany. A portion of the workforce at the factories used consisted of political prisoners. This fact, revealed in a report by Ernst & Young commissioned by the company, resulted from intermingling of criminals and political dissidents in the state-owned production facilities IKEA contracted with, a practice which was generally known in West Germany. IKEA was one of a number of companies, including West German firms, which benefited from this practice. The investigation resulted from attempts by former political prisoners to obtain compensation. In November 2012, IKEA admitted being aware at the time of the possibility of use of forced labor and failing to exercise sufficient rigor to identify and avoid it. A summary of the Ernst & Young report was released on 16 November 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Ikea Admits Forced Labor Was Used in 1980s|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/business/global/ikea-to-report-on-allegations-of-using-forced-labor-during-cold-war.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 November 2012|author=Nicholas Kulish|author2=Julia Werdigier[/tpl]

===Verdana typeface===

In 2009 IKEA caused a flap in the graphic design world when it changed the typeface used in its catalogue from Futura to Verdana, expressing a desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography.http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/verdanagate.php – "Verdanagate," by "Armin" in "Brand New" blog, 31 August 2009
Time magazine and The Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and designers.http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1919127,00.html – The Font War: Ikea Fans Fume over Verdana.

IKEA launched a UK-wide "Home is the Most Important Place in the World" advertising campaign in September 2007 using estate agent signs with the term "Not For Sale" written on them as part of the wider campaign. After the campaign appeared in the Metro newspaper London the business news website www.mad.co.uk remarked that the IKEA campaign had amazing similarities with the marketing activity of UK home refurbishment company Onis living who had launched their own Not For Sale advertising campaign[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onisliving.co.uk/about-onis/not-for-sale.html|title=Our award winning campaign | Onis Home Refurbishments|publisher=Onisliving.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl] two years prior and was awarded the Interbuild 2006 Construction Marketing Award for best campaign under £25,000.http://www.constructionmarketingawards.com/testimonials.html [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl]
A debate ensued between Fraser Patterson, Chief Executive of Onis and Andrew McGuinness, partner at Beattie McGuinness Bungay (BMB), the advertising and PR agency awarded the £12m IKEA account.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mad.co.uk/BreakingNews/BreakingNews/Articles/bd5d7deae8ff43a0bbd83f8a9dc15ff3/Ikea-campaign-attracts-copycat-claims.html|title=Ikea campaign attracts copycat claims|publisher=Mad.co.uk|date=21 September 2007|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/business/businessnews/display.var.1741413.0.ikeas_new_marketing_campaign_remarkably_similar_to_strategy_used_by_scotsled_firm.php|title=Ikea's new marketing campaign 'remarkably similar' to strategy used by Scots-led firm|publisher=Sundayherald.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011011621/http://www.sundayherald.com/business/businessnews/display.var.1741413.0.ikeas_new_marketing_campaign_remarkably_similar_to_strategy_used_by_scotsled_firm.php|archivedate=11 October 2007[/tpl] The essence of the debate was that BMB claimed to be unaware of Onis's campaign as Onis were not an advertising agency. Onis's argument was that their advertising could be seen in prominent landmarks throughout London, having been already accredited, showing concern about the impact IKEA's campaign would have on the originality of their own.
After some negotiations BMB and IKEA agreed to provide Onis with a feature page on the IKEA campaign site linking through to Onis's .co.uk site, for a period of 1 year. Onis is possibly the only company to have ever been advertised by IKEA in such a fashion. In 2008, Onis Homes limited was placed into voluntary liquidation and the website www.onishome.com closed.
The Intellectual Property and trading rights of Onis Homes Limited were later purchased by new shareholders with the strategy to grow the Onis brand throughout the U.K. as a one stop shop home refurbishment franchise using the trading name Onis living.
In 2008, IKEA paired up with the makers of popular video game The Sims 2 to make a stuff pack called The Sims 2 IKEA Home Stuff, featuring many IKEA products. It was released on 24 June 2008 in North America and 26 June 2008 in Europe. It is the second stuff pack with a major brand, the first being The Sims 2 H&M Fashion Stuff, which are both coincidentally companies of Swedish origin.

In April 2011, an advertising campaign for which aims to discover whether men or women are messier in the home launched. Created by Mother, the campaign will begin with a TV advert shot in front of a live audience, featuring four stand-up comedians, two men and two women, having the debate over which gender is the messiest. The strategy behind the campaign is that domestic clutter leads to arguments, leading to an unhappy home, which IKEA wants to prove can be avoided with better storage. Viewers will be directed to a new Facebook page for the brand, where they are able to vote as to who they believe is the messiest, and submit proof using videos and photos through an app created especially for the campaign. Meanwhile, online display banners will allow off users the opportunity to vote, with online adverts promoting Ikea products also demonstrating the problems people have shared, and offering solutions.
Anna Crona, marketing director at IKEA United Kingdom and Ireland, explained: "We are committed to understanding how our customers live life at home so we can provide solutions to make life happier. Everybody has storage needs in the home and by encouraging debate and providing solutions we will show that IKEA is relevant to everybody, no matter what your home is like or how much money you have." Press adverts will also support the campaign, as will a handbook entitled "Peace, Love and Storage", which will be available through the Facebook site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletin/brandrepublicnewsbulletin/article/1063045/ikea-rolls-battle-sexes-campaign/|title=Ikea rolls out battle of the sexes campaign – Brand Republic News|publisher=Brandrepublic.com|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl]
