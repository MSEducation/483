SimSafari is a construction and management simulation game almost identical to SimPark, except that the park is set in Africa rather than in North America, and therefore has African animals and plants. It was created by Maxis, partly as an educational tool for children to learn about environmental balance. It was first released on March 15, 1998.

==Gameplay==

Unlike SimPark, the game is divided into three different zones, the nature park, the tourist grounds and the African village. The ultimate aim is for the players' park to reach five stars, although like most Sims games the player can continue playing indefinitely. To gain five stars, the player needs to make sure each zone is being run properly. The player can control tourism and staff.
The game had a paragraph of information on every species in it, with short animations for the animals. Scenarios included one where the park is overrun by rabbits and another where the camp is burned down. To contain rabbits, one must place many animals that prey on rabbits, or catch them all in nets. To contain fire, the player must bulldoze around it to keep it from spreading.
It gained moderate reviews.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]

==Park==

The park was where the player could buy animals and made sure they were not being over-eaten or underfed. The player can control the species of animals, grasses, shrubs and trees that were built here. Natural disasters could happen like fires, droughts, locusts, and twisters.

==Camp==

The Camp, also known as the Tourist Ground, was where tourists stayed. The player can build restaurants, hotels, swimming pools, cottages, tents, etc. for guests. The buildings were staffed by workers hired from the village.

==Village==

The player had the least control over the village because it was up to the AI to decide what to build. In the village the player could hire drivers, naturalists, guides, cooks and attendants to staff your tourist grounds. The more staff was hired, the better the village did and if the player didn't hire staff the village would begin poaching your park's animals. If things went very badly, the village might even stop working for you altogether.
