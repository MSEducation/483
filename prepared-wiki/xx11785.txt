CATEGORIES: Wine, Fermented beverages

Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.[tpl]cite book |title=Vintage: The Story of Wine |last=Johnson |first=H. |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-79182-6 |pages=11‚Äì6 [/tpl] Yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, terroir and subsequent appellation, along with human intervention in the overall process.
Wine is a psychoactive drug, as are all alcoholic beverages,[tpl]cite web|title=Drugs info - alcohol|url=http://www.drugscience.org.uk/drugs-info/alcohol/[/tpl] commonly used for its intoxicating effects today and throughout history. The psychoactive effects of wine are evident at the normal serving size.[tpl]cite web|title=BAC per Drink tables|url=http://attorneydwi.com/bacperdrink.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Effects At Specific B.A.C.

Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, rice wine, pomegranate wine, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine. The term "wine" can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified beverages having higher alcohol content, such as barley wine, huangjiu, or sake.
Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred [tpl]c.|6000[/tpl]¬†BC in Georgia.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Keys |title=Now that's what you call a real vintage: professor unearths 8,000-year-old wine |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20111005120059/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html |work=The Independent |date=28 December 2003 |accessdate=20 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Mark |last=Berkowitz |title=World's Earliest Wine |url=http://www.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/wine.html |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |journal=Archaeology |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=1996 |accessdate=25 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Cultures of The World Georgia|last1=Spilling |first1=Michael |last2=Wong |first2=Winnie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-7614-3033-9 |page=128 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] It had reached the Balkans by [tpl]c.|4500[/tpl]¬†BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece and Rome.
From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. Red wine was closely associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians, who, according to Plutarch, avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC Saite dynasty, "thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods".[tpl]cite web | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html | title = Isis & Osiris | publisher = University of Chicago[/tpl] The Greek cult and mysteries of Dionysus, carried on by the Romans in their Bacchanalia, were the origins of western theater. Judaism incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in its Eucharist, while alcohol consumption was forbidden in Islam.

==Etymology==

The English word "wine" comes from the Proto-Germanic *winam, an early borrowing from the Latin vinum, "wine" or "(grape) vine", itself derived from the Proto-Indo-European stem *win-o- (cf. Hittite: wiyana; Lycian: oino; Ancient Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Œø·º∂ŒΩŒøœÇ[/tpl] oinos; Aeolic Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|œùŒø·øñŒΩŒøœÇ[/tpl] woinos, Armenian: gini).[tpl]OEtymD|wine[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Whiter |first=Walter |encyclopedia=Etymologicon Magnum, Or Universal Etymological Dictionary, on a New Plan |title=Wine |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SRPVgBfSrdMC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=foinos+wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |year=1800 |publisher=Francis Hodson |pages=145[/tpl][tpl]LSJ|oi)[tpl]=[/tpl]nos1|Œø·º∂ŒΩŒøœÇ|ref[/tpl].
The earliest attested terms referring to wine are the Mycenaean Greek [tpl]lang|gmy|êÄïêÄ∂êÄ∫êÑÄêÄöêÄ∫[/tpl] me-tu-wo ne-wo (*[tpl]lang|grc|ŒºŒ≠Œ∏œÖœùŒøœÇ ŒΩŒ≠œù·ø≥[/tpl]),Found on the PY Fr 1202 tablet.Cf.

Some scholars have noted the similarities between the words for wine in Kartvelian (e.g. Georgian ·É¶·Éï·Éò·Éú·Éù [tpl]IPA-ka|…£vin…î|[/tpl]), Indo-European languages (e.g. Armenian gini, Latin vinum, Ancient Greek Œø·º∂ŒΩŒøœÇ, Russian –≤–∏–Ω–æ [tpl]IPA-ru|vino|[/tpl]), and Semitic (*wayn), pointing to the possibility of a common origin of the word denoting "wine" in these language families.Benjamin W.

Wines from other fruits, such as apples and berries, are usually named after the fruit from which they are produced combined with the word "wine" (for example, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine or country wine (not to be confused with the French term vin de pays). Besides the grape varieties traditionally used for winemaking, most fruits naturally lack either a high amount of fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.
Other wines, such as barley wine and rice wine (e.g. sake), are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer  more than wine, while ginger wine is fortified with brandy. In these latter cases, the term "wine" refers to the similarity in alcohol content rather than to the production process.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avbc.com/news/BW.html |title=Barley Wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |last=Allen |first=Fal |publisher=Anderson Valley Brewing Company |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227015623/http://www.avbc.com/news/BW.html  |archivedate = 27 February 2008[/tpl] The commercial use of the English word "wine" (and its equivalent in other languages) is protected by law in many jurisdictions.[tpl]cite book |last=George |first=Rosemary |title=The Simon & Schuster Pocket Wine Label Decoder |year=1991 |publisher=Fireside |isbn=978-0-671-72897-7[/tpl]

==History==

Archaeological evidence has established the earliest-known production of wine from fermenting grapes during the late Neolithic or early Chalcolithic in the Caucasus and the northern edge of the Middle East. An extensive gene-mapping project in 2006 analyzed the heritage of more than 110 modern grape cultivars, narrowing their origin to a region of Georgia.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=David | last=Keys | date=28 December 2003 | title=Now that's what you call a real vintage: professor unearths 8,000-year-old wine[/tpl] This matches the earliest discovered sites containing shards of wine-stained pottery, dated to [tpl]c.|6000[/tpl]¬†BC in Georgia, and [tpl]c.|5000[/tpl]¬†BC in Iran.[tpl]cite news |first=Amy |last=Ellsworth|title=7,000 Year-old Wine Jar |url=http://www.penn.museum/blog/collection/125th-anniversary-object-of-the-day/7000-year-old-wine-jar-object-of-the-day-24/ |work=The Penn Musium |date=18 July 2012[/tpl] The jars at the northwestern Iranian site already showed treatment with preservative turpentine pine resin, the flavoring of modern retsina.

A 2003 report by archaeologists indicates a possibility that grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented beverages in China in the early years of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/51/17593.full?sid=deed5ba2-d55a-40a6-89f0-e4051226b236 | title=Fermented beverages of pre- and proto-historic China | publisher=The National Academy of Sciences | work=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | author=Patrick E.

The spread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the Phoenicians who spread outward from a base of city-states along the Lebanese and Israeli coast.McGovern, Patrick E. 2003. Ancient wine: the search for the origins of viniculture. Princeton University Press The wines of Byblos were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean. Evidence includes two Phoenician shipwrecks from 750 BC discovered by Robert Ballard, whose cargo of wine was still intact.MIT technology helps map ancient Phoenician shipwrecks MIT press release. As the first great traders in wine (cherem), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from oxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin, again similar to retsina.
Literary references to wine are abundant in Homer (8th century BC, but possibly relating earlier compositions), Alkman (7th century BC), and others. In ancient Egypt, six of 36 wine amphoras were found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun bearing the name "Kha'y", a royal chief vintner. Five of these amphoras were designated as originating from the king's personal estate, with the sixth from the estate of the royal house of Aten.[tpl]cite book | author=Johnson, Hugh | title=Vintage: The Story of Wine | page=32 | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1989 | isbn=0-671-68702-6[/tpl] Traces of wine have also been found in central Asian Xinjiang in modern-day China, dating from the second and first millennia BC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sytu.edu.cn/zhgjiu/u5-2.htm |title=Wine Production in China |accessdate=25 June 2008 |last=Rong |first=Xu Gan |coauthors=Bao Tong Fa |work=Grandiose Survey of Chinese Alcoholic Drinks and Beverages[/tpl]
The first known mention of grape-based wines in India is from the late 4th-century BC writings of Chanakya, the chief minister of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.

==Grape varieties==

Wine is usually made from one or more varieties of the European species Vitis vinifera, such as Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay and Merlot. When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a "varietal" as opposed to a "blended" wine. Blended wines are not considered inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of winemaking; some of the world's most highly regarded wines, from regions like Bordeaux and the Rhone Valley, are blended from different grape varieties.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
Wine can also be made from other species of grape or from hybrids, created by the genetic crossing of two species. V. labrusca (of which the Concord grape is a cultivar), V. aestivalis, V. ruprestris, V. rotundifolia and V. riparia are native North American grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.
Hybridization is different from grafting. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European V. vinifera vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to phylloxera, a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in Argentina, the Canary Islands and Chile‚Äîthe only places not yet exposed to the insect.[tpl]cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course: A Guide to the World of Wine |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=978-0-7892-0883-5 |page=97[/tpl]
In the context of wine production, terroir is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma and taste influences of their unique terroir.[tpl]cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |coauthors=Jancis Robinson |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |pages=22‚Äì23[/tpl] However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production techniques such as micro-oxygenation, tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film evaporation,
and spinning cones.[tpl]cite web |url=http://winegeeks.com/articles/85 |title=High Alcohol is a Wine Fault... Not a Badge of Honor |accessdate=25 June 2008 |last=Citriglia |first=Matthew |date=14 May 2006 |publisher=GeekSpeak, LLC[/tpl]

==Classification==

Regulations govern the classification and sale of wine in many regions of the world. European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. Bordeaux, Rioja and Chianti), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. Pinot noir and Merlot). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley in California; Willamette Valley in Oregon; Columbia Valley in Washington; Barossa Valley in South Australia and Hunter Valley in New South Wales; Luj√°n de Cuyo in Argentina; Central Valley in Chile; Vale dos Vinhedos in Brazil; Hawke's Bay and Marlborough in New Zealand; and Okanagan Valley and Niagara Peninsula in Canada.
Some blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by trademark law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, Meritage (sounds like "heritage") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, but may also include Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. Commercial use of the term Meritage is allowed only via licensing agreements with the Meritage Association.

===European classifications===

France has various appellation systems based on the concept of terroir, with classifications ranging from Vin de Table ("table wine") at the bottom, through Vin de Pays and Appellation d'Origine Vin D√©limit√© de Qualit√© Sup√©rieure (AOVDQS), up to Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) or similar, depending on the region.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.terroir-france.com/wine/rates.htm |title=Wine classification |accessdate=22 June 2007 |work=French Wine Guide[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wineanorak.com/terroir2.htm |title=Terroir revisited: towards a working definition |accessdate=22 June 2007 |last=Goode |first=Jamie[/tpl] Portugal has developed a system resembling that of France and, in fact, pioneered this concept in 1756 with a royal charter creating the Demarcated Douro Region and regulating the production and trade of wine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.250rdd.utad.pt/en/index.html |title=The Spirit of the Commemorations |accessdate=25 June 2008[/tpl] Germany created a similar scheme in 2002, although it has not yet achieved the authority of the other countries' classification systems.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.germanwinesociety.org/wine_classification.htm |title=About German Wine |accessdate=22 June 2007 |work=German wine society [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/germanylawsandclassifications.shtml |title=German Wine Guide: Wine Laws and Classifications |accessdate=22 June 2007 |work=The Winedoctor[/tpl] Spain, Greece and Italy have classifications based on a dual system of region of origin and product quality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.winesfromspain.com/icex/cda/controller/pageGen/0,3346,1549487_4938361_4938888_1_-1,00.html |title=Land of wines |accessdate=17 July 2007 |work=Wines from Spain[/tpl]

===Beyond Europe===

New World wines‚Äîthose made outside the traditional wine regions of Europe‚Äîare usually classified by grape rather than by terroir or region of origin, although there have been unofficial attempts to classify them by quality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nicks.com.au/Index.aspx?link_id=76.907 |title=Towards an Australian Wine Classification |last=Chlebnikowski |first=Simon |coauthors=Alex Chlebnikowski |accessdate=26 June 2008 |publisher=Nicks Wine Merchants[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.camwheeler.com/wine/2005/langtons-australian-wine-classification-iv/ |title=Langton's Australian Wine Classification IV |accessdate=26 June 2008 |date=27 July 2007[/tpl]

==Vintages==

A "vintage wine" is made from grapes that were all or mostly grown in a particular year, and labeled as such. Some countries allow a vintage wine to include a small portion that is not from the labeled vintage. Variations in a wine's character from year to year can include subtle differences in color, palate, nose, body and development. High-quality wines can improve in flavor with age if properly stored.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica |title=wine |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106005/wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online[/tpl] Consequently, it is not uncommon for wine enthusiasts and traders to save bottles of an especially good vintage wine for future consumption.
In the United States, for a wine to be vintage-dated and labeled with a country of origin or American Viticultural Area (AVA) (e.g. Sonoma Valley), 95% of its volume must be from grapes harvested in that year.Title 27 of the United States Code, Code of Federal Regulations ¬ß4.27 If a wine is not labeled with a country of origin or AVA the percentage requirement is lowered to 85%.
Vintage wines are generally bottled in a single batch so that each bottle will have a similar taste. Climate's impact on the character of a wine can be significant enough to cause different vintages from the same vineyard to vary dramatically in flavor and quality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.frenchscout.com/wine-vintages |title=Wine vintages, vintage charts |accessdate=26 June 2008 |last=Breton |first=F√©licien |publisher=French Scout[/tpl] Thus, vintage wines are produced to be individually characteristic of the particular vintage and to serve as the flagship wines of the producer. Superior vintages from reputable producers and regions will often command much higher prices than their average ones. Some vintage wines (e.g. Brunello), are only made in better-than-average years.
For consistency, non-vintage wines can be blended from more than one vintage, which helps winemakers sustain a reliable market image and maintain sales even in bad years.[tpl]cite news |first=Clive |last=Platman |title=Wine: Lovely bubbly |date=2 October 2002 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BPOC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F671027250245CB&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |work =Birmingham Post |accessdate=26 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |date=May 2006 |title=Change to Vintage Date Requirements (2005R-212P) |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |issue=84 |url=http://regulations.justia.com/view/43285/ |accessdate=26 June 2008 |page=25748 |author=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau[/tpl] One recent study suggests that for the average wine drinker, the vintage year may not be as significant for perceived quality as had been thought, although wine connoisseurs continue to place great importance on it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.liquidasset.com/WEILVDQS.PDF |format=PDF|title=Parker v.

==Tasting==

Wine tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and spices. The sweetness of wine is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. Dry wine, for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar.
Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine "breathe" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. Decanting (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.[tpl]cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |coauthors=Jancis Robinson |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46[/tpl]
During aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often "relaxes" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor. Older wines generally "fade" (lose their character and flavor intensity) with extended aeration.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fruity character and breathing times | date=18 September 2005 | publisher= | url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:KLSC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10CBABDF8E627AD8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 | work =New Straits Times | pages = | accessdate =24 October 2007 | language = [/tpl] Despite these general rules, breathing does not necessarily benefit all wines. Wine may be tasted as soon as the bottle is opened to determine how long it should be aerated, if at all.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
When tasting wine, individual flavors may also be detected, due to the complex mix of organic molecules (e.g. esters and terpenes) that grape juice and wine can contain. Experienced tasters can distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape and flavors that result from other factors in winemaking.

The ideal temperature for serving a particular wine is a matter of debate, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally enhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at "cellar temperature" ([tpl]convert|13|C|F|disp=sqbr[/tpl]). Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees.  Red wines are generally perceived best when served chambr√© ("at room temperature"). However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room‚Äîoften around ([tpl]convert|21|C|F|disp=sqbr[/tpl])‚Äîbut rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly cooler than the dining room itself.  Pinot noir should be brought to the table for serving at ([tpl]convert|16|C|F|disp=sqbr[/tpl]) and will reach its full bouquet at ([tpl]convert|18|C|F|disp=sqbr[/tpl]).

==Collecting==

Outstanding vintages from the best vineyards may sell for thousands of dollars per bottle, though the broader term "fine wine" covers those typically retailing in excess of US$30‚Äì50.For example, Berry Brothers & Rudd, one of the world's largest dealers, start "fine wine" prices at about ¬£25‚Äîin March 2009 with a wine from Au Bon Climat website "Fine wine offers". "Investment wines" are considered by some to be Veblen goods: those for which demand increases rather than decreases as their prices rise. 
Particular selections have higher value, such as "Verticals", in which a range of vintages of a specific grape and vineyard, are offered. The most notable was a Chateau d'Yquem 135 year vertical containing every vintage from 1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5 million.
The most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux and Burgundy; cult wines from Europe and elsewhere; and vintage port. Characteristics of highly collectible wines include:
Investment in fine wine has attracted those who take advantage of their victims' relative ignorance of this wine market sector.economist.com Fine-wine fraud.

The methodology includes persons 15 years of age or older.http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf

==Uses==

Wine is a popular and important beverage that accompanies and enhances a wide range of European cuisines, from the simple and traditional to the most sophisticated and complex. Wine is important in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes. Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5%‚Äì14.5% range.[tpl]cite book |author=Jancis Robinson |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] See alcoholic strength at p. 10. Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.

==Religious significance==

===Ancient religions===

The use of wine in religious ceremonies is common to many cultures and regions. Libations often included wine, and the religious mysteries of Dionysus used wine as a sacramental entheogen to induce a mind-altering state.

===Judaism===

Wine is an integral part of Jewish laws and traditions. The Kiddush is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat. On Pesach (Passover) during the Seder, it is a Rabbinic obligation of adults to drink four cups of wine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm |title=Pesach: Passover |last=Rich |first=Tracey R |work=Judaism 101[/tpl] In the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem, the libation of wine was part of the sacrificial service.[tpl]cite book |last=Neusner |first=Jacob |title=The Halakhah: An Encyclopaedia of the Law of Judaism |publisher=BRILL |year=2000 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XThbHMAHbNAC |isbn=90-04-11617-6[/tpl] Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol of blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the blood libel. 
"It has been one of history's cruel ironies that the blood libel‚Äîaccusations against Jews using the blood of murdered gentile children for the making of wine and matzot‚Äîbecame the false pretext for numerous pogroms. And due to the danger, those who live in a place where blood libels occur are halachically exempted from using red wine, lest it be seized as "evidence" against them."[tpl]cite web|last=Rutman|first=Rabbi Yisrael|title=Pesach: What We Eat and Why We Eat It|url=http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/passover/pesacheat.html|publisher=Project Genesis Inc.|accessdate=14 April 2013[/tpl]

===Christianity===

In Christianity, wine is used in a sacred rite called the Eucharist, which originates in the Gospel account of the Last Supper (Gospel of Luke 22:19) describing Jesus sharing bread and wine with his disciples and commanding them to "do this in remembrance of me." Beliefs about the nature of the Eucharist vary among denominations (see Eucharistic theologies contrasted).
While some Christians consider the use of wine from the grape as essential for the validity of the sacrament, many Protestants also allow (or require)  pasteurized grape juice as a substitute. Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. Methodist dentist and prohibitionist Thomas Bramwell Welch applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of grape juice. Some Christians who were part of the growing temperance movement pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree.[tpl]cite news |title=Almost Like Wine |date=3 September 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824374,00.html |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=26 June 2008[/tpl] There remains an ongoing debate between some American Protestant denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary beverage, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.

===Islam===

Alcoholic beverages, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of Islamic law.[tpl]cite news |first=Frances |last=Harrison |title=Alcohol fatwa sparks controversy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7342425.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl] Iran had previously had a thriving wine industry that disappeared after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.[tpl]cite news |first=Robert |last=Tait |title=End of the vine |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/12/worlddispatch.iran |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=12 October 2005 |accessdate=26 June 2008 |location=London[/tpl] In Greater Persia, mey (Persian wine) was a central theme of poetry for more than a thousand years, long before the advent of Islam. Some Alevi sects use wine in their religious services.
Certain exceptions to the ban on alcohol apply. Alcohol derived from a source other than the grape (or its byproducts) and the dateSahih Muslim Book 043, Hadith Number 7186. is allowed in "very small quantities" (loosely defined as a quantity that does not cause intoxication) under the Sunni Hanafi madhab, for specific purposes (such as medicines), where the goal is not intoxication. However, modern Hanafi scholars regard alcohol consumption as totally forbidden.Alcohol based Perfumes, Deodrants and Creams, Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam, Darul Iftaa, Leicester

==Health effects==

Although excessive alcohol consumption has adverse health effects, epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that moderate consumption of alcohol and wine is statistically associated with a decrease in cardiovascular illness such as heart failure.[tpl]cite journal |last= Lindberg |first= Matthew L. |coauthors= Ezra A. Amsterdam |title= Alcohol, wine, and cardiovascular health |journal= Clinical Cardiology |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=347‚Äì51 |year=2008 |pmid=18727003 |doi=10.1002/clc.20263[/tpl] Additional news reports on the French paradox also back the relationship.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Journal of Consumer Marketing |year=1994 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=17‚Äì24 |title= The impact of media stories concerning health issues on food product sales: management planning and responses |last=Dodd |first= Tim H. |coauthors=Steve Morse |doi=10.1108/07363769410058894[/tpl]
This paradox concerns the comparatively low incidence of coronary heart disease in France despite relatively high levels of saturated fat in the traditional French diet. Some epidemiologists suspect that this difference is due to the higher consumption of wines by the French, but the scientific evidence for this theory is limited. Because the average moderate wine drinker is likely to exercise more often, to be more health conscious, and to be from a higher educational and socioeconomic background, the association between moderate wine drinking and better health may be related to confounding factors or represent a correlation rather than cause and effect.
Population studies have observed a J-curve association between wine consumption and the risk of heart disease: heavy drinkers have an elevated risk, while moderate drinkers (up to 20g of alcohol per day, approximately [tpl]convert|120|ml|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of 13% ABV wine) have a lower risk than non-drinkers. Studies have also found that moderate consumption of other alcoholic beverages may be cardioprotective, although the association is considerably stronger for wine.[tpl]Cite pmid|19406740[/tpl] Additionally, some studies have found greater health benefits for red than white wine, though other studies have found no difference. Red wine contains more polyphenols than white wine, and these are thought to be particularly protective against cardiovascular disease.

To benefit fully from resveratrol in wine, it is recommended to sip slowly when drinking. Due to inactivation in the gut and liver, most of the resveratrol consumed while drinking red wine does not reach the blood circulation. However, when sipping slowly, absorption via the mucous membranes in the mouth can result in up to 100 times the blood levels of resveratrol."Health Secrets of Red Wine Uncovered", Forbes, 06.11.2009
Red wines from the south of France and from Sardinia in Italy have been found to have the highest levels of procyanidins, compounds in grape seeds thought to be responsible for red wine's heart benefits.

==Forgery and manipulation of wines==

Incidents of fraud, such as mislabeling the origin or quality of wines, have resulted in regulations on labeling. "Wine scandals" that have received media attention include:

==Packaging==

Most wines are sold in glass bottles and sealed with corks (50% of which come from Portugal).J. L. CALHEIROS E MENESES, President, Junta Nacional da Corti√ßa, Portugal. "The cork industry in Portugal" An increasing number of wine producers have been using alternative closures such as screwcaps and synthetic plastic "corks". Although alternative closures are less expensive and prevent cork taint, they have been blamed for such problems as excessive reduction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
Some wines are packaged in thick plastic bags within corrugated fiberboard boxes, and are called "box wines", or "cask wine". Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine oxidizes more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.
Environmental considerations of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. And, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.Muzaurieta, Annie Bell, thedailygreen.com (2008-10-01). Holy Hangover! Wine Bottles Cause Air Pollution

==Storage==

Wine cellars, or wine rooms, if they are above-ground, are places designed specifically for the storage and aging of wine. In an "active" wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. "Passive" wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types‚Äîincluding red, white, sparkling, and fortified‚Äîcan spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines can maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is [tpl]convert|13|C|F[/tpl],fineliving.com Storing Wine others [tpl]convert|15|C|F[/tpl].maridajesgourmet.com Storing Wine Temperature
Wine refrigerators offer an alternative to wine cellars and are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the perfect temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://intowine.com/wine-fridges-and-wine-cabinets|title=Wine Fridges and Wine Cabinets[/tpl]
