==Stage career==

Hardwicke made his first appearance on stage at the Lyceum Theatre, London,  in 1912 during the run of Frederick Melville's melodrama The Monk and the Woman, when he took over the part of Brother John. During that year he was at Her Majesty's Theatre understudying, and subsequently appeared at the Garrick Theatre in Charles Klein's play Find the Woman, and Trust the People. In 1913 he joined Benson's Company and toured in the provinces, South Africa and Rhodesia. During 1914 he toured with Miss Darragh (Letitia Marion Dallas, d. 1917) in Laurence Irving's play The Unwritten Law, and he appeared at the Old Vic in 1914 as Malcolm in Macbeth, Tranio in The Taming of the Shrew, and the gravedigger in Hamlet, among other roles.
The First World War intervened in his career, and from 1914 to 1921 he served as an officer in the British Army in France. Following his discharge, in January 1922 he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, playing a range of parts from the drooping young lover Faulkland in The Rivals to the roistering Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night.
He played many classical roles on stage, appearing at London's top theatres, making his name on the stage performing works by George Bernard Shaw, who said that Hardwicke was his fifth favourite actor after the four Marx Brothers. As one of the leading Shavian actors of his generation, Hardwicke starred in such Shavian works as Caesar and Cleopatra, Pygmalion, The Apple Cart, Candida, Too True to Be Good, and Don Juan in Hell, making such an impression that at age 41 he became the youngest actor to be knighted[tpl]cite book|last=Blum|first=Daniel|title=Daniel Blum's Screen World|year=1966|publisher=Biblo-Moser|isbn=0819603066|pages=220|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EQrtw8lzEg8C&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=youngest+actor+to+be+knighted&source=bl&ots=f9cAEo1wZu&sig=FdxRPLAZCfS3VousTkJ3UQuFBAc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Wn6XT7WjBsn66QGw78TfBg&ved=0CGgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=youngest%20actor%20to%20be%20knighted&f=false[/tpl]  (this occurred in the 1934 New Year's Honours; Laurence Olivier subsequently took the record in 1947 when he was knighted at the age of 40). Other stage successes included The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, Antigone and A Majority of One, winning a Tony Award nomination for his performance as a Japanese diplomat. In 1928, while appearing with Edith Day, Paul Robeson and Alberta Hunter in the London production of "Showboat", he married Helena Pickard.[tpl]cite news  | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Deaths  | work =  Issue 49962; col D  | pages = 7  | language =  | publisher =The Times  | date = 22 September 1944  | url =  | accessdate =  [/tpl]
In December 1935, Hardwicke was elected Rede Lecturer to Cambridge University for 1936, where took as his subject "The Drama Tomorrow".W. A. Darlington, W. A. "Hardwicke, Sir Cedric Webster (1893–1964)", rev. K. D. Reynolds, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 20 March 2013 [tpl]ODNBsub[/tpl] In the late 1930s he moved to the US, initially for film work (see below). In the early 1940s he continued his stage career touring and in New York.
In 1944 Hardwicke returned to Britain, again touring, and reappeared on the London stage, at the Westminster Theatre, on 29 March 1945, as Richard Varwell in a revival of Eden and Adelaide Phillpotts' comedy Yellow Sands, and subsequently toured in this on the continent. He returned to America late in 1945 and appeared with Ethel Barrymore in December in a revival of Shaw's Pygmalion, and continued on the New York stage the following year. In 1946, he starred opposite Katharine Cornell as King Creon in her production of Jean Anouilh's adaptation of the Greek tragedy Antigone.Mosel, "Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell" In 1948 he joined the Old Vic Company at the New Theatre to play Sir Toby Belch, Doctor Faustus, and Gaev in The Cherry Orchard, but, according the critic and biographer W. A. Darlington, "it was about this time that he confessed to a friend that he was finding the competition in London too hot for him", and he moved permanently to the US.  In 1951–1952, he appeared on Broadway in Shaw's Don Juan in Hell with Agnes Moorehead, Charles Boyer and Charles Laughton.

==Film and TV work==
