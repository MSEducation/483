Turn Island is a small island in the San Juan Islands  of northern Puget Sound of the U.S. state of Washington. The entire island contains Turn Island State Park and is located within the San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge.
Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838-1842, thought it was part of San Juan Island and named it Point Salisbury after one of his officers. In 1858 the British found that it was actually an island with dangerous rocks in the channel between it and San Juan Island. The name Turn Island and Turn Rocks were given to mark the proper sailing channel.[tpl]cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3[/tpl]
