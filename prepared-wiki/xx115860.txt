Mill Valley High School is a high school located in Shawnee, Kansas, and is part of the De Soto School District (USD 232). The school began classes in 2000-2001. As of the 2011-2012 school year, its attendance is roughly 1,139.http://svapp15586.ksde.org/rcard/summary/D02320833.pdf The school is much smaller than nearby Shawnee Mission Northwest High School and Olathe Northwest High School, because of the school board's original intent to keep class sizes small.  However, because of ongoing increases in attendance, the school district proposed two bond issues and finally passed one on Nov. 4, 2008. Construction on Mill Valley began in February 2009. The construction was finished in the summer of 2010. The second expansion of the school building follows a prior extension of the "A" hallway including the construction of a dedicated art wing.
Mill Valley students consistently score well above the state requirements in math and reading. In 2011-2012 according to the Kansas State Department of Education Building Report Card, students scored 96.8 percent as proficient or above in reading and 95.4 percent as proficient or above in math.
Mill Valley is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association and offers a variety of sports programs. Athletic teams compete in the 5A division and are known as the "Jaguars".
