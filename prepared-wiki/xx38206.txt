==History==

Nakskov is in the inner part of the Western inlet of Lolland, which remains one of the agriculturally richest of the Danish islands. The area was settled during the neolithic period and from this period the area has been continuously inhabited. The town received trade privileges in 1266, during the reign of king Erik 5. Glipping of Denmark. Once the export center of the rich farmland region of western Lolland, Nakskov thrived on trade, commerce and industry. This situation changed gradually as overland traffic was enabled by the construction of a railway to the neighboring island of Falster in 1875,http://www.highways.dk/danmark/broer/nykobingbro.php. The connection to Sjælland and the national capital of Copenhagen over the Storstrømsbroen bridge in 1937 http://www.highways.dk/danmark/broer/storstromsbro.php shifted the flow of goods away from the port of Nakskov. Traditionally a center of manufacturing and industry, Nakskov has turned to commerce and trade, after the industrial boom in shipbuilding ended when Denmark joined the EEC and various subsidies were consequently dismantled.
Nowadays Nakskov is an appealing environment for tourists to visit, with one of the most environmentally conscious and cleanest town environments of Denmark. As technologically and environmentally based enterprises replace the predeceding heavy industries, Nakskov stands out as a pleasurable goal of travel and  a center of culture and commerce. In recent years, local government has focused on restoring Nakskov's former architectural beauty, and has restored the town's cityscape into a culturally stimulating and pleasurable entertainment and shopping area, making Nakskov a typically Danish idyllic countryside town, encompassing the ethnic and cultural diversity brought on by globalization.
