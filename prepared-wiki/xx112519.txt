According to urban legend, the village is haunted.HK magazine: "Secret Hong Kong", October 16th, 2009 Hikers have also reported that compasses tend to stop working when they enter the village area, leading to the village being dubbed 'So Lo Pun', which in Chinese literally means that 'the compass is locked'.
