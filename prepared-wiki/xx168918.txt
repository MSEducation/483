Crusher was a free web-based invitation service, a competitor to Evite,"Webware - Crusher takes a fresh look at online invitations" July 11, 2007 based in San Francisco, California. Crusher was a utility in the creation of customizable invites for art, music, film events, or just a party.
Crusher Inc. began roughly in August 2006 and launched its beta service in May 2007. Crusher was conceived out of the frustrations of using Evite and a clear lack of alternatives. It was founded by Ericson deJesus (of Yahoo! and frog design) and Phillip Bensaid (of frog design) and its beta development was led by Doug McBride (of Ofoto) and Russell Richardson (of Microsoft and Siebel). By early 2008 the Crusher team has disbanded to take on other employment. In late 2009, Michael Dungan joined Ericson deJesus in continuing the development of Crusher."VCs Tell Startups: Don't Show Me the Money (Yet)" December 4th, 2007, WIRED"Daily Candy - The Weekend Guide" Thursday July 26th, 2007, DailyCandy.com"Website Of The Day: Crusher" Thursday, July 26th, 2007, geeksugar.com"Crusher!"
