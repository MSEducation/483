[[Edmonds' algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Graph algorithms

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, Edmonds' algorithm or Chuâ€“Liu/Edmonds' algorithm is an algorithm for finding a maximum or minimum optimum branchings. This is similar to the minimum spanning tree problem which concerns undirected graphs. However, when nodes are connected by weighted edges that are directed, a minimum spanning tree algorithm cannot be used.
The optimum branching algorithm was proposed independently first by Yoeng-jin Chu and Tseng-hong Liu (1965) and then by Edmonds (1967). To find a maximum path length, the largest edge value is found and connected between the two nodes, then the next largest value, and so on. If an edge creates a loop, it is erased.  A minimum path length is found by starting from the smallest value.

Let BV be a vertex bucket and BE be an edge bucket. Let v be a vertex and e be an edge of maximum positive weight that is incident to v. Ci is a circuit. G0 = (V0,E0) is the original digraph. ui is a replacement vertex for Ci.

 i=0<br><br>
 A:
    if w(e) &le; 0 then goto A
 }
    i=i+1
    modify BE, BV and some edge weights
 }
 goto A<br><br>
 B:
 while i &ne; 0 {
    }else{
    }
    i=i-1
 }
