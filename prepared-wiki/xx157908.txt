SmartDrive (or SMARTDRV) was a disk caching program shipped with MS-DOS versions 4.01 through 6.22 and Windows 3.0 through Windows 3.11.[tpl]cite web|title=SMARTDrive Version History (Revision 2.1)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/127021|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=7 July 2005[/tpl] It improved data transfer rates by storing frequently accessed data in random-access memory (RAM).[tpl]cite web|title=SMARTDrive and 32-Bit Disk Access (revision 1.1)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?id=83325|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=16 November 2006[/tpl]
Early versions of SmartDrive were loaded through a CONFIG.SYS device driver named SMARTDRV.SYS. Versions 4.0 and later were loaded through an executable file named SMARTDRV.EXE, which could be run at user's discretion or at boot time via AUTOEXEC.BAT. However, SMARTDRV.EXE also includes double-buffering driver that should be loaded through CONFIG.SYS. Version 4.0 also introduced 32-bit disk access and could reduce its footprint in conventional memory (the first 640 kilobytes of memory which was critical to MS-DOS) by running in upper memory area (the 384 kilobytes of memory located beyond the conventional memory).
A cloaked variant of SmartDrive utilizing the Helix Cloaking API was available from Helix Software. On Intel 80386 processors, it could run in protected mode to reduce its footprint in conventional memory.
Microsoft suggests SmartDrive to be used when installing Windows 2000 or Windows XP from MS-DOS to reduce installation time.[tpl]cite web|title=How to start the Setup program from MS-DOS in Windows XP (revision 6.0)|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307848|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=22 May 2013[/tpl]
