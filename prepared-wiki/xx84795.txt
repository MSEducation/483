The text of the petition reads, in its entirety:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.petitionproject.org | title=Global Warming Petition Project |publisher=Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine |accessdate=2012-08-25[/tpl]

The petition included a covering letter from Frederick Seitz, chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute, and made reference to his former position as president of the US National Academy of Sciences; together with a manuscript plus a reprint of a December 1997 Wall Street Journal op-ed, "Science Has Spoken: Global Warming Is a Myth", by Arthur and Zachary Robinson. The current version of Seitz's letter describes the summary as "a twelve page review of information on the subject of 'global warming'."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.petitionproject.org/seitz_letter.php | title=Letter from Frederick Seitz| author=Frederick Seitz | publisher=OISM | accessdate=2010-01-11 [/tpl] The article is titled "Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide" by Arthur B.

==Signatories==

The Oregon Petition Project clarified their verification process as follows:

===Credentials and authenticity===

The credentials, verification process, and the authenticity of the signatories has been questioned.
Jeff Jacoby promoted the Oregon Institute petition as delegates convened for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1998. Jacoby, a columnist for the Boston Globe, said event organizers "take it for granted" that global warming is real when scientists do not agree "that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful" or "that human activity leads to global warming in the first place."Jeff Jacoby. Scientists don't agree on global warming, The Boston Globe. 5 November, 1998. George Woodwell and John Holdren, two members of the National Academy of Sciences, responded to Jacoby in the International Herald Tribune, describing the petition as a "farce" in part because "the signatories are listed without titles or affiliations that would permit an assessment of their credentials."George Woodwell and John Holdren. Climate-Change Skeptics Are Wrong New York Times. November 14, 1998. Myanna Lahsen said, "Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."  The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics "added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved". Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,Joseph H. Hubert Odd Names Added to Greenhouse Plea Associated Press. (abridged version) 1 May, 1998. the movie Star Wars, Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as "I. C. Ewe".David McNeely. It’s easy for pseudoscientists to mislead people, Edmond Sun. February 22, 2006. When questioned about the pop singer during a telephone interview with Joseph Hubert of the Associated Press, Robinson acknowledged that her endorsement and degree in microbiology was inauthentic, remarking "When we're getting thousands of signatures there's no way of filtering out a fake". A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. "These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided."Todd Shelly. Bashing the Scientific Consensus on Global Warming, Hawaii Reporter. 14 July, 2005. According to the Petition Project website, the issue of duplication has been resolved.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.petitionproject.org/frequently_asked_questions.php | publisher=Global Warming Petition Project | accessdate=2010-09-10 | title=Frequently Asked Questions[/tpl] Kevin Grandia offered similar criticism, saying although the Petition Project website provides a breakdown of "areas of expertise", it fails to assort the 0.5% of signatories who claim to have a background in Climatology and Atmospheric Science by name, making independent verification difficult. "This makes an already questionable list seem completely insignificant".Kevin Grandia. The 30,000 Global Warming Petition Is Easily-Debunked The Huffington Post. October 27, 2012.
In 2001, Scientific American took a random sample "of 30 of the 1,400 signatories claiming to hold a Ph.D. in a climate-related science."
 Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages. Crudely extrapolating, the petition supporters include a core of about 200 climate researchers – a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/page.cfm?section=sidebar&articleID=0004F43C-DC1A-1C6E-84A9809EC588EF21 |title=Skepticism About Skeptics (sidebar of Climate of Uncertainty) | publisher=Scientific American |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060823125025/http://www.sciam.com/page.cfm?section=sidebar&articleID=0004F43C-DC1A-1C6E-84A9809EC588EF21 |archivedate = 2006-08-23[/tpl], October 2001 
Former New Scientist correspondent Peter Hadfield says scientists are not experts on every topic, as depicted by the character Brains in Thunderbirds. Rather, they must specialize:

==NAS incident==

A manuscript accompanying the petition was presented in a near identical style and format to contributions that appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm | title=Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide | author=Arthur B. Robinson | coauthors=Sallie L. Baliunas, Willie Soon,Zachary W. Robinson | accessdate=2008-07-14 | publisher=OISM and the George C. Marshall Institute |date=January 1998 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070114000614/www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm |archivedate=2007-01-14[/tpl] but upon careful examination was distinct from a publication by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, said the presentation was "designed to be deceptive by giving people the impression that the article … is a reprint and has passed peer review." Pierrehumbert also said the publication was full of "half-truths". F. Sherwood Rowland, who was at the time foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the Academy received numerous inquiries from researchers who "are wondering if someone is trying to hoodwink them." 
After the petition appeared, the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1998 news release that "The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal."[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=s04201998 | title=Statement by the Council of the National Academy of Sciences regarding Global Change Petition | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | date=April 20, 1998 | accessdate=2010-03-04 [/tpl] It also said "The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy." The NAS further noted that its own prior published study had shown that "even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge of the relevant phenomena, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses. Investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises."
Robinson responded in a 1998 article in Science, "I used the Proceedings as a model, but only to put the information in a format that scientists like to read, not to fool people into thinking it is from a journal." A 2006 article the magazine Vanity Fair stated: "Today, Seitz admits that 'it was stupid' for the Oregon activists to copy the academy's format. Still, he doesn't understand why the academy felt compelled to disavow the petition, which he continues to cite as proof that it is "not true" there is a scientific consensus on global warming".
