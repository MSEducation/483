Ion Ansotegi Gorostola (born 13 July 1982 in Berriatua, Basque Country) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Real Sociedad in La Liga, as a central defender.

==Football career==

After starting his professional career with SD Eibar (with a loan to Barakaldo CF included), Ansotegi moved to Basque giants Real Sociedad. He made his La Liga debut on 22 January 2006 in a 3–3 home draw against Athletic Bilbao, in a derby match, and played 33 games in his first two top flight seasons combined.
Ansotegi only missed two matches in the 2009–10 season, being booked just six times in his 40 complete appearances – and adding four goals – as Real Sociedad returned to division one after a three-year absence. He featured in 32 contests (all starts) in the following campaign as the club retained its league status, but lost his importance in the squad following the January 2011 signing of Norwegian Vadim Demidov and the emergence of youth product Iñigo Martínez.
