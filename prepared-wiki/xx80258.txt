NBA Live is a series of basketball video games, published by EA Sports. It is the successor to EA's previous NBA Playoffs and NBA Showdown series. Its main competitor is the NBA 2K series. After the release of NBA Live 10, EA attempted to retool the series under a new name with NBA Elite 11. However, the game was met with bad publicity and development problems before release and was cancelled (though a playable demo was released for download). In November 2010, development of the franchise was moved from EA Canada studio to Florida-based Tiburon studio. It was eventually announced that the series' next installment would be released in Fall 2012 and would return to the NBA Live name as NBA Live 13,[tpl]cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/23/eas-next-basketball-sim-is-nba-live-13/ |title=EA's next basketball sim is NBA Live 13 |publisher=Joystiq |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl] but announced on September 27, 2012 that they would cancel the release.[tpl]cite web|last=Suszek |first=Mike |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/27/nba-live-13-has-been-canceled/ |title=NBA Live 13 canceled by EA |publisher=Joystiq |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl] However, in the fall of 2013, the game would officially return with NBA Live 14.

==NBA Playoffs==

The predecessor of the NBA Live series was the NBA Playoffs series, which featured Lakers vs. Celtics, released first in 1989 for MS-DOS-compatible PCs and later adapted for consoles in early 1991 for the Sega Mega Drive. This game was played from a horizontal view (while later versions moved to an isometric view before ultimately moving to 3D on newer consoles).  The game was one of the first to feature an NBA license, containing both real NBA teams and player likenesses and signature moves.  Details such as Horace Grant's goggles are clearly visible, and Michael Jordan's "Air Reverse Layup" is animated with very high accuracy.  Player numbers were also visible.  The game featured only eight of the sixteen teams that qualified for the NBA playoffs that year, as well as both NBA All-Star teams.
The next game in the series was Bulls vs. Lakers, released in 1992, followed by Bulls vs. Blazers in 1993.  Unlike the first game, these two releases were titled after the two teams who were in the NBA Finals the previous season, while the original release apparently chose the Lakers and Celtics due to both teams' historical success.  Each revision added more teams and players, as well as more signature moves.  The series also included an Olympic basketball spinoff game, Team USA Basketball (1992) which uses the same engine. The final game in the series was NBA Showdown 94 for SNES before the transition to the NBA Live series.

==NBA Live==

The NBA Live series was originally released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES with NBA Live 95. The naming was changed from utilizing the last two digits of the year to the entire year number from 2000â€“2005, but returned to the original naming convention with NBA Live 06.
The Create-A-Player feature was not available in the 1995 versions of the game, but have been a mainstay since NBA Live 96. NBA Live 98 in 1997 was the last NBA Live game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and the SNES. NBA Live 98 also was the first NBA Live series game to support 3Dfx graphic cards. Only first generation Voodoo and Voodoo Rush cards were officially supported. NBA Live 99 was the first to feature Practice Mode and Multi-season play.
Starting from NBA Live 2000, the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams, that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Along the series, some of the rosters were changed due to many reasons as Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004 and then, Spud Webb and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tom Chambers were added to the rosters in NBA Live 06.
NBA Live 2005 brought the addition of the Freestyle Air, NBA All-Star Weekend which includes the Rookie Challenge, Three Point Shootout, Slam Dunk Contest, and the NBA All-Star Game, and Freestyle Challenge which 2 players or more can play the Three Point Shootout or the Slam Dunk Contest.
NBA Live 06 was released on September 26, 2005 for the Xbox 360, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, PC, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 Mobile. It features Dwyane Wade as the cover athlete.
NBA Live 07 was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, PlayStation Portable, and the Xbox360. The major new feature for this year was an evolution of the freestyle superstars system. Tracy McGrady of the Rockets is the cover athlete.
