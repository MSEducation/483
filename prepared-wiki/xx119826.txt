[[Kwans]]

CATEGORIES: Taekwondo kwans, Korean martial arts

Kwan (Hanja: 館; [tpl]ko-hhrm|관[/tpl]) in Korean literally means building or hall, but when used in martial arts it can also refer to a school or clan of martial artists who follow the same style and/or leader. This article is about the different taekwondo kwans.

==The five original Taekwondo kwans==

==Later important Taekwondo kwans (post Korean War)==

The four later Kwans are considered annex kwans, since they all are lines from one of the 5 earlier kwans.
