The institute's stated objectives are amongst others:
Its principal activity has been the distribution of awards to companies, nominally those with innovative transport products and services. However, companies are invited to nominate themselves and effectively to pay the institute for "accreditation" or "evaluation". Perhaps as a result, the award categories have varied from year to year and have included Chemical Distribution Company of the Year, OEM-Approved Lubricants of the Year, Fuel Card of the Year, Independent Vehicle Remarketing Company of the Year, and Warehouse Management Solutions Company of the Year.
The organisation's website lists a number of "Accredited Suppliers", many of whom are no longer in existence.
