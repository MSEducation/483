[[Sargento mayor]]

CATEGORIES: Military ranks, History of Spain

Sargento mayor ("sergeant major") was a rank immediately below that of maestro de campo in the Spanish tercios of the 16th and 17th centuries.  Initially second in rank to a coronel ("colonel") in a colunella, the sargento mayor became second in rank to the maestre de campo after the creation of the tercios in 1534. He took care of the tactical training, security and lodging of the troops of the tercio.  Also he transmitted the orders of the maestre de campo or the capit√°n general to subordinate officers.
