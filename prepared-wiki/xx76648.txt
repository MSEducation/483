[[Pixiphone]]

CATEGORIES: Keyboard percussion, Idiophones, Pitched percussion, Toy instruments

The Pixiphone was a range of toy glockenspiels (although they were inaccurately labelled as xylophones on their packaging). The larger Pixiphones had a 'raiser-bar' which could be used to end a note abruptly, rather than letting it fade naturally. Although marketed as a children's toy, the Pixiphone could be tuned pitch-perfect and was very robust, resulting in many children using them at British schools.

==Manufacturer==

The Pixiphone was manufactured by Chas E. Methven Ltd, Chatham, Kent, England and distributed by Playcraft Toys Ltd England from the 1950s to the 1970s (or possibly later). 

==Recordings==

The Pixiphone was played by Steve Took on three Tyrannosaurus Rex albums, where it is incorrectly (or jokingly) credited as a Pixiephone.  http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/pixiphone.html retrieved 21 July 2012
