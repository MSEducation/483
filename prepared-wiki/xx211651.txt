Sayers was born in London in February 6, 1928 and moved to Melbourne with his parents. He graduated from Melbourne University with a first-class degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering. He then worked as an electronics design engineer before working in Imperial College as a research student. In 1968, he became Professor of Engineering Applied to Medicine.
During the 1960s, Sayers established the Engineering in Medicine Laboratory, which became a research centre for physics and engineering applications to biomedical problems. In 1989, the laboratory eventually became the College's Centre for Biological and Medical Systems. Finally, in the 1990s, this became the Department of Bioengineering for Imperial College.
Throughout his career, Sayers published various research papers about signal processing and statistical techniques to biomedical problems. He worked with the World Health Organization to study the spread of many diseases. In the 1990s, he worked in WHO's Advisory Committee on Heath Research (ACHR), chaired several subcommittees, and served as the vice-chairman of ACHR. 
Sayers co-edited a book on Global Health and the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, which is sponsored by UNESCO, until his death.
