==First Generation==

===Gallardo===

The first generation Gallardo came with a 5 litre 90 degree V10 (4961cc). The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-Box) six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled semi-automatic robotized manual, which Lamborghini abbreviates to "E-gear". The "E-gear" allows the driver to make shifts much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode.Introducing the Gallardo LamboCars.com The vehicle was designed by Italdesign Giugiaro, which was based on the 1995 Calà prototype.Gallardo

===2005 coupe update===

For the MY2006 (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These were based on the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20 bhp to a maximum of [tpl]convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|lk=in[/tpl], and the biggest change was an overall lowering of the gearing, especially in 1st to 5th. The result was a much improved car; it handled and turned better, sounded better under full throttle and the extra power and lower gearing made an already fast car into a much faster one.

===Spyder===

The production spyder model of the Gallardo was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006.  It was considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with [tpl]convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a lower-ratio six-speed manual transmission.  The soft top was fully retractable.

===Gallardo Superleggera===

During the 2007 Geneva Auto ShowAutoBlog.com, Geneva Motor Show: Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera Lamborghini debuted the Gallardo Superleggera, the name paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/8154/1|title=Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (2007–)|accessdate=2009-03-14|work=channel4.com[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and its emphasis on weight reduction. The Superleggera was lighter than the base Gallardo by [tpl]convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] via the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was upgraded by [tpl]convert|10|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] thanks to an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total of [tpl]convert|530|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option.

====SUPER GT====

The Gallardo was entered by privateers to the GT300 class of the Japanese SUPER GT Championship, car had to conform to rather different regulations. It could produce no more than 300PS (295 bhp/224 kW) and must be Rear-Wheel-Drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox was a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the SUPER GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top this 2009 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://supergt.net/en/ |title=SuperGT.net |publisher=SuperGT.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02[/tpl]
