In the Gospels of Mark and Luke this episode takes place after the exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum. Jesus goes to Apostle Peter's house. There he sees the mother of Peter's wife lying in bed with a high fever. Jesus touches her hand and the fever leaves her, and she gets up and begins to wait on him.
Following this, the Gospels report that at sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness or were demon-possessed, and laying his hands on each one, Jesus healed them and cast demons out of them (Matthew 8:16-18).
