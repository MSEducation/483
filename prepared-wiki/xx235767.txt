Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES), or the International English School, is a Swedish corporation that consists of several Independent schools (or “free schools”). IES was founded in 1993.Internationella Engelska Skolan website, accessed September, 2013. by Barbara Bergström, an American by origin and a science teacher by profession. She is still the sole owner of the company and its working chairman. The CEO is Ralph Riber.
IES schools are based on the idea of bilingual education, with up to half of the teaching in English, performed by native English speaking teachers recruited from the United Kingdom, USA, Canada, and other English-speaking countries. Other vital elements are “tough love”, creating “a safe, calm environment in which teachers can teach and students learn”; and “high academic expectations”. Restaurant-type school lunches are also part of the concept. IES schools show results on the Swedish national tests which are far above average[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].
