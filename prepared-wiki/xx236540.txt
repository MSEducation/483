==Inception of the album==

Kastle did not want to record an album of short works, mostly for the piano.  He insisted that his first album feature the 25 minute "Royce Concerto" with an orchestra. The record company maintained that Kastle's first album needed to break even, at least, and offered to guarantee a second release if he recorded shorter works for the first album, split evenly between classics and newer Kastle compositions.
