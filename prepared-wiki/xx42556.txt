Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games created by Interplay Entertainment. Although the series is set during the 22nd and 23rd centuries, its retrofuturistic setting and artwork are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner for Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 video game of which the Fallout series is regarded to be a spiritual successor. Although the game worlds are different, the background story, inhabitants, locations, and characters draw many parallels. 
The first two titles in the series (Fallout and Fallout 2) were developed by Black Isle Studios. Micro Fort√© and 14 Degrees East's 2001 Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is a tactical role-playing game. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6086046.html |title=Q&A: Feargus Urquhart, Part One |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl] and continued to produce an action game with RPG elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel without Black Isle Studios. A third entry in the main series, Fallout 3, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks. The latest role-playing installment of the series, Fallout: New Vegas, came out in 2010 and was developed by Obsidian Entertainment.
Bethesda Softworks now owns the rights to produce all Fallout games.[tpl]cite web | title=Contract between Bethesda and Interplay Entertainment Corp | url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1057232/000117091807000324/0001170918-07-000324.txt | date=2007-04-09 | accessdate=2007-05-16[/tpl] Soon after acquiring the rights to the IP, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game version of Fallout to Interplay.

===Main series===

====Fallout====

Released in 1997, Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161. The protagonist is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken chip in his or her underground shelter home, Vault 13. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop a new system, the SPECIAL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/948/948937p3.html|title=IGN Presents the History of Fallout|date=2009-01-28|work=IGN|page=3|accessdate=2009-01-30[/tpl] Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-WWII America and the nuclear paranoia that was widespread at that time.

====Fallout 2====

Fallout 2 was released in 1998, with several improvements over the first game, including an improved game engine, the ability to set attitudes of non-player character (NPC) party members and the ability to push people who are blocking doors. Additional features included several changes to the game world, including significantly more pop culture jokes and parodies, such as multiple Monty Python-referencing special random encounters, and self-parodying dialogue that broke the fourth wall to mention game mechanics. Fallout 2 takes place eighty years after Fallout, and centers around a descendant of the Vault-Dweller, the protagonist of Fallout. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as he tries to save his village, Arroyo, after several years of drought and death.

====Fallout 3====

Fallout 3 was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on October 28, 2008. The story picks up thirty years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game's world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/info/faq.html|title=FAQ|publisher=Bethesda Softworks|date=2008-05-05|accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl] The player is a Vault-dweller in Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest him/her in response to the player's father leaving the Vault. Once free, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C., known as the Capital Wasteland, to find his/her father. It differs from previous games in the series by utilizing 3D graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games' 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat. It was developed simultaneously for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine. On release it received highly positive reviews, garnering 94/100,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/fallout3 |title=Fallout 3 PC Reviews at Metacritic |accessdate=2008-11-07 |publisher=Metacritic [/tpl] 92/100,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/fallout3 |title=Fallout 3 PS3 Reviews at Metacritic |accessdate=2008-11-07 |publisher=Metacritic [/tpl] and 93/100[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/fallout3 |title=Fallout 3 Xbox 360 Reviews at Metacritic |accessdate=2008-11-07 |publisher=Metacritic [/tpl] averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, respectively. It won IGN's 2008 Overall Game of the Year Award, Xbox 360 Game of the Year, Best RPG, and Best Use of Sound, as well as E3's Best of the Show and Best Role Playing Game.

====Fallout: New Vegas====

Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released on October 19, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.filefront.com/fallout-new-vegas-release-date-announced |title=Fallout: New Vegas Release Date Announced |publisher=News.filefront.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19[/tpl] The development team included developers who previously worked on Fallout and Fallout 2.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20100216/fallout16_st.art.htmhttp://www.joystiq.com/2009/04/20/fallout-new-vegas-coming-to-consoles-next-year/ Fallout: New Vegas is not a direct sequel to Fallout 3;[tpl]cite web|title=Fallout: New Vegas Interview: Josh Sawyer|url=http://au.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/falloutnewvegas/video/6261040/fallout-new-vegas-interview-josh-sawyer|last=Tong|first=Sophia|work=GameSpot|date=May 4, 2010|format=Video[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20100216/fallout16_st.art.htm|title=What happens in 'Fallout: New Vegas'|last=Snider|first=Mike|work=USATODAY.com|date=February 16, 2010|accessdate=February 16, 2010[/tpl] rather, it is a stand-alone product. Events in the game follow four years after Fallout 3 and offer a similar role-playing experience, but no characters from that game appear. The player assumes the role of a courier in the post-apocalyptic world of the Mojave Wasteland. As the game begins, the Courier is shot in the head and left for dead shortly before being found and brought to a doctor in the nearby town of Goodsprings, marking the start of the game and the Courier's search for his or her would-be murderer. The city of New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic interpretation of Las Vegas with only three standing casinos.

====Fallout 4====

Pete Hines of Bethesda Softworks said: "The whole reason we went out and acquired the license and that we now own Fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one. This is not something we're going to do once and then go away and never do it again. When that will be or how long that will be God only knows, but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with The Elder Scrolls."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Fallout-3/news/Fallout-4-Planned-13049.html |title=TVG: Fallout MMO Planned |publisher=Totalvideogames.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-04[/tpl] On January 8, 2013, Fallout 3 voice actor Erik Dellums hinted via Twitter that his character, Three Dog, would be returning.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ETDellums/status/288757510406557697 |title=Twitter / ETDellums: To all my #Fallout3 and #ThreeDog |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl] In a follow-up tweet, he stated, "I was given permission to release that tease."[tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ETDellums/status/288758936583168001 |title=Twitter / ETDellums: @ToastTheRabbit How was that |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl] This was widely interpreted by the gaming media as a sign that a Fallout 4 announcement is imminent. However, in July of the same year, Dellums tweeted that the game he is working on is not being produced by Bethesda Softworks, therefore it was not the anticipated new Fallout title.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ETDellums/statuses/357615277078347776 |title=Twitter / ETDellums: New game is not with my friends |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl]
On November 13, 2013, an alleged ZeniMax funded website thesurvivor2299.com was created. The site contained several coded messages and morse code, and most notably a timer believed to be counting down to an announcement or teaser trailer for Fallout 4, which was also done with Fallout 3; the messages and morse code was in turn translated by several Fallout fansites. On December 6, Bethesda finally responded in regards to the site stating; "PSA: If you don‚Äôt hear it through an official channel like this, assume all rumors and speculation are false."[tpl]cite web|url= https://twitter.com/Bethblog/status/409085013397733376 |title= Bethblog twitter |publisher= Twitter[/tpl] The site was revealed to be a hoax shortly after. 
On December 11, 2013, Kotaku reported that Fallout 4 was indeed in development,[tpl]cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/leaked-documents-reveal-that-fallout-4-is-real-set-in-1481322956 |title= Leaked Documents Reveal That Fallout 4 Is Real, Set In Boston |publisher= Kotaku[/tpl]  stating it had documents, confirmed to be real, which apparently set the game in Massachusetts. The leaked documents never actually made a reference to Fallout, but the beginning of one page starts with "War. War never changes" ‚Äì the usual introductory line for the stories in the Fallout series.

===Spin-offs===

====Fallout: Tactics====

Tactics is the first Fallout game not to require the player to fight in a turn-based mode, and it is also the first to allow the player to customize the skills, perks, and combat actions of the rest of the party. Fallout Tactics focuses on tactical combat rather than role-playing; the new combat system included different modes, stances, and modifiers, but the player had no dialogue options. Most of the criticisms of the game came from its incompatibility with the story of the original two games, not from its gameplay. Fallout: Tactics includes a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against squads of other characters controlled by other players. Unlike the previous two games, which are based in California, Fallout: Tactics takes place in the Midwestern United States. The game was released in early 2001 to generally favorable reviews.

====Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel====

Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel became the first Fallout game for consoles when it was released in 2004. It follows an initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel who is given a suicidal quest to find several lost Brotherhood Paladins. BoS is an action role-playing game, representing a significant break from previous incarnations of the Fallout series in both gameplay and aesthetics. The game does not feature non-player characters that accompany the player in combat and uses heavy metal music, including Slipknot, Devin Townsend, and Killswitch Engage, which stands in contrast to the music of Fallout 3, performed by The Ink Spots and Louis Armstrong. It was the last Fallout game to be developed by Interplay.

===Cancelled games===

====Fallout Extreme====

====Van Buren====

Van Buren was the code-name for the cancelled version of Fallout 3 developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay. It featured an improved engine with real 3D graphics as opposed to sprites, new locations, vehicles, and a modified version of the SPECIAL system. The story disconnected from the Vault-Dweller/Chosen One bloodline in Fallout and Fallout 2. Plans for the game included the ability to influence the various factions. The game was cancelled in December 2003 when the budget cuts forced Interplay to dismiss the PC development team. Interplay subsequently sold the Fallout intellectual property to Bethesda Softworks, who began development on their own version of Fallout 3 unrelated to Van Buren. Van Buren is considered to be a part of the main Fallout series, however it is considered non-canon. Main parts of the game were incorporated into Fallout 3 and its add-ons as well as Fallout: New Vegas.

====Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2====

====Fallout Online====

Fallout Online (previously known as Project V13, also known as FOOL) was a cancelled project by Interplay and Masthead Studios[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6207361.html?tag=result;title;0|title=Earthrise studio arming Fallout MMORPG|publisher=Gamespot.com |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] to develop a Fallout-themed massively multiplayer online game.

==Series overview==

===Setting===

The series is set in a United States alternate history scenario which diverges from our reality following World War II. The transistor was not invented, while vacuum tubes and atomic physics became the cornerstones to scientific progress, eventually achieving the technological aspirations of the early Atomic Age and locking society into a 1950's cultural stasis. Thus, in this alternative "golden age", a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 1950's-era computers and telephones, and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century.
More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to a period called the "Resource Wars" ‚Äì a series of events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska. These eventually culminated in the 2077 Great War, a cataclysmic nuclear exchange that lasted for only two hours, and subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States setting of Fallout.

===Vaults===

Having foreseen this outcome decades earlier, the U.S. government began a nationwide project in 2054 to build fallout shelters known as "Vaults". The Vaults were ostensibly designed by the government contractor Vault-Tec as public shelters, financed by junk bonds and each able to support up to a thousand people. Each Vault is self-sufficient, so they could theoretically sustain their inhabitants indefinitely. However, the Vault project was never intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in such a deadly scenario. Around 400,000 vaults would have been needed, but only 122 were commissioned and constructed. Instead, the Vaults were part of a secret and unethical social experiment, and were designed to determine the effects of different environmental and psychological conditions on its inhabitants. Experiments included: a Vault that was designed to never open, a Vault where the inhabitants were exposed to the mutagenic Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.), and a Vault where the door never closed, exposing the inhabitants to dangerous amounts of radiation. A few control Vaults were made to function as advertised to contrast with the data from those Vaults with intentional flaws. Nevertheless, many Vaults had their experiments derailed due to unexpected events. Many of these Vaults were so self-destructive that by the time other survivors opened them, they were nothing but graveyards.

===Post-War conditions===

In the years following the Great War, the United States devolved into a post-apocalyptic environment commonly dubbed "the Wasteland". The War and subsequent nuclear fallout severely depopulated the country, leaving large expanses of property decaying from neglect. In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated and radiation exposure, combined with a mutagenic bioweapon that was accidentally released into the atmosphere during the War, have caused mutation in nearly all forms of life. With a large portion of the country's infrastructure in ruins, basic necessities are scarce. Barter is the common method of exchange, with bottlecaps providing a more conventional form of currency. Most cities and towns are empty, having been looted and deserted in favor of smaller, makeshift communities scattered around the Wasteland.
Many humans who could not get into the Vaults survived the atomic blasts, but many of these, affected by the radiation, turned into so-called ghouls. While they were given an extended lifespan, most lost their hair and their skin decayed, giving them a zombie-like appearance; often, their voices became raspy. Many ghouls have a hatred for humans, either through jealousy or due to discrimination by the humans. Almost all ghouls resent their comparison to zombies and being called a zombie is viewed as a great insult by them. After suffering mass amounts of radiation, a number of ghouls eventually go insane; these "feral ghouls" become mindless, aggressive creatures, driven only by instinct.

===Factions===

Although the Wastelands of the Fallout series are home to innumerable self-supporting groups, there are a number of factions who have a significant presence across the entire former United States. These factions are often the major players in the larger events of each game's primary storyline.

===Influences===

Fallout draws from 1950's pulp magazine science fiction and superhero comic books, all rooted in Atomic Age optimism of a nuclear-powered future, though gone terribly awry by the time the events of the game take place. The technology is retro-futuristic, with various Raygun Gothic machines such as laser weaponry and boxy Forbidden Planet-style robots. Computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors, architecture of ruined buildings feature Art Deco and Googie designs, energy weapons resemble those used by Flash Gordon, and what few vehicles remain in the world are all 1950's-styled. Fallout's other production design, such as menu interfaces, are similarly designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the Atomic Age. Advertising in the game such as billboards and brochures has a distinct 1950's motif and feel. The lack of retro-stylization was a common reason for criticism in spin-off games.
A major influence was A Boy and His Dog, where the main character Vic and his dog Blood scavenge the desert of the Southwestern United States, stealing for a living and evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants. It "inspired Fallout on many levels, from underground communities of survivors to glowing mutants."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_211/6283-Junktown-Dog.2 | title=Junktown Dog | publisher=The Escapist | date=July 21, 2009 | accessdate=July 29, 2011 | author=Fiegel, Michael[/tpl] Other film influences include the Mad Max series, with its depiction of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. In the first game, one of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that resembles the jacket worn by Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.[tpl]citation|title=Fallout: New Vegas designer Josh Sawyer on post-apocalyptic games|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/10/fallout-new-vegas-interview|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2010-11-10[/tpl]

==Gameplay==

===SPECIAL===

SPECIAL is a character creation and statistics system developed specifically for the Fallout series. SPECIAL is an acronym, representing the seven attributes used to define Fallout characters: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. SPECIAL is heavily based on GURPS, which was originally intended to be the character system used in the game.
The SPECIAL system involves the following sets of key features:
The SPECIAL system has thus far been used in the role-playing video game Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel. A heavily modified version of the system was used for Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout: Warfare, a tabletop battle game available on the Fallout Tactics bonus CD.
Aside from Fallout games, modified versions of SPECIAL were also used in Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader (also referred to as Fallout Fantasy early in production), a fantasy role-playing video game that involved spirits and magic in addition to the traditional SPECIAL features, as well as the cancelled project Black Isle's Torn.

===The PIP-Boy and Vault Boy===

The PIP-Boy (Personal Information Processor-Boy) is an iconic wrist-computer given to the player early in Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas which serves various roles in quest, inventory, and battle management, as well as presenting player statistics. The model present in Fallout and Fallout 2 is identified as a PIP-Boy 2000, and both games feature the very same unit, used first by the Vault Dweller and later inherited by the Chosen One. Fallout Tactics contains a modified version of the 2000 model, called PIP-Boy 2000BE, while Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas uses a PIP-Boy 3000.
The Vault Boy character[tpl]cite web |url=http://bethblog.com/index.php/2008/06/25/papercraft-vault-boy-now-online/ |title=Papercraft Vault Boy now online |publisher=Official Bethesda Softworks Blog |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl] is Vault-Tec's mascot, and is a frequently recurring element in Vault-Tec-related items in the world. This includes the PIP-Boy, where  Vault Boy illustrates all of the character statistics and selectable attributes. From Bethesda's Fallout 3 onward Vault Boy models all of the clothing and weaponry as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/vault/diaries_diary5-6.6.08.html |title=Fallout: Welcome to the Official Site |publisher=Fallout.bethsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-04[/tpl]

==Tabletop games==

===Fallout: Warfare===

Fallout: Warfare is a tabletop wargame based on the Fallout Tactics storyline, using a simplified version of the SPECIAL system. The rulebook was written by Christopher Taylor, and was available on the Fallout Tactics bonus CD, together with cut-out miniatures. Fallout: Warfare features five distinct factions, vehicles, four game types and 33 different units. The rules only require ten-sided dice. The modifications to the SPECIAL system allow every unit a unique set of stats and give special units certain skills they can use, including piloting, doctor, and repair. A section of the Fallout: Warfare manual allows campaigns to be conducted using the Warfare rules. The game is currently available for free online from fansite No Mutants Allowed and several other sources. It has also been chosen for many awards and one game of the year.

==Lawsuits==

Interplay was threatened with bankruptcy and sold the full Fallout franchise to Bethesda, but kept the rights to the Fallout MMO through a back license in April 2007 and began work on the MMO later that year.[tpl]cite news |first=iTZKooPA |url=http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=150073 |title='Fallout' IP Goes To Bethesda Softworks |publisher=Totalgaming.net |date=2007-04-13 |accessdate=2007-04-13[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|author = iTZKooPA|title = Interplay Almost Out Of Debt; Searching For 'Fallout'-based MMO Funding | url=http://tgnforums.stardock.com/?forumid=141&aid=160315 |publisher = Totalgaming.net |date=  2007-08-15 |accessdate = 2007-08-22[/tpl] Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment for copyright infringement on September 8, 2009, regarding the Fallout Online license and selling of Fallout Trilogy and sought an injunction to stop development of Fallout Online and sales of Fallout Trilogy. Key points that Bethesda were trying to argue is that Interplay did not have the right to sell Fallout Trilogy on the Internet via Steam, Good Old Games or other online services.  Bethesda also said that "full scale" development on Fallout Online was not met and that the minimum financing of 30 million of "secured funding" was not met. Interplay launched a counter suit claiming that Bethesda's claims were meritless and that it did have the right to sell Fallout Trilogy via online stores via its contract with Bethesda. Interplay also claimed secure funding had been met and the game was in full scale development by the cut off date. Interplay argued to have the second contract that sold Fallout voided which would result in the first contract that licensed Fallout to come back into effect. This would mean that Fallout would revert to Interplay. Bethesda would be allowed to make Fallout 5. Bethesda would also have to pay 12% of royalties on Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and expansions plus interest on the money owed. On December 10, 2009, Bethesda lost the first injunction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/09/11/bethesda-softworks-files-lawsuit-against-interplay-over-fallout/|title=Bethesda-Fallout Lawsuit|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl]
Bethesda shortly afterward tried a new tactic and fired its first lawyer, replacing him and filing a second injunction, claiming that Bethesda had only back licensed the name Fallout but no content. Interplay has countered showing that the contract states that they must make Fallout Online that has the look and feel of Fallout and that in the event Interplay fails to meet the requirements (30 million minimum secure funding and "full scale" development by X date) that Interplay can still release the MMO but they have to remove all Fallout content. The contract then goes on to list all Fallout content as locations, monsters, settings and lore. Bethesda has known that Interplay would use Fallout elements via internet emails shown in court documents and that the contract was not just for the name.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35494/Interplay_Bethesda_Knew_Fallout_MMO_Was_About_More_Than_The_Name.php|title=New Turn in Interplay-Bethesda Lawsuit|accessdate=28 June 2011[/tpl] The second injunction by Bethesda was denied on August 4, 2011 by the courts. Bethesda then appealed the denial of their second preliminary injunction. Bethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a restraining order against the company. Bethesda was denied this restraining order before Masthead Studios could call a counter-suit.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/37428/Bethesda_Denied_Restraining_Order_Against_Fallout_MMO.php|title=Bethesda's Restraining Order Denied|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] Bethesda then lost its appeal of the second injunction.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1210805p1.html?_cmpid=ign40|title=Bethesda Appeal Denied|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=29 October 2011[/tpl]
Bethesda then filed motion in limine against Interplay. Interplay then filed a motion in limine against Bethesda the day after. Shortly after, the trial by jury which Bethesda requested on October 26, 2010 was changed to a trial by court because the APA contract (aka the second  contract that sold Fallout to Bethesda) stated that all legal matters would be resolved via a trial by court and not a trial by jury. The trial by court began on December 12. In 2012, in a press conference Bethesda revealed that in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave to them full rights for Fallout Online. Interplay's rights to sell and merchandise Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel expired on December 31, 2013.

==Voice cast==

The Fallout series features several well known actors as NPC voice talent. Throughout the series, actor Ron Perlman voices The Narrator; other notable appearances include:

==Reception==
