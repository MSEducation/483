[[Centillion]]

CATEGORIES: Large numbers

One centillion is a number, which is equal to either 10303 or 10600, depending on the system used.

==Short scale==

In areas using the short scale, such as Canada and the U.S. and the UK, a centillion is 10303. It is formed on a pattern starting with a million: a million (1,000,000) has three zeroes more than a thousand (1,000); a billion (1,000,000,000) has two groups of three zeroes more than a thousand, and so on. A centillion has one hundred groups of three zeroes more than a thousand.
A centillion in the short-scale system is equivalent to a quinquagintilliard, or a thousand quinquagintillion, in the long-scale system.

==Long scale==

In long scale usage, one centillion is 10600, which is equal to (106)100; that is, it's the number with a hundred times as many zeroes as a million.
A centillion in the long scale is equivalent to a cennovemnonagintillion in the short scale.http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/math/number/howhigh.html
