[[Lake Saka Nature Reserve Area]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Turkey

The Saka Gölü Nature Reserve Area is a nature reserve area in Kırklareli Province of Turkey near the small coast town of İğneada on the Black Sea Coast. It gets its name from the Saka Lake which is in the boundaries of the area. Its area is 1345 ha. The area sits on a floodplain of a river that flows into the Black Sea and seasonally floods thus rendering it a unique and one of the very few remaining floodplain forests in all of Europe. The flora consists of oak forests (typical of the Yıldız mountains located in the vicinity of the area), ash, alder, elm, maple and hornbeam trees. There are also wide stretches of pristine coastal area with several endemic plants, some of which are halophytes (salt-loving), and wetlands dominated by reeds which harbor different bird species.
