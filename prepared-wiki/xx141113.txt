Richard William Sladdin (born January 8, 1969) was an English cricketer  who played for Derbyshire from 1991 to 1994 and for Somerset in 1997. He was born in Halifax, Yorkshire.
The most important spinner within the Derbyshire lineup in the early part of the 1990s,[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] he debuted in a draw against Yorkshire in July 1991, as Derbyshire finished in third position in the season's table. A common fixture until the middle of the 1994 season, his career was quickly over, as he hit zero wickets for 190 runs, the single worst bowling figures in the history of Derbyshire County Cricket Club.
Prior to the end of his career, he played briefly in the 1997 season, for Somerset, though his career finished there. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler. He hit five wickets in an inning twice in his career, including once in his sole first-class game for Somerset.
Sladdin retired from all forms of the game in mid 2000's before qualifying as a coach at The Cricket Asylum in 2013. He also restarted his playing career in the same year after being asked to Pro for Central Lancashire League side, Walsden.
