==Campuses==

===Vancouver===

The Vancouver campus is located at Point Grey, a twenty-minute drive from downtown Vancouver. It is near several beaches and has views of the North Shore mountains. The 7.63 km² Pacific Spirit Regional Park serves as a green-belt between the campus and the city. Buildings on the Vancouver campus currently occupy 1,091,997 m² gross, located on 1.7 km² of maintained land.  The   campus street plan is mostly in a grid of malls (for driving and pedestrian-only). Lower Mall and West Mall are in the southwestern part of the peninsula, with Main, East, and Wesbrook Malls northeast of them.
The University Endowment Lands are not within Vancouver's city limits, and therefore UBC is policed by the RCMP rather than the Vancouver Police Department. However, the Vancouver Fire Department   provides service to UBC under a contract. In addition to UBC RCMP, UBC have Campus Security, that patrol the campus.  Postage sent to any building on campus includes Vancouver in the address.  UBC Vancouver also has two satellite campuses within the City of Vancouver: a campus at Vancouver General Hospital for the medical sciences, and UBC Robson Square in downtown Vancouver for part-time credit and non-credit programmes.  UBC is also a partner in the consortium backing Great Northern Way Campus Ltd, and is affiliated with a group of adjacent theological colleges, which include the Vancouver School of Theology, Regent College, Carey Theological College and Corpus Christi College.
The campus is home to numerous gardens. The UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research, the first UBC department, holds a collection of over 8000 different kinds of plants used for research, conservation and education. The original site of the UBC botanical garden was at the "Old Arboretum". Today all that remains of it are trees planted in 1916 by John Davidson. The old arboretum is now home to many buildings including the First Nations House of Learning. The Nitobe Memorial Garden, built to honour Japanese scholar Inazo Nitobe, the garden has been the subject of more than fifteen years' study by a UBC professor, [tpl]who|date=June 2012[/tpl] who believes that its construction hides a number of impressive features, including references to Japanese philosophy and mythology, shadow bridges visible only at certain times of year, and positioning of a lantern that is filled with light at the exact date and time of Nitobe's death each year. The garden is behind the university's Asian Centre, which is built using steel girders from Japan's exhibit at Osaka Expo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/home/lib-history.html|title=UBC Library History|publisher=University of British Columbia|date=July 26, 2005|accessdate=January 25, 2009[/tpl]
The campus also features the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts: a performing arts centre containing the Chan Shun Concert Hall, Telus Studio Theatre and the Royal Bank Cinema. It is often the location of convocation ceremonies as well as the filming location for the 4400 Center on the television show The 4400,The 4440, locations, IMDb as well as the Madacorp entrance set on Kyle XY.Kyle XY filming locations â€” Movie Maps.

===Libraries, archives and galleries===

The UBC Library, which comprises 5.8 million books and journals, 5.3 million microforms, over 833,000 maps, videos and other multimedia materials and over 46,700 subscriptions, is the second largest research library in Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/home/about.html |title=About the Library | accessdate=February 2, 2010[/tpl]  The libraries lent out over 2.5 million print works in 2008/2009 with over 2.9 million visits to the library (measured by gate counters).
The library has twenty-one branches and divisions at UBC and at other locations, including three branches at teaching hospitals (St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, BC Children's Hospital), one at UBC's Robson Square campus in downtown Vancouver, and one at the UBC's Okanagan Campus. Plans are also under way to establish a library at the Great Northern Way Campus on the Finning Lands.
The former Main Library has undergone construction and has been renamed the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. The new library incorporates the centre heritage block of the old Main Library with two new expansion wings and features an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS), the first of its kind in Canada.[tpl]cite press release | title = UBC Opens $79.7M Irving K.

==Governance and academics==

The administration of UBC, as mandated by the University Act, is composed of a chancellor, convocation, board, senate, and faculties of the university.[ref]
</ref> The Board of Governors is responsible for the management of property and revenue, while the Senate is vested with managing the academic operation of the university. Both are composed of faculty and students who are elected to the position. Degrees and diplomas are conferred by the convocation, which is composed of alumni, administrators, and faculty, with a quorum of twenty members. UBC also has a President, who is a chief executive officer of the university and a member of the Senate, Board of Governors, Convocation, and also serves as Vice Chancellor. The President of the University is responsible for managing the academic operation of the university, including recommending appointments, calling meetings of faculties, and establishing committees.

===Faculties and schools===

UBC's academic activity is organized into "faculties" and "schools".[tpl]cite web |title= Faculties & Schools|url= http://www.ubc.ca/academic/fac_schools.html|publisher= University of British Columbia|accessdate=October 20, 2009[/tpl] Currently, UBC has twelve faculties at its Vancouver campus and seven faculties at its Okanagan campus. UBC Vancouver has two academic colleges: Interdisciplinary Studies and Health Disciplines, while UBC Okanagan has a College of Graduate Studies. At the Vancouver campus, the Faculty of Arts, which dates back to the 1915 Fairview Campus, is the largest faculty with twenty departments and schools. With the split of the Faculty of Arts and Science in 1964, the Faculty of Science is the second largest faculty with nine departments. The Sauder School of Business is UBC's Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration. The School of Architecture offers a program in architecture accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board at both the bachelor level (B.Arch.) and the master's level (M.Arch.).Architecture Canada  As of December 2012, a new school was created: UBC Vancouver School of Economics in conjunction with the Sauder School of Business.http://www.vpfinance.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/ubc_ten_year_finance_plan.pdfLast Words: November 14, 2011 edition | The Ubyssey | The Ubyssey, UBC's official student newspaper.

===Enrollment===

In 2011, UBC had 3,331 full-time Faculty, and 10,652 non-faculty employees. It had over fifty six thousand students (48,726 undergraduate students and 10,686 graduate students), and more than 275,000 alumni in 120 countries. The requirements for admission differ between students from British Columbia, other provinces in Canada, and international students due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. In 2003 the National Post stated that the university had the highest entrance requirements for undergraduate admission out of all universities in Canada.Queen's University's 'back door' is in England: Easier to gain admission to campus at 15th-century castle, Heather Sokoloff, National Post, June 5, 2003 The secondary school average for full-time first-year students at the university in 2009–2010 was 89.5 percent for the Vancouver campus, and 82.2% for the Okanagan campus.

===Sustainability===

UBC has been ranked in the Corporate Knights school rankings, which ranks universities based on how they integrate sustainability into the learning experience. The rankings adopt a broad definition of sustainability which encompasses both environmental and social concerns. In the 2011 rankings, UBC was ranked 2nd in the category: top 5 teaching programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corporateknights.com/report/8th-annual-knight-schools-results/knight-schools|title=8th Annual Knight Schools Results|date=27 September 2011|publisher=Corporate Knights Inc.|accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl] In the ranking of the Canadian law schools, UBC's law school ranked fifth. In the ranking of the MBA programs, Sauder School of Business was ranked fourth in Canada. The same rankings placed the business school 11th in Canada for its undergraduate business program.
The University strives to be a world leader in sustainability and sustainable development, aiming to meet the needs of the growing student and faculty population while preserving the environment. The Center for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) building is a recent addition to the Vancouver campus and it exemplifies the University’s sustainable practices.  Developed to create the most sustainable society at UBC, the building has been called the most sustainable, innovative, and high performance building in North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com|title=Learning teaching in the sustainability classroom|date=23 October 2007|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl] The CIRS building was first thought of in 2000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cirs.ubc.ca/building|title=The Building|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl] and was the brainchild of Doctor John Robinson, a sustainable development research initiative professor.

The CIRS building exhibits regenerative sustainability, meaning that the building improves the environment around it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8B56CNOtfw|title=CIRS Overview with Dr. John Robinson|date=8 November 2010|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl]  For example, it uses the neighbouring Earth and Ocean Sciences (EOSC) Building in order to heat itself. The EOSC building uses roughly 1600 megawatts of heat energy and goes through ten air changes every hour, wasting around 900 megawatts of that energy. The engineers who built the CIRS building saw this as an opportunity; they take the heat that has been expelled from the EOSC building, use 300 megawatts to heat the CIRS building, and send back 600 megawatts to the EOSC building so that it can heat itself. In this way, the CIRS building is restoring its surrounding environment. The CIRS building is designed to be net positive in four ways environmentally, meaning that the processes or products that leave the building are more environmentally friendly than those that go into it. The best example of the net positivity of the building is the wood it is made of; the wood the building is made of holds within is nearly 600 tons of carbon, this is more carbon than that which has been by the construction of the building, as well as the manufacturing that goes on inside the building today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjExkoDMH4|title=David Suzuki at UBC Celebrating CIRS|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl] 
	Other sustainable features of the CIRS building include:
The building integrates ‘green,’ sustainable and humane features, i.e. not only does it have a small ecological footprint, it also serves as an environment for occupants to be happy, healthy, and productive within. This is the direction that the University of British Columbia is moving towards in order to continue their ideas of sustainable development.

===Aboriginal===

UBC’s Longhouse is the University's centre for Aboriginal activities.   The university has an Associate Dean of Indigenous Education, and  has developed governing board and senate policies as well as Aboriginal governed councils within the university structure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/cms-filesystem-action?file=pdfs/conferences/2007/aboriginal-rt-spring-report.pdf |title=. The University of Winnipeg |format=PDF |accessdate=October 6, 2008[/tpl] UBC offers degrees in First Nations Studies through a program in the Arts Faculty, and a Chinook Diploma Program in the Sauder School of Business; it also runs the Chinook Summer Biz Camp, to   foster  entrepreneurship among First Nations and Métis high school students.  It hosts a Bridge Through Sport Program, Summer Science Program, Native Youth Program, and Cedar Day Camp and Afterschool Program.  Its  First Nations Forestry Initiatives were developed in partnership with specific Aboriginal communities to meet needs in their more remote areas.

==Finances==

As a public university, UBC is not as dependent on its endowment for operating revenue as some of its international peers. For 2006–2007, UBC had expected a $36 million deficit. With various cost cutting measures, the University posted a small surplus of $1.92 million.  As of March 2007, UBC had assets of $3.2 billion and liabilities of $1.8 billion. Total revenue for 2006–2007 was $1.59 billion, of which 36% came from the provincial government, 11% from the federal government, 17% from "sales of goods and services", 18% from tuition, and 18% from all other sources. Total expenses were $1.50 billion, of which salaries, wages, benefits, and honoraria were 59%, office supplies and expenses were 12%, amortization was 9%, and all other expenses were 20%.UBC Financial Statements, March 31, 2007 Less than 1% of expenses went to fundraising.[ref]

===Tuition===

Tuition fees vary significantly between Canadian citizens (and permanent residents) and international students. In addition, for both undergraduate and graduate programs, tuition rates vary between the university's different faculties. Students must also pay for various living expenses such as housing, food and student healthcare. As of the 2012–2013 school year, these expenses were estimated at around $13,000 CAD per academic year.https://you.ubc.ca/ubc/vancouver/cost.ezchttp://www.students.ubc.ca/coursesreg/tuition-fees-deposits/tuition-fees/http://connectionsforlife.ubc.ca/tuition-costs

====Undergraduate tuition====

UBC tuition for 2012 was $4,700 before adding other mandatory administrative fees for a Canadian student in a basic 30-unit program, though various programs cost from $3,406 to $9,640. Tuition for international students is significantly higher (2.3–4.6 times higher than domestic students). In 2012, tuition for international students ranged from $16,245 CAD to $25,721 CAD.Undergraduate tuition & student fees
In 2001–02, UBC had one of the lowest undergraduate tuition rates in Canada, at an average of $2,181 CAD per year for a full-time programme. This was due to a government-instituted tuition freeze.  In 2001, however, the BC Liberal party defeated the NDP in British Columbia and lifted the tuition freeze. In 2002–03 undergraduate and graduate tuition rose by an average of 30%, and by up to 40% in some faculties. This has led to better facilities, but also to student unrest and contributed to a teaching assistant union strike.
UBC again increased tuition by 30% in the 2003–04 year, again by approximately 15% in the 2004–05 season, and 2% in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 years. Increases were lower than expected because, in the 2005 Speech from the Throne, the government announced that tuition increases would be capped to inflation.[ref]
</ref> In 2006–07, the Canadian average undergraduate tuition fee was $4,347 and the BC average was $4,960.<ref>

[/ref]

====Graduate tuition====

In the academic year 2011/2012 most research-based graduate programs assess tuition of $4,263.87 per semester for Canadian students and permanent residents or $7,490.88 for international students.Master's tuition feeDoctoral tuition fee International students without any external funding that meet the general eligibility criteria will be supported with guaranteed funding of up to $3,200 per year.International Partial Tuition Scholarship – Scholarships, Awards and Funding – Fellowships – Bursaries – Grad School Tuition for professional Master's programs varies.

==Student life==

===Student representation===

UBC undergraduate students within the Vancouver campus are represented by the Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, or AMS. The society's mandate is to improve the quality of educational, social, and personal lives of UBC students. The AMS lobbies the UBC administration on behalf of the student body, provides services, such as the AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan, supports and administers student clubs, and maintains the Student Union Building (aka SUB) and the services it houses. IN 2013 the AMS began construction on a new $103 million Student UNion Building.
Graduate Students are represented by the Graduate Student Society (GSS) which operates as an independent entity. The GSS is governed by a council representing each graduate program and an executive elected by graduate students as a whole.http://gss.ubc.ca/main/?page_id=71

===Student facilities===

The heart of student activity at UBC Vancouver is the centrally located Student Union Building, which houses offices of many clubs, half a dozen restaurants and cafés, a pub ("The Pit"), a nightclub ("The Gallery"), the inexpensive 425-seat Norman Bouchard Memorial Theatre ("The Norm Theatre"), several shops and a post office. The majority of the outlets and shops in the SUB are run by the AMS, however the addition of major corporate outlets in recent years by UBC Food Services has generated some controversy. The SUB Art Gallery contains mostly students' work. An underground bus loop slated to replace the "Grassy Knoll" beside the SUB, did not receive funding by Translink.
As a result, the bus loop project has been cancelled by the administration, although the rest of the renovations of the University Boulevard Neighbourhood are still under consideration.
Other student facilities on campus include the Ladha Science Student Centre, which was funded through a donation from Abdul Ladha, a levy from all Science undergraduate students, the VP Students, and the Dean of Science, and the Meekison Arts Student Space, which is located in the Faculty of Art's Buchanan D building. The UBC Bookstore has two locations on the Vancouver campus, the main store at 6200 University Boulevard, and one at the Sauder School of Business. There are also stores at the Okanagan and Robson Square Campuses. The Bookstore provides a range of products and services. It returns a large dividend back to UBC each year which is re-invested in the campus or in student and community organizations.The University of British Columbia. UBC Bookstore: About Us.

===Greek organizations===

While UBC's Greek system is somewhat smaller than its counterparts in the United States, it does offer the largest and most active Greek system in Canada. There is a total of 18 Greek organizations. An InterFraternal Council (IFC) is recognized as a club by the Alma Mater Society and meetings of the fraternities under IFC occur at their respective fraternity houses each week. Greek life has its own division within UBC REC]UBC REC – Unit Point Standings and intense competition between the 9 Fraternities for the title of top Athletic Fraternity occur.
There are ten international fraternities on campus, the first of which, Alpha Delta Phi, was established in 1926. However Alpha Delta Phi was preceded by several local fraternities on campus. Other fraternities include Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, Sigma Chi,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ubcsigs.com/[/tpl] Beta Theta Pi,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ubcbeta.com/|title=Home – Gamma Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi |publisher=Betaubc.ca |accessdate=October 13, 2008[/tpl] Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Kappa Sigma, and Zeta Psi which re-chartered at UBC in 2013.
The National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) member organizations (sororities) on campus are overseen by the Panhellenic Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ubcsororities.com |title=UBC Sororities | get involved. UBC |publisher=Ubcsororities.com |accessdate=October 6, 2008[/tpl] All sororities have a chapter room in the Panhellenic House on Wesbrook Mall; the building also offers housing for 72 college women, with preference given to sorority members.
The eight sororities on the Vancouver campus include Alpha Delta Pi,  Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. The current Panhellenic total is 81. Chapter meetings are held in the chapter's respective rooms each week or in classrooms and Greek-wide or campus-wide events are attended by members of all the sororities and fraternities. Formal recruitment for the sororities begin during the second week of September and is a 4-day process consisting of: Tours (first 2 days), Invitationals and Preference.
Phrateres has traditionally been affiliated with the Greek system since its installation at UBC in 1935. Historical records indicate that for many years, members identified themselves, and were recognized as Greek. Members interacted with fraternities on a similar basis as the sororities, and participated in many Greek events, such as Songfest and exchanges. However, they presently operate as a self-governing organization under the Alma Mater Society with the closure of their international headquarters in 2001.
Moreover, UBC was ranked among Canada's top party schools by the website Ask Men. In the latest ranking, UBC was ranked 7th, ahead of Queen's University and below Concordia University.http://ca.askmen.com/top_10/travel_top_ten_100/145b_travel_top_ten.html

===Residences===

According to a 2009 UBC Student Housing Study, UBC currently provides approximately 8680 beds on the Point Grey campus for an on-campus student population of about 11,000 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planning.ubc.ca/news_events/whats_new/articles263.php|title=UBC Student Housing Demand Study|publisher=UBC Planning|date=December 2009|accessdate=January 26, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The UBC administration has recognized the need for more student housing on campus, forecasting the need for 6400 new beds on campus within the next 20 years, and has expanded housing with the opening of the Marine Drive towers and the MBA house residence on South Campus.
As of the 2012–2013 school year, there are two dormitory style residences on campus, primarily for first and second-year students: Totem Park and Place Vanier.http://www.housing.ubc.ca/student-residences-van/choose-the-right-residence Totem Park, housing about 1757 students, consists of eight dormitory buildings (Nootka, Dene, Haida, Salish, Kwakiutl, Shuswap, Həm'ləsəm' and Q'ələχən Houses), and a Commons Block (Coquihalla). All houses, except Shuswap, are co-ed, with alternating men's and women's floors; Shuswap house has co-ed floors.  Both Həm'ləsəm' and Q'ələχən houses were opened to residents of Totem Park in September 2011 and consist of single rooms with semi-private or private washrooms in contrast to the other house's communal floor washrooms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.housing.ubc.ca/totem-park/totem-overview/389 |title=həm’ləsəm’ |publisher=Housing.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl]
Place Vanier, housing 1370 people, consists of 12 blocks constructed in 1959 (Robson House), 1960 (Okanagan, Sherwood Lett, Mackenzie, Ross, Hamber and Mawdsley Houses), 1961 (Kootenay House), 1968 (Cariboo and Tweedsmuir Houses), 2002 (Korea-UBC House) and 2003 (Tec de Monterrey-UBC House). The buildings vary from Male and Female only, to alternating gender floors, as well as fully mixed floors. The residences have both single and double rooms, with each floor having a lounge and communal bathrooms.
Students nineteen and above have suite-style residence options on the Point Grey campus. The Gage Towers consist of three 17-floor towers (North, South and East) primarily for second, third, and fourth-year undergraduate students. It consists of three interconnected towers (North, South, and East) as well as single student housing (both studio, and apartment) in a building. The towers are composed of "quads": four separate pods, each consisting of six individual bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen-dining area.http://www.housing.ubc.ca/walter-gage/overview
Adjacent to the Acadia Park residence area on the east part of campus is Fairview Crescent, a residence primarily for second- and third-year undergraduate students, and many graduate students as well. The residence consists of an L-shaped pedestrian-only street lined with 4, 5 and six-student (a mix of single-sex and co-ed) townhouses. The Beanery coffee shop is in the middle of the residence.
The Thunderbird residences are primarily for graduate students and fourth-year undergraduate students; they are located at the southern edge of the academic core campus. The Ritsumeikan-UBC House is a residence with a Japanese cultural setting, named for Ritsumeikan University. It houses Japanese exchange students and Canadian students, who participate in unique inter-cultural programmes. The residence's tatami room is used for practice sessions by the UBC Urasenke Japanese tea ceremony club. Two Canadian students are typically paired with two Japanese exchange students.
Marine Drive Residence is situated on the west side of campus slightly south of Place Vanier. The first phase, consisting of Building 1 (an 18-floor tower) and Building 2 (a five-floor building commonly called the "Podium") opened fall 2005, and is the most expensive residence on campus. In February 2006, the Board of Governors approved plans for the second phase of Marine Drive, finally putting an end to the debacle caused by concerns over the view of Wreck beach (Phase I's Building 1 was reduced from 20 floors to 18 because of this). Phase II consists of Buildings 4 through 6 (two towers and another "Podium", respectively), and also the Commonsblock.  Buildings 4 through 6 were all open to students as of September 2008.  A separate Commonsblock (the current Front Desk being located in building 1) was completed in summer 2009, and contains similar services to the Commonsblocks of other residences, such as exercise, game, and study rooms.  Construction at Marine Drive was completed in February 2010, with the opening of a restaurant in building 4.
The newest addition to UBC Vancouver's student housing is the Ponderosa Commons Residence.
The university has two colleges dedicated to accommodation for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars: St. John's CollegeSt. John's College, University of British Columbia (UBC), Residential Graduate College and Green College.Graduate Residential College | Green College UBC

===Campus events===

A small number of large-scale, campus-wide events occur annually at UBC which are organized by university institutions, the AMS, and student constituencies of various faculties and departments. UBC Orientations organizes several events for first-year students, such as Imagine UBC, GALA, and UBC Jump Start. Imagine UBC is an orientation day and pep rally for first-year undergraduate students that replaces the first day of September classes at UBC Vancouver.http://newtoubc.students.ubc.ca/get-oriented/undergraduate-students
Several group athletic events take place at UBC every year. Storm the Wall is an intramural relay race put on by UBC REC in April, culminating in the climbing of a [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wall.  Day of the Longboat is an intramural event put on at the end of September/early October by UBC REC. It is a major voyageur canoe race with teams competing in a 2 km paddle around the waters of Jericho Sailing Centre. The program is operated by over 120 volunteer students and staff who are responsible for operating every aspect of this program. UBC REC's student administrators fill various roles including event planning, sport officiating, public relations and building supervision.
Faculty constituencies, such as the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS) and Science Undergraduate Society (SUS), hold events annually. Many of the major constituencies, such as for Arts, Science, and Engineering, hold their own faculty weeks to celebrate their faculties. The events may include keynote speeches, merchandise sales, and dances. Arts County Fair was an annual concert and party on the last day of classes in April, put on by the AUS and occurring at Thunderbird Stadium.  Past headliners have included Sam Roberts, The New Pornographers, and Metric.  Due to increasing financial difficulties (mostly resulting from mounting security and related costs) the AUS announced they would not continue the event in 2008. In its place, the Alma Mater Society of UBC hosted the AMS Block Party to celebrate the end of classes.
A number of unofficial 'traditions,' exist at UBC: jumping from the UBC Aquatic Centre's outdoor 10-metre diving board late at night; and frequent repainting of the Engineering cairn, refashioning its large red-and-white 'E' into other letters representative of other faculties, clubs, and groups.
In March 2012, UBC was the partner Host University of the Harvard World Model United Nations Conference (WorldMUN 2012 Vancouver). As the world's largest student-organized Model UN conference, this was also the largest student conference to have ever been organized by UBC and the largest student conference on Canadian soil.http://www.vancouver2012.org/http://www.vancouver2012.org/?page=about_worldmun There were 2,200 student delegates and nearly 200 faculty advisors from 270 universities from over 60 countries. The organizing committee amassed over 500 student volunteers from across the UBC campus and the local student community to execute the week-long event.
