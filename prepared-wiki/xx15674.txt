Toilet paper is a soft tissue paper product primarily used for the cleaning of the anus to remove fecal material after defecation or to remove remaining droplets of urine from the genitals after urination, and acts as a layer of protection for the hands during this process. It is typically sold as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a paperboard core, to be stored in a dispenser adjacent to a toilet. Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in septic tanks, whereas some other bathroom and facial tissues are not. Toilet paper can be one-, two- or three-ply, or even thicker, meaning that it is either a single sheet or multiple sheets placed back-to-back to make it thicker, softer, stronger and more absorbent. 
The use of paper for such hygiene purposes has been recorded in China in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass-produced in the 14th century. Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883.
Different names, euphemisms and slang terms are used for toilet paper in countries around the world, including "bumf," "bum wad," "loo roll/paper," "bog roll," "toilet roll," "dunny roll/paper," "bathroom/toilet tissue," "TP," "arsewipe," and just "tissue."

==History==

Although paper had been known as a wrapping and padding material in China since the 2nd century BC,Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 122. the first documented use of toilet paper in human history dates back to the 6th century AD, in early medieval China.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 123. In 589 AD the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591) wrote about the use of toilet paper:
During the later Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), an Arab traveller to China in the year 851 AD remarked:
During the early 14th century, it was recorded that in modern-day Zhejiang province alone there was an annual manufacturing of toilet paper amounting in ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper each. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), it was recorded in 1393 that an annual supply of 720,000 sheets of toilet paper (two by three feet in size) were produced for the general use of the imperial court at the capital of Nanjing. From the records of the Imperial Bureau of Supplies of that same year, it was also recorded that for Emperor Hongwu's imperial family alone, there were 15,000 sheets of special soft-fabric toilet paper made, and each sheet of toilet paper was even perfumed.
Elsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with wool, lace or hemp, while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, leaves, grass, hay, stone, sand, moss, water, snow, maize, ferns, many apple plant husks, fruit skins, or seashells, and corncobs, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after usage, placed back in a bucket of saltwater. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b). These are all cited in the classic Biblical and Talmudic Medicine by the German physician Julius Preuss (Eng. trans. Sanhedrin Press, 1978).
The 16th-century French satirical writer François Rabelais, in Chapter XIII of Book 1 of his novel-sequence Gargantua and Pantagruel, has his character Gargantua investigate a great number of ways of cleansing oneself after defecating. Gargantua dismisses the use of paper as ineffective, rhyming that: "Who his foul tail with paper wipes, Shall at his ballocks leave some chips." (Sir Thomas Urquhart's 1653 English translation). He concludes that "the neck of a goose, that is well downed" provides an optimum cleansing medium.[tpl]cite web |author=François Rabelais |title=Gargantua and Pantagruel |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rabelais/francois/r11g/book1.13.html |publisher=eBooks@Adelaide |location=The University of Adelaide, Australia |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]
In many parts of the world, especially where toilet paper or the necessary plumbing for disposal may be unavailable or unaffordable, toilet paper is not used. Also, in many parts of the world such as India, people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenews-messenger.com/article/20120221/NEWS01/202210308/Teen-takes-mission-trip-India|quote=[tpl]space[/tpl]'In most of India, they don't use toilet paper.

===As a commodity===

Joseph Gayetty is widely credited with being the inventor of modern commercially available toilet paper in the United States.  Gayetty's paper, first introduced in 1857, was available as late as the 1920s.  Gayetty's Medicated Paper was sold in packages of flat sheets, watermarked with the inventor's name.  Original advertisements for the product used the tagline "The greatest necessity of the age! Gayetty's medicated paper for the water-closet."
Seth Wheeler of Albany, New York, obtained the earliest United States patents for toilet paper and dispensers, the types of which eventually were in common usage in that country, in 1883.The first of note is for the idea of perforating commercial papers (25 July 1871, #117355), the application for which includes an illustration of a perforated roll of paper. On 13 February 1883 he was granted patent #272369, which presented a roll of perforated wrapping or toilet paper supported in the center with a tube. Wheeler also had patents for mounted brackets that held the rolls. See also Joseph Nathan Kane, "Famous First Facts: A Record of First Happenings, Discoveries and Inventions in the United States" (H. W. Wilson: 1964), p. 434; Harper's Magazine, volume. Q, 1941-1943 (Harper's Magazine Co.:1941), p. 181; Jules Heller, "Paper Making" (Watson-Guptill:1978), p. 193.
Moist toilet paper was first introduced in the United Kingdom by Andrex in the 1990s, and in the United States  by Kimberly-Clark in 2001 (in lieu of bidets which are rare in those countries.) It is designed to clean better than dry toilet paper after defecation, and may be useful for women during menstruation.
Twenty-six billion rolls of toilet paper, worth about US$2.4 billion, are sold yearly in America alone. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per capita per year."Mr. Whipple Left It Out: Soft Is Rough on Forests" by Leslie Kaufman, The New York Times, 25 February 2009, Retrieved 2-26-09.

==Description==

Toilet paper is available in several types of paper, a variety of patterns, decorations, and textures, and it may be moistened or perfumed, although fragrances sometimes cause problems for users who are allergic to perfumes. The average measures of a modern roll of toilet paper is ~10 cm (3 15/16 in.) wide, ø 12 cm (4 23/32 in.) and weighs about 227 grams (8 oz.).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.toiletpaperhistory.net/toilet-paper-facts/toilet-paper-fun-facts/ | title = Toilet paper fun facts | work = ToiletPaperHistory.com [/tpl]

===Materials===

Toilet paper products vary greatly in the distinguishing technical factors, such as size, weight, roughness, softness, chemical residues, "finger-breakthrough" resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require or demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.
Quality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper. Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger. Premium toilet paper may have lotion and wax and has two to four plies of very finely pulped paper. If it is marketed as "luxury", it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with aloe or other perfumes.
In order to advance decomposition of the paper in septic tanks or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres).
A German quip says that the toilet paper of Nazi Germany was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the Völkischer Beobachter instead, because the paper was softer.Read, Anthony and Fisher, David The Fall of Berlin London: Pimlico, 1993.

===Color and design===

Colored toilet paper in colors such as pink, lavender, light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one's bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s.  Up until 2004, Scott was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink.  However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
Today, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand. Colored toilet paper remains commonly available in some European countries.

==Installation==

===Dispensers===

A toilet roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. There are at least seven types of holders:

===Orientation===

There are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a horizontal axle parallel to the wall: the toilet paper may hang over or under the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit. In surveys of American consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer over.

===Decoration===

Toilegami refers to toilet paper origami. Like table napkins, some fancy Japanese hotels fold the first squares of toilet paper on its dispenser to be presented in a fashionable way.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.origami-resource-center.com/toilet-paper-origami.html | title = Toilet Paper Origami | work = Origami Resource Center[/tpl]

===Vandalism===

Toilet paper has been the primary tool in an act of vandalism known as "TP-ing" (pronounced Teepeeing).[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] TP-ing, or "toilet papering", is often favored by adolescents and teenagers and is the act of throwing rolls of toilet paper over cars, trees, houses and gardens, causing the toilet paper to unfurl and cover the property, creating an inconvenient mess.
Another popular method of toilet paper vandalism is called "spitballing" or "wet TP-ing".[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] This involves wadding up a handful of toilet paper, soaking it in water or any other liquid and throwing it at a target, usually the ceiling. The wad of toilet paper is usually adhesive due to its moist state, which causes it to stick to the target for maximum inconvenience.

==Mechanics==

Alexander Balankin and coauthors have studied the behavior of toilet paper under tensile stress[tpl]sfn|Balankin|Susarrey Huerta|Bravo|2001[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Balankin|Susarrey Huerta|Urriolagoitia Calderón|Hernández|2002[/tpl] and during wetting and burning.[tpl]sfn|Balankin|Matamoros|2002[/tpl]
Toilet paper has been used in physics education to demonstrate the concepts of torque, moment of inertia, and angular momentum;[tpl]sfn|Harkay|2006[/tpl][tpl]sfn| Goodwin|1985[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Walker|1975[/tpl] and the conservation of momentum and energy.[tpl]sfn|Ehrlich|1997[/tpl]

==Usage==

===Environmental considerations===

One tree produces about [tpl]convert|100|lb[/tpl] of toilet paper and about 83 million rolls are produced per day. Global toilet paper production consumes 27,000 trees daily.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/thegreenguide/2010/04/27000-trees-a-day-used-for-toilet-tissue.html |title=Toilet paper wipes out 27,000 trees a day - National Geographic's Green Guide |publisher=Blogs.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2012-02-26[/tpl]
Twenty-six billion rolls of toilet paper, worth about US$2.4 billion, are sold yearly in America alone. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per capita a year. The average American uses [tpl]convert|50|lb[/tpl] of tissue paper per year which is 50% more than the average of other Western countries or Japan.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.simpleecology.com/eco/soft-tissue-paper.html | title =Soft Tissue Paper is Hard on the Environment | work = Simple Ecology | date = 2009-08-22[/tpl] The higher usage in the United States may be explained by the fact that other countries people utilize bidets or spray hoses to clean themselves.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/euro-style-personal-hygiene-with-the-bidet/index.html | title =Euro-style Personal Hygiene With the Bidet | work = hgtv.com | date = 2012-02-27[/tpl] Millions of trees are harvested in North and South America leaving ecological footprint concerns.[tpl]cite web | url = http://members.greenpeace.org/blog/greenpeaceusa_blog/2009/02/26/destroying_forest_to_make_toilet_paper_i | title = Destroying forests to make toilet paper is "worse than driving Hummers" | work = Green Peace | date = 2009-02-26 | last = Lindsey[/tpl] Citizens of many western countries sometimes use toilet paper for industrial purposes such as oil filters,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frantzoil.com/TOILETPAPER.html |title=Toilet paper Oil Filters |publisher=Frantzoil.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-02-26[/tpl] which may distort the usage statistics.
[tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], between 22% and 48% of the toilet paper used in the United States comes from tree farms in the U.S. and South America, with most of the rest coming from second growth forests, and only a small percentage coming from virgin forests.
