The Beijing-based Standard Chinese pronunciation is rendered in Wade-Giles as Ch'ung-ch'ing, and in the latter 20th Century this form was used officially in Taiwan and in Western academic literature.[/tpl]) is a major city in Southwest China and one of the five national central cities in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Administratively, it is one of the PRC's four direct-controlled municipalities (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and the only such municipality in inland China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/chinamaps/tp/china-municipalities.htm |title=China's Direct-Controlled Municipalities |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=1997-03-14 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
The municipality was created on 14 March 1997, succeeding the sub-provincial city administration that was part of Sichuan province. As of April 29, 2011, the municipality had a population of 28,846,170,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.163.com/11/0503/01/733HTAIV00014AED.html|title=重庆市2010年第六次全国人口普查主要数据公报|publisher=Netease|date= 2011-05-03[/tpl] although the urbanized area is estimated to have a population of only 6 or 7 million,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16761784 | work=BBC News | title=The world's biggest cities: How do you measure them? | date=29 January 2012[/tpl] whereas the greater area comprises some 34.000.000 people all together. Chongqing is the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, and comprises 19 districts, 15 counties, and 4 autonomous counties.
The official abbreviation of the city, [tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|渝[/tpl][/tpl] (Yú), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/1702/2005-9-8/17@159525.htm |title=Chongqing's Official Abbreviation |publisher=English.cri.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] Chongqing was also a municipality of the Republic of China (ROC) administration, serving as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). Its abbreviated name is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.
Chongqing has a significant history and culture and serves as the economic centre of the upstream Yangtze basin. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub and in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, was named as one of the 13 emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx |title=EIU Report |publisher=Eiu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

==History==

Tradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.  The Ba people supposedly established Chongqing during the Spring and Autumn period after moving from their first capital Yicheng ([tpl]lang|zh|夷城[/tpl]) in Hubei under pressure from Chu. This new capital  was first named Jiangzhou ([tpl]lang|zh|江州[/tpl]).[tpl]cite book |title= Chongqing & The Three Gorges |author= Kim Hunter Gordon, Jesse Watson |publisher= |year=2011 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vSNOR3qt6DwC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=38–40 |isbn=978-7-5022-5215-1 [/tpl] In 316 BC, however, the state of Ba was conquered by the State of Qin.
Jiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Southern and Northern Dynasties to Chu Prefecture ([tpl]lang|zh|楚州[/tpl]), then in 581 AD (Sui Dynasty) to Yu Prefecture ([tpl]lang|zh|渝州[/tpl]), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture ([tpl]lang|zh|恭州[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |title=Chongqing's History with the State of Ba |publisher=Chongqing Municipal Government |date=06-12-2007 [/tpl]  The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (Central Yu).  It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song Dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a "double celebration" ([tpl]zh|s=双重喜庆 |t=雙重喜慶|p=shuāngchóng xǐqìng[/tpl], or chongqing in short).  In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore renamed Chongqing subprefecture marking the occasion of his enthronement.
In 1362, (Yuan Dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebelling leader, established the Daxia Kingdom ([tpl]lang|zh|大夏[/tpl]) at Chongqing for a short time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://neohumanism.org/m/mi/ming_yuzhen.html |title=Ming Yuzhen Information |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Neohumanism.com |accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] In 1621 (Ming Dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang ([tpl]lang|zh|大梁[/tpl]) was established by She Chongming ([tpl]lang|zh|奢崇明[/tpl]) with Chongqing as its capital.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xXLg4cTZcDkC&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&dq=she+chongming+empire&source=bl&ots=_ZgC33mllw&sig=DxUZj2d-2QgmgIfdURvtmYuXOkU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=D6nxT4zHDpCO8wSP55GAAg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=she%20chongming%20empire&f=false |title=Political Frontiers, Ethnic Boundaries, and Human Geographies in Chinese History |author=Nicola di Cosmo, Don J. Wyatt |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl] In 1644, after the fall of the Ming Dynasty to rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province.  The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing Dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of Qing emperor.
In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/subject/2005/2005-08/12/content_4869354.htm |title=UK Consulate Page |publisher=Cq.xinhuanet.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mitchellteachers.org/ChinaTour/UnitRoleofWater/YangtzeRiverTourStop6Chongqing.htm |title=Chongqing Opens Itself To Foreigners |publisher=Mitchellteachers.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896-1904.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/subject/2005/2005-08/12/content_4868903.htm |title=French Consulate Page |publisher=Cq.xinhuanet.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chongqing.cn.emb-japan.go.jp/index_c.htm |title=Japanese Consulate Page |publisher=Chongqing.cn.emb-japan.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.us-passport-service-guide.com/us-consulate-in-china.html |title=US Consulate Page |publisher=Us-passport-service-guide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://2011.cqlib.cn/article_detail.asp?cid=13&rid=1&did=622 |title=German Consulate Page |publisher=2011.cqlib.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Provisional capital of the Republic of China===

In 1929, Chongqing (then known almost universally as Chungking) became a municipality in the Republic of China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. More than 50 embassies moved to Chongqing with the Kuomintang (KMT) government at the time, and by now, some of which are still well protected. During this time, the Allies set up the Chinese Anti-fascist headquarters in Chongqing, which was responsible for directing the allied army of China, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and Malaysia. It was under the direction of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and General Joseph Stilwell. The Japanese Air Force heavily bombed it. Due to its mountainous environment, many people were saved from the bombing. Due to the bravery, contributions and sacrifices made by the local people during World War II, Chongqing became known as the City of Heroes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://daveporter.typepad.com/global_strategies/2012/02/chongqing-china.html |title=Chongqing in World War II |publisher=Daveporter.typepad.com |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949 the Nationalist KMT government fled the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/wwii/06/p1/mjm/WWII-Chang.html |title=WWII Era History of Chongqing |publisher=.needham.k12.ma.us |date=1944-10-23 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Municipality status===

On 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanzhou, and Qianjiang prefecture-level districts that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on the 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the five National Central/Core cities, the other four are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6892862.html |title=Chongqing becomes 5th National Central city |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is one of the 3 National New Areas, the other two being Pudong new area in Shanghai and Binhai new area in Tianjin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gochina.scmp.com/chongqing/business/room-expansion |title=Establishment of the Liangjiang New Area |publisher=Gochina.scmp.com |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Organised crime, the gang trials and Bo's fall from grace===

In the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a massive crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, 'outlaws' and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over.Chongqing on the mend after crackdown on criminal gangs, SCMP, 5 Oct 2009 However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for "coaching his client to make false claims of torture" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail.lawyer reveals Bo Xilai's use of torture[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
On 14 November 2011, British citizen Neil Heywood was found dead in his Chongqing hotel room, while he was staying at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel, a popular secluded three-star resort in the city.[tpl]cite web|author=Simon Tomlinson |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2131101/Neil-Heywood-death-Inside-Chinese-hotel-poisoned-UK-businessman-met-fate.html |title=Neil Heywood's Hotel Stay |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]  At the time, local authorities declared he had died from alcohol over-consumption, though his family noted that he was not a heavy drinker. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood’s death was a homicide, and Bo Xilai was implicated. Heywood served as an intermediary linking western companies to powerful Chinese politicians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/british-fixers-murky-death-linked-to-fallen-leaders-wife/story-fnb64oi6-1226315844589|title=British fixer Neil Heywood's murky death linked to fallen leader Bo Xilai's wife |date=2 April 2012|work=Michael Sheridan|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] He was a long-time associate of the Bo family: he reportedly shared a close personal relationship with Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, and had helped the couple’s son earn admission to the Harrow School in England.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/world/asia/bo-xilai-scandal-and-the-mysterious-neil-heywood.html |title=Briton’s Wanderings Led Him to Heart of a Chinese Scandal |author=Sharon Lafraniere, John F.

In October 2011, Heywood reportedly had a business dispute with Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, when he demanded a higher commission for his services. The dispute escalated, with Heywood ultimately threatening to reveal the family’s business dealings and overseas assets, estimated to total in excess of $136 million.Michael Forsythe  Bo Xilai Clan Links Included Citigroup Hiring of Elder Son, Bloomberg, 23 April 2012[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9206308/Neil-Heywood-killed-because-he-threatened-to-expose-Gu-Kailais-money-trail.html|title=Neil Heywood killed 'because he threatened to expose Gu Kailai's money trail'.|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (UK)|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl] Heywood was then allegedly poisoned by Gu and an assistant.Damien McElroy and Malcolm Moore, Bo Xilai’s wife ‘was in the room when Neil Heywood was poisoned’, Daily Telegraph,  24 April 2012.
Then, on 6 February 2012, apparently fearing for his life, Wang Lijun traveled to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu, bringing evidence implicating Bo and his family in the Neil Heywood murder. According to reports, Wang sought and was denied asylum in the United States. Wang was privy to details of Neil Heywood's death, and had reportedly attempted to voice his concerns to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang is believed to have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo's wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations.
On 15 March 2012, Bo was dismissed as Chongqing party chief and its related municipal posts, while temporarily retaining a seat on the Politburo. Due to the potentially destructive effects Bo's dismissal would have on party unity, party elders were consulted on the matter.[tpl]cite news|last=Ansfield|first=Jonathan|title=China’s Hierarchy Strives to Regain Unity After Chongqing Leader’s Ouster|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/world/asia/chinas-leaders-seek-unity-after-ouster-of-bo-xilai.html|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 March 2012[/tpl] The decision was reportedly made at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee on 7 March, during which security tsar Zhou Yongkang cast a lone dissenting vote.

==Geography==

===Physical geography and topography===

Chongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone  often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its "night rain in the Ba Mountains". The municipality reaches a maximum width of [tpl]convert|470|km[/tpl] from east to west, and a maximum length of [tpl]convert|450|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from north to south.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1921.htm |title=Location of Chongqing |publisher=En.cq.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.
Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by mountain and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights.[tpl]cite web|author=Mountains in Sichuan and Chongqing |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/sichuan-and-chongqing/sights-nam_class:31425.html |title=Chongqing Topography |publisher=Fodors.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of [tpl]convert|665|km|abbr=on[/tpl], cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctg.com.cn/en/ |title=The Three Gorges Corp |publisher=Ctg.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] Coming from northwest and running through "the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.Wonder of the Yangtze[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city with its unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a "mountain city" and a "city on rivers".[tpl]cite web|author=Ryan Murphy |url=http://elevendegreesnorth.blogspot.com/2010/12/three-china-chongqings-rivers.html |title=Trip to Chongqing |publisher=Elevendegreesnorth.blogspot.com |date=2010-12-28 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves.

Chongqing has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), and for most of the year experiences very humid conditions. Known as one of the "Three Furnaces" of the Yangtze River, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of [tpl]convert|33|to|34|°C|°F|0[/tpl] in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August.
Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year,[ref]
</ref> is also known as the "Fog City" ([tpl]lang|zh|雾都[/tpl]), and a thick layer of fog shrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn.<ref>
