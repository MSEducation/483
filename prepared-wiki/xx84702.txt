==Professional career==

In a 15-year major league career (through the end of the 2011 season), Ordóñez was a .309 hitter with 294 home runs and 1,236 RBIs in 1,848 games. He has been selected for the All-Star Game six times (1999–2001, 2003, and 2006–07) and has won three Silver Slugger awards (2000, 2002, and 2007). In 2007, he won the American League batting title with an average of .363. He also established a career high with 139 runs batted in, and finished runner-up to Alex Rodriguez in the AL Most Valuable Player award voting.

===Chicago White Sox (1997–2004)===

Ordóñez spent the first eight years of his major league career playing with the Chicago White Sox.  In the five seasons prior to 2004, Ordóñez hit at least .300 with 29 home runs and 99 RBI, and reached the 30-home run, 100-RBI plateau in four of those seasons. He also collected over 70 extra-base hits from 2001 to 2003, but a collision with second baseman Willie Harris on Omar Vizquel's popup to right field during a May 19, 2004 game against the Cleveland Indians, cost him two trips to the disabled list and two surgeries on his left knee. He finished with .292, 9 home runs, and 37 RBI in 52 games. During the 2001 season when Ordóñez was teammates with Jose Canseco, Canseco claims he injected Ordóñez with steroids.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/jose-canseco-pumped-assist-mlb-article-1.277819 | location=New York | work=Daily News[/tpl]
During the 2003 off-season, Ordonez was almost traded to the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox and Texas Rangers had been in discussions for weeks about Boston acquiring the reigning American League MVP, SS Alex Rodriguez for outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox then agreed in principle to trade its incumbent SS Nomar Garciaparra to the White Sox for Ordonez. When the Rodriguez-for-Ramirez trade fell through, the Red Sox decided to not trade Garciaparra and the Ordonez trade was called off as well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1688365 |title=Deal would trigger Nomar-for-Ordonez |work=ESPN |date=December 18, 2003 |accessdate=March 6, 2013[/tpl]

===Detroit Tigers (2005–2011)===

Ordóñez signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent on February 7, 2005. His five-year, $85 million contract was the second largest the Tigers had ever paid a player. Because of Ordóñez's knee injury from the 2004 season, the contract included a clause stating that if he were to spend more than 25 days on the disabled list due to the same injury, the contract could be bought out for $3 million at the discretion of the Tigers' management.
After he signed with Detroit, a minor war of words occurred between Ordóñez and Ozzie Guillén, his former manager and teammate in Chicago.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2043978 |title=Skipper: Ordonez 'better shut up and play' |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |work=ESPN.com |publisher=|date= [/tpl] Their apparent mutual dislike for each other was a contributing factor to Ordóñez's departure from the White Sox. However, the rivalry appears to have cooled, as Guillén actually requested Ordóñez for the 2006 All-Star Game.
In 2005, Ordóñez's first season for Detroit, he strained an abdominal muscle during the first week of the season and spent the next three months on the disabled list, as the strain turned out to be a hernia. This caused him to rest after corrective surgery for two months following the injury, after which he began a rehabilitation assignment at the Tigers' AAA minor league team in Toledo. He returned to the Tigers' lineup in early July, and once again became a star by hitting consistently over .300 while batting clean-up.
In 2006, Ordóñez returned to  All-Star form. He was selected to the 2006 All-Star game as an injury replacement for Red Sox Left Fielder Manny Ramírez. At the All-Star break, Ordóñez was hitting .312 with 16 HR and 62 RBI, and was a mainstay for a Tigers team that was a major-league best 59–29 at the break.
On October 14, 2006, Ordóñez completed the Tigers' sweep of the ALCS with a three-run homer against Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics, with two outs on a 1–0 count in the bottom of the 9th, the 8th time in MLB history that a post-season series has ended with a home run. The win sent the Tigers to their first World Series appearance since 1984.  Coincidentally, it also happened 22 years to the day from when the Tigers won the World Series in that year.
Ordóñez had the best season of his career in 2007.  His .363 batting average, 28 home runs and 139 RBIs could be considered the best season by a Detroit Tigers batter until Miguel Cabrera won the Triple Crown in 2012. Ordonez finished second in the American League MVP race.  Magglio's records and accomplishments in 2007 include:

==Nicknames and family==

In Detroit's Comerica Park, some Tiger fans sported curly black wigs underneath their baseball caps in support of their long-haired right fielder. This ended in mid-2009 when he cut his hair.  He is also sometimes referred to affectionately as "Maggs". In mid-2006, a group of bloggers began referring to Magglio as "The Big Tilde". This nickname has been referenced on Deadspin, MLB.com, and during a Fox Sports broadcast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thebigtilde.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/todays-tilde-quaintance-fox-sports/ |title=Today's Tilde-quaintance: Fox Sports « The Big Tilde |publisher=Thebigtilde |date=April 29, 2008 |accessdate=October 9, 2011[/tpl]
