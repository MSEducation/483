 In the "conventional" Benetton B192 Schumacher took his place on the [[podium]] for the first time, finishing third in the [tpl]F1 GP|1992|Mexican[/tpl]. He went on to take his first victory at the [tpl]F1 GP|1992|Belgian[/tpl], in a wet race at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit, which by 2003 he would call "far and away my favourite track".<ref>[tpl]cite book | last = Kehm | first = Sabine | title =''Michael Schumacher.

The Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the [tpl]F1|1993[/tpl] season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[ref]
. Benetton first raced traction control at the 1993 Monaco Grand Prix, having introduced active suspension at the 1993 European Grand Prix (Domenjoz (2002) p. 40). Williams had first raced an active system in 1987 and used it throughout 1992,(Autocourse (1992) p.50) while McLaren and Ferrari both introduced active cars in the final races of the 1992 season.(Autocourse (1992) pp.42 & 80)</ref>
 Schumacher won one race, the [tpl]F1 GP|1993|Portuguese[/tpl] where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 15 races. He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.

The [tpl]F1|1994[/tpl] season was Schumacher's first Drivers' Championship. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Ayrton Senna (witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind in 2nd position) and Roland Ratzenberger during the [tpl]F1 GP|1994|San Marino[/tpl], and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[tpl]cite book | title = Michael Schumacher: The Rise of a Genius | first = Luc | last = Domenjoz | isbn = 0-7525-9228-9 | publisher=Parragon | origyear = 2002 | pages = 44–47 | year = 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Globetrotter: Rocking the boat | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gt/gt00044.html | first = Joe | last = Saward | authorlink = Joe Saward | publisher=GrandPrix.com | date = 11 August 1994 | accessdate =28 August 2008[/tpl]
Schumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the [tpl]F1 GP|1994|Spanish[/tpl], before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear. Schumacher finished the race in second place.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2003/4/288.html|title=A return to racing – Spanish Grand Prix 1994|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=The Official Formula One Website[/tpl] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of "launch control" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.
