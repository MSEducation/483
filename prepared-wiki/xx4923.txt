[[Intelligence quotient]]

CATEGORIES: Intelligence tests, Psychometrics, Intelligence, Intelligence by type

An intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. The abbreviation "IQ" comes from the German term Intelligenz-Quotient, originally coined by psychologist William Stern. When current IQ tests are developed, the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as IQ 100 and scores each standard deviation (SD) up or down are defined as 15 IQ points greater or less, although this was not always so historically. By this definition, approximately 95 percent of the population scores an IQ between 70 and 130, which is within two standard deviations of the mean.
IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as morbidity and mortality,[tpl]cite journal | author = Markus Jokela, G. David Batty, Ian J. Deary, Catharine R.

IQ scores are used as predictors of educational achievement, special needs, job performance and income. They are also used to study IQ distributions in populations and the correlations between IQ and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of differing patterns of increases in IQ battery subtest scores informs current research on human intelligence.

==History==

===Early history===

The English statistician Francis Galton made the first attempt at creating a standardised test for rating a person's intelligence. A pioneer of psychometrics and the application of statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the heritability of intelligence, he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity (by which he did not mean genes, although he did develop several pre-Mendelian theories of particulate inheritance).Bulmer, M. (1999). The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity. Journal of the History of Biology, 32(3), 263-292. Cowan, R. S. (1972). Francis Galton's contribution to genetics. Journal of the History of Biology, 5(2), 389-412. See also Burbridge, D. (2001). Francis Galton on twins, heredity and social class. British Journal for the History of Science, 34(3), 323-340. He hypothesized that there should exist a correlation between intelligence and other desirable traits like good reflexes, muscle grip, and head size.Fancher, R. E. (1983). Biographical origins of Francis Galton's psychology. Isis, 74(2), 227-233. He set up the first mental testing centre in the world in 1882 and he published "Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development" in 1883, in which he set out his theories. After gathering data on a variety of physical variables, he was unable to show any such correlation, and he eventually abandoned this research.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Gillham |first1=Nicholas W. |title=Sir Francis Galton and the birth of eugenics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11700278 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090055[/tpl]
French psychologist Alfred Binet, together with Victor Henri and Théodore Simon had more success in 1905, when they published the Binet-Simon test in 1905, which focused on verbal abilities. It was intended to identify mental retardation in school children, but in specific contradistinction to claims made by psychiatrists that these children were "sick" (not "slow") and should therefore be removed from school and cared-for in asylums.Nicolas, S., Andrieu, B., Croizet, J.-C., Sanitioso, R. B., & Burman, J. T. (2013). Sick? Or slow? On the origins of intelligence as a psychological object. Intelligence, 41(5), 699-711. doi:10.1016/j.intell.2013.08.006 (This is an open access article, made freely available by Elsevier.)
The score on the Binet-Simon scale would reveal the child's mental age. For example, a six-year-old child who passed all the tasks usually passed by six-year-olds—but nothing beyond—would have a mental age that matched his chronological age, 6.0. (Fancher, 1985).
Binet thought that intelligence was multifaceted, but came under the control of practical judgement.
In Binet's view, there were limitations with the scale and he stressed what he saw as the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures (White, 2000). American psychologist Henry H. Goddard  published a translation of it in 1910. American psychologist Lewis Terman at Stanford University revised the Binet-Simon scale, which resulted in the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales (1916). It became the most popular test in the United States for decades.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Terman |first1=Lewis M. |last2=Lyman |first2=Grace |last3=Ordahl |first3=George |last4=Ordahl |first4=Louise |last5=Galbreath |first5=Neva |last6=Talbert |first6=Wilford |title=The Stanford revision of the Binet-Simon scale and some results from its application to 1000 non-selected children |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=551–62 |year=1915 |doi=10.1037/h0075455[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Wallin |first1=J.

===General factor (g)===

The many different kinds of IQ tests use a wide variety of methods. Some tests are visual, some are verbal, some tests only use abstract-reasoning problems, and some tests concentrate on arithmetic, spatial imagery, reading, vocabulary, memory or general knowledge.
The British psychologist Charles Spearman in 1904 made the first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests. He observed that children's performance ratings across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it g for "general factor" and labelled the smaller, specific factors or abilities for specific areas s. In any collection of IQ tests, by definition the test that best measures g is the one that has the highest correlations with all the others. Most of these g-loaded tests typically involve some form of abstract reasoning. Therefore, Spearman and others have regarded g as the (perhaps genetically determined) real essence of intelligence.
This is an argument still accepted in principle by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the g factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.
However, this view is not universally accepted; other factor analyses of the data, with different results, are possible. Some psychometricians regard g as a statistical artifact. One of the most commonly used measures of g is Raven's Progressive Matrices, which is a test of visual reasoning.[tpl]cite journal |author=Neisser U |title=Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests |journal=American Scientist |volume=85 |pages=440–7 |year=1997 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/1[/tpl]

===The War Years in the United States===

During World War I, a way was needed to evaluate and assign recruits. This led to the rapid development of several mental tests.  The testing generated controversy and much public debate in the United States. Nonverbal or "performance" tests were developed for those who could not speak English or were suspected of malingering.  After the war, positive publicity on army psychological testing helped to make psychology a respected field.[tpl]cite book |first1=Carrie H. |last1=Kennedy |first2=Jeffrey A. |last2=McNeil |editor1-first=Carrie H. |editor1-last=Kennedy |editor2-first=Eric |editor2-last=Zillmer |year=2006 |chapter=A history of military psychology |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=rytCzdXGgXkC&pg=PA1 |title=Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications |pages=1–17 |location= New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-57230-724-2[/tpl] Subsequently, there was an increase in jobs and funding in psychology in the United States.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Katzell |first1=Raymond A. |last2=Austin |first2=James T. |year=1992 |title=From then to now: The development of industrial-organizational psychology in the United States |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=803–35 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.6.803[/tpl] Group intelligence tests were developed and became widely used in schools and industry.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kevles |first1=D. J. |title=Testing the Army's Intelligence: Psychologists and the Military in World War I |journal=The Journal of American History |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=565–81 |year=1968  |doi=10.2307/1891014 |jstor=1891014[/tpl]
L.L. Thurstone argued for a model of intelligence that included seven unrelated factors (verbal comprehension, word fluency, number facility, spatial visualization, associative memory, perceptual speed, reasoning, and induction). While not widely used, it influenced later theories.
David Wechsler produced the first version of his test in 1939. It gradually became more popular and overtook the Binet in the 1960s. It has been revised several times, as is common for IQ tests, to incorporate new research.  One explanation is that psychologists and educators wanted more information than the single score from the Binet. Wechsler's 10+ subtests provided this. Another is Binet focused on verbal abilities, while the Wechsler also included nonverbal abilities. The Binet has also been revised several times and is now similar to the Wechsler in several aspects, but the Wechsler continues to be the most popular test in the United States.

===Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory===

Raymond Cattell (1941) proposed two types of cognitive abilities in a revision of Spearman's concept of general intelligence. Fluid intelligence (Gf) was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning, and crystallized intelligence (Gc) was hypothesized as a knowledge-based ability that was very dependent on education and experience. In addition, fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant. The theory was almost forgotten, but was revived by his student John L. Horn (1966) who later argued Gf and Gc were only two among several factors, and he eventually identified 9 or 10 broad abilities. The theory continued to be called Gf-Gc theory.
John B. Carroll (1993), after a comprehensive reanalysis of earlier data, proposed the three stratum theory, which is a hierarchical model with three levels. The bottom stratum consists of narrow abilities that are highly specialized (e.g., induction, spelling ability). The second stratum consists of broad abilities. Carroll identified eight second-stratum abilities. Carroll accepted Spearman's concept of general intelligence, for the most part, as a representation of the uppermost, third stratum.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Lubinski, D. |year=2004 |title= Introduction to the special section on cognitive abilities: 100 years after Spearman's (1904) [tpl]' "[/tpl]General Intelligence," Objectively Determined and Measured[tpl]'-[/tpl] |journal=Journal of Personality & Social Psychology |pmid=14717630 |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=96–111 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.96[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |author=Carroll, J.B. |year=1993 |title=Human cognitive abilities: A survey of factor-analytic studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-38712-4[/tpl]
More recently (1999), a merging of the Gf-Gc theory of Cattell and Horn with Carroll's Three-Stratum theory has led to the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory. It has greatly influenced many of the current broad IQ tests.
It is argued that this reflects much of what is known about intelligence from research. A hierarchy of factors is used; g is at the top. Under it are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:
Modern tests do not necessarily measure all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ. Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment.
g was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc, which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.
Modern comprehensive IQ tests no longer give a single score. Although they still give an overall score, they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities, identifying particular strengths and weaknesses of an individual.

===Other theories===

J.P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect (1967) model used three dimensions which when combined yielded a total of 120 types of intelligence. It was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, but faded owing to both practical problems and theoretical criticisms.
Alexander Luria's earlier work on neuropsychological processes led to the PASS theory (1997). It argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring. The attention/arousal process involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus, ignoring distractions, and maintaining vigilance. Simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships. Successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order. The planning and attention/arousal components comes from structures located in the frontal lobe, and the simultaneous and successive processes come from structures located in the posterior region of the cortex.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Das, J.P., Kirby, J., & Jarman, R.F. |year=1975 |title=Simultaneous and successive synthesis: An alternative model for cognitive abilities |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=82 |pages=87–103 |doi=10.1037/h0076163[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |author=Das, J.P. |year=2000 |title=A better look at intelligence |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=11 |pages=28–33 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00162[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |author=Naglieri, J.A., & Das, J.P. |year=2002 |title=Planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive cognitive processes as a model for assessment |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=19 |pages=423–442[/tpl] It has influenced some recent IQ tests, and been seen as a complement to the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory described above.

==Current tests==

There are a variety of individually administered IQ tests in use in the English-speaking world. The most commonly used individual IQ test series is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for adults and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children for school-age test-takers. Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as "IQ" scores) include the current versions of the Stanford-Binet, Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, the Cognitive Assessment System, and the Differential Ability Scales.
Approximately 95% of the population have scores within two standard deviations (SD) of the mean. If one SD is 15 points, as is common in almost all modern tests, then 95% of the population are within a range of 70 to 130, and 98% are below 131. Alternatively, two-thirds of the population have IQ scores within one SD of the mean; i.e. within the range 85-115.
IQ scales are ordinally scaled.[tpl]Cite book|title=Psychology: An Introduction |last=Mussen |first=Paul Henry |year=1973 |publisher=Heath |location=Lexington (MA) |isbn=0-669-61382-7  |page=363 |quote=The I.Q. is essentially a rank; there are no true "units" of intellectual ability.

The correlation between IQ test results and achievement test results is about 0.7.[tpl]cite doi|10.1177/073428290302100302[/tpl]

==Reliability and validity==

Psychometricians generally regard IQ tests as having high statistical reliability.[tpl]Harvnb |Mackintosh|2011|page=169 "after the age of 8–10, IQ scores remain relatively stable: the correlation between IQ scores from age 8 to 18 and IQ at age 40 is over 0.70." [/tpl] A high reliability implies that—although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, and they may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age—the scores generally agree with one another and across time. Like all statistical quantities, any particular estimate of IQ has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate. For modern tests, the standard error of measurement is about three points. Clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes.[tpl]Cite book|title=Measuring intelligence: A guide to the administration of the new revised Stanford-Binet tests of intelligence |last1=Terman |first1=Lewis Madison |last2=Merrill |first2=MaudeA. |authorlink1=Lewis Terman |year=1937 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston (MA) |series=Riverside textbooks in education |page=44 |ref=harv [/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last1=Anastasi |first1=Anne |last2=Urbina |first2=Susana |authorlink1=Anne Anastasi |authorlink2=Susana Urbina |title=Psychological Testing |edition=Seventh |location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-02-303085-7 |year=1997 |pages=326–327|laysummary=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Psychological-Testing-7E/9780023030857.page |laydate=28 July 2010 |ref=harv [/tpl]

This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The Bell Curve after James R.

==IQ and age==

IQ can change to some degree over the course of childhood.[tpl]Cite book|title=IQ Testing 101 |last=Kaufman |first=Alan S. |authorlink=Alan S.

For decades practitioners' handbooks and textbooks on IQ testing have reported IQ declines with age after the beginning of adulthood. However, later researchers pointed out this phenomenon is related to the Flynn effect and is in part a cohort effect rather than a true aging effect.
A variety of studies of IQ and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first Wechsler Intelligence Scale drew attention to IQ differences in different age groups of adults. Current consensus is that fluid intelligence generally declines with age after early adulthood, while crystallized intelligence remains intact. Both cohort effects (the birth year of the test-takers) and practice effects (test-takers taking the same form of IQ test more than once) must be controlled to gain accurate data. It is unclear whether any lifestyle intervention can preserve fluid intelligence into older ages.[tpl]Cite book |title=IQ Testing 101 |last=Kaufman |first=Alan S. |authorlink=Alan S.

The exact peak age of fluid intelligence or crystallized intelligence remains elusive. Cross-sectional studies usually show that especially fluid intelligence peaks at a relatively young age (often in the early adulthood) while longitudinal data mostly show that intelligence is stable until the mid adulthood or later. Subsequently, intelligence seems to decline slowly.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Desjardins|first1=Richard|last2=Warnke|first2=Arne Jonas|year=2012|issn=1993-9019|doi=10.1787/5k9csvw87ckh-en|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/ageing-and-skills_5k9csvw87ckh-en|title=Ageing and Skills|series=OECD Education Working Papers[/tpl]

==Genetics and environment==

Environmental and genetic factors play a role in determining IQ. Their relative importance has been the subject of much research and debate.

===Heritability===

Heritability is defined as the proportion of variance in a trait which is attributable to genotype within a defined population in a specific environment. A number of points must be considered when interpreting heritability.International Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 35, Issue 3, June 2006. See reprint of Leowontin's 1974 article "The analysis of variance and the analysis of causes" and 2006 commentaries: http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3.toc  Heritability measures the proportion of 'variation' in a trait can be attributed to genes, and not the proportion of a trait caused by genes.  The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered.  A high heritability of a trait does not mean environmental effects, such as learning, are not involved.  Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults.
Studies have found the heritability of IQ in adult twins to be 0.7 to 0.8 and in children twins 0.45 in the Western world.[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/correlation/intelligence.pdf |title=Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns |accessdate=20 March 2014 |volume=52 |number=2 |pages=77–101, 85 |date=February 1996 |author=Neisser, Ulric et al. |journal=American Psychologist [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Plomin |first1=R. |last2=Pedersen |first2=N.

However, the opposite occurs. Heritability measures in infancy are as low as 0.2, around 0.4 in middle childhood, and as high as 0.8 in adulthood.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bouchard |first1=Thomas J. |title=Genetic Influence on Human Psychological Traits. A Survey |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=148–51 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00295.x[/tpl] One proposed explanation is that people with different genes tend to reinforce the effects of those genes, for example by seeking out different environments. Debate is ongoing about whether these heritability estimates are too high, owing to inadequate consideration of various factors — such as the environment being relatively more important in families with low socioeconomic status, or the effect of the maternal (fetal) environment.
Recent research suggests that molecular genetics of psychology and social science requires approaches that go beyond
the examination of candidate genes.http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~cfc/Chabris2012a-FalsePositivesGenesIQ.pdf

===Shared family environment===

Family members have aspects of environments in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25–0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence, it is quite low (zero in some studies). The effect for several other psychological traits is similar. These studies have not looked at the effects of extreme environments, such as in abusive families.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bouchard Jr |first1=TJ |title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities. |journal=Human biology; an international record of research |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=257–79 |year=1998 |pmid=9549239[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Plomin |first1=R |last2=Asbury |first2=K |last3=Dunn |first3=J |title=Why are children in the same family so different?

===Non-shared family environment and environment outside the family===

Although parents treat their children differently, such differential treatment explains only a small amount of nonshared environmental influence. One suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment because of different genes. More likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family.

===Individual genes===

A very large proportion of the over 17,000 human genes are thought to have an effect on the development and functionality of the brain.[tpl]cite doi|10.1002/wcs.135[/tpl] While a number of individual genes have been reported to be associated with IQ, none have a strong effect. Deary and colleagues (2009) reported that no finding of a strong gene effect on IQ has been replicated.[tpl]cite doi| 10.1007/s00439-009-0655-4[/tpl] Most reported associations of genes with intelligence are false positive results.C.

Dickens and Flynn (2001) have argued that  genes for high IQ initiate environment-shaping feedback, as genetic effects cause bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that further increase IQ. In their model, environment effects decay over time (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition in early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they caused children to persist in seeking out cognitively demanding experiences.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–69 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first1=William T. |last1=Dickens |first2=James R.|last2=Flynn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002[/tpl]

==Interventions==

In general, educational interventions, as those described below, have shown short-term effects on IQ, but long-term follow-up is often missing. For example, in the US very large intervention programs such as the Head Start Program have not produced lasting gains in IQ scores. More intensive, but much smaller projects such as the Abecedarian Project have reported lasting effects, often on Socioeconomic status variables, rather than IQ.
A placebo controlled double-blind experiment found that vegetarians who took 5 grams of creatine per day for six weeks showed a significant improvement on two separate tests of fluid intelligence, Raven's Progressive Matrices, and the backward digit span test from the WAIS. The treatment group was able to repeat longer sequences of numbers from memory and had higher overall IQ scores than the control group. The researchers concluded that "supplementation with creatine significantly increased intelligence compared with placebo."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rae|first1=Caroline|last2=Digney|first2=Alison L.|last3=McEwan|first3=Sally R.|last4=Bates|first4=Timothy C.|title=Oral creatine monohydrate supplementation improves brain performance: a double–blind, placebo–controlled, cross–over trial|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=270|issue=1529|pages=2147–50 |year=2003|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2492|pmid=14561278|pmc=1691485[/tpl] A subsequent study found that creatine supplements improved cognitive ability in the elderly.[tpl]cite journal |last1=McMorris |first1=Terry |last2=Mielcarz |first2=Gregorsz |last3=Harris |first3=Roger C. |last4=Swain |first4=Jonathan P. |last5=Howard |first5=Alan |title=Creatine Supplementation and Cognitive Performance in Elderly Individuals |journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=517–28 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/13825580600788100 |pmid=17828627[/tpl] However, a study on young adults (0.03 g/kg/day for six weeks, e.g., 2 g/day for 150-pound individual) failed to find any improvements.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rawson |first1=E |last2=Lieberman |first2=H |last3=Walsh |first3=T |last4=Zuber |first4=S |last5=Harhart |first5=J |last6=Matthews |first6=T |title=Creatine supplementation does not improve cognitive function in young adults |journal=Physiology & Behavior |volume=95 |issue=1–2 |pages=130–4 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.05.009 |pmid=18579168[/tpl]
Recent studies have shown that training in using one's working memory may increase IQ. A study on young adults published in April 2008 by a team from the Universities of Michigan and Bern supports the possibility of the transfer of fluid intelligence from specifically designed working memory training.[tpl]harv|Klingberg|Forssberg|Westerberg|2002[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Jaeggi |first1=S.

Among other questions, it remains to be seen whether the results extend to other kinds of fluid intelligence tests than the matrix test used in the study, and if so, whether, after training, fluid intelligence measures retain their correlation with educational and occupational achievement or if the value of fluid intelligence for predicting performance on other tasks changes. It is also unclear whether the training is durable of extended periods of time.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sternberg |first1=R. J. |title=Increasing fluid intelligence is possible after all |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=19 |pages=6791–2 |year=2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803396105 |pmc=2383939 |pmid=18474863[/tpl]

==Music and IQ==

Musical training in childhood has been found to correlate with higher than average IQ.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Glenn Schellenberg |first1=E. |title=Music Lessons Enhance IQ |journal=Psychological Science |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=511–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15270994 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Glenn Schellenberg |first1=E. |title=Long-term positive associations between music lessons and IQ |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=457–468 |year=2006 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.2.457[/tpl] A 2004 study indicated that 6 year-old children who received musical training (voice or piano lessons) had an average increase in IQ of 7.0 points while children who received alternative training (e.g. drama) or no training had an average increase in IQ of only 4.3 points (which may be a consequence of the children entering grade school) as indicated by full scale IQ. Children were tested using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Third Edition, Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement and Parent Rating Scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children.
Listening to classical music was reported to increase IQ; specifically spatial ability. In 1994 Frances Rauscher and Gorden Shaw reported that college students who listened to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos, showed an increase in IQ of 8 to 9 points on the spatial subtest on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = Frances H. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Gorden L. | year = 1995 | title = Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 185 | issue = | pages = 44–47 | doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4[/tpl] The phenomenon was coined the Mozart effect.
Multiple attempted replications (e.g.C. Stough, B. Kerkin, T. C. Bates and G. Mangan. (1994). Music and spatial IQ. Personality & Individual Differences, 17, http://dx.doi.org/695) have shown that this is at best a short-term effect (lasting no longer than 10 to 15 minutes), and is not related to IQ-increase.C. F. Chabris. (1999). Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? Nature, 400, author reply 827-828

===Music lessons===

In 2004, Schellenberg devised an experiment to test his hypothesis that music lessons can enhance the IQ of children. He had 144 samples of 6 year old children which were put into 4 groups; keyboard lessons, vocal lessons, drama lessons or no lessons at all, for 36 weeks. The samples' IQ was measured both before and after the lessons had taken place using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Third Edition, Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement and Parent Rating Scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children. All four groups had increases in IQ, most likely resulted by the entrance of grade school. The notable difference with the two music groups compared to the two controlled groups was a slightly higher increase in IQ. The children in the control groups on average had an increase in IQ of 4.3 points, while the increase in IQ of the music groups was 7.0 points. Though the increases in IQ were not dramatic, one can still conclude that musical lessons do have a positive effect for children, if taken at a young age. It is hypothesized that improvements in IQ occur after musical lessons because the music lessons encourage multiple experiences which generates progression in a wide range of abilities for the children. Testing this hypothesis however, has proven difficult.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|title=Music Lessons Enhance IQ|journal=Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=15|issue=8|pages=511–514|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x|pmid=15270994[/tpl]
Another test also performed by Schellenberg tested the effects of musical training in adulthood. He had two groups of adults, one group whom were musically trained and another group who were not. He administered tests of intelligence quotient and emotional intelligence to the trained and non-trained groups and found that the trained participants had an advantage in IQ over the untrained subjects even with gender, age, environmental issues (e.g. income, parent's education) held constant. The two groups, however, score similarly in the emotional intelligence test. The test results (like the previous results) show that there is a positive correlation between musical training and IQ, but it is not evident that musical training has a positive effect on emotional intelligence.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|title=Music Lessons, Emotional Intelligence, and IQ|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=December 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=185–194[/tpl]

==IQ and brain anatomy==

Several neurophysiological factors have been correlated with intelligence in humans, including the ratio of brain weight to body weight and the size, shape and activity level of different parts of the brain. Specific features that may affect IQ include the size and shape of the frontal lobes, the amount of blood and chemical activity in the frontal lobes, the total amount of gray matter in the brain, the overall thickness of the cortex and the glucose metabolic rate.

==Health and IQ==

Health is important in understanding differences in IQ test scores and other measures of cognitive ability. Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood–brain barrier is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Since about 2010 researchers such as Eppig, Hassel and MacKenzie have found a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children.Eppig. Christopher. Scientific American."Why is average IQ higher in some places?" 2011. They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it is by far the most important factor in determining population IQ. However they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition, regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.
Developed nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. lead, mercury, and organochlorides).  Improvements in nutrition, and in public policy in general, have been implicated in worldwide IQ increases. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Cognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores and health. Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences.

==Social outcomes==

Intelligence is a better predictor of educational and work success than any other single score.
Some measures of educational aptitude are essentially IQ tests[tpl]snd[/tpl] for instance, Frey and Detterman (2004) reported a correlation of 0.82 between g (general intelligence factor) and SAT scores;[tpl]cite journal |last1=Frey |first1=Meredith C. |last2=Detterman |first2=Douglas K. |title=Scholastic Assessment org? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=373–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15147489 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x[/tpl] another research found a correlation of 0.81 between g and GCSE scores, with the explained variance ranging "from 58.6% in Mathematics and 48% in English to 18.1% in Art and Design".[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Deary |first1=I |last2=Strand |first2=S |last3=Smith |first3=P |last4=Fernandes |first4=C |title=Intelligence and educational achievement |journal=Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.001[/tpl]

===School performance===

The American Psychological Association's report "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns" states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50. This means that the explained variance is 25%. Achieving good grades depends on many factors other than IQ, such as "persistence, interest in school, and willingness to study" (p. 81).
It has been found IQ correlation with school performance depends on the IQ measurement used. For undergraduate students, the Verbal IQ as measured by WAIS-R has been found to correlate significantly (0.53) with the GPA of the last 60 hours. In contrast, Performance IQ correlation with the same GPA was only 0.22 in the same study.[tpl]cite book | last = Kamphaus | first = Randy W. | title = Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-387-26299-7[/tpl]

===Job performance===

According to Schmidt and Hunter, "for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Frank L. |last2=Hunter |first2=John E. |title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=262–74 |year=1998 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262[/tpl] The validity of IQ as a predictor of job performance is above zero for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=John E. |last2=Hunter |first2=Ronda F. |title=Validity and utility of alternative predictors of job performance |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=72–98 |year=1984 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.1.72[/tpl] The correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for. While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=Molly |last2=Ernst |first2=John |last3=Townes |first3=Brenda |last4=Peel |first4=John |last5=Preston |first5=Michael |title=Relationships Between IQ and Neuropsychological Measures in Neuropsychiatric Populations: Within-Laboratory and Cross-Cultural Replications Using WAIS and WAIS-R |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=545–62 |year=1987 |pmid=3667899 |doi=10.1080/01688638708410768[/tpl] IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations. That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores are more likely to be a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance. It is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance.
In establishing a causal direction to the link between IQ and work performance, longitudinal studies by Watkins and others suggest that IQ exerts a causal influence on future academic achievement, whereas academic achievement does not substantially influence future IQ scores.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Watkins |first1=M |last2=Lei |first2=P |last3=Canivez |first3=G |title=Psychometric intelligence and achievement: A cross-lagged panel analysis |journal=Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=59–68 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.04.005[/tpl] Treena Eileen Rohde and Lee Anne Thompson write that general cognitive ability, but not specific ability scores, predict academic achievement, with the exception that processing speed and spatial ability predict performance on the SAT math beyond the effect of general cognitive ability.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rohde |first1=T |last2=Thompson |first2=L |title=Predicting academic achievement with cognitive ability |journal=Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–92 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.05.004[/tpl]
The US military has minimum enlistment standards at about the IQ 85 level. There have been two experiments with lowering this to 80 but in both cases these men could not master soldiering well enough to justify their costs.Gottfredson, L. S. (2006).

In 2000 the New London, CT police department turned away a recruit for having an IQ above 125, under the argument that those with overly-high IQs will become bored and exhibit high turnover in the job. This policy has been challenged as discriminatory, but was upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.ABC News, "Court OKs Barring High IQs for Cops", http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95836
The American Psychological Association's report "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns" states that since the explained variance is 29%, other individual characteristics such as interpersonal skills, aspects of personality etc. are probably of equal or greater importance, but at this point there are no equally reliable instruments to measure them.

===Income===

While it has been suggested that "in economic terms it appears that the IQ score measures something with decreasing marginal value. It is important to have enough of it, but having lots and lots does not buy you that much.",[ref]
Detterman and Daniel, 1989.[/ref] large scale longitudinal studies  indicate an increase in IQ translates into an increase  in performance at all levels of IQ: i.e., that ability and  job performance are monotonically linked at all IQ levels.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Coward |first1=W. Mark |last2=Sackett |first2=Paul R. |title=Linearity of ability-performance relationships: A reconfirmation |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=297–300 |year=1990 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.75.3.297[/tpl] Charles Murray, coauthor of The Bell Curve, found that IQ has a substantial effect on income independently of family background.[tpl]cite book |last1= Murray |first1= Charles |year=1998 |title= Income Inequality and IQ |publisher= AEI Press |url=http://www.aei.org/docLib/20040302_book443.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=0-8447-7094-9 [/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The link from IQ to wealth is much less strong than that from IQ to job performance. Some studies indicate that IQ is unrelated to net worth.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1701377.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Brains don't make you rich IQ study finds | first=Mark | last=Henderson | date=April 25, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl]http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070424204519.htm
The American Psychological Association's  1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that IQ scores accounted for (explained variance) about a quarter of the social status variance and one-sixth of the income variance. Statistical controls for parental SES eliminate about a quarter of this predictive power. Psychometric intelligence appears as only one of a great many factors that influence social outcomes.
Some studies claim that IQ only accounts for (explains) a sixth of the variation in income because many studies are based on young adults, many of whom have not yet reached their peak earning capacity, or even their education.  On pg 568 of The g Factor, Arthur Jensen claims that although the correlation between IQ and income averages a moderate 0.4 (one sixth or 16% of the variance), the relationship increases with age, and peaks at middle age when people have reached their maximum career potential. In the book, A Question of Intelligence, Daniel Seligman cites an IQ income correlation of 0.5 (25% of the variance).
A 2002 study[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bowles |first1=Samuel |last2=Gintis |first2=Herbert |title=The Inheritance of Inequality |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=3–30 |year=2002 |doi=10.1257/089533002760278686[/tpl] further examined the impact of non-IQ factors on income and concluded that an individual's location, inherited wealth, race, and schooling are more important as factors in determining income than IQ.

===IQ and crime===

The American Psychological Association's  1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was -0.2. It was -0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to -0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. It is important to realize that the causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well.
In his book The g Factor (1998), Arthur Jensen cited data which showed that, regardless of race, people with IQs between 70 and 90 have higher crime rates than people with IQs below or above this range, with the peak range being between 80 and 90.
The 2009 Handbook of Crime Correlates stated that reviews have found that around eight IQ points, or 0.5 SD, separate criminals from the general population, especially for persistent serious offenders. It has been suggested that this simply reflects that "only dumb ones get caught" but there is similarly a negative relation between IQ and self-reported offending. That children with conduct disorder have lower IQ than their peers "strongly argues" for the theory.Handbook of Crime Correlates; Lee Ellis, Kevin M. Beaver, John Wright; 2009; Academic Press
A study of the relationship between US county-level IQ and US county-level crime rates found that higher average IQs were associated with lower levels of property crime, burglary, larceny rate, motor vehicle theft, violent crime, robbery, and aggravated assault. These results were not "confounded by a measure of concentrated disadvantage that captures the effects of race, poverty, and other social disadvantages of the county."[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.intell.2010.12.002[/tpl]http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000524

===Other correlations with IQ===

In addition, IQ and its correlation to health, violent crime, gross state product, and government effectiveness are the subject of a 2006 paper in the publication Intelligence. The paper breaks down IQ averages by U.S. states using the federal government's National Assessment of Educational Progress math and reading test scores as a source.
The American Psychological Association's  1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that the correlations for most "negative outcome" variables are typically smaller than 0.20, which means that the explained variance is less than 4%.
Tambs et al.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Tambs |first1=Kristian |last2=Sundet |first2=Jon Martin |last3=Magnus |first3=Per |last4=Berg |first4=Kåre |title=Genetic and environmental contributions to the covariance between occupational status, educational attainment, and IQ: A study of twins |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=209–22 |year=1989 |pmid=2719624 |doi=10.1007/BF01065905[/tpl][tpl]Better source|date=November 2010[/tpl] found that occupational status, educational attainment, and IQ are individually heritable; and further found that "genetic variance influencing educational attainment ... contributed approximately one-fourth of the genetic variance for occupational status and nearly half the genetic variance for IQ." In a sample of U.S. siblings, Rowe et al.Rowe, D. C., W. J. Vesterdal, and J. L. Rodgers, "The Bell Curve Revisited: How Genes and Shared Environment Mediate IQ-SES Associations," University of Arizona, 1997[tpl]Page needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] report that the inequality in education and income was predominantly due to genes, with shared environmental factors playing a subordinate role.
A recent USA study that reviewed political views and intelligence has shown that the mean adolescent intelligence of young adults who identify themselves as "very liberal" is 106.4, while that of those who identify themselves as "very conservative" is 94.8.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kanazawa S | year = 2010 | title = Why Liberals and Atheists Are More Intelligent | url = http://personal.lse.ac.uk/Kanazawa/pdfs/SPQ2010.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 33–57 | doi=10.1177/0190272510361602[/tpl] Two other studies conducted in the UK reached similar conclusions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Deary I.

There are also other correlations such as those between religiosity and intelligence and fertility and intelligence.

===Real-life accomplishments===

There is considerable variation within and overlap among these categories. People with high IQs are found at all levels of education and occupational categories. The biggest difference occurs for low IQs with only an occasional college graduate or professional scoring below 90.

==Group differences==

Among the most controversial issues related to the study of intelligence is the observation that intelligence measures such as IQ scores vary between ethnic and racial groups and sexes. While there is little scholarly debate about the existence of some of these differences, their causes remain highly controversial both within academia and in the public sphere.

===Sex===

Most IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.[tpl]cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1037/a0026699[/tpl] Popular IQ batteries such as the WAIS and the WISC-R are also constructed in order to eliminate sex differences.Jensen, A. (1998) The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (p. 531) In a paper presented at the International Society for Intelligence Research in 2002, it was pointed out that because test constructors and the Educational Testing Service (which developed the SAT) often eliminate items showing marked sex differences in order to reduce the perception of bias, the "true sex" difference is masked. Items like the MRT and RT tests that show a male advantage in IQ are often removed.Jackson, D. N. (2002, December 5–7). Evaluating g in the SAT: Implications for the sex differences and interpretations of verbal and quantitative aptitude. Paper presented at the International Society for Intelligence Research, Nashville, TN."

===Race and ethnicity===

The 1996 Task Force investigation on Intelligence sponsored by the American Psychological Association concluded that there are significant variations in IQ across races. The problem of determining the causes underlying this variation relates to the question of the contributions of "nature and nurture" to IQ. Psychologists such as Alan S. Kaufman[tpl]Cite book|title=IQ Testing 101 |last=Kaufman |first=Alan S. |authorlink=Alan S.
