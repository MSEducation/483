[[Beryl (given name)]]

Beryl is a given name which is deemed unisex due to occasional American usage as a male name, as such probably a variant spelling of the surname Burrell whose seeming root is the Old French bovre a reddish-brown woolen fabric with the resultant name denoting a worker in the wool trade; Beryl may also be a variant spelling of the Yiddish (Judeo-German) male name Berel.
Overwhelmingly the name Beryl has been borne by females being a jewel name with reference to the mineral beryl. Like most jewel names, Beryl's use as a female name dates from the late 19th century: dancer Beryl de Zoete and actress Beryl Mercer would have been among the earliest namesakes being born respectively in 1879 and 1882. The female name Beryl was always more popular in the British Isles than in North America; since the mid-20th century the name has become somewhat unfashionable in the British Isles while its North American usage has grown peripheral.
