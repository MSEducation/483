In 2000, there were 210 licensed allopathic drug-manufacturing units in the country, out of which only 173 were in active production; others were either closed down on their own or suspended by the licensing authority for drugs due to non compliance to good manufacturing practices or drug laws. The industry manufactured about 5,600 brands of medicines in different dosage forms. There were, however, 1,495 wholesale drug license holders and about 37,700 retail drug license holders in Bangladesh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=1429 |title=Pharmaceutical industry - Business & Industry - Bangladesh Strategic & Development Forum |publisher=Bdsdf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17[/tpl] After the promulgation of the Drugs (Control) Ordinance, 1982,Drug Control Ordinance the development of this sector was accelerated.
