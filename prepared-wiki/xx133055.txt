Cory Environmental is a large waste disposal company based in the United Kingdom. Cory operates in more than 30 locations throughout England, providing services in the collection, recycling and disposal of waste as well as municipal cleansing.

==Operations==

Cory is one of the UK’s leading waste management companies. It handles more than 3.5 million tonnes of waste and recyclable materials per year at sites across the UK and has contracts for recycling, street cleansing and waste collection stretching from Merseyside to Kent and Cornwall. It may be best known for operating barges on the River Thames from central London out to Cory's Mucking Marshes Landfill site. About 15% of London’s waste is transferred by barge, removing 100,000 lorry movements per year from London’s roads.

==History==

===Coal and refuse===

The company was founded in London in 1896 as William Cory and Son Ltd.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coryenvironmental.co.uk/page/history.htm |title=History - Page 1 |year=2011 |work=Cory Environmental |publisher=Cory Environmental |accessdate=24 June 2011[/tpl] Cory was formed form the merger of eight companies in the coal trade and had a comprehensive business in transporting and supplying five million tonnes of coal per year to trade and domestic customers in London. Cory had a fleet of 2,500 railway wagons and also operated lighters on the River Thames. Rather than operate its lighters unladen on their return journeys from delivering coal, Cory used them to carry refuse from London to be dumped in the marshlands of Essex and Kent.
After the turn of the 20th century, Cory started to provide social housing for some of its workforce.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coryenvironmental.co.uk/page/history2.htm |title=History - Page 2 |year=2011 |work=Cory Environmental |publisher=Cory Environmental |accessdate=24 June 2011[/tpl]

By the 1950s Cory was transporting and supplying fuel oil as well as coal. In 1956 Cory started to develop a fleet of barges designed specifically to carry refuse rather than coal. Cory had its own barge-building yard, which produced more than 400 such vessels between 1962 and 1972. Oil-fired central heating grew in popularity such that by 1972 Cory was supplying [tpl]convert|216|e6USgal|m3[/tpl] per year to domestic customers.
In 1972 Ocean Group plc bought Cory. In 1979 Cory bought Thames and General Lighterage, making Cory the largest waste carrier on the Thames.
