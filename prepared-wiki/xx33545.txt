[[Eight-cell stage]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental biology

The eight-cell stage is a period in embryonic development when the conceptus has undergone three cleavages from a single cell, resulting in eight cells. In some mammals, it is at this stage of development that the individual cells begin to adhere tightly, a process called compaction.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nikas G, Ao A, Winston RM, Handyside AH |title=Compaction and surface polarity in the human embryo in vitro |journal=Biol.
