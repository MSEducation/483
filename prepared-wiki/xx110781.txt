Jeong Seon (1676–1759) was a well-known Korean landscape painter, also known as by his pen name Gyeomjae (meaning humble study). He was one of the few known Korean painters to depart from traditional Chinese styles. It is reported that he frequently left his studio and painted the world around him, as he could see it. Soon, Jeong Seon inspired other Korean artists to follow suit, leaving a lasting impact on Korean art of the Joseon era.
In contrast to most painters at the time, Jeong Seon was not born in a wealthy family. He was discovered by an aristocratic neighbour who recommended him to the court. Soon he gained an official position.
Jeong is said to have painted daily, with a prolific output until his old age. His paintings are classified as Southern School, but during his life, Jeong developed his own style: unique brush wrinkles of bold strokes in parallels.
