Revue des Études Arméniennes (in English: "Journal of Armenian Studies") is a peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes articles relating to Classical and medieval Armenian history, art history, philology, linguistics, and literature.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Revue des Études Arméniennes.

The Revue was established in 1920 by Frédéric Macler and Antoine Meillet.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Mahé, Jean-Pierre. «Ռևյու դեզ էթյուդ Արմենիեն» des Études Arméniennes. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1983, vol. ix, p. 649. Meillet himself wrote many of the articles during the formative years of the journal (1920-1933), which typically covered Armenian history, grammar, and folk tales. The Revue was not published from 1934 to 1963.
In 1964, thanks to the efforts of the Paris-based Armenian scholar Haïg Berbérian (1887-1978), the journal was revived. Berbérian was able to secure the financial backing of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation for the journal's publication, and the first volume of the "Nouvelle série" appeared under his editorship in 1964.Kouymjian, Dickran. "Preface" in In Memoriam: Haïg Berbérian, ed. Dickran Kouymjian. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1986, pp. xi-xii. Unlike during the first series, however, the publication of articles on the modern period of Armenian history was discontinued, and the journal has since limited its scope to the Early modern period (that is, until the 18th century).Revue des Études Arméniennes.

Up until 1933, articles were published in French, but when publication resumed articles were also published in English and German.Manuscripts submitted in other languages, such as Spanish, are also now accepted. The journal uses the Hübschmann-Meillet-Benveniste system in the transcription of Armenian words into Latin characters. In addition to scholarly articles, it also publishes book reviews.
The journal's former editors were Jacques Benveniste (nominally, 1964-1975), Georges Dumézil (1975-1980), and Sirarpie Der-Nersessian (1981-1989).
