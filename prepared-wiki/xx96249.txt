[[1962–63 United States network television schedule]]

CATEGORIES: United States primetime network television schedules, 1962 in American television, 1963 in American television

This was the television schedule on all three networks for the fall season beginning in September 1962. 
Television historians Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik (1982) state, "Despite all the promises of programming reform made by television executives in May, 1961, the 1962–63 schedule turned out to be business as usual". Castleman and Podrazik point out that although the three networks had added generally well-made public-affairs and news programs to their schedules, there were "too many of them and their sheer number diluted the audience and stretched resources far too thin to allow quality productions each week".[tpl]cite book| last = Castleman| first = Harry| authorlink = |author2= Walter J.
