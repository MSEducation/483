CATEGORIES: Passenger rail transport in China

Z-series ([tpl]zh|c=直达特快列车[/tpl]) is a train service offered by China National Railway.Z stands for Zhida ("non-stop"). Most Z-series trains do not have any intermediary stops, not even technical stops for changing locomotives or drivers. However, some of these trains later had a few stops added to their schedule to boost the number of passengers.
Generally, Z-series trains are overnight, all-sleeper trains that have travel time of around 10–14 hours, with an average speed of around [tpl]convert|120|km/h|mph|0[/tpl], and top speed up to [tpl]convert|160|km/h|mph|0[/tpl]. The majority have both soft sleepers and hard sleepers, while some Z trains have only soft sleepers, few of them also have soft seat. Most of the Z-series trains stop at either Beijing, Beijing West and Shanghai Railway Station.
