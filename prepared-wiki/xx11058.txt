Slovakia is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south. The largest city is the capital, Bratislava, and the second largest is Košice. Slovakia is a member state of the European Union, NATO, United Nations, OECD and WTO among others. The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.
The Slavs - ancestors of the Slovaks - arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration period. In the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant role in the creation of Samo's Empire, historically the first Slavic state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century, Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity, the Principality of Nitra, which later together with the Principality of Moravia, formed Great Moravia. After the 10th century the territory of today's Slovakia was gradually integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary,[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian & Slavic myth and legend|last=Dixon-Kennedy|first=Mike|year=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-130-4|page=375|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eD5AkdM83iIC&pg=PA57&dq=slovakia+was+part+of++hungary|accessdate=23 April 2009[/tpl] which itself became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Habsburg Empire. After WWI and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the nation of Slovaks and Czechs established their mutual state - Czechoslovakia.

==History==

Radiocarbon dating puts the oldest surviving archaeological artifacts from Slovakia – found near Nové Mesto nad Váhom – at 270,000 BC, in the Early Paleolithic era. These ancient tools, made by the Clactonian technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.
Other stone tools from the Middle Paleolithic era (200,000 – 80,000 BC) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave near Bojnice and from other nearby sites.[tpl]cite web |url=http://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |first=|last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave|work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011[/tpl] The most important discovery from that era is a Neanderthal cranium (c. 200,000 BC), discovered near Gánovce, a village in northern Slovakia.
Archaeologists have found prehistoric Homo sapiens skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the Gravettian culture, principally in the river valleys of Nitra, Hron, Ipeľ, Váh and as far as the city of Žilina, and near the foot of the Vihorlat, Inovec, and Tribeč mountains, as well as in the Myjava Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of mammoth-bone (22,800 BC), the famous Venus of Moravany. The statue was found in the 1940s in Moravany nad Váhom near Piešťany. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile gastropods of the Tertiary period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošinare. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the Mediterranean and Central Europe.

===Bronze age===

The Bronze Age in Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800 BC.  Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in Špania Dolina) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.
After the disappearance of the Čakany and Velatice cultures, the Lusatian people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centers. Excavations of Lusatian hill forts document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewelry, dishes, and statues.

===Iron age===

====Hallstatt Period====

The arrival of tribes from Thrace disrupted the people of the Kalenderberg culture, who lived in the hamlets located on the plain (Sereď) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near Smolenice, in the Little Carpathians. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. The common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries. A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the Hallstatt period disappeared in Slovakia during the last century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the Scytho-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught interest of emerging Celtic tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

====La Tène Period====

From around 500 BC, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by Celts, who built powerful oppida on the sites of modern-day Bratislava and Devin.  Biatecs, silver coins with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique Puchov culture, with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as Cotini.

====Roman Period====

From 2 AD, the expanding Roman Empire established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the Danube, the largest of which were known as Carnuntum (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and Brigetio (present-day Szöny at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of Rusovce, currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian vicus and several farms of the villa rustica type. The name of this settlement was Gerulata. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modeled after the Cananefates. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in Devin castle (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of Dubravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.
Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the Limes Romanus, there existed the winter camp of Laugaricio (modern-day Trenčín) where the Auxiliary of Legion II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic Quadi tribe in 179 AD during the Marcomannic Wars. The Kingdom of Vannius, a kingdom founded by the Germanic Suebian tribes of Quadi and Marcomanni, as well as several small Germanic and Celtic tribes, including the Osi and Cotini, existed in Western and Central Slovakia from 8–6 BC to 179 AD.

===Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries===

In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the Huns began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377 AD and occupied Pannonia, which they used for 75 years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the Avars, conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the Pannonian Plain, and established an empire dominating the Carpathian Basin.
In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo, a Frankish merchant.[tpl]cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1[/tpl] After 626, the Avar power started a gradual declineKristó, p.30–31 but its reign lasted to 804.

===Slavic states===

The Slavic tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of Samo's empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the Principality of Nitra arose in the 8th century and its ruler Pribina had the first known Christian church of Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighboring Moravia, the principality formed the core of the Great Moravian Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863, during the reign of Prince Rastislav, and the territorial expansion under King Svatopluk I.

===Great Moravia (830–before 907)===

Great Moravia arose around 830 when Mojmír I unified the Slavic tribes settled north of the Danube and extended the Moravian supremacy over them.'Europe', p.360 When Mojmír I endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of East Francia in 846, King Louis the German deposed him and assisted Moimír's nephew Rastislav (846–870) in acquiring the throne.[tpl]cite book|last=Kristó|first=Gyula|title=Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9–14. század) (Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History – 9th–14th centuries)|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1994|location=Budapest|page=467|isbn=963-05-6722-9[/tpl] The new monarch pursued an independent policy: after stopping a Frankish attack in 855, he also sought to weaken influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm. Rastislav asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael III to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular.
Upon Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius came in 863. Cyril developed the first Slavic alphabet and translated the Gospel into the Old Church Slavonic language. Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state. Numerous fortified castles built throughout the country are dated to his reign and some of them (e.g., Dowina, sometimes identified with Devín Castle)[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1080/00438243.1978.9979728|title=The Origins of Christianity in Slavonic Countries North of the Middle Danube Basin|journal=World Archaeology|year=1978|first=Josef|last=Poulik|volume=10|issue=2|pages=158–171|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Čaplovič|first=Dušan|coauthors=Viliam Čičaj, Dušan Kováč, Ľubomír Lipták, Ján Lukačka|title=Dejiny Slovenska|publisher=AEP|year=2000|location=Bratislava[/tpl] are also mentioned in connection with Rastislav by Frankish chronicles.pages=167, 566[tpl]cite book|title=Annales Fuldenses, sive, Annales regni Francorum orientalis ab Einhardo, Ruodolfo, Meginhardo Fuldensibus, Seligenstadi, Fuldae, Mogontiaci conscripti cum continuationibus Ratisbonensi et Altahensibus / post editionem G. H. Pertzii recognovit Friderious Kurze ; Accedunt Annales Fuldenses antiquissimi|publisher=Imprensis Bibliopolii Hahniani|year=1978|location=Hanover|url=http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm|accessdate=26 September 2009[/tpl]
During Rastislav's reign, the Principality of Nitra was given to his nephew Svatopluk as an appanage. The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svatopluk I (871–894) assumed the title of the king (rex).[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day Moravia and Slovakia but also present-day northern and central Hungary, Lower Austria, Bohemia, Silesia, Lusatia, southern Poland and northern Serbia belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors.[tpl]cite book|last=Tóth|first=Sándor László|title=Levediától a Kárpát-medencéig ("From Levedia to the Carpathian Basin")|publisher=Szegedi Középkorász Műhely|year=1998|location=Szeged|page=199|isbn=963-482-175-8[/tpl] Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the semi-nomadic Magyar tribes and the Bulgarian Empire, although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against East Francia.page=51
In 880, Pope John VIII set up an independent ecclesiastical province in Great Moravia with Archbishop Methodius as its head. He also named the German cleric Wiching the Bishop of Nitra.
After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons Mojmír II (894–906?) and Svatopluk II succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively. However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with Eastern Francia, Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.
In the meantime, the semi-nomadic Magyar tribes, possibly having suffered defeat from the similarly nomadic Pechenegs, left their territories east of the Carpathian Mountains,[tpl]Cite book|title=A Country Study: Hungary |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+hu0013)|accessdate=6 March 2009[/tpl] invaded the Carpathian Basin and started to occupy the territory gradually around 896.pages=189–211 Their armies' advance may have been promoted by continuous wars among the countries of the region whose rulers still hired them occasionally to intervene in their struggles.[tpl]cite book|last=Kristó|first=Gyula|title=Magyar honfoglalás – honfoglaló magyarok ("The Hungarians' Occupation of their Country – The Hungarians occupying their Country")|publisher=Kossuth Könyvkiadó|year=1996|pages=84–85|isbn=963-09-3836-7[/tpl]
We do not know what happened with both Mojmír II and Svatopluk II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In three battles (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near Bratislava, the Magyars routed Bavarian armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the breakup of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).
Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The Glagolitic script and its successor Cyrillic were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their sociocultural development. The administrative system of Great Moravia may have influenced the development of the administration of the Kingdom of Hungary.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]

===Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1918)===

Following the disintegration of the Great Moravian Empire at the turn of the 10th century, the Hungarians annexed the territory comprising modern Slovakia. From the 11th century, when the territory inhabited by the Slovak-speaking population of Danubian Basin was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, until 1918, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed, the territory of modern Slovakia was an integral part of the Hungarian state.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sOlD_8Kw0K0C&pg=PA3&dq=slovak+territory+part+of+hungary+11+century&hl=sk&ei=lD54TqDdB430-gbE9eGbDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=slovak%20territory%20part%20of%20hungary%2011%20century&f=false |title=James Ramon Felak. p 3. 1994 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Brjcd07bN6sC&pg=PA71&dq=slovak+territory+part+of+hungary+11+century&hl=sk&ei=lD54TqDdB430-gbE9eGbDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rudolf Schuster, M.

A significant decline in the population resulted from the invasion of the Mongols in 1241 and the subsequent famine. However, in medieval times the area of the present-day Slovakia was characterized rather by burgeoning towns, construction of numerous stone castles, and the cultivation of the arts.[tpl]cite book|author=Tibenský, Ján et al.|title=Slovensko: Dejiny|publisher=Obzor|year=1971|location=Bratislava[/tpl] In 1465, King Matthias Corvinus founded the Hungarian Kingdom's third university, in Pozsony (Bratislava), but it was closed in 1490 after his death.[tpl]cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava|url=http://www4.bratislava.sk/en/vismo5/dokumenty2.asp?u=700000&id_org=700000&id=2009414&|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080507064915/http://www4.bratislava.sk/en/vismo5/dokumenty2.asp?u=700000&id_org=700000&id=2009414&|archivedate=7 May 2008|title=Academia Istropolitana|date=14 February 2005|accessdate=5 January 2008[/tpl]

===Czechoslovakia (1918–1939)===

In 1918, Slovakia and the regions of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Carpathian Ruthenia formed a common state, Czechoslovakia, with the borders confirmed by the Treaty of Saint Germain and Treaty of Trianon. In 1919, during the chaos following the breakup of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders. A Slovak patriot Milan Rastislav Štefánik (1880–1919), who helped organize Czechoslovak regiments against Austria-Hungary during the First World War, died in a plane crash. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period.
During the Interwar period, democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with Romania and Yugoslavia (Little Entente); however, the Locarno Treaties of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity.  There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. The minority Germans came to accept their role in the new country and relations with Austria were good. Yet the Great Depression caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.J. V. Polisencky, History of Czechoslovakia in Outline (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.
Thereafter Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the revisionist governments of Germany and Hungary. Eventually this led to the Munich Agreement of September 1938, which allowed Nazi Germany to partially dismember the country by occupying what was called the Sudetenland, a region with a German-speaking majority and bordering Germany and Austria. The remainder of "rump" Czechoslovakia was renamed Czecho-Slovakia and included a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. Southern and eastern Slovakia, however, was reclaimed by Hungary at the First Vienna Award of November 1938.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

===World War II===

After the Munich Agreement and its Vienna Award, Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared. Thus, Slovakia seceded from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and allied itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.Gerhard L. Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939 (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481. The government of the First Slovak Republic, led by Jozef Tiso and Vojtech Tuka, was strongly influenced by Germany and gradually became a puppet regime in many respects.
Most Jews were deported from the country and taken to German labor camps. Thousands of Jews, however, remained to labor in Slovak work camps in Sereď, Vyhne, and Nováky.Leni Yahil, The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945 (Oxford, 1990), pp. 402–403. Tiso, through the granting of presidential exceptions, has been credited with saving as many as 40,000 Jews during the war, although other estimates place the figure closer to 4,000 or even 1,000.For the higher figure, see Milan S. Ďurica, The Slovak Involvement in the Tragedy of the European Jews (Abano Terme: Piovan Editore, 1989), p. 12; for the lower figure, see Gila Fatran, "The Struggle for Jewish Survival During the Holocaust" in The Tragedy of the Jews of Slovakia (Banská Bystrica, 2002), p. 148.
Nevertheless, under Tiso's government, 83% of Slovakia's Jewish population, a total of 75,000 individuals, were murdered,Dawidowicz, Lucy. The War Against the Jews, Bantam, 1986. p. 403 though new estimates show increasing numbers of Jewish casualties, approximately 105,000 people.[tpl]cite web|author=Rebekah Klein-Pejšová|title=An overview of the history of Jews in Slovakia|work=Slovak Jewish Heritage|publisher=Synagoga Slovaca|year=2006|url=http://www.slovak-jewish-heritage.org/history-of-jews-in-slovakia.html|accessdate=2 August 2007[/tpl] Tiso became the only European leader to pay Nazi authorities to deport his country's Jews.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6231163.stm|title=Slovak bishop praises Nazi regime|publisher=BBC News|date=4 January 2007|accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/slovakia/index.htm |title=Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today – Slovakia |publisher=Axt.org.uk |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]
After it became clear that the Soviet Red Army was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi resistance movement launched a fierce armed insurrection, known as the Slovak National Uprising, near the end of summer 1944. A bloody German occupation and a guerilla war followed. The territory of Slovakia was liberated by Soviet and Romanian forces by the end of April 1945.

Czechoslovakia came under the influence of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact after a coup in 1948. The country was occupied by the Warsaw Pact forces (with the exception of Romania) in 1968, ending a period of liberalization under the leadership of Alexander Dubček.

In July 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar, declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Mečiar and Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.
The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the Velvet Divorce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011[/tpl] Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries cooperate with Hungary and Poland in the Visegrád Group. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the Euro as its national currency.

==Geography==

Slovakia lies between latitudes 47° and 50° N, and longitudes 16° and 23° E.
The Slovak landscape is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the Carpathian Mountains extending across most of the northern half of the country. Amongst these mountain ranges are the high peaks of the Fatra-Tatra Area (including Tatra mountains, Greater Fatra and Lesser Fatra), Slovak Ore Mountains, Slovak Central Mountains or Beskids. The largest lowland is the fertile Danubian Lowland in the southwest, followed by the Eastern Slovak Lowland in the southeast.[tpl]cite web |title= Slovakia |work= The World Factbook |publisher= CIA |year=2007 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lo.html |accessdate=26 April 2008[/tpl]

===Tatra mountains===

Tatras, with 29 peaks higher than [tpl]convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=off[/tpl] AMSL, are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. Tatras occupy an area of [tpl]convert|750|km²|0|abbr=out[/tpl], of which the greater part [tpl]convert|600|km²|0|abbr=out[/tpl] lies in Slovakia. They are divided into several parts.
To the north, close to the Polish border, are the High Tatras which are a popular hiking and skiing destination and home to many scenic lakes and valleys as well as the highest point in Slovakia, the Gerlachovský štít at [tpl]convert|2655|m|ft|0[/tpl] and the country's highly symbolic mountain Kriváň. To the west are the Western Tatras with their highest peak of Rysy at [tpl]convert|2503|m|ft|0[/tpl] and to the east are the Belianske Tatras, smallest by area.
Separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the Váh river are the Low Tatras, with their highest peak of Ďumbier at [tpl]convert|2043|m|ft|0[/tpl].
The Tatra mountain range is represented as one of the three hills on the coat of arms of Slovakia.

===National Parks===

There are 9 national parks in Slovakia:

===Caves===

Slovakia has hundreds of caves and caverns under its mountains, out of which 15 are open to the public. Most of the caves have stalagmites rising from the ground and stalactites hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under UNESCO's World Heritage Site status. They are Dobšinská Ice Cave, Domica, Gombasek Cave, Jasovská Cave and Ochtinská Aragonite Cave. Other caves open to public include Belianska Cave, Demänovská Cave of Liberty, Demänovská Ice Cave or Bystrianska Cave

===Rivers===

Most of the rivers stem in Slovak mountains. Some are only passing through and the others make a natural border with surrounding countries (more than [tpl]convert|620|km|mi|0[/tpl]). For example Dunajec ([tpl]convert|17|km|mi|0[/tpl]) to the north, Danube ([tpl]convert|172|km|mi|0[/tpl]) to the south or Morava ([tpl]convert|119|km|mi|0[/tpl]) to the West. The total length of the rivers on Slovak territory is [tpl]convert|49774|km|mi|0[/tpl].
The longest river in Slovakia is Váh ([tpl]convert|403|km|mi|0[/tpl]), the shortest is  Čierna voda. Other important and large rivers are Myjava, Nitra ([tpl]convert|197|km|mi|0[/tpl]), Orava, Hron ([tpl]convert|298|km|mi|0[/tpl]), Hornád ([tpl]convert|193|km|mi|0[/tpl]), Slaná ([tpl]convert|110|km|mi|0[/tpl]), Ipeľ ([tpl]convert|232|km|mi|0[/tpl], making the border with Hungary), Bodrog, Laborec, Latorica and Ondava.
The biggest volume of discharge in Slovak rivers is during spring, when the snow is melting from the mountains. The only exception is Danube, whose discharge is the biggest during summer when the snow is melting in the Alps. Danube is the largest river that flows through Slovakia.[tpl]cite web|author=Nie ste prihlásený. |url=http://www.slovakregion.sk/vodstvo-jazera-rieky-rybniky-slovenska |title=Translated from Slovak language |publisher=Slovakregion.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]

===Lakes===

There are around 175 naturally formed tarns in High Tatras. With an area of 20 ha and its depth of [tpl]convert|53|m|ft|0[/tpl], Veľké Hincovo pleso is the largest and the deepest tarn in Slovakia. Other tarns in the High Tatras include Štrbské pleso, Popradské pleso, Skalnaté pleso, Zbojnícke pleso, Velické pleso, Žabie pleso, Krivánske zelené pleso or Roháčske plesá. Other than in the High Tatras there are Vrbické pleso in Low Tatras, Morské oko and Vinné jazero in Vihorlat Mountains or Jezerské jazero in Spišská Magura.
The largest dams on the river Váh are Liptovská Mara and Sĺňava. Other well known dams are Oravská priehrada in the north, Zemplínska Šírava and Domaša in the east, Senecké jazerá, Zlaté piesky or Zelená voda in the west.

===Climate===

The Slovak climate lies between the temperate and continental climate zones with relatively warm summers and cold, cloudy and humid winters. Temperature extremes are in interval between [tpl]convert|-41|to|40.3|C|F|1[/tpl] although temperatures below [tpl]convert|-30|°C|0[/tpl] are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous North to the plain South.
The warmest region is Bratislava and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may rise up to [tpl]convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in summer, occasionally to [tpl]convert|37|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. During night, the temperatures rise up to [tpl]convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of [tpl]convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] up to [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below [tpl]convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around [tpl]convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] (less in the mountains). Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March and April and the night temperatures go down to [tpl]convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and colder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate |title=Based on the "Climate" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]

==Biodiversity==

Slovakia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl]
The biodiversity of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota), micro-organisms (including Mycetozoa), and plants.

===Fungi===

Over 4000 species of fungi have been recorded from Slovakia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia. Observations of fungi and their associated organisms |accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl]Pavel Lizoň & Kamila Bacigálová, Huby - Fungi in F. Hindák ed. Checklist of Non-vascular and Vascular Plants of Slovakia (Bratislava, 1998), pp. 102–227. Of these, nearly 1500 are lichen-forming speciesIvan Pišút, Lichenizované Huby (Lišajníky) - Lichen-forming Fungi (Lichens) in F. Hindák ed. Checklist of Non-vascular and Vascular Plants of Slovakia (Bratislava, 1998), pp. 229–295. Some of these fungi are undoubtedly endemic, but not enough is known to say how many. Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some way. About 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare. The conservation status of non-lichen-forming fungi in Slovakia is not well documented, but there is a red list for its larger fungi.Pavel Lizoň, Threatened macrofungi in Slovakia Biologia (Bratislava) 50: 9-12(1995).

==Politics and government==

Slovakia is a parliamentary democratic republic with a multi-party system. The last parliamentary elections were held on 10 March 2012 and two rounds of presidential elections took place on 15 and 29 March 2014.
The Slovak head of state is the president (currently Ivan Gašparovič), elected by direct popular vote for a five-year term. Most executive power lies with the head of government, the prime minister (currently Robert Fico), who is usually the leader of the winning party, but he/she needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.
Slovakia's highest legislative body is the 150-seat unicameral National Council of the Slovak Republic (Národná rada Slovenskej republiky). Delegates are elected for a four-year term on the basis of proportional representation. Slovakia's highest judicial body is the Constitutional Court of Slovakia (Ústavný súd), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13 members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by parliament.
Slovakia has been a member state of the European Union and NATO since 2004. As a member of the United Nations (since 1993), Slovakia was, on 10 October 2005, elected to a two-year term on the UN Security Council from 2006 to 2007. Slovakia is also a member of WTO, OECD, OSCE, and other international organizations.
The Constitution of the Slovak Republic was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 January 1993). It was amended in September 1998 to allow direct election of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements.
The civil law system is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The legal code was modified to comply with the obligations of Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to expunge the Marxist-Leninist legal theory. Slovakia accepts the compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction with reservations.
The president is the head of state and the formal head of the executive, though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the two-round system for a five-year term.
Following National Council elections, the leader of the majority party or the leader of the majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president. Cabinet appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister has to receive the majority in the parliament.

===Foreign relations===

Slovakia has been a member of European Union since 2004. Slovakia has been an active participant in U.S.- and NATO-led military actions. There is a joint Czech-Slovak peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
Slovakia is a member of the United Nations and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the OECD. It also is part of the Visegrad Four (Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland), a forum for discussing areas of common concern.
The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic entered into a Customs Union upon the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993, which facilitates a relatively free flow of goods and services. Slovakia maintains diplomatic relations with 134 countries, primarily through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are 44 embassies and 35 honorary consulates in Bratislava.

===Military===

The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic number 14,000 uniformed personnel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/239481-slovenska-armada-se-zbavi-tanku.html?ref=stalo-se |title=Slovenská armáda se zbaví tanků – |publisher=Novinky.cz |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] Slovakia joined NATO in March 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/03-march/e0329a.htm |title=NATO Update: Seven new members join NATO|publisher=Nato.int |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] From 2006 the army transformed into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished.
Slovak Ground Forces are made up of two active mechanized infantry brigades. The Air and Air Defence Forces comprise one wing of fighters, one wing of utility helicopters, and one SAM brigade. Training and support forces comprise a National Support Element (Multifunctional Battalion, Transport Battalion, Repair Battalion), a garrison force of the capital city Bratislava, as well as a training battalion, and various logistics and communication and information bases. Miscellaneous forces under the direct command of the General Staff include the 5th Special Forces Regiment.

===Human rights===

The U.S. State Department in 2010 reported:
Human rights in Slovakia are guaranteed by the Constitution of Slovakia from the year 1992 and by multiple international laws signed in Slovakia between 1948 and 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/zahranicna__politika&TG=BlankMaster&URL=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/medzinarodne_zmluvy-zmluvy_podla_predmetu&CTYPE=%C4%BDudsk%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A1va&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=SK&PAGE_VSETKYZMLUVY-DWMCEA-7XEM76=1 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia – list of international acts relating to human rights |publisher=Mzv.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] Slovakia excludes multiple citizenships.

===Administrative divisions===

As for administrative division, Slovakia is subdivided into 8 krajov (singular – kraj, usually translated as "region"), each of which is named after its principal city. Regions have enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy since 2002. Their self-governing bodies are referred to as Self-governing (or autonomous) Regions (sg. samosprávny kraj, pl. samosprávne kraje) or Upper-Tier Territorial Units (sg. vyšší územný celok, pl. vyššie územné celky, abbr. VÚC).
The "kraje" are subdivided into many okresov (sg. okres, usually translated as districts). Slovakia currently has 79 districts.
In terms of economics and unemployment rate, the western regions are richer than eastern regions; however the relative difference is no bigger than in most EU countries having regional differences.

==Economy==

The Slovak economy is considered an advanced economy, with the country dubbed the "Tatra Tiger". Slovakia transformed from a centrally planned economy to a market-driven economy. Major privatizations are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost completely in private hands, and foreign investment has risen.
Before the global recession, Slovakia had experienced high and sustained economic growth. In 2007 (with GDP growth of 10.5%), 2008 (6%) and 2010 (with 4%), Slovakia was the fastest growing economy in the European Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2012/pdf/ee-2012-1_en.pdf |title=Statistical data and prediction of the European Commission |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] In 2011 (with the GDP growth of 3.3%) and 2012 (GDP growth of 1.8%), Slovakia was the 2nd fastest growing Eurozone member after Estonia. Slovakia's GDP growth of 0.9% in 2013 remains one of the highest in the Eurozone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tec00115 |title=Real GDP growth rate - volume |accessdate=2014-01-20[/tpl]
The ratio of government debt to GDP in Slovakia reached 58% by the end of 2013.http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23102013-AP/EN/2-23102013-AP-EN.PDF
Unemployment, peaking at 19% at the end of 1999, decreased to 7.5% in October 2008 according to the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=afxnews&articleid=6608367&subject=companies&action=article |title=Slovak unemployment falls to 7.8% in Feb from Jan from Thomson Financial News Limited |publisher=Iii.co.uk |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] In addition to economic growth, migration of workers to other EU countries also contributed to this reduction. According to Eurostat, which uses a calculation method different from that of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, the unemployment rate in September 2012 is at 13.9% [tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/5/5e/Unemployment_rates%2C_seasonally_adjusted%2C_September_2012.png |title=Eurostat graph of unemployment in Europe Sep. 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] the third highest in the Eurozone (after Spain and Portugal).
Inflation dropped from an average annual rate of 12% in 2000 to just 3.3% in 2002, an election year, but it rose again in 2003–2004 because of rising labor costs and taxes. It reached only 1% in 2010 which is the lowest recorded rate since 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ako-investovat.sk/index.php/inflacia-na-slovensku |title=Inflation in Slovakia since 1993 |publisher=Ako-investovat.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] The rate was at 4% in 2011.
Slovakia adopted the Euro currency on 1 January 2009 as the 16th member of the Eurozone. The euro in Slovakia was approved by the European commission on 7 May 2008. The Slovak koruna was revalued on 28 May 2008 to 30.126 for 1 euro,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601034210/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archivedate=1 June 2008|title=Slovakia revalues currency ahead of euro entry|first=Marcin|last=Grajewski|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] which was also the exchange rate for the euro.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7495169.stm|title=Slovak euro exchange rate is set|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl]
Slovakia is an attractive country for foreign investors mainly because of its low wages, low tax rates and well educated labour force. In recent years, Slovakia has been pursuing a policy of encouraging foreign investment. FDI inflow grew more than 600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached an all-time high of $17.3 billion in 2006, or around $22,000 per capita by the end of 2008.
Despite a sufficient number of researchers[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] and a decent secondary educational system,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Slovakia, along with other post-communist countries, still faces major challenges in the field of the knowledge economy. The business and public research and development expenditures are well below the EU average. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Slovak secondary education the 30th in the world (placing it just below the United States and just above Spain).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale at OECD |format=PDF |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl]
In March 2008, the Ministry of Finance announced that Slovakia's economy is developed enough to stop being an aid receiver from the World Bank. Slovakia became an aid provider at the end of 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tasr.sk/30.axd?k=20080312TBB00600 |title=Slovakia Is Sufficiently Developled to Offer Aid Within World Bank at TASR |publisher=Tasr.sk |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

===Industry===

Although Slovakia's GDP comes mainly from the tertiary (services) sector, the industrial sector also plays an important role within its economy. The main industry sectors are car manufacturing and electrical engineering. Since 2007, Slovakia has been the world's largest producer of cars per capita,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16083 |title=Slovak Car Industry Production Almost Doubled in 2007 |publisher=Industryweek.com |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] with a total of 571,071 cars manufactured in the country in 2007 alone. There are currently three automobile assembly plants: Volkswagen's in Bratislava, PSA Peugeot Citroën's in Trnava and Kia Motors' Žilina Plant.
From electrical engineering companies, Sony has a factory at Nitra for LCD TV manufacturing, Samsung at Galanta for computer monitors and television sets manufacturing.
ESET is an IT security company from Bratislava with more than 500 employees worldwide at present. Their branch offices are in the United States, Ireland, United Kingdom, Argentina, Czech Republic, Singapore and Poland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eset.com/me/about/profile/history/|title=About ESET: Company Profile: History|publisher=ESET|accessdate=2011-07-01[/tpl]

===Energy===

In 2012, Slovakia produced a total of 28 393 GWh of electricity while at the same time consumed 28 786 GWh. The slightly higher level of consumption than the capacity of production (- 393 GWh) meant the country was not self-sufficient in energy sourcing. Slovakia imported electricity mainly from the Czech Republic (9 961 GWh - 73.6% of total import) and exported mainly to Hungary (10 231 GWh - 78.2% of total export).
Nuclear energy accounts for 53.8% of total electricity production in Slovakia, followed by 18.1% of thermal power energy, 15.1% by hydro power energy, 2% by solar energy, 9.6% by other sources and the rest 1.4% is imported.[tpl]cite web|work=Electricity consumption / production in Slovakia in 2012|url=http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|title=National Control Centre of Slovakia|year=2013|accessdate=3 October 2013|language=Slovak, English[/tpl]
The two nuclear power-plants in Slovakia are in Jaslovské Bohunice and Mochovce, each of them containing two operating reactors. Prior to the accession of Slovakia to the EU in 2004, the government agreed to turn-off the V1 block of Jaslovské Bohunice power-plant, built by Soviet Union in 1978. After deactivating the last of the two reactors of the V1 block in 2008, Slovakia instantly stopped being self-dependent in energy production. Currently there is another block (V2) with two active reactors in Jaslovské Bohunice. It is scheduled for decommissioning in 2025. The nuclear power production in Slovakia sometimes draws attention to Austrian green-energy activists who occasionally organize protests and block the borders between the two countries.

===Transportation===

There are four main highways D1 to D4 and eight express ways R1 to R8. Most of them are still in the planning phase.
The D1 motorway connects Bratislava to Trnava, Nitra, Trenčín, Žilina and beyond, while the D2 motorway, going in the north-south direction, connects it to Prague, Brno and Budapest in the north-south direction. The D4 motorway (an outer bypass), which would ease the pressure on Bratislava's highway system, is mostly at the planning stage.
The A6 motorway to Vienna connects Slovakia directly to the Austrian motorway system and was opened on 19 November 2007.[tpl]cite web|work=Pravda|url=http://www.tvojepeniaze.sk/do-viedne-uz-netreba-ist-po-okresnej-ceste-fgy-/sk_pludia.asp?c=A071119_072754_sk_pludia_p01|title=Do Viedne už netreba ísť po okresnej ceste|year=2007|accessdate=19 November 2007|language=Slovak[/tpl]
In Bratislava there are currently five bridges standing over the Danube (ordered by the flow of the river): Lafranconi Bridge, Nový Most (The New Bridge), Starý most (The Old Bridge), Most Apollo and Prístavný most (The Harbor Bridge).
The city's inner network of roadways is made on the radial-circular shape. Nowadays, the city experiences a sharp increase in the road traffic, increasing pressure on the road network. There are about 200,000 registered cars in Bratislava, (approximately 2 inhabitants per car).
Bratislava's M. R. Štefánik Airport is the main international airport in Slovakia. It is located 9 kilometres (5.59 mi) northeast of the city centre. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing of all common types of aircraft currently used.

===Languages===

The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family. Hungarian is widely spoken in the southern regions, and Rusyn is used in some parts of the Northeast. Minority languages hold co-official status in the municipalities in which the size of the minority population meets the legal threshold of 20%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-8.mensiny.vlada.gov.sk/data/files/418.doc|title=Zákon 184/1999 Z. z. o používaní jazykov národnostných menšín |last=Slovenskej Republiky|first=Národná Rada|year=1999|publisher=Zbierka zákonov|language=Slovak|accessdate=7 June 2009[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Folk tradition===

Folk tradition has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, "Nad Tatrou sa blýska", which is based on a melody from "Kopala studienku" folk song.
Manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the "Východná" Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation,[tpl]cite web|title="Východná" festival|url=http://www.festivalvychodna.sk/en/[/tpl] which takes place in Východná annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SĽUK (Slovenský ľudový umelecký kolektív - Slovak folk art collective). SĽUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition.
An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well preserved village of Vlkolínec which has been the UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993.[tpl]cite web|title=UNESCO information about Vlkolínec|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/622[/tpl] Eastern part of Slovakia, particularly the region of Spiš, preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches. Most of them are protected by Slovak law as cultural heritage, but some of them are on the UNESCO list too, in Bodružal, Hervartov, Ladomirová and Ruská Bystrá.
The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk mythologies, is Juraj Jánošík (1688–1713) (the Slovak equivalent of Robin Hood). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Jánošík's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a film Jánošík directed by Martin Frič in 1935.[tpl]cite web|title=Jánošík movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/[/tpl]

===Art===

Visual art in Slovakia is represented through painting, drawing, printmaking, illustration, arts and crafts, sculpture, photography or conceptual art. The supreme and central gallery institution displaying Slovak art nowadays is the Slovak National Gallery,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sng.sk/en/uvod/o-sng |title=About SNG – SNG |publisher=Sng.sk |accessdate=2012-11-25[/tpl] established in 1949.
Medieval time
Well known sculptor of the 15th century Late Gothic era in Slovakia is the Master Paul of Levoča. Although his work can be found in many places (Banská Bystrica, Spišská Sobota or Lomnička), his most famous is a wooden altar in the Church of St. Jacob in Levoča. With its height of [tpl]convert|18.62|m|ft|0[/tpl], it is the tallest Gothic altar in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=Altar information from the official portal of St. Jacob church in Levoča|url=http://www.chramsvjakuba.sk/en.html#hosjakuba[/tpl] Well known painters of that time are the Master from Okoličné, author of the altar in St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice, and Master M.S. of the 16th century, whose statue of Madonna can be seen in the Saint Catherine Church in Banská Štiavnica. The statues of Saint Catherine and Saint Barbara are in the art gallery of the Slovak Mining Museum in Banská Štiavnica.
19th century
The 19th century in Slovakia was a turbulent period of time when Slovaks began experiencing their national revival in the kingdom of Austria-Hungary. Romanticism of Jozef B. Klemens (1817–1883) and Peter Michal Bohúň (1822–1879) was represented in the portrait paintings of Slovak national protagonists of that time (Štefan Moyses, Andrej Sládkovič, Karol Kuzmány or Ľudovít Štúr), depicting the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1840s in the background. Other important painters of the 19th century were mainly portraitists Vojtech Angyal, Dominik Skutecký (1849–1921), J. Štetka, E. Ballo, Jozef Hanula (1863 – 1944), landscapist Karol Miloslav Lehotský (1846 – 1915) and impressionists Maximilián Schurmann (1863 – 1944) and P. Kern.
Sculpture in the 19th century was dominated by a sacral sculptor Vavrinec Dunajský (1784 – 1833) and his son Ladislav Dunajský, author of Ján Hollý memorial in Dobrá Voda. Another important sculptors were Ján Koniarek (1878 – 1952), Alojz Stróbl (1856 – 1926), Ján Fadrusz (1858 – 1903) and Alojz Rigele (1879–1940).

The inspiration of their work stems mainly from the lives of everyday people in Slovak rurals which they admired and idealized. The painters influenced by Art Nouveau, symbolism and expressionism are Zolo Palugyay (1898 – 1935), Anton Jasusch (1882–1965), Edmund Gwerk (1895–1956) or Július Jakoby (1903 – 1985). Important also is Blažej Baláž (1958).
Some of the most distinguished Slovak artists, whose work was closely linked to modern European art streams are Koloman Sokol (1902 – 2003), who became a professor of graphic techniques at the Escuela de las Artes del Libro and at the University of Mexico City from 1937 to 1941, Ľudovít Fulla (1902 – 1980) who received many international prices for his work[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=galeria&ix=sngglf |title=Galéria Ludovíta Fullu Ružomberok /* Ludovit Fulla Gallery Ruzomberok /Muzeum.SK - múzeum, galéria, hrad, zámok/ |publisher=Muzeum.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] and Imro Weiner-Kráľ (1901 – 1978).

===Literature===

For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see List of Slovak authors.
Christian topics include: poem Proglas as a foreword to the four Gospels, partial translations of the Bible into Old Church Slavonic, Zakon sudnyj ljudem.
Medieval literature, in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in Latin, Czech and Slovakized Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include Johannes de Thurocz, author of the Chronica Hungarorum and Maurus, both of them Hungarians.[tpl]cite book |title=The dictionary of biographical reference: containing one hundred thousand names, together with a classed index of the biographical literature of Europe and America|last=Lawrence Barnett Phillips |first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|year=1871 |publisher=S. Low, Son, & Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020[/tpl] The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.
There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was Anton Bernolák whose concept was based on the western Slovak dialect in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was Ľudovít Štúr, whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.
Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include Pavol Jozef Šafárik, Matej Bel, Ján Kollár, and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such Milan Rastislav Štefánik and Alexander Dubček.
Famous globetrotter and explorer, count Móric Benyovszky had Slovak ancestors.

===Music===

Classical music
The most important Slovak composers have been Eugen Suchoň, Mikuláš Schneider-Trnavský, Ján Cikker, Ján Levoslav Bella, Alexander Moyzes and Dezider Kardoš, in the 21st century Vladimír Godár and Peter Machajdík.
Pop music
Popular music began to replace folk music beginning in the 1950s, when Slovakia was still part of Czechoslovakia; American jazz, R&B, and rock and roll were popular, alongside waltzes, polkas, and czardas, among other folk forms. By the end of the 1950s, radios were common household items, though only state stations were legal. Slovak popular music began as a mix of bossa nova, cool jazz, and rock, with propagandistic lyrics. Dissenters listened to ORF (Austrian Radio), Radio Luxembourg, or Slobodná Európa (Radio Free Europe), which played more rock.
Due to Czechoslovak isolation, the domestic market was active and many original bands evolved. Slovakia had a very strong pop culture during the 1970s and 1980s. This movement brought many original bands with their own unique interpretations of modern music. The quality of socialist music was very high. Stars such as Karel Gott, Olympic, Pražský výběr (from Czechia) or Elán, Modus, Tublatanka, Team (from Slovakia) and many others were highly acclaimed and many recorded their LPs in foreign languages.
After the Velvet Revolution and the declaration of the Slovak state, domestic music dramatically diversified as free enterprise encouraged the formation of new bands and the development of new genres of music. Soon, however, major labels brought pop music to Slovakia and drove many of the small companies out of business. During the 1990s, American grunge and alternative rock, and Britpop have a wide following, as well as a newfound enthusiasm for musicals.
Jazz
Peter Lipa (born 1943) is a well-known Slovak singer, composer and promoter of modern jazz. He is one of the main organizers of the "Bratislava Jazz Days" festival, which takes place in the capital city at the end of October each year since 1975. It is the biggest jazz venue in Slovakia.
Martin Valihora (1976), having been awarded a scholarship on the Berklee College of Music in Boston,[tpl]cite news|title=Well-rooted musicians can stretch their styles|date=18 April 2011|work=The Slovak Spectator|quote=The festival is the "spiritual child" of Valihora, a graduate of Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA,[/tpl] he established himself as a part of the New York's jazz scene. He has been playing with the world's famous Japanese jazz pianist Hiromi Uehara.[tpl]cite news|title=The first (and only) name in jazz piano|date=5 December 2004|work=The Houston Chronicle|page=7 section:"ZEST"|quote=Hiromi ... makes her Houston debut ... with her trio, featuring electric bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihor[/tpl]
Other notable Slovak jazz players are Laco Déczi (1938) -  composer, jazz trumpeter, Marián Varga (1947) - composer, organ player

===Cuisine===

Traditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on pork meat, poultry (chicken is the most widely eaten, followed by duck, goose, and turkey), flour, potatoes, cabbage, and milk products. It is relatively closely related to Hungarian, Czech and Austrian cuisine. On the east it is also influenced by Ukrainian and Polish cuisine. In comparison with other European countries, "game meat" is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular. Boar, rabbit, and venison, are generally available throughout the year. Lamb and goat are eaten but are not widely popular.
The traditional Slovak meals are bryndzové halušky, bryndzové pirohy and other meals with potato dough and bryndza. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterized by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzové halušky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.
A typical soup is a sauerkraut soup ("kapustnica"). A blood sausage called "jaternica", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific slovak meal.
Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. Slovak wine comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or rosé (except in some regions), and sweet wine more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] Beer (mainly of the pilsener style, though dark lagers are also consumed) is also popular.
