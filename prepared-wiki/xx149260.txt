The WFCU Centre is a sports-entertainment centre in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It opened on December 11, 2008, and it is named after the Windsor Family Credit Union, a local financial institution. It is located in the east end of the city, northeast of the intersection of Tecumseh and Lauzon Roads.

==History==

The WFCU Centre was built at a cost of approximately $71 million by the Windsor, Ontario-based construction company, PCR Contractors. The land was purchased from London, Ontario developer Farhi Holdings Corporation. The construction of this sports-entertainment centre was decided upon as a part of the city governmentâ€™s overall effort to add excitement to the economy. As part of that effort, Windsor city council committed to building the centre, and agreed to fund most of the cost. 
During the initial stages of planning, several other committees and companies proposed building arenas and venues in the area, including a privately owned skating arena, as well as proposed a relocation of the Windsor Raceway Slots to Tecumseh, Ontario, owned by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation.
