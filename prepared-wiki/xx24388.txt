The York Chocolate (or simply York) is an uncommon and relatively recent American breed of show cat, with a long, fluffy coat and a tapered tail and most of them are mostly or entirely chocolate-brown. The breed was named after New York state, where it was established in 1983. This breed was created by color-selecting domestic long-haired cats of mixed ancestry.  The breed is not widely recognized by cat registries.

==History==

The breed was created by Janet Chiefari in 1983. The father was a black longhaired cat and the mother was a longhaired black and white cat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/cats/York_Chocolate.htm|title=York Chocolate|accessdate=2007-07-22|publisher=The Furry Creature Network[/tpl][tpl]Tertiary[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=March 2013[/tpl] Their Siamese ancestors created the brown coloring in one kitten: Brownie. Brownie had a litter that subsequent summer with a black longhaired tom. There were two kittens in the litter: a chocolate male and a white and chocolate female. Upon noticing similarities in coat and body types, Chiefari began her own breeding program.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
The breed is recognized, under the shorter name York, by the recently founded World Cat Federation based in Germany, and with some differences from previously published standards,[ref]
 A PDF version is available.[/ref] most of which seem to be lost.  The breed is not recognized by any major, long-established international cat fancier organizations, such as The International Cat Association (TICA), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) or Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), nor even US national groups such as the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA).  In March 1990, the Cat Fanciers' Federation of the New England area of the US recognized York Chocolates as an "experimental" cat breed, and allegedly gave it championship status within the group in March 1992, but publishes no breed standard or any other information about the breed today.The Cat Fanciers' Federation (CFF) mentions the breed name in its list of breeds, but provides no information about it at all, not even its status, much less a breed standard. It was supposedly granted champion status by the Canadian Cat Association in March 1995, as well,[tpl]cite web |url= http://pets.iloveindia.com/cats/cat-breed/york-chocolate.html |title=York Chocolate |accessdate=2007-07-22 |work=Pets.ILoveIndia.com[/tpl][tpl]tertiary[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=March 2013[/tpl] but while the CCA published a breed standard in 1995,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cca-afc.com/en/BreedStandards/york%20chocolate.pdf |title=York Chocolate |date=January 28, 1995 |author= |work=CCA-AFC.com |publisher=Canadian Cat Association (CCA) |location=Mississauga, Ontario, Canada |accessdate=March 5, 2013 |archivedate=March 5, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EtHsnsF2 |format=PDF[/tpl] [tpl]as of|March 2013|lc=y[/tpl], the organization no longer advertises it, and it includes outdated wording.The Canadian Cat Association (CCA) has a placeholder page for the breed on their website, but it is empty of content.
