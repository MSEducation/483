==National economic planning==

Following annual approval of the government’s budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan. The fifth development plan, for 2010–15, is designed to delegate power to the people and develop a knowledge economy.The fifth Iranian development plan. PressTV, January 19, 2010. Retrieved January 20, 2010. The plan is part of "Vision 2025", a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.[ref]

===Economic reform plan===

Expansion of public healthcare and international relations are the other main objectives of the fifth plan, an ambitious series of measures that include subsidy reform, banking, currency, taxation, customs, construction, employment, nationwide goods and services distribution, social justice and productivity. The intent is to make the country self-sufficient by 2015 and replace the payment of $100 billion in subsidies annually with targeted social assistance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0430/Why-Iran-s-Ahmadinejad-is-pushing-to-cut-popular-government-subsidies |author= Roshanak Taghavi| title=Why Iran's Ahmadinejad is pushing to cut popular government subsidies |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl]Iran Investment Monthly.

==Ownership==

Following the hostilities with Iraq the Government declared its intention to privatize most industries and to liberalize the economy. Sale of state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a nationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006 most industries, some 70% of the economy, remained state-owned. The majority of heavy industries including steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the public sector, with most light industry privately owned.
Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country's economy should consist of state, cooperative and private sectors based. The state sector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals, banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services, aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned and administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned with production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of the cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law. As of 2012, 5,923 consumer cooperatives, employed 128,396.6,000 Cooperatives Nationwide. Iran Daily, July 12, 2012. Retrieved July 14, 2012.  Consumer cooperatives have over six million members.
