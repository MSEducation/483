Living Legends is a rap group consisting of six indie hip hop artists from California. Beginning in the early 1990s, the crew garnered a following by recording, promoting and performing their music independently. 
The crew is considered by LA Weekly to be "one of the biggest success stories of the indie-rap movement, having sold close to 300,000 units of their various solo and group efforts â€” all by them-damn-selves."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-06-05/music/eight-men-out/|title=The Who's Who of L.A.'s Living Legends Crew|publisher=LA Weekly|first=Jonah|last=Flicker|date=June 4, 2008[/tpl]

==History==

Living Legends originally grew out of Mystik Journeymen, consisted of BFAP (now known as Sunspot Jonz) and PSC (now known as Luckyiam). Beginning in 1994, the Mystik Journeymen began cultivating a fan base by selling their own tapes on the streets and hosting "Underground Survivors" shows in East Oakland. In 1995, the duo met The Grouch. They soon embarked on the first of several of self-funded tours throughout Europe. In 1996, Mystik Journeymen and The Grouch joined with the trio known as 3 Melancholy Gypsys (Eligh, Scarub and Murs) of Los Angeles. They formed Living Legends in late 1990s. The crew has since grown to include Bicasso, Aesop and Arata.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-legends/classic/14192/|publisher=Prefix Magazine|title=Album Review: Living Legends - Classic|first=Josiah|last=Hughes|date=March 8, 2005[/tpl]
