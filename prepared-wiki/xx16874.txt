The annihilation into a neutrino–antineutrino pair is also possible, but the probability is predicted to be negligible. The branching ratio for o-Ps decay for this channel is [tpl]val|6.2|e=-18[/tpl] (electron neutrino–antineutrino pair) and [tpl]val|9.5|e=-21[/tpl] (for each non-electron flavour) in predictions based on the Standard Model, but it can be increased by non-standard neutrino properties, like mass or relatively high magnetic moment. The experimental upper limits on branching ratio for this decay (as well as for a decay into any "invisible" particles) are

==Energy levels==

While precise calculation of positronium energy levels uses the Bethe–Salpeter equation or the Breit equation, the similarity between positronium and hydrogen allows a rough estimate.  In this approximation, the energy levels are different between the two because of a different value for the mass, m*, used in the energy equation (see electron energy levels for a derivation)
The reduced mass in this case is
Thus, for positronium, its reduced mass only differs from the rest mass of the electron by a factor of 2. This causes the energy levels to also roughly be half of what they are for the hydrogen atom.
So finally, the energy levels of positronium are given by

==Prediction and discovery==

Croatian scientist Stjepan Mohorovičić predicted the existence of positronium in a 1934 article published in Astronomische Nachrichten, in which he called the substance "electrum". Other sources credit Carl Anderson as having predicted its existence in 1932 while at Caltech. It was experimentally discovered by Martin Deutsch at MIT in 1951 and became known as positronium.

==Exotic compounds==

Molecular bonding was predicted for positronium.  Molecules of positronium hydride (PsH) can be made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/accomplishments/files/BES_Accomp_FY1992.pdf|page=9|title="Out of This World" Chemical Compound Observed[/tpl]  Positronium can also form a cyanide and can form bonds with halogens or lithium.[tpl]cite journal|last=Saito|first=Shiro L.|year=2000|title=Is Positronium Hydride Atom or Molecule?|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B|volume=171|pages=60–66|doi=10.1016/s0168-583x(00)00005-7[/tpl]
The first observation of di-positronium molecules—molecules consisting of two positronium atoms—was reported on 12 September 2007 by David Cassidy and Allen Mills from University of California at Riverside.

Positronium in high energy states has been predicted to be the dominant form of atomic matter in the universe in the far future, if proton decay is a reality.A dying universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects, Fred C.
