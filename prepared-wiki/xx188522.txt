Giovanni "Gianni" Alemanno (born 3 March 1958 in Bari, Italy) is an Italian politician  who from April 2008 until June 2013 was Mayor of Rome for the centre-right People of Freedom.

==Career==

At an early age Alemanno joined the neo-fascist/post-fascist Italian Social Movement, and he became national secretary of the youth organization of the party in 1988. After being elected regional deputy of Lazio in 1990, he was elected for the first time to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1994 general election.
In 1995 he joined the newly formed National Alliance party, which succeeded the Italian Social Movement following its repudiation of extremism. Together with Francesco Storace, he founded Social Right, a national- and social-conservative faction within National Alliance.
Between 2001 and 2006, Alemanno was Minister of Agriculture under Silvio Berlusconi (in Berlusconi's 2nd and 3rd cabinets).

===Mayor of Rome===

After having been heavily defeated by Walter Veltroni in the 2006 mayoral election of Rome, in April 2008 he defeated Francesco Rutelli and became Mayor of the city. Alemanno rejected a formal alliance with the far-right party, but his critics emphasized that his victory was greeted by crowds of supporters, among them far right skinheads, who chanted "Duce! Duce!" and raised their arms in a fascist salute;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/2706408/Italian-politicians-praise-fascist-era-of-Benito-Mussolini.html|title=Italian politicians 'praise' fascist era of Benito Mussolini | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Nick | last=Squires | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate=2010-05-03[/tpl] [tpl]en icon[/tpl] then Alemanno said: «People calling me Duce makes me laugh. I’m not at all fascist and I think that today the word belongs to the history books.

In August 2008, Alemanno caused a controversy when a group of Gypsies attacked a Dutch couple that had been camping outside of Rome. The couple was beaten and robbed and the woman was raped. Alemanno  stated that the couple had been "very careless" by camping in an area "forgotten by God and man" where camping was illegal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4602567.ece|title=Attack on pilgrim tourists reignites Italy's row over immigrants | location=London | work=The Times | first=Richard | last=Owen | date=2008-08-25 | accessdate=2010-05-03[/tpl] [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
Alemanno said that the attack was an isolated case, and repeated to want to crack down on crime, regaining total control of the territory.
In November 2008, Alemanno decided to build a museum dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust in a Roman park.
