==Track listing==

Bone Symphony had a successful Dance hit in Europe with the single from their Bone Symphony EP "It's a Jungle Out There", and yet the group is best known for "One Foot in Front of The Other" from the movie Revenge of The Nerds. The eponymous 1983 Bone Symphony EP (Capitol Records) was their first and only album. 
The album lost the punchy techno-garage sound found in the group's live performances in Hollywood -  the production was smoother, fatter and more commercial, much like many of the dance records of the day. This was due largely to the replacement of the original Roland 808 and Linn drum machines by the incredibly talented drummer Robert Williams (Captain Beefheart, PIL). 
Sadly, the much more "techno" demos are now lost.
