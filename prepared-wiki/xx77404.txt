==Life==

M. M. Kaye was born in Simla, India, and spent her early childhood and much of her early-married life there. Her family ties with the country are strong: her father, Sir Cecil Kaye was an intelligence officer in the Indian Army; her grandfather, brother and husband all served the British Raj and her grandfather's cousin, Sir John Kaye, wrote the standard accounts of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the First Afghan War. After India's independence, her husband, Major-General Goff Hamilton of Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (the famous Indian Army regiment featured in The Far Pavilions), joined the British Army and for the next nineteen years M. M. Kaye followed the drum to Kenya, Zanzibar, Egypt, Cyprus and Germany.
M. M. Kaye won worldwide fame for The Far Pavilions, which became a worldwide best-seller on publication in 1978. Shadow of the Moon and Trade Wind, although originally published prior to The Far Pavilions, were reissued after that novel's success. She also wrote and illustrated The Ordinary Princess, a children's book (called "refreshingly unsentimental" by an article in Horn Book Magazine)[tpl]cite journal|last=Schmitz |first=Terri |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |date=July–August 2002 |title=Recommended Reissues: Safety in Numbers |journal=Horn Book Magazine |volume=LXXVIII |issue=4 |pages=432 |publisher= |location=Boston |issn=0018-5078 |quote=  [/tpl] which she originally wrote as a short story,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-02-04-author-kaye-dies_x.htm |title='Far Pavilions' author M.M.
