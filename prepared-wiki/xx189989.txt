OPUS is a rechargeable contactless stored value smart card used by most of the public transit systems in the Canadian province of Quebec.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Smart transit cards come to Montreal, Quebec |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/04/21/qc-smartcards0421.html |work=CBC News |publisher= |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2008-07-22 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Opus's encore plays downtown |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=7523163f-7b82-4ea7-847f-5179624b1d15 |work=The Gazette (Montreal) |publisher= |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2008-07-22 [/tpl]  
The name is a play on the French phrase au puce, puce being the generic French word for the chip used in any type smart card.

==Fares==

An advantage to the smart card compared to the previous system is the seamless integration with other transit networks of neighbouring cities.  Another advantage relates to the speed at which users can access the system. As opposed to the magnetic stripe cards previously in use, the contactless smart card is more user-friendly in that not only will the card not risk becoming demagnetized and rendered useless, but it also does not require patrons to slide the card in a particular way — proximity to the contactless reader will suffice.
One card can contain up to four different kinds of fares. (An OPUS card can contain, for example, 1 STM monthly pass, 10 STL tickets, 6 CIT Laurentides tickets and 2 train tickets for AMT zone 5.)  One transit fare simply overrides the other 3 when paying at any machine in a similar fashion to PayPass.  The main goal behind the creation of this card is to reduce the amount of fare evasion that takes place in the province's transit systems.
The card is available at various points of sale where local transit fares are currently sold.  Re-filling stations can be found at Montreal Metro stations, train stations, and Agence metropolitaine de transport bus terminals, as well as where local transit fares are sold.
Costs to the STM related to the project were approximately $138 million, compared to the original estimated cost of some $100 million. The project was originally supposed to be implemented in 2006.

==Rollout phases==

In preparation for this new step in Montreal's public transportation network, turnstiles that incorporate the reader and vending machines were  installed in metro stations; buses had previously been fitted with new fare boxes that incorporate the card reader, in order to ensure the uniformity of methods of payment across Montreal's transit network and that of its suburbs.
