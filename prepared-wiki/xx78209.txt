[[Flag of Kuwait]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Asia, National symbols of Kuwait

The flag of Kuwait ([tpl]lang-ar|علم الكويت[/tpl]) was adopted on September 7, 1961, and officially hoisted November 24, 1961.
Before 1961, the flag of Kuwait, like those of other Persian Gulf states, was red and white with the word "الكويت" in the middle. The present flag is in the Pan-Arab colours, but each colour is also significant in its own right. Black represents the defeat of the enemy, while red is the colour of blood on the Kuwaiti swords. White symbolizes purity, and green is for the fertile land.
The colours' meaning came from a poem by Safie Al-Deen Al-Hali:
Rules of hanging and flying the flag:
In 2005, it became the design of the world's largest kite at a size of 1019 square metres. It was made in New Zealand by Peter Lynn, launched to the public for the first time in 2004 in the United Kingdom, officially launched in Kuwait in 2005, and has not been surpassed since.

==Amir's flag==

The current Amir of Kuwait is not known to have a personal royal standard. It is a possibility that he uses the national flag as his own. In photographs he appears with the national flag with a golden fringe. Formerly the flag of the Amir was the national one with a yellow crown on the green stripe.
