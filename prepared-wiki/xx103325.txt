The RT-2 was an intercontinental ballistic missile deployed by the Soviet Union, which was in service from December 1968 until 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/rt2.html|title=RT-2|first=Anatoly|last=Zak|work=RussianSpaceWeb|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] It was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-13 Savage and carried the GRAU index 8K98. It was designed by OKB-1[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/launchers/rocket-rt2p.html|title=Rocket RT-2P|publisher=RKK Energia|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] and about 60 were built by 1972.

==History==

The RT-2 was the first solid-propellant ICBM in Soviet service, and was a development of the earlier RT-1 series. It was a three-stage inertially-guided missile that is comparable to the American Minuteman III. It was armed with a single 600 kiloton warhead and was silo-launched, although a rail-based version was contemplated by Soviet planners. It was deployed in the Yoshkar-Ola missile field.
The two upper stages of the RT-2 were used to develop the RT-15 mobile IRBM system. The RT-2PM Topol is supposedly a modernized version of the RT-2[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

==Operations==

The RT-2 was capable of delivering a [tpl]convert|1200|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] class payload to a maximum operational range of approximately 5,500 nautical milesDefense Intelligence Agency: "SS-13 Ballistic Missile System", 8 November 1973, DIA Task No. T74-10-03

===Command and Control===

Numbers of launchers were monitored by a single launch control center (LCC). The hardened and dispersed silo concept increased system survivability and provided steady environmental controls from the solid-propellant motors.  Normal control of the RT-2 missile force was exercised by Headquarters RVSN, through an intermediate RVSN Army and launch complex headquarters (HCC).  A launch complex consisted of an HCC and several LCCs, monitoring numerous underground launchers.
