</ref> Many variations of three-player chess have been devised. They usually use a non-standard [[Board game|board]], for example, a [[hexagon]]al or three-sided board that connects the center cells (board "squares") in a special way. The three armies are differentiated usually by color.
Three-player chess variants (as well as other three-player games) are the hardest to design fairly, since the imbalance created when two players gang up against one is usually too great for the defending player to withstand. Some versions attempt to avoid this "petty diplomacy"[ref]
