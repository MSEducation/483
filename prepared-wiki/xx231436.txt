The Belvedere Hotel is a Beaux Arts style building in Baltimore, Maryland.  Designed by the Boston architectural firm of Thomas and Parker and built in 1903, the Belvedere is a Baltimore landmark in the city's fashionable Mount Vernon neighborhood. The eleven-story building rises [tpl]convert|118|ft|0[/tpl] from a rusticated base to an elaborately-detailed Second Empire crown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=429&COUNTY=Baltimore%20City&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Baltimore%20City|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-07|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
The hotel is named for its site on the former "Belvidere" estate of John Eager Howard. The hotel was known as the premier lodging in Baltimore during the first half of the twentieth century, hosting U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Woodrow Wilson, among others, along with such celebrities as Wallis Warfield Simpson (the Duchess of Windsor), Douglas MacArthur, Clark Gable, and others.[tpl]cite web|title=The Belvedere: History|year=2003|publisher=Belvedere Hotel|url=http://www.belvederebaltimore.com/history.php|accessdate=2009-06-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090527022748/http://www.belvederebaltimore.com/history.php| archivedate= 27 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The partners retained the architectural firm of Parker and Thomas of Baltimore and Boston, and the construction firm of W. W. and E. A. Wells of Chicago. Parker and Thomas had designed the Homewood campus of The Johns Hopkins University some 30 years earlier. 
When it was completed, the Belvedere, according to early accounts was considered "something of a sensation for Baltimore." Over the years, it has figured prominently in Baltimore's social, political and economic life. In 1911, Woodrow Wilson, once a professor at the Johns Hopkins University, stayed at the Belvedere while attending the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore. That convention nominated him for President. 
Sheraton Hotels purchased the hotel in 1946 and operated it until 1968 as the Sheraton-Belvedere.http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_life_at_the_belvedere_jf12/
The hotel was converted to condominiums in 1991, although the building's ballrooms, restaurants, and lounges remain open to the public.
