The Flanders F.4 was a 1910s British experimental military two-seat monoplane aircraft designed and built by Howard Flanders as a development of the Flanders F.3.

==Development==

Following success with his F.3 experimental monoplane in the spring of 1912, the British War Office ordered four Flanders monoplanes for use by the newly formed Royal Flying Corps.Bruce 1982, p.249. The aircraft had the same configuration as the F.3 but was improved with larger cockpits, accommodating a crew of two in tandem, was powered by a 70 hp (52 kW) Renault engine driving a four-bladed propellerBruce 1982, pp. 249–250. and had other modifications to improve reliability and maintainability. The fixed landing gear of the F.3 was improved with the addition of coil-spring suspension. The first aircraft was flying at Brooklands by 6 July 1912, with all four flown and delivered to the RFC by 2 January 1913. Testing showed the monoplanes flew well,Bruce 1982, pp. 250–251. but following the fatal crashes of a Deperdussin and a Bristol-Coanda Monoplane on 6 and 10 September 1912, the Royal Flying Corps had banned the use of monoplanes and the aircraft were not used, with their engines being removed to power Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2s.Bruce 1982, p. xv.Bruce 1982, p. 251.
