Robert James Bruce (born May 16, 1933) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball.
Bruce was a mainstay of the expansion Houston Colt .45 starting rotation in that team's early seasons, tying Turk Farrell for the team lead in wins (with 10) in the Colt .45's inaugural 1962 season, and becoming the first Houston pitcher to win 15 games, in 1964.
On April 19, 1964, Bruce struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 6-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Bruce became the seventh National League pitcher and the 12th pitcher in major league history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning, only one day after Sandy Koufax achieved the same feat.
