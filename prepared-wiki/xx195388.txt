==History==

KEDA (1540 AM) founded on March 17, 1966, by a Tejano radio pioneer, Manuel G. Davila. KEDA is regarded by some as one of the first Tejano Music radio stations in the United States.http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Does-anyone-recall-50s-teen-DJs-4265914.php Davila's first words on the opening day of his station were "KEDA está en el aire." [tpl]Verify source|date=March 2013[/tpl] From its founding KEDA committed to the goal of supporting the local tejano bands of San Antonio. This goal has been attributed by some to the lack of airtime given to Tejano bands in the 1960s. KEDA made it a practice to play the albums of small bands and can now claim the early featuring of now famous performers. While the radio formats of stations usually change over time, KEDA's format has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. [tpl]Verify source|date=March 2013[/tpl] 
In 2008 KEDA was the longest-running and last remaining family-owned independent radio station in the San Antonio market; along with playing music, it maintained a connection to its roots through community-service programming. These efforts included the reading of obituaries on the air, as well as fundraisers for those who could not afford to bury their dead children.[tpl]Verify source|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Manuel G. Davila died on July 12, 1997. Leaving the station to his wife and children. His youngest son, Albert Davila was Program Director of KEDA until 2011. [tpl]Verify source|date=October 2012[/tpl]
