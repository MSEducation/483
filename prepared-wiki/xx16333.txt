===Early history===

Finglas was originally the site of an Early Christian abbey, the origin of which has been associated, from early times, with the name of St. Cainnech, or Canice, the patron of Kilkenny, said to have founded it in 560 A.D. The Nethercross from the first abbey can be seen today in the old graveyard.Parish of St. Canice - The Cross of Nethercross Several primary schools and churches in the area have been named after Canice. According to an ancient legend, the ground on which Finglas stands had been sanctified by St. Patrick, who is said to have uttered from it a prophecy that a great town would arise at the ford of hurdles in the vale beneath. St. Canice is said to have been born at Glengiven near Derry. The Finglas or Finglass family, prominent in law and politics in the sixteenth century, took their name from the district.
Finglas is a civil parish in the barony of Castleknock.
Following the Battle of the Boyne, Finglas was used as a camp for four days by William of Orange en route to Dublin city. He is believed to have camped near the Labour Exchange building on Mellowes Road and to the rear of Glebe House with access from Church Street. Excavation works at the site in the early 1990s found what is believed to be fortifications dating from this time.
