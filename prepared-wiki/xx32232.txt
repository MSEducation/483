The Orinoco is one of the longest rivers in South America at [tpl]convert|2,140|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its drainage basin, sometimes called the Orinoquia, covers [tpl]convert|880,000|km2|-3[/tpl], with 76.3% of it in Venezuela and the remainder in Colombia. The Orinoco and its tributaries are the major transportation system for eastern and interior Venezuela and the llanos of Colombia.

==History==

The mouth of the Orinoco at the Atlantic Ocean was documented by Columbus on 1 August 1498, during his third voyage. Its source at the Cerro Delgado-Chalbaud, in the Parima range, was not explored by non-indigenous peoples until 1951, 453 years later. The source, on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border, at [tpl]convert|1047|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of elevation ([tpl]coord|02|19|05|N|63|21|42|W|[/tpl] ), was explored in 1951 by a joint Venezuelan-French team.
The Orinoco delta, and tributaries in the eastern llanos such as the Apure and Meta, were explored in the 16th century by German expeditions under Ambrosius Ehinger and his successors.  In 1531 Diego de Ordaz, starting at the principal outlet in the delta, the Boca de Navios, sailed up the river to the Meta. Antonio de Berrio sailed down the Casanare to the Meta, and then down the Orinoco and back to Coro.
Alexander von Humboldt explored the basin in 1800, reporting on the pink river dolphins. He published extensively on the river's flora and fauna.Helferich, Gerard (2004) Humboldt's Cosmos: Alexander von Humboldt and the Latin American Journey that Changed the Way We See the World, Gotham Books, New York, ISBN 1-59240-052-3.
The new age singer Enya made a song, called Orinoco Flow, honoring the Orinoco river.

==Geography==

The course of the Orinoco forms a wide ellipsoidal arc, surrounding the Guiana Shield; it is divided in four stretches of unequal length that roughly correspond to the longitudinal zonation of a typical large river:
