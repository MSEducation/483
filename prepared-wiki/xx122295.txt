"Me Gustas Tú" is the second single from Manu Chao's second solo album, Próxima Estación: Esperanza. It has proved to be one of the artist's most popular songs worldwide. Its lyrics show a simple but catchy structure, and it is primarily sung in Spanish but on the chorus French is also spoken. The song, as well as two other tracks from the same album, "La Primavera" and "Infinita Tristeza", feature the same background music. In fact, on the album, "La Primavera" fades and leads into "Me Gustas Tú".

==Music video==

A music video was produced for the song, featuring Manu Chao dancing and singing the lyrics while some spare words from it appear on the screen, always surrounded by a frame of colourful patterns. A blonde woman (Paz Gómez) dances beside him and sings at the end of the song.
