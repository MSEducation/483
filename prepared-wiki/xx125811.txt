SRF 1 is a Swiss television channel run under the public SRG SSR broadcasting group. It is the first of three national German-language channels in Switzerland (the others being SRF zwei and SRF info). On December 16, 2012 the channel formerly called SF1 was renamed together with the other two national German-speaking TV and five radio channels to emphasise their common broadcasting group and to create a shared web-site under one name.
Channel programming consists of local programmes as well as a wide range of American prime time shows. SRF 1 is considered to be the channel that airs more local programming, infotainment and other programmes of that nature.
