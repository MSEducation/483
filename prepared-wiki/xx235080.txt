[[Spiro (band)]]

CATEGORIES: British musical groups

Spiro are an instrumental musical group based in Bristol, England. They emerged from the Bristol session scene in 1993, soon settling on a line-up which remains unchanged to this day. They released one album (Lost in Fishponds, 1994) under the name The Famous Five. Their first album under the name Spiro, Pole Star (1997), saw a development of their interest in fusing minimalist classical influences with the traditional music of the North of England.  In 2009 they signed to Real World Records, since when they have released two albums, Lightbox (2009) and Kaleidophonica (2012).
