The National Guard was called out and men with machine guns blocked the front entrance to the track. Time Magazine reported the story nationwide in October 1937.Time Magazine 9/20/37. Quinn won in the short-term, as Walter O'Hara was removed from his post as president and manager of the Narragansett Racing Association, and Judge James E. Dooley officially took control of the track. Quinn was unsuccessful in his re-election bid in 1938 after millionaire William H. Vanderbilt defeated him. Ultimately, the “Race Track War” was considered a national embarrassment.An Album of Rhode Island History by Patrick T. Conley
