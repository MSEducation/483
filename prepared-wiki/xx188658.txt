The most critical factors in the spread or eradication of disease have been human behavior (shifting population centers, changing farming methods and the like) and living standards. Precise statistics do not exist because many cases occur in rural areas where people do not have access to hospitals or other health care. As a consequence, the majority of cases are undocumented.[tpl]cite journal | author = Murray CJ, Rosenfeld LC, Lim SS, Andrews KG, Foreman KJ, Haring D, Fullman N, Naghavi M, Lozano R, Lopez AD | title = Global malaria mortality between 1980 and 2010: a systematic analysis | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960034-8/fulltext/ | journal = Lancet | year = 2012 | volume = 379 | issue = 9814 | pages = 413-431 | pmid = 22305225 [/tpl] Poverty has been and remains associated with the disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Worrall E, Basu S, Hanson K | title = Is malaria a disease of poverty?

After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated.  Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs including chloroquine and artemisinins were used to resist the scourge. 
Malaria researchers have won multiple Nobel Prizes for their achievements, although the disease continues to afflict some 200 million patients each year, killing more than 600,000.

At the close of the 20th century, malaria remains endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.

==Classical period==

Malaria became widely recognized in ancient Greece by the 4th century BCE, and is implicated in the decline of many city-state populations. The term μίασμα (Greek for miasma): "stain, pollution", was coined by Hippocrates of Kos who used it to describe dangerous fumes from the ground that are transported by winds and can cause serious illnesses. Hippocrates (460–370 BCE), the "father of medicine", related the presence of intermittent fevers with climatic and environmental conditions and classified the fever according to periodicity: Gk.:tritaios pyretos / L.:febris tertiana (fever every third day), and Gk.:tetartaios pyretos / L.:febris quartana (fever every fourth day).[tpl]cite journal | author = Hippocrates| title = Of the epidemics (Translated by Francis Adams) The Internet Classics Archive| url =http://classics.mit.edu//Hippocrates/epidemics.mb.txt [/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = Pappas G, Kiriaze IJ, Falagas ME| title = Insights into infectious disease in the era of Hippocrates | journal = Int J Infect Dis.| year = 2008 | pmid = 18178502 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2007.11.003 | volume = 12 | pages = 347–50 | issue = 4[/tpl]

Around 168 BCE the herbal remedy Qing-hao (青蒿) (Artemisia annua) came into use in China to treat female hemorrhoids (Wushi'er bingfang translated as "Recipes for 52 kinds of diseases" unearthed from the Mawangdui tombs).[tpl]cite journal | author = Li Y, Wu YL. | title = An over four millennium story behind qinghaosu (artemisinin)--a fantastic antimalarial drug from a traditional Chinese herb| journal = Curr Med Chem| volume = 10 | pages = 2197–230| year =  2003| pmid =14529339 | doi = 10.2174/0929867033456710 | issue = 21 [/tpl]
Qing-hao was first recommended for acute intermittent fever episodes by Ge Hong as an effective medication in the 4th-century Chinese manuscript Zhou hou bei ji fang, usually translated as "Emergency Prescriptions kept in one's Sleeve".

In 835, the celebration of Hallowmas was moved from May to November at the behest of Pope Gregory IV, on the "practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it", and perhaps because of public health considerations regarding Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives of pilgrims during the sultry summers of the region.Butler's Saint for the Day (Paul Burns), Liturgical Press, page 516

==Middle Ages==

During the Middle Ages, treatments for malaria (and other diseases) included blood-letting, inducing vomiting, limb amputations and trepanning. Some turned to witchcraft and astrology. Physicians and surgeons as well as folk-healers administered ineffective and often deadly herbs - Belladonna, for example.  

===European Renaissance===

The name malaria derived from mal aria ('bad air' in Medieval Italian). This idea came from the Ancient Romans who thought that this disease came from the horrible fumes from the swamps. The word malaria has its roots in the miasma theory, as described by historian and chancellor of Florence Leonardo Bruni in his Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII, which was the first major example of Renaissance historical writing:[tpl]cite journal | author = Hempelmann E, Krafts K  | title = Bad air, amulets and mosquitoes: 2,000 years of changing perspectives on malaria | journal = Malar J. | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 213 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23835014 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-12-232| url = http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-12-232.pdf[/tpl]
 
 Avuto i Fiorentini questo fortissimo castello e fornitolo di buone guardie, consigliavano fra loro medesimi fosse da fare. Erano alcuni a' quali pareva sommamente utile e necessario a ridurre lo esercito, e massimamente essendo affaticato per la infermità e per la mala ariae  per lungo e difficile campeggiare nel tempo dell'autunno e in luoghi infermi, e vedendo ancora ch'egli era diminuito assai per la licenza conceduta a molti pel capitano di potersi partire: perocchè, nel tempo che eglino erano stati lungamente a quello assedio, molti, o per disagio del campo o per paura d'infermità, avevano domandato e ottenuto licenza da lui.
After the Florentines had conquered this stronghold, after putting good guardians on it they were discussing among themselves how to proceed. For some of them it appeared most useful and necessary to reduce the army, more so as it was extremely stressed by disease and bad air, and due to the long-lasting and difficult camps in unhealthy places during the autumn. They (the Florentines) further considered that the army was reduced in numbers due to the leave permits granted to many soldiers by the officers. In fact during the siege many soldiers had asked and obtained the permit to leave due to the camp hardships and fear of illness (Leonardo Bruni, 1444) from medieval Italian.

The coastal plains of southern Italy fell from international prominence  when malaria expanded in the sixteenth century. At roughly the same time, in the coastal marshes of England, mortality from "marsh fever" or "tertian ague" (ague: via French from medieval Latin acuta (febris), acute fever) was comparable to that in sub-Saharan Africa today.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Dobson MJ | title = Malaria in England: a geographical and historical perspective|  journal = Parassitologia. | volume = 36|  pages = 35–60| year = 1994 | pmid = 7898959 | issue =  1–2[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author =  Knottnerus O S | title = Malaria Around the North Sea: A Survey |  journal = Gerold Wefer, Wolfgang H.

===Chinchona tree===

Spanish missionaries found that fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later established to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona).[tpl]cite journal | author = Butler AR, Khan S, Ferguson E| title = A brief history of malaria chemotherapy| journal = J R Coll Physicians Edinb | volume = 40| issue = 2| pages = 172–7 | year = 2010| pmid = 20695174| url = http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_40_2/butler.pdf | doi = 10.4997/JRCPE.2010.216[/tpl]  It was used by the Quechua Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills.[tpl]cite journal | author = Guerra F.| title = The introduction of Cinchona in the treatment of malaria | journal = J Trop Med Hyg.| volume = 80 |issue =  6| pages = 112–118; 135–140| year =  1977 | pmid = 330870[/tpl]  Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), an apothecary by training and who lived in Lima, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark).[tpl]cite journal | author = Greenwood D.| title = The quinine connection| journal = J Antimicrob Chemother. | volume = 30| issue = 4 | pages =417–27  | year = 1992 | pmid = 1490916 | doi = 10.1093/jac/30.4.417[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = Kaufman T, Rúveda E | title = The quest for quinine: those who won the battles and those who won the war | journal = Angew Chem Int Ed Engl | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 854–85 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15669029 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200400663[/tpl] Jesuit Barnabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark.Torti, F. “Therapeutice Specialis ad Febres Periodicas Perniciosas”, 1712 Modena This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bruce-Chwatt LJ |title=Three hundred and fifty years of the Peruvian fever bark |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=296 |issue=6635 |pages=1486–7 |year=1988 |pmid=3134079 |pmc=2546010 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6635.1486 [/tpl]
It would be nearly 200 years before the active principals, quinine and other alkaloids, of cinchona bark were isolated. Quinine, a toxic plant alkaloid, in addition to its anti-malarial properties, is an effective muscle relaxant, as the modern use for nocturnal leg cramps suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).[tpl]cite journal | author = Guay DR| title = Are there alternatives to the use of quinine to treat nocturnal leg cramps?| journal = Consult Pharm | volume = 23 |issue = 2|  pages =141–56  | year = 2008 | pmid = 18454580 | doi = 10.4140/TCP.n.2008.141[/tpl]

===Clinical indications===

In 1717, the dark pigmentation of a postmortem spleen and brain was published by the epidemiologist Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. This was one of the earliest reports of the characteristic enlargement of the spleen and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas to the presence of flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cook GC, Webb AJ.| title = Perceptions of malaria transmission before Ross' discovery in 1897| journal = Postgrad Med J. |volume= 76 |issue= 901|pages= 738–40|year= 2000 | url =  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1741788/pdf/v076p00738.pdf[/tpl]

==19th century==

In the nineteenth century, the first drugs were developed to treat malaria and parasites were first identified as its source.

===Antimalarial drugs===

====Quinine====

French chemist Pierre Joseph Pelletier and French pharmacist Joseph Bienaimé Caventou separated in 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered fever tree bark, allowing for the creation of standardized doses of the active ingredients.Pelletier and Caventou (1820) "Suite:  Des recherches chimiques sur les quinquinas" (Continuation:  Chemical research on quinquinas), Annales de Chimie et de Physique, vol. 15, pages 337–365.  The authors name quinine on page 348:  "..., nous avons cru devoir la nommer quinine, pour la distinguer de la cinchonine par un nom qui indique également son origine."  (..., we thought that we should name it "quinine" in order to distinguish it from cinchonine by means of a name that also indicates its origin.)

An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant spent four years collecting cinchona seeds in the Andes in Bolivia, highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865 the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the Cinchona ledgeriana in Java (Indonesia).

In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an antipyretic medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine and other herbs. Trials were made in Europe in the 1840s and 1850s. It was officially adopted by the Austrian Empire in 1847. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals to be a more efficacious antimalarial than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.[tpl]cite journal |author= Maclean WC |title= Professor Maclean, C.B., on the true composition and therapeutic value of Warburg's Tincture |journal=Lancet |volume=106|pages=716–718 |year=1875|doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(02)30835-3 |issue= 2724[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author= Poser CM, Bruyn GW.  |title= An Illustrated History of Malaria, p. 87|journal=New York: Parthenon, ISBN 978-1-85070-068-5 |year=1999  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N4fyLSwLP3MC&dq=%22An+illustrated+history+of+malaria%22&printsec=frontcover&q= |publisher= Informa Health Care |isbn= 978-1-85070-068-5[/tpl]

====Methylene blue====

In 1876, methylene blue was synthesized by German chemist Heinrich Caro.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krafts K, Hempelmann E, Oleksyn BJ |title=In search of the malarial parasite : Biographical sketches of the blood stain contributors|journal= Parasitol Research |volume= 109 |pages=521–529|year=2011|pmid=21660627 |doi=10.1007/s00436-011-2475-4 |issue=3 [/tpl] Paul Ehrlich in 1880 described the use of "neutral" dyes – mixtures of acidic and basic dyes for the differentiation of cells in peripheral blood smears.

===Etiology: Identification of Plasmodium and Anopheles===

IN 1848 German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel[tpl]cite journal| author=Lorber CG, Lorber CP, Schneider J |title= Die Medizinerfamilie Meckel aus Wetzlar |journal= Hess Aerzteblatt|volume=2 |pages=95–99 |year=2005|url = http://www.laekh.de/upload/Hess._Aerzteblatt/2005/2005_02/2005_02_08.pdf[/tpl] recorded black-brown pigment granules in the blood and spleen of a patient who had died in a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meckel H.|title= Ueber schwarzes Pigment in der Milz und dem Blute einer Geisteskranken|journal= Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie  |volume= IV |pages= 198–226 |year= 1847 [/tpl] The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cox FE | title = History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors | journal = Parasites & Vectors  | volume = 3 | pages = 5 | year = 2010 |doi = 10.1186/1756-3305-3-5 |url = http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/pdf/1756-3305-3-5.pdf | pmid = 20205846 | issue = 1 | pmc = 2825508[/tpl] This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.
In 1885, Ettore Marchiafava, Angelo Celli and Camillo Golgi studied the reproduction cycles in human blood (Golgi cycles). Golgi observed that all parasites present in the blood divided almost simultaneously at regular intervals and that division coincided with attacks of fever. In 1886 Golgi described the morphological differences that are still used to distinguish two malaria parasite species Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae. Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava & Celli in 1890 independently identified Plasmodium falciparum as a species distinct from P. vivax and P. malariae. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both P. malariae and P. vivax (although within the genus Haemamoeba.)[tpl]cite journal |last1=Grassi |first1=B |last2=Feletti |first2=R |year=1890 |title=Parasites malariques chez les oiseaux. |journal=Arch. Ital. Biol. |volume=13 |pages=297–300[/tpl] By 1890 Laveran's germ was generally accepted, but most of his initial ideas had been discarded in favor of the taxonomic work and clinical pathology of the Italian school. Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism Plasmodium.[tpl]cite journal |author= Smith DC, Sanford LB.|title= Laveran's germ: the reception and use of a medical discovery|journal= Am J Trop Med Hyg|volume= 34 |issue= 1|pages=2–20 |year= 1985 |pmid= 2578751[/tpl] H. vivax was soon renamed  Plasmodium vivax. In 1892 Marchiafava and Bignami proved that the multiple forms seen by Laveran were from a single species. This species was eventually  named P. falciparum. Laveran was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine "in recognition of his work on the role played by protozoa in causing diseases".[tpl]cite web | title = Biography of Alphonse Laveran | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1907/laveran-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15[/tpl]
Dutch physician Pieter Pel first proposed a tissue stage of the malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. This suggestion was reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells).[tpl]cite journal |author= Golgi C |title= Sulle febbri malariche estivo-autumnali di Roma|journal= Gass Med di Pavia |volume= 2 |pages=481–493, 505–520, 529–544, 553–559 |year= 1893 [/tpl] Pel in 1896 supported Gogli's latent phase theory.[tpl]cite journal |author= Pel PK |title= Mededeelingen uit de Geneeskundige kliniek.

An early effort at malaria prevention occurred in 1896 in Masssachusetts. An Uxbridge outbreak prompted health officer Dr. Leonard White to write a report to the State Board of Health, which led to a study of mosquito-malaria links and the first efforts for malaria prevention. Massachusetts state pathologist, Theobald Smith, asked that White's son collect mosquito specimens for further analysis, and that citizens add screens to windows, and drain collections of water.[tpl]cite web |title=A History of Mosquitoes in Massachusetts, by Curtis R.

Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon working in Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes, an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/world-mosquito-day/ | title=World Mosquito Day 2010 | publisher=Department for International Development | date=20 August 2010 | accessdate=21 November 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CLT7rY2B | archivedate=21 November 2012[/tpl] He was able to find pigmented malaria parasites in a mosquito that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.[tpl]cite web | title = Biography of Ronald Ross | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15[/tpl] He reported this to the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1898.
Giovanni Battista Grassi, professor of Comparative Anatomy at Rome University, showed that human malaria could only be transmitted by Anopheles (Greek anofelís: good-for-nothing) mosquitoes.[tpl]cite journal |author= Capanna E |title= Grassi versus Ross: who solved the riddle of malaria? | journal= Int Microbiol.|volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 69–74|year= 2006|pmid=16636993 |url = http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1139-67092006000100010&script=sci_arttext[/tpl] Grassi along with coworkers Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli and Ettore Marchiafava announced at the session of the Accademia dei Lincei on 4 December 1898 that a healthy man in a non-malarial zone had contracted tertian malaria after being bitten by an experimentally infected Anopheles claviger specimen.
In 1898-99 Bastianelli, Bignami and Grassi were the first to observe the complete transmission cycle of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae from mosquito to human and back in A. claviger.[tpl]cite journal|author =Grassi B, Bignami A, Bastianelli G|title=Ulteriore ricerche sul ciclo dei parassiti malarici umani sul corpo del zanzarone|journal= Accad Lincei|year=1899|issue=8|pages=21–28[/tpl]
A dispute broke out between the British and Italian schools of malariology over priority, but Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for "his work on malaria, by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it".[tpl]cite web | title = Ross and the Discovery that Mosquitoes Transmit Malaria Parasites| work = CDC Malaria website | url = http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/ross.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602185153/http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/ross.htm |archivedate = 2 June 2007[/tpl]

===Synthesis of quinine===

William Henry Perkin, a student of August Wilhelm von Hofmann  at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, unsuccessfully tried in the 1850s to synthesize quinine in a commercial process. The idea was to take two equivalents of N-allyltoluidine ([tpl]chem|C|10|H || 13|N[/tpl]) and three atoms of oxygen to produce quinine ([tpl]chem|C|20|H|24|N|2|O|2[/tpl]) and water. Instead, Perkin's mauve was produced when attempting quinine total synthesis  via the oxidation of N-allyltoluidine.[tpl]cite journal |author= Seeman JI|title= The Woodward-Doering/Rabe-Kindler total synthesis of quinine: setting the record straight|journal=  Angew Chem Int Ed Engl.|volume= 46 |issue= 9 |pages=1378–413 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17294412 |doi= 10.1002/anie.200601551[/tpl] Before Perkin's discovery, all dyes and pigments were derived from roots, leaves, insects, or, in the case of Tyrian purple, molluscs.
Quinine wouldn't be successfully synthesized until 1918.  Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, with the additional problem of separation of the stereoisomers.  Though quinine is not one of the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies upon extraction from the cinchona tree.

Three possible mechanisms of relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small numbers in the blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marchoux E | title =Paludisme| journal = J.

===Malariotherapy===

In the early twentieth century, before antibiotics, patients with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to create a fever; this was called malariotherapy.

===Panama Canal and vector control===

In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish physician practising in Havana, theorized that yellow fever was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti.[tpl]cite journal|author=Finlay CJ.|title=El mosquito hipotéticamente considerado como agent de transmision de la fiebre amarilla|journal=Anales de la Real Academia de Ciencias Médicas Físicas y Naturales de la Habana|date=1881|issue=18|page=147-169[/tpl] The theory remained controversial for twenty years until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed.[tpl]cite journal |author= Reed W, Carroll J, Agramonte A|title= The Etiology of Yellow Fever|journal= JAMA|volume= 36|pages= 431-440 |year= 1901 [/tpl] This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.  
Yellow fever and malaria among workers had seriously delayed construction of the Panama Canal. Mosquito control instituted by William C.

====Artemisinins====

Systematic screening of traditional Chinese medical herbs was carried out by Chinese research teams, consisting of hundreds of scientists in the 1960s and 1970s.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Li Y, Wu Y| title = A golden phoenix arising from the herbal nest – A review and reflection on the study of antimalarial drug Qinghaosu | journal = Frontiers of Chemistry in China | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–422 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11458-010-0214-5[/tpl] Qinghaosu, later named artemisinin, was cold-extracted in a neutral milieu (pH 7.0) from the dried leaves of Artemisia annua.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wright CW, Linley PA, Brun R, Wittlin S, Hsu E| title = Ancient chinese methods are remarkably effective for the preparation of artemisinin-rich extracts of qing hao with potent antimalarial activity | journal = Molecules| volume = 15 |  pages = 804–12| year = 2010 |pmid =20335947 |url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/15/2/804/pdf | doi = 10.3390/molecules15020804 | issue = 2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Liao F| title = Discovery of Artemisinin (Qinghaosu) | journal = Molecules| volume = 14 |  pages = 5362–5366| year = 2009 | doi =10.3390/molecules14125362 |url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/12/5362/pdf | issue = 12[/tpl]
Artemisinin was isolated by pharmacologist Tu Youyou. Tu headed a team tasked by the Chinese government with finding a treatment for choloroquine-resistant malaria. Their work was known as Project 523, named after the date it was announced – 23 May 1967. The team investigated more than 20,00 Chinese herb preparations and by 1971 had made 380 extracts from 200 herbs. An extract from qinghao (Artemisia annua) was effective but the results were variable. Tu reviewed the literature, including Zhou hou bei ji fang (A handbook of prescriptions for emergencies) written in 340 BC by Chinese physician Ge Hong. This book contained the only useful reference to the herb: "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all." Tu's team subsequently isolated a nontoxic, neutral extract that was 100% effective against parasitemia in animals. The first successful trials of artemisinin were in 1979.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Miller LH, Su X| title = Artemisinin: Discovery from the Chinese Herbal Garden| journal = Cell | volume = 146 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–858 | year = 2011 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3414217/[/tpl] 
Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone containing a peroxide group, which is believed to be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chotivanich K, Sattabongkot J, Udomsangpetch R, Looareesuwan S, Day NP, Coleman RE, White NJ| title = Transmission-Blocking Activities of Quinine, Primaquine, and Artesunate| journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother| volume = 50| issue = 6| pages = 1927–30| year = 2006| pmid = 16723547| doi =10.1128/AAC.01472-05 | pmc = 1479118[/tpl] In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992.

===Insecticides===

Efforts to control the spread of malaria suffered a major setback in 1930. Entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis).[tpl]Cite book|title=Mosquito: The Story of Man's Deadliest foe | year=2002 | publisher=Hyperion | page=131 | first1=Andrew | last1=Spielman | first2=Michael | last2=D'Antonio | isbn=978-0-7868-8667-8|postscript=[/tpl]. This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa.[tpl]cite journal |author= Parmakelis A, Russello MA, Caccone A, Marcondes CB, Costa J, Forattini OP, Sallum MA, Wilkerson RC, Powell JR |title=Historical analysis of a near disaster: Anopheles gambiae in Brazil |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=176–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18187802 |url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/176[/tpl] In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A.gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by meticulous application of Paris Green to breeding places and of Pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.[tpl]cite journal | author = Russell PF, West LS, Manwell RD, MacDonald G | title = Practical Malariology 2nd ed | journal = Oxford University Press, London, New York, Toronto| year = 1963 [/tpl]

====DDT====

Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler is credited with the first synthesis of DDT (DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane) in 1874.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zeidler O| title = Verbindungen von Chloral mit Brom- und Chlorbenzol| journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 1180–1181 | year = 1874 |doi = 10.1002/cber.18740070278 [/tpl] The insecticidal properties of DDT were identified in 1939 by chemist Paul Hermann Müller of Geigy Pharmaceutical. For his discovery of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[ref]
[tpl]cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1948 | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation[/tpl][/ref] In the fall of 1942, samples of the chemical were acquired by the United States, Britain and Germany. Laboratory tests demonstrated that it was highly effective against many insects.
Rockefeller Foundation studies showed in Mexico that DDT remained effective for six to eight weeks if sprayed on the inside walls and ceilings of houses and other buildings.[tpl]cite journal | author = The Rockefeller Foundation| title = Annual Report | year = 1944 |url = http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/d336704a-253d-45da-8572-5c98bcd65801-1944.pdf[/tpl] The first field test in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings was carried out in central Italy in the spring of 1944. The objective was to determine the residual effect of the spray upon Anopheline density in the absence of other control measures. Spraying began in Castel Volturno and, after a few months, in the delta of the Tiber. The unprecedented effectiveness of the chemical was confirmed: the new insecticide was able to eradicate malaria by eradicating mosquitoes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Soper FL, Knipe FW, Casini G, Riehl LA, Rubino A| title = Reduction of Anopheles Density Effected by the Preseason Spraying of Building Interiors with DDT in Kerosene, at Castel Volturno, Italy, in 1944–1945 and in the Tiber Delta in 1945 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 177-200 | year = 1947 | pmid = 20292226[/tpl]  At the end of World War II a massive malaria control program based on DDT spraying was carried out in Italy. In Sardinia – the second largest island in the Mediterranean – between 1946 and 1951, the Rockefeller Foundation conducted a large-scale experiment to test the feasibility of the strategy of "species eradication" in an endemic malaria vector.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tognotti E| title = Program to Eradicate Malaria in Sardinia, 1946–1950| journal = Emerg Infect Dis. | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1460–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19788815 |url = http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/9/pdfs/08-1317.pdf | pmc = 2819864 | doi = 10.3201/eid1509.081317 [/tpl] Malaria was effectively eliminated in the United States by the use of DDT in the National Malaria Eradication Program (1947–52). The concept of eradication prevailed in 1955 in the Eighth World Health Assembly: DDT was adopted as a primary tool in the fight against malaria.
In 1953, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an antimalarial program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However these projects encountered difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.James L. A.  Webb, "The First Large-Scale Use of Synthetic Insecticide for Malaria Control in Tropical Africa: Lessons from Liberia, 1945–1962". Journal of the History of Medicine & Allied Sciences (2011) 66#3 pp 347-376
DDT was banned in the US in 1972, after the discussion opened in 1962 by Silent Spring, written by American biologist Rachel Carson, which launched the environmental movement in the West. The book catalogued the environmental impacts of indiscriminate DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife. The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT spraying as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for indoor residual spraying in Africa: how can it be used for malaria control? | journal = Am.

====Pyrethrum====

Other insecticides are available for mosquito control in addition to measures such as draining of wetland breeding grounds and provision of better sanitation. Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum Tanacetum  cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting.[tpl]cite journal | author = Duchon S, Bonnet J, Marcombe S, Zaim M, Corbel V | title = Pyrethrum: a mixture of natural pyrethrins has potential for malaria vector control | journal = Journal of Medical Entomology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 516–22 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19496422 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/033.046.0316 | doi = 10.1603/033.046.0316 [/tpl] The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 BCE. Pyrethrins are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming and are either dried and powdered or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.

===Research===

====Avian, mouse and monkey models====

Until the 1950s screening of anti-malarial drugs was carried out on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of Plasmodium berghei in wild rodents in the Congo[tpl]cite journal |author= Vincke IH, Lips M|title= Un nouveau plasmodium d'un rongeur sauvage du Congo: Plasmodium berghei n.sp |journal= Annales de la Société belge de médecine tropicale |volume= 28 |pages= 97–104|year=1948[/tpl] and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain. Plasmodium cynomolgi in Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used in the 1960s to test drugs active against P. vivax. 
Growth of the liver stages in animal-free systems was achieved in the 1980s when pre-erythrocytic P. berghei stages were grown in wI38, a human embryonic lung cell line (cells cultured from one specimen).[tpl]cite journal |title=The Influence of Cell Type and Culture Medium on the In vitro Cultivation of Exoerythrocytic Stages of Plasmodium berghei |first1=Michael R. |last1=Hollingdale |first2=Pamela |last2=Leland |first3=James L. |last3=Leef |first4=Richard L. |last4=Beaudoin |journal=The Journal of Parasitology |volume= 69 |issue= 2 |date=April 1983 |pages= 346–352 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3281232[/tpl] This was followed by their growth in human hepatoma line HepG2.[tpl]cite pmid|2489396[/tpl] Both P. falciparum and P. vivax have been grown in human liver cells; partial development of P. ovale in human liver cells was achieved; and P. malariae was grown in chimpanzee and monkey liver cells.[tpl]cite doi |10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002[/tpl]
The first successful continuous malaria culture was established in 1976 by William Trager and James B. Jensen, which facilitated research into the molecular biology of the parasite and the development of new drugs. By using increasing volumes of culture medium, P.falciparum was grown to higher parasitemia levels (above 10%).[tpl]cite journal | author = Trager W, Jensen JB | title = Human malaria parasites in continuous culture| journal = Science| volume = 193 | issue = 4254 | pages = 673–5 | year = 1976 | pmid = 781840| doi=10.1126/science.781840[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = Schuster FL | title = Cultivation of Plasmodium spp | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev.| volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–64 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12097244 | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/355 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002 | pmc = 118084 [/tpl]

====Diagnostics====

The use of antigen-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) emerged in the 1980s.[tpl]cite journal | author=Ling IT, Cooksley S, Bates PA, Hempelmann E, Wilson RJM | title=Antibodies to the glutamate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum| journal=Parasitology | year=1986 | volume=92 | pages=313–24 | pmid=3086819 | doi=10.1017/S0031182000064088 | issue=2 [/tpl] In the twenty-first century Giemsa microscopy and RDTs became the two preferred diagnostic techniques. Malaria RDTs do not require special equipment and offer the potential to extend accurate malaria diagnosis to areas lacking microscopy services.[tpl]cite journal | author=Makler MT, Piper RC| title=Rapid malaria tests: where do we go after 20 years?| journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg| year=2009| volume=81 | pages=921–6 | pmid=19996417|url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/6/921 | doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2009.09-0202 | issue=6 [/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author=Bisoffi Z, Gobbi F, Angheben A, Van den Ende J| title=The Role of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Managing Malaria| journal=PLOS Medicine| year=2009| volume=6 | pages=e1000063 | pmid=19399160|url =http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | issue=4 | pmc=2667642[/tpl]

===A zoonotic malarial parasite===

Plasmodium knowlesi has been known since the 1930s in Asian macaque monkeys and as experimentally capable of infecting humans. In 1965 a natural human infection was reported in a U.S. soldier returning from the Pahang Jungle of the Malaysian peninsula.[tpl]cite journal|author =Antinori S, Galimberti L, Milazzo L, Corbellino M  | title=Plasmodium knowlesi: The emerging zoonotic malaria parasite |journal=Acta Tropica|year=2013|issue=125|pages=191–201|url = http://www.malarianexus.com/_common/updateable/files/articles/634941176681754741.pdf[/tpl]
