Lee's earlier films, such as The Wedding Banquet, Pushing Hands, and Eat Drink Man Woman  explored the relationships and conflicts between tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western. Lee also deals with the repressed, hidden emotions in many of his films, including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hulk; and Brokeback Mountain. Lee's insight into the human heart has allowed his films to transcend cultural and linguistic barriers to speak to audiences all over the world.[tpl]cite news|title=Life of Pi - film that transcends global emotions|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-27/news-interviews/34103258_1_suraj-sharma-ang-lee-film-makers|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=indiatimes.com|date=September 27, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Speaking a Universal Language: Director Ang Lee|url=http://www.gotoread.com/mag/11900/sarticle_26802.html|publisher=gotoread.com|accessdate=February 18, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Ang Lee and His Thoughts|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/headlines/2005/12/ang-lee-and-his-thoughts/|accessdate=December 28, 2005|newspaper=asian-nation.org|date=December 28, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Phippen|first=Richard|title=Ang Lee's Hulk - FOR (& Against)|url=http://skymovies.sky.com/ang-lees-hulk-for-against|accessdate=November 18, 2008|newspaper=sky.com|date=November 18, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=The Western look Ang Lee: everywhere, nor sets traces|url=http://www.best-news.us/news-4064800-The-Western-look-Ang-Lee:-everywhere-nor-sets-traces.html|accessdate=March 12, 2013|newspaper=best-news.us|date=March 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Kevin Kline, Ang Lee, and Sigourney Weaver on "The Ice Storm"|url=http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/interview.cfm?File=ang-lee|accessdate=4 June 2010|newspaper=filmscouts.com|date=4 June 2010[/tpl]

==Early life==

===Childhood and education===

Ang Lee was born in the town of Chaochou in Pingtung,Ho Yi. Family and friends praise Ang Lee's quiet dedication. Taipei Times. March 7, 2006. a southern agricultural county in Taiwan. He grew up in a household that put heavy emphasis on education and the Chinese classics. Both of Lee's parents moved to Taiwan from China following the Chinese Nationalists' defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Lee's father imbued his children with studying Chinese culture and art, especially calligraphy.
Lee studied in the Provincial Tainan First Senior High School (now National Tainan First Senior High School) where his father was the principal. He was expected to pass the annual Joint College/University Entrance Examination, the only route to a university education in Taiwan. But after failing the exam twice, to the disappointment of his father, he entered a three-year college, the National Arts School (now reorganized and expanded as National Taiwan University of Arts), and graduated in 1975. His father had wanted him to become a professor, but he had become interested in drama and the arts at college. This early frustration set his career on the path of performance art. Seeing Ingmar Bergman's film The Virgin Spring (1960) was a formative experience for him.Interview from Studio 360
After finishing Republic of China Armed Forces's mandatory military service, Lee went to the US in 1979 to study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he completed his bachelor's degree in theater in 1980. There, Lee met his future wife Jane Lin ([tpl]zh|c=林惠嘉|p=Lín Huìjiā[/tpl]), also a Taiwanese student, who pursued her Ph.D. degree at UIUC. Thereupon, he enrolled at the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University, where he received his MFA in film production. He was a classmate of Spike Lee and worked on the crew of his thesis film, Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads.
During graduate school, Lee finished a 16mm short film, Shades of the Lake (1982), which won the Best Drama Award in Short Film in Taiwan. His own thesis work, a 43-minute drama, Fine Line (1984), won NYU's Wasserman Award for Outstanding Direction and was later selected for the Public Broadcasting Service.

===Life after graduation===

Lee's NYU thesis drew attention from the William Morris Agency, the famous talent and literary agency that later represented Lee. At first, though, WMA found Lee few opportunities, and Lee remained unemployed for six years. During this time, he was a full-time house-husband, while his wife Jane Lin, a molecular biologist, was the sole breadwinner for the family of four. This arrangement put enormous pressure on the couple, but with Lin's support and understanding, Lee did not abandon his career in film but continued to generate new ideas from movies and performances. He also wrote several screenplays during this time.[tpl]cite web|title=Ang Lee: A Never-Ending Dream|url=http://whatshihsaid.com/2013/02/26/ang-lee-a-never-ending-dream/|publisher=gotoread.com|accessdate=January 18, 2014[/tpl]
In 1990, Lee submitted two screenplays, Pushing Hands and The Wedding Banquet, to a competition sponsored by Taiwan's Government Information Office, and they came in first and second, respectively. The winning screenplays brought Lee to the attention of Li-Kong Hsu ([tpl]zh|c=徐立功|p=Xú Lìgōng[/tpl]), a recently promoted senior manager in a major studio who had a strong interest in Lee's unique style and freshness. Hsu, a first-time producer, invited Lee to direct Pushing Hands, a full-length feature that debuted in 1991.

==Career==

===Debut from Taiwan===

The 'Father Knows Best' trilogy
Pushing Hands (1992) was a success in Taiwan both among critics and at the box office. It received eight nominations in the Golden Horse Film Festival, Taiwan's premier film festival. Inspired by the success, Li-Kong Hsu collaborated with Lee in their second film, The Wedding Banquet (1993), which won the Golden Bear at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1993/03_preistr_ger_1993/03_Preistraeger_1993.html |title=Berlinale: 1993 Prize Winners |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl] and was nominated as the Best Foreign Language Film in both the Golden Globe and the Academy Awards. In all, this film collected eleven Taiwanese and international awards and made Lee a rising star. These first two movies were based on stories of Chinese Americans, and both were filmed in the US.
In 1995,  Hsu invited Lee to return to Taiwan to make Eat Drink Man Woman, a film that depicts traditional values, modern relationships, and family conflicts in Taipei. The film was a box office hit and was critically acclaimed. For a second consecutive year, Lee's film received the Best Foreign Language Film nomination in both the Golden Globe and Academy Awards, as well as in the British Academy Award. Eat Drink Man Woman won five awards in Taiwan and internationally, including the Best Director from Independent Spirit.
The three films show the Confucian family at risk and star the Taiwanese actor Sihung Lung to form what has been called Lee's "Father Knows Best" trilogy.Wei Ming Dariotis, Eileen Fung, "Breaking the Soy Sauce Jar: Diaspora and Displacement in the Films of Ang Lee," in Hsiao-peng Lu, ed., Transnational Chinese Cinemas: Identity, Nationhood, Gender (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1997), p. 242.

===Arrival in Hollywood===

====Sense and Sensibility====

Lee's three acclaimed first dramas opened the door to Hollywood for him. In 1995, Lee directed Columbia TriStar's British classic Sense and Sensibility. The switch from Taiwanese to British films did not prevent Lee's work from garnering awards: Sense and Sensibility made Lee a second-time winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and won Best Adapted Screenplay for screenwriter Emma Thompson, who also starred in the movie alongside Hugh Grant and Kate Winslet. Sense and Sensibility also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama.
After this, Lee directed two more Hollywood movies: The Ice Storm (1997), a drama set in 1970s suburban America, and Ride with the Devil, an American Civil War drama (1999). Although the critics still highly praised these latter two films, their box office was not impressive, and for a time this interrupted Lee's unbroken popularity – from both general audiences and arthouse aficionados – since his first full-length movie. However, in the late 1990s and 2000s, The Ice Storm has had high VHS and DVD sales and rentals and repeated screenings on cable television, which has increased the film's popularity among audiences.

===1999 onward===

====Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon====

In 1999, Li-Kong Hsu, Lee's old partner and supporter, invited him to make a movie based on the traditional Chinese “wuxia” (martial arts and chivalry) genre. Excited about the opportunity to fulfill his childhood dream, Lee assembled a team from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Mainland China for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). The film was a surprising success worldwide. With Chinese dialogue and English subtitles, the film became the highest grossing foreign film in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, and was nominated in 10 categories at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, and Best Director. It ended up winning Best Foreign Language Film and three technical awards. The success of Crouching Tiger demonstrated that Lee's artistry had a general appeal; it also inspired such established directors as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige to explore wuxia films for Western audiences.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

====Hulk====

In 2003, Lee returned to Hollywood to direct Hulk, his second big-budget movie after the disappointment of Ride with the Devil's restricted release. The film received mixed reviews and became a moderate success, grossing over $245 million at the box office. After the setback, Lee considered retiring early, but his father encouraged him to continue making movies.

====Brokeback Mountain====

Lee decided to take on a small-budget, low-profile independent film based on Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-finalist short story, Brokeback Mountain. In a 2005 article [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=BlevintronBot[/tpl] by Robert K. Elder, Lee was quoted as saying, "What do I know about gay ranch hands in Wyoming?" In spite of the director's removal from the subject at hand, Brokeback Mountain showcased Lee's skills in probing the depths of the human heart. The 2005 movie about the forbidden love between two Wyoming sheepherders immediately caught public attention and became a cultural phenomenon, initiating intense debates and becoming a box office hit.
The film was critically acclaimed at major international film festivals and won Lee numerous Best Director and Best Picture awards worldwide. Brokeback Mountain was the most acclaimed film of 2005, winning 71 awards and an additional 52 nominations. It won the Golden Lion (best film) award at the Venice International Film Festival and was named 2005's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London film critics. It also won best picture at the 2005 Broadcast Film Critics Association, Directors Guild of America, Writers Guild of America (Adapted Screenplay), Producers Guild of America and the Independent Spirit Awards as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, with Lee winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Brokeback also won Best Film and Best Director at the 2006 British Academy Awards (BAFTA). Brokeback Mountain was nominated for a leading eight Oscars and was the front runner for Best Picture heading into the March 5 ceremony, but lost out to Crash, a story about race relations in Los Angeles, in a controversial upset. He became the first person of Asian heritage and the first non-white person to ever win the Best Director at the Academy Awards. In 2006, following his Best Director Oscar, Ang Lee was bestowed the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, the second highest civilian honour, by the Taiwanese government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aIPL&ID=201302270035|title=Presidential Office mulling honor for Ang Lee|publisher=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=February 23, 2013[/tpl]

====Lust, Caution====

After Brokeback Mountain, Lee returned to a Chinese topic. His next film was Lust, Caution, which was adapted from a short novel by the Chinese author Eileen Chang. The story was written in 1950, and was loosely based on an actual event that took place in 1939–1940 in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, China, during World War II. Similar to Brokeback Mountain, Ang Lee adapted and expanded a short, simple story into a feature film in a way that allows individual figures to develop sophisticated layers of reserved emotions, without being sidetracked by complicated plots or overstuffed material.
Lust, Caution was distributed by Focus Features and premiered at international film festivals in the summer and early fall of 2007. In the US, the movie received a NC-17 rating (no one 17 and under admitted) from the MPAA mainly due to several strongly explicit sex scenes. This was a challenge to the film's distribution because many theater chains in the United States refuse to show NC-17 films. The director and film studio have decided not to appeal the decision. Lee removed 9 minutes from the film to make the content suitable for minor audiences in order to be permitted to show Lust, Caution in mainland China.[tpl]cite news|title=Ang Lee bows to China and self-censors award-winning film|date=September 11, 2007|publisher=Yahoo! News|author=AFP|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20070911/ten-entertainment-venice-film-china-taiw-1dc2b55.html[/tpl]
Lust, Caution captured the Golden Lion from the 2007 Biennale Venice Film Festival, making Lee the winner of the highest prize for the second time in three years (Lee is one of only four filmmakers to have ever won the Golden Lion twice). When Lust, Caution was played in Lee's native Taiwan in its original full-length edition, it was very well received.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Staying in Taiwan to promote the film and to participate in a traditional Chinese holiday, Lee got emotional[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] when he found that his work was widely applauded by fellow Taiwanese. Lee admitted that he had low expectations for this film from the US audience since "its pace, its film language – it's all very Chinese."[tpl]cite news|title=Ang Lee: Don't expect much from 'Lust, Caution'|date=September 23, 2007|work=USA Today|author=Min Lee, Associated Press|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2007-09-23-anglee_N.htm[/tpl] Indeed, the film was ignored by the Oscars, receiving zero nominations, despite the generally positive critical reception and the fact most of Ang Lee's past films had received multiple Academy Award nominations. It was snubbed even from consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category; after being officially submitted by Taiwan, the Academy ruled that an insufficient number of Taiwanese nationals had participated in the production, thus disqualifying it from further consideration.
Lee was chosen as president of the jury for the 2009 edition of the Venice Film Festival that took place from September 2 to 12, 2009.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News  |date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=February 27, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7915196.stm|title=Ang Lee to head Venice festival| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090227235246/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7915196.stm| archivedate= February 27, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

====Life of Pi====

Lee's next film after 2009's Taking Woodstock was Life of Pi, which was adapted from the novel of the same name written by Yann Martel.
The story was a retrospective first-person narrative from Pi, a then 16-year-old boy from India, who is the only human to survive the sinking of a freighter on the way from India to Canada. He finds himself on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, a wounded zebra and a Bengal tiger.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=52960 | title=Life of Pi | publisher=ComingSoon.net | accessdate=June 2, 2011 [/tpl] During this unlikely journey, young Pi questions and reassures his belief in God and the meaning of life. The novel was once considered impossible to make into a movie, but Lee persuaded 20th Century Fox to invest $120 million and heavily relied on 3D special effects in post-production. Unlike most other sci-fi precedents, Lee explores the artistic horizon of applying 3D effects and pushes the boundary of how this technology can serve the movie's artistic vision. The movie made its commercial premiere during the Thanksgiving weekend of 2012 in the US and worldwide and became a highly critical and box office success. In January 2013, Life of Pi earned 11 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Visual Effects; only one fewer than Steven Spielberg's Lincoln.[tpl]cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201301070018|title=Life of pi succession[/tpl] He went on to win the Academy Award for Best Director.
In 2013 he was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[tpl]cite news | url=http://variety.com/2013/film/news/nicole-kidman-christopher-waltz-ang-lee-among-cannes-jury-members-1200410650/ | title=Nicole Kidman, Christopher Waltz, Ang Lee Among Cannes Jury Members | work=Variety | publisher=Reed Business Information | date=23 April 2013 | accessdate=23 April 2013 | last=Saperstein | first=Pat[/tpl]
