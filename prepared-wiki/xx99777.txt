Bromo-DragonFLY (or 3C-Bromo-Dragonfly, DOB-Dragonflyhttps://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly.shtml)  is a psychedelic drug related to the phenethylamine family. Bromo-DragonFLY is considered an extremely potent hallucinogen, only slightly less potent than LSD with a normal dose in the region of 200 μg to 800 μg, and it has an extremely long duration of action up to several days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_dose.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-DragonFly Vault : Dosage |accessdate= |work=[/tpl]  Bromo-DragonFLY has a stereocenter and R-(-)-bromo-DragonFLY is the more active stereoisomer.

==History==

Bromo-DragonFLY was first synthesized by Matthew Parker in the laboratory of David E. Nichols in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent dihydrofuran series of compounds nicknamed FLY, Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.

==Pharmacology==

The hallucinogenic effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its agonist activity at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT2B and  5-HT2C serotonin receptors, and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT2 agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT2C receptors as for 5-HT2A, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT2A over 5-HT2B.[tpl]cite journal |author=Parker MA, Marona-Lewicka D, Lucaites VL, Nelson DL, Nichols DE |title=A novel (benzodifuranyl)aminoalkane with extremely potent activity at the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=41 |issue=26 |pages=5148–9 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9857084 |doi=10.1021/jm9803525 |url=[/tpl]Corazza O, Schifano F, Farre M, Deluca P, Davey Z, Torrens M, Demetrovics Z, Di Furia L, Flesland L, Siemann H, Skutle A, Van Der Kreeft P, Scherbaum N.

==Dosage==

The typical dose of Bromo-DragonFLY is not known, however it has varied from 500 μg to 1 mg. It has about 300 times the potency of mescaline, or 1/5 the potency of LSD. It has been sold in the form of blotters, similar to the distribution method of LSD, which has led to confusion, and reports of mistakenly consuming Bromo-DragonFly. It has a much longer duration of action than LSD and can last for up to 2–3 days following a single large dose, with a slow onset of action that can take up to 6 hours before the effects are felt.

==Toxicity==

The toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans when taken in doses above the therapeutic range, with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY reported in Norway,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_death2.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Reported GHB-Related Death Involved Bromo-Dragonfly |accessdate= |work=[/tpl] Sweden,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_death1.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Information about a death reportedly related to Bromo-Dragonfly |accessdate= |work=[/tpl]

Finland
and the United States.
Laboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-Dragonfly was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound 2C-B-FLY, which is around 20x less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb_fly/2cb_fly_death1.shtml |title=Erowid 2C-B-Fly Vault: Death Report |accessdate= |work=[/tpl]
Vasoconstrictive action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case.  In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred.  Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.Bromo-dragonfly – livsfarlig missbruksdrog (Swedish)Thorlacius K, Borna C, Personne M.

Overdoses, disturbing experiences, and Bromo-DragonFLY associated health problems have been described. One case in 2008 in England involved inhalation of vomit, causing nearly fatal asphyxia.[tpl]cite web|last=George |first=Sallie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/surrey/7315020.stm |title=England | Surrey | 'I nearly died from taking £5 hit' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl] Seizures have also been reported.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wood DM, Looker JJ, Shaikh L, Button J, Puchnarewicz M, Davies S, Lidder S, Ramsey J, Holt DW, Dargan PI |title=Delayed onset of seizures and toxicity associated with recreational use of Bromo-dragonFLY |journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=226–9 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19876858 |doi= |url=[/tpl]
On October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-dragonfly. His friend described the trip saying, "It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil thing I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity" [tpl]cite web|url=http://jp.dk/indland/kbh/article1884968.ece |title=| Danish man died after trip on Chinese drug |publisher=Jp.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl]
On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations. Several surviving victims are reportedly still suffering from its physical effects.http://www.newson6.com/story/14641463/second-victim-dies-after-taking-designer-drug-in-konawa
