==History==

The Australian National University (ANU) Library has its foundations in the appointment of the first University Librarian, Arthur Leopold Gladstone McDonald (1898-1981) in early 1948http://www.payer.de/hbiweltweit/weltw309.html. The importance of the establishment of the ANU Library in the development of the University was such that McDonald was appointed by the Interim Council before any of the professorshttp://www.payer.de/hbiweltweit/weltw309.html.
Initially McDonald and several assistants were housed in Ormond College at the University of Melbournehttp://www.payer.de/hbiweltweit/weltw309.html, where they began to form the collection. At the end of 1950 the collection, which had grown to approximately 40, 000 volumes, was transferred to Canberra, to be located in the Canberra Community Hospital and nearby hutshttp://www.payer.de/hbiweltweit/weltw309.html. Over the course of the 1950s the collection grew steadily, and  by the time of McDonalds retirement 1960 the collection had grown to 150, 000 volumes (excluding pamphlets) http://www.payer.de/hbiweltweit/weltw309.html.

==ANU Archives==

The ANU Archiveshttp://archives.anu.edu.au/home preserves the university's own archives and collects archives of business, trade unions, professional associations and industry bodies, to support research by the University community and the general public. 
It collects in two areas, the University Archives and the Noel Butlin Archives Centre.

===University Archives===

The University Archiveshttp://archives.anu.edu.au/anu-archives hold a range of material dating from the late 1920s relating to the history of The Australian National University. This material is available under a 30-year rule (progressing to a 20-year rule by 2021) which means that records up to the mid-1980s can be generally used for research. The collection includes minutes of the ANU Council and other University committees, correspondence files, photographs, plans, and publications such as annual reports and the ANU Reporter. The papers of academic and senior staff of the University and University organisations are also part of the University Archives. The acquisition of material is governed by a collecting policy.

===Noel Butlin Archives Centre===

The Noel Butlin Archives Centre (NBAC) http://archives.anu.edu.au/collections collects business and labour records from Australian companies, trade unions, industry bodies and professional organisations. We are a national organisation interested in material from all states and territories. The NBAC holds the records of large companies such as the Australian Agricultural Company, Burns Philip, CSR Ltd, Dalgety's,Tooth and Company and the Adelaide Steamship Company as well as those of smaller businesses such as pastoral stations. We hold records of federally registered trade unions and their predecessors, and of peak councils such as the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the National Farmers Federation. The records date from the 1820s to the early 21st century and include files, photographs, minutes of meetings, some staff and membership records, maps and plans, and publications such as trade journals and union newsletters. Some material may be closed because it is very recent or  the owners' permission may be required before it can be used.
The collection supports research on topics such as industrial relations, immigration, working women, indigenous employment, architecture, economic history, family history, social history in Australia and the Pacific, and on particular industries such as agriculture, timber, shipping, mining, brewing, advertising and finance. In addition, the Archives contain the National AIDS Archive Collection, which documents the history of HIV/AIDS education and prevention throughout Australia.
The Noel Butlin Archives collection is divided into the following categories:
Companies, 
Organisations including trade unions and professional associations, 
Personal Papers, 
National AIDS Archive Collection, 
Maps, 
Photographs.
The acquisition of material is governed by a collecting policy.
