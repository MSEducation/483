Crack dot Com was a computer game development company. The company was co-founded by ex-id Software programmer Dave Taylor, and Jonathan Clark. 
The first game the company made was Abuse, a side-scrolling shoot 'em up game which sold over 80,000 copies worldwide.  Abuse was ported to a wide variety of platforms including DOS, Win32, MacÂ OS, AIX, SGI Irix, Amiga, and Linux.
Prior to the company's closing in October 1998, they were working on Golgotha, a hybrid of first-person shooter and real-time strategy.  Crack dot com made the source and data for both Golgotha and Abuse public domain.
