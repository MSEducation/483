==Concept and design==

The Riverside Museum building was designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and engineers Buro Happold.Museum of Transport Glasgow, Glasgow Transport Museum, Zaha Hadid The internal exhibitions and displays were designed by Event Communications. Replacing facilities at the city's Kelvin Hall, the new purpose-built museum is the first to be opened in the city since the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art in 1993 and is expected to attract up to 1 million visitors a year. Although containing approximately the same floorspace as the previous museum facility at 7,500 sq m, it creates a more environmentally stable home for Glasgow's significant Transport Technology collections. The building also houses a workshop and office space for the Clyde Maritime Trust.[tpl]cn|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The location of the museum is on the site of the former A. & J. Inglis Shipyard within Glasgow Harbour, on the north bank of the River Clyde and adjacent to its confluence point with the River Kelvin. This site enables the Clyde Maritime Trust's SV Glenlee and other visiting craft to berth alongside the museum.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://www.clydeport.co.uk/index.php?site_id=3&page_id=558|title=Riverside Museum|publisher=Clyde Port|accessdate=2008-04-30[/tpl]

By late September 2008, the steel framework of the structure was taking shape. During 2010 the cladding of the building was put in place and internal fitting-out work continued along with external landscaping works. The building was structurally completed by late autumn 2010 and work continued to prepare the Riverside Museum for its opening on 21 June 2011.

As well as housing many of the existing collections of the Glasgow Museum of Transport, the city has acquired additional items to enhance the experience:

==Reception==

Since opening the Riverside Museum has received generally positive reviews. However its layout continues to be regularly criticised by visitors; the chief complaint being that a significant portion of the cars on display are positioned on shelves mounted at great height. Visitor reviews indicate that this has been disappointing for car enthusiasts and also for Glaswegians with fond memories of visiting the Transport Museum at its previous location, which displayed the exhibits at ground level allowing visitors to see the cars up close and look inside them.http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186534-d214166-Reviews-The_Riverside_Museum_of_Transport_and_Travel-Glasgow_Scotland.html
