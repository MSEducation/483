The name "Bobby's Bus Shelter" honours Bobby Macaulay, a child who used to cycle to the shelter in the mornings to catch the bus to school. The local council had plans to remove the bus shelter, but after he sent them a letter asking them not to and explaining that the shelter is where he kept his bike while at school, the council left it there and furnished it. Every year, the shelter is redecorated in accordance with what is going on in Bobby's life. In 2009 the shelter was decorated in pink to represent the fact that Bobby was working for a Breast Cancer charity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
