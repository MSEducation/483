Karl Gottlob (Carolus Timotheus) Zumpt (1 April 1792 – 25 June 1849) was a German philologist from Berlin. Educated at Heidelberg and Berlin, he was from 1812 to 1827 a schoolmaster in Berlin, and in 1827 became professor of Latin literature at the University of Berlin.
His chief work was his Latin Grammar (Lateinische Grammatik, 1818), which stood as a standard work until superseded by Madvig's in 1844. He edited Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria (1831), Cicero's Verrines and De officiis (1837), and Curtius. Otherwise he devoted himself mainly to Roman history, publishing Annales veterum regnorum et populorum (3rd ed. 1862), a work in chronology down to 476 AD, and other antiquarian studies.
He was the uncle of August Wilhelm Zumpt.
