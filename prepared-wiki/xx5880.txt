Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations based on various readings and measurements made by the Great Trigonometric Survey of India in 1849 came to the conclusion that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, was the highest. Allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga is the third-highest mountain.[tpl]cite book | title = Everest: The Best Writing and Pictures from Seventy Years of Human Endeavour | author= Gillman, P. | year = 1993 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company |location= Boston| isbn = 0316904899 | page = 208[/tpl]
Kangchenjunga was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of a British expedition. They stopped short of the summit as per the promise given to the Maharaja of Sikkim that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate. Every climber or climbing group that has reached the summit has followed this tradition. Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinon.[tpl]cite web |author=Perrin, J. |url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/01/guardianobituaries.sport |year=2005 |title= Obituary: John Jackson.

==Names==

Kangchenjunga is the official spelling adopted by Douglas Freshfield, A. M. Kellas, and the Royal Geographical Society that gives the best indication of the Tibetan pronunciation.
The brothers Hermann, Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit explained the local name Kanchinjínga ([tpl]bo|t=གངས་ཆེན་མཛོད་ལྔ་|w=gangs chen mdzod lnga|z=Kangqênzön'nga[/tpl], Sikkimese IPA: [tpl]IPA|k̀ʱɐŋt͡ɕʰẽd͡zø̃ŋɐ[/tpl]) meaning “The five treasures of the high snow” as originating from the Tibetan word (following IPA given in Sikkimese Tibetan) "gangs" [tpl]IPA|/k̀ʱɐŋ/[/tpl] (English approx. /kaŋ/) meaning snow, ice; "chen" [tpl]IPA|/t͡ɕʰẽ/[/tpl] (English approx. ʧen) meaning great; "mdzod" [tpl]IPA|/d͡zø/[/tpl] meaning treasure; "lnga" [tpl]IPA|/̃ŋɐ/[/tpl] meaning five.[tpl]cite book |authors=De Schlagintweit, H., de Schlagintweit, A., de Schlagintweit, R. |year=1863 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jOE-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA207&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=IV.

Volume III. |publisher= Brockhaus, Leipzig and Trübner & Co., London.[/tpl] The treasures represent the five repositories of God, which are gold, silver, gems, grain, and holy books.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
There are a number of alternative spellings which include Kangchen Dzö-nga, Khangchendzonga, Kanchenjanga, Kachendzonga, Kanchenjunga or Kangchanfanga. The final word on the use of the name Kangchenjunga came from His Highness Sir Tashi Namgyal, the Maharaja or chogyal of Sikkim, who stated that "although junga had no meaning in Tibetan, it really ought to have been Zod-nga (treasure, five) Kang-chen (snow, big) to convey the meaning correctly". Following consultations with a Lieutenant-Colonel J.L.R. Weir, British agent to Sikkim, he agreed that it was best to leave it as Kangchenjunga, and thus the name remained so by acceptance and common usage.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Kangchenjunga's name in Nepali is कञ्चनजङ्घा Kanchanjaŋghā. Its name in the Limbu language and the Khambu Rai language is Sewalungma, meaning "mountain to which we offer greetings". Sewalungma is considered sacred by adherents of the Kirant religion.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

==Protected areas==

The Kangchenjunga landscape is a complex of three distinct ecoregions: the eastern Himalayan broad-leaved and coniferous forests, the eastern Himalayan alpine meadows and the Terai-Duar savannas and grasslands.[tpl]cite book |author=Wikramanayake, E. D. (ed.)|year= 2001 |title= Ecoregion-based Conservation in the Eastern Himalaya: Identifying Important Areas for Biodiversity Conservation |publisher= World Wildlife Fund and International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |location=Kathmandu |isbn= 9993394009[/tpl]
The Kangchenjunga transboundary landscape is shared by Bhutan, China, India and Nepal, and comprises 14 protected areas with a total of [tpl]convert|6032|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]:Chettri, N., Bajracharya, B., Thapa, R. (2008). Feasibility Assessment for Developing Conservation Corridors in the Kangchenjunga Landscape. Pages 21–30 in: Chettri, N., Shakya, B., Sharma, E. (eds.) Biodiversity Conservation in the Kangchenjunga Landscape. International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Kathmandu.
These protected areas are habitats for many globally significant plant species such as rhododendrons and orchids and many endangered flagship species such as snow leopard, Asiatic black bear, red panda, Himalayan musk deer, blood pheasant and chestnut-breasted partridge.

==Geography==

The Kangchenjunga Himal section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and Sikkim, and encompasses 16 peaks over [tpl]convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur. Kanchenjunga rises about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about [tpl]convert|125|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east-south-east of Mount Everest as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the [tpl]convert|3000|-|3500|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and north Bengal.
Kangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif.Smythe, F. S. (1930). The Kangchenjunga adventure. Victor Gollancz Ltd., London The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the following table.
Four glaciers radiate from the peak, pointing roughly to the north-east, south-east, north-west and south-west. The Zemu glacier in the north-east and the Talung glacier in the south-east drain to the Teesta River. The Yalung glacier in the south-west and the Kangchen glacier in the north-west drain to the Arun and Kosi rivers.Freshfield, D. W. (1902). The Glaciers of Kangchenjunga. The Geographical Journal 19: 453–475.
The glaciers spread over the area above approximately [tpl]convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and the glacialized area covers [tpl]convert|314|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in total.Asahi, K. (1999). Data on inventoried glaciers and its distribution in eastern part of Nepal Himalaya. Data Report 2, Basic studies for assessing the impacts of the global warming on the Himalayan cryosphere, 1994–1998. Institute for Hydrospheric-Atomospheric Sciences, Nagoya University and Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, HMG/Nepal.
The main ridge of the massif runs from north-north-east to south-south-west and forms a watershed to several rivers. Together with ridges running roughly from east to west they form a giant cross. These ridges contain a host of peaks between [tpl]convert|6000|and|8000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. On the east ridge is Siniolchu ([tpl]convert|6888|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]). The west ridge culminates in the Jannu ([tpl]convert|7710|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]) with its imposing north face. To the south are Kabru North ([tpl]convert|7338|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]), Kabru South ([tpl]convert|7316|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Rathong ([tpl]convert|6678|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]). The north ridge, after passing through the Kangchenjunga North ([tpl]convert|7741|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]), includes the Twins and Tent Peak, and runs up to the Tibetan border by the Jongsang La, a [tpl]convert|6120|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high pass.

==Climbing history==

===Early reconnaissances and attempts===

===First ascent===

In 1955, Joe Brown and George Band made the first ascent on 25 May, followed by Norman Hardie and Tony Streather on 26 May. The full team also included John Clegg (team doctor), Charles Evans (team leader), John Angelo Jackson, Neil Mather, and Tom Mackinnon.
The ascent proved that Aleister Crowley's 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft|-3[/tpl] high. The main feature of this face is the "Great Shelf", a large sloping plateau at around [tpl]convert|7500|m|ft|-2[/tpl], covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier, and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.[tpl]cite journal| author1 = Evans, C.| author2 = Band, G.| title = Kangchenjunga Climbed| journal = The Geographical Journal | year = 1956 | volume = 122 | number = 1 | pages = 1–12[/tpl]

===Other notable ascents===

Despite improved climbing gear the fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit Kanchenjunga is high. Since the 1990s, more than 20% of people died while climbing Kanchenjunga's main peak.[tpl]cite web |author=Hansen, L. |year=2012 |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/30757/5-mountains-deadlier-everest |title=5 Mountains Deadlier Than Everest[/tpl]

==Tourism==

Some of the most famous views of Kangchenjunga are from the hill station of Darjeeling. The Darjeeling War Memorial is among the most visited places from which Kangchenjunga is observed. On a clear day it presents an image not so much of a mountain but of a white wall hanging from the sky. The people of Sikkim revere Kangchenjunga as a sacred mountain. Permission to climb the mountain from the Indian side is rarely given.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Due to its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier.

==In myth==

The area around Kangchenjunga is said to be home to the "Kangchenjunga Demon", a type of yeti or rakshasa. A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the "Kangchenjunga Demon".
For generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Mount Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962 a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
