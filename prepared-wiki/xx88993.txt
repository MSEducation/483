CATEGORIES: Military satellites, Military equipment, Satellites by type

A military satellite is an artificial satellite used for a military purpose. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation and military communications.The first military satellites were photographic reconnaissance missions. Some attempts were made to develop satellite based weapons but this work was halted in 1967 following the ratification of international treaties banning the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. As of 2013, there are 950 satellites of all types in Earth orbit. It is not possible to identify the exact number of these that are military satellites partly due to secrecy and partly due to dual purpose missions such as GPS satellites that serve both civilian and military purposes.

==Military reconnaissance satellites==

The first military use of satellites was for reconnaissance.
In the United States the first formal military satellite programs, Weapon System 117L, was developed in the mid 1950s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.milsatmagazine.com/story.php?number=1811044549|title=Military Satellite Systems: A History — Part One|date=May 2008|accessdate=2014-01-21|publisher=MilsatMagazine[/tpl] Within this program a number of sub-programs were developed including Corona.  Satellites within the Corona program carried different code names. The first launches were code named Discoverer. This mission was a series of reconnaissance satellite, designed to enter orbit, take high-resolution photographs and then return the payload to Earth via parachute. Discoverer 1, the first mission, was launched on 28 February 1959 although it didn't carry a payload being intended as a test flight to prove the technology.[tpl]cite web|publisher=NASA|title=This Week in NASA History: Discoverer 1|date=23 February 2007|accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl] The Corona program continued until 25 May 1972.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] It was abandoned after a Soviet Navy submarine was detected waiting beneath a mid-air retrieval zone in the Pacific Ocean.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Corona was followed by other programs including Canyon (seven launches between 1968 and 1977Jonathan's space update No. 369 (1998-08-22) Lists U.S. SIGINT launches), Aquacade[tpl]cite book|author=James Bamford|title=The Shadow Factory|year=2008|publisher=Doubleday|page=176[/tpl] and Orion (stated by US Government sources to be extremely large[tpl]cite web | title=National Reconnaissance Office Update| url=http://www.afa.org/events/conference/2010/scripts/AFA-100913-Carlson.pdf | author=Bruce Carlson |publisher = Air & Space Conference and Technology Exposition 2010 | accessdate=2010-11-25 | date=2010-09-13[/tpl]). There have also been a number of subsequent programs including Magnum and Trumpet,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1995/31/Riesige_Lauscher_am_Himmel|title=Riesige Lauscher am Himmel|publisher=Die Zeit|date=28 July 1995[/tpl] but these remain classified and therefore many details remain speculative.
The Soviet Union began the Almaz ([tpl]lang-ru|Алмаз[/tpl]) program in the early 1960s. This program involved placing space stations in Earth orbit as an alternative to satellites. Three stations were launched between 1973 and 1976: Salyut 2, Salyut 3 and Salyut 5. Following Salyut 5, the Soviet Ministry of Defence judged in 1978 that the time consumed by station maintenance outweighed the benefits relative to automatic reconnaissance satellites.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Navigation satellites==

The first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by the United States Navy, was tested in 1960.[tpl]cite web|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|title=Navstar: GPS Satellite Network|url=http://www.space.com/19794-navstar.html|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl]  It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour.
During the Cold War arms race, the nuclear threat was used to justify the cost of providing a more capable system. These developments led eventually to the deployment of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The US Navy required precise navigation to enable  submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010[/tpl] The USAF had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system, as did the United States Army for geodetic surveying http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660002550_1966002550.pdf for which purpose they had developed the SECOR system. SECOR used ground-based transmitters from known locations that sent signals to satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station, at an undetermined position, could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm|title=SECOR Chronology|work=Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=January 19, 2010[/tpl]
In 1978, the first experimental Block-I GPS satellite was launched[tpl]cite journal | url = https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ieee_pilot/articles/96jproc12/jproc-CHegarty-2006090/article.html | title = Evolution of the Global Navigation SatelliteSystem (GNSS) | first1 = Christopher J. | last1 = Hegarty | first2 = Eric | last2 = Chatre | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | date = December 2008 | pages = 1902–1917 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2008.2006090 [/tpl]  and by December 1993, GPS achieved initial operational capability (IOC), indicating a full constellation (24 satellites) was available and providing the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpsinfo.html|title=USNO NAVSTAR Global Positioning System|publisher=U.S. Naval Observatory|accessdate=January 7, 2011[/tpl] Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in April 1995, signifying full availability of the military's secure Precise Positioning Service (PPS).

==Early warning systems==

A number of nations have developed satellite based early warning systems designed to detect ICBMs during different flight phases. In the United States these satellites are operated by the Defense Support Program (DSP). The first launch of a DSP satellite was on 6 November 1970 with the 23rd and last launched 10 November 2007. This program has been superseded by the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS).

==Satellite weapons==

In the United States, research into satellite based weapons was initiated by President Eisenhower in the 1950s. In 1958 the United States initiated Project Defender to develop an anti-ICBM solution launched from satellites. The satellites would have deployed a huge wire mesh to disable ICBMs during their early launch phase. The project foundered due to the lack of any mechanism to protect the satellites from attack resulting in the cancellation of Defender in 1968.[tpl]cite news|title=Star Wars Traced to Eisenhower Era|date=28 October 1986|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/science/star-wars-traced-to-eisenhower-era.html|newspaper=The New York Times|author=William J. Broad|accessdate=2014-02-06[/tpl]
Since October 1967 satellite based weapons systems have been limited by international treaty to conventional weapons only. Art.IV of the Outer Space Treaty specifically prohibits signatories from installing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit. The treaty became effective on 10 October 1967 and, as of May 2013, 102 countries are parties to the treaty with a further 27 pending full ratification.[tpl]cite web  | url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/outer_space  | title = Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies  | accessdate = 2013-04-18 | publisher= United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/scaucasus/azerbaijan/2149769.html|title=Azerbaijan improves legal framework for space cooperation|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=2013-05-18[/tpl]

==Military communication satellites==

The US Armed Forces maintains international networks of satellites with ground stations located in various continents. 
Signal latency is a major concern in satellite communications, so geographic and meteorological factors play an important role in choosing teleports. Since some of the major military activities of the U.S. army is in foreign territories, the U.S. government needs to subcontract satellite services to foreign carriers headquartered in areas with favorable climate.“US Military Satellite Communications Through Australian Teleports“
Military Strategic and Tactical Relay, or Milstar, is a constellation of military satellites managed by the United States Air Force. Six spacecraft were launched between 1994 and 2003, of which five are operational, with the sixth lost in a launch failure. They are deployed in geostationary orbit and provide wideband, narrowband and protected military communication systems. Wideband systems support high-bandwidth transfers. Protected systems offer more sophisticated security protection like antijam features and nuclear survivability, while narrowband systems are intended for basic communications services that do not require high bandwidth.
The United Kingdom also operates military communication satellites through its Skynet system. This is currently operated with support from Astrium Services and provides a near world wide with both X band and Ultra high frequency services.
Skynet 5 is the United Kingdom's most recent military communications satellite system. There are four Skynet satellites in orbit, with the latest launch completed in December 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20781625|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2014-04-11|title=UK's Skynet military satellite launched|author=Jonathan Amos|date=19 December 2012[/tpl] The system is provided by a private contractor, Astrium, with the UK government paying service charges based on bandwidth consumption.
