The animated series follows the antics of an aging Casanova, Dr. Lynch, and the young man he's training in the art of seducing women. The series was created by Catmandu Branded Entertainment, a branded entertainment firm headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina and produced by Encuadre. The characters were developed by Italian illustrator Milo Manara and aired in English.
City Hunters airs on Fox Latin America's adult-skewed block "No Molestar" (Spanish-speaking countries; in Brazil, "NÃ£o Perturbe", both meaning "Do Not Disturb"), which includes Futurama, The Simpsons, Family Guy, and American Dad.
