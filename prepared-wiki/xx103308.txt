Northlake Mall is a major shopping mall northeast of Atlanta in northern DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The mall is owned and managed by Simon Property Group.

==History==

Northlake Mall opened in 1971 with original anchor stores Davison's, JCPenney, and Sears.  Northlake was the fifth mall to open in DeKalb County, following Columbia Mall (later Avondale Mall) in 1964, North DeKalb Mall in 1965, South DeKalb Mall in 1968, and Perimeter Mall in 1971.
The mall was renovated in the early 1990s, and added Parisian as an anchor in the location of the former Piccadilly Cafeteria & Spencers Gifts.  This renovation also included a new food court area, and gave JC Penney a second mall entrance.  After its acquisition by Belk, the Parisian location closed in 2007.  A Kohl's store now occupies the space.
Northlake Mall also briefly held one of the two fully signed Rich's-Macy's stores before reverting to Macy's (which bought Davison's in 1925) in the old Davison's store.
Currently, the mall is anchored by JCPenney, Macy's, Kohl's, and Sears.
