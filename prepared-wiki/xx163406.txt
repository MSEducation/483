He also published studies of Benjamin FranklinFay, Franklin, the Apostle of Modern Times (1929). and George Washington.Fay, George Washington, Republican Aristocrat (1931).

==Life==

At the beginning of the Second World War Fay was a professor at the Collège de France. During the occupation he replaced Julien Cain as general administrator of the Bibliothèque Nationale and director of the anti-Masonic service of the Vichy Government. During his tenure of this office, his secretary Gueydan de Roussel was in charge of preparing the card indexes containing 60,000 names drawn from archives seized from Freemason and other secret societies, which Marshal Philippe Pétain was convinced were at the heart of all France's troubles;Fay also served as an adviser to Pétain. Historia Thématique: "Aux heures sombres de Vichy". lists of names of Freemasons were released to the official gazette of the Vichy government for publication, and many Catholic papers copied these lists in order to induce public opprobrium. Fay edited and published during the four years of the occupation a monthly review  Les Documents maçonniques ("Masonic Documents"), which published historical studies of Freemasonry together with essays on the role of Freemasonry in society and frank anti-Masonic propaganda.Historia Thématique: "Aux heures sombres de Vichy".
During Fay's tenure with the Vichy regime, 989 Freemasons were sent to concentration camps, where 549 were shot. In addition, about 3,000 lost their jobs. All Freemasons were required by law to declare themselves to authorities.Pakalert Press Nov. 13, 2013
In 1943 Fay produced the film Forces Occultes, directed by Jean Mamy, which depicts a worldwide Jewish-Freemason conspiracy.[tpl]cite book|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|title=Women Modernists and Fascism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eDBH3cZzYo0C&pg=PA89|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=89[/tpl]
Despite his anti-Semitism, Faÿ, who was suspected to be a Gestapo agent for much of the occupation, protected Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Following the liberation, Stein wrote a letter on Faÿ's behalf when he was tried as a collaborator.Michael Kimmelman, "The Last Act" (review of Janet Malcolm, "Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice"), New York Review of Books, Vol. LIV No. 16 (Oct. 25, 2007), pp. 4-5. In 1946 a French court condemned him to dégradation nationale and forced labor for life, but he managed to escape to Switzerland in 1951,[tpl]cite book | title = And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris | author = Alan Riding | publisher = Alfred A.

He taught French literature to American junior-year-abroad students in the 1960s at the Villa des Fougères in Fribourg, run by the Dominican sisters of Rosary College (now Dominican University) in River Forest, Illinois. During this time he also taught at a girls high school, Le Grand Verger, in Lutry, Switzerland, a short distance east of Lausanne on the northern border of Lake Geneva (Lac Leman). There he instructed American and other national girls in American History. His method consisted of notecard lectures and knowledge he carried in his head. He particularly shone in his art history class where he taught from illustrated postcards of paintings, drawings and sculptures. In European fashion of the time, he demanded precise and voluminous feedback of his lecture material in tests. (ref on Le Grand Verger entry by former student, Janine Dawn Lieberman, 1962) In 1969, Fay is credited with being one of those who convinced Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, then the retired Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, to start a new seminary in Fribourg for traditional Catholics disquieted by the changes wrought by the Second Vatican Council in the formation of priests.[tpl]cite book | title = The Biography of Marcel Lefebvre | author = Bernard Tissier de Mallerais | publisher = Angelus Press | place = Kansas City | year = 2004 [/tpl]
