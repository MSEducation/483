It is located [tpl]convert|370|m|ft[/tpl] north of Drove Cottage. The site is a ceremonial Neolithic location.[tpl]cite web|title=Mendip Hills|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/research/landscapes-and-areas/protected-landscapes/mendip-hills/|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] Since this henge is one of only around 80 henges throughout England, it is considered to be nationally important.

==Description==

Drove Cottage Henge is situated in a valley. The bank circumscribing the henge is about [tpl]convert|11.5|m|ft[/tpl] thick and [tpl]convert|.4|m|ft[/tpl] high, with a diameter of around [tpl]convert|54|m|ft[/tpl] when measuring from the outsides of the banks. Just inside this bank is a ditch [tpl]convert|6|m|ft[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|.3|m|ft[/tpl] deep, enclosing a circular central area about [tpl]convert|19|m|ft[/tpl] in diameter. In the northern portion of this central area is a low-lying mound in front of the exit, which appears as a break in the outside bank.[tpl]cite web|title=Henge 370m NE of Drove Cottage, Hillgrove Road, Priddy|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=24154|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl]
Jodie Lewis noted in 2005 that "Examples of southerly and north-north-westerly orientations, apropos Stockwood and Hunter's Lodge, are documented at other Class I henge sites, but are not common".Jodie Lewis, Monuments, ritual and regionality: the neolithic of Northern Somerset (Archaeopress, 2005) Harding and Lee in 1987 said of it "HUNTERS LODGE, Priddy ST 559 498: Sub-oval enclosure, surviving as an earthwork, situated at the head of a shallow valley."A. F. Harding, G. E. Lee, Henge monuments and related sites of Great Britain: air photographic evidence and catalogue (1987)
This whole site has become hard to see because repeated ploughing has heavily damaged the archaeological site, including the turf cover.
