Michael Henry "Nicko" McBrain (born 5 June 1952 in Hackney, London) is an English musician, best known as the drummer of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, which he joined in 1982.
Having played in small pub bands from the age of 14, upon leaving school McBrain paid his bills with session work before he joined a variety of artists, such as Streetwalkers, Pat Travers, and the French political band, Trust. He joined Iron Maiden in time to debut on their fourth album, Piece of Mind (1983), and has remained with them since, contributing to a total of twelve studio releases.

==Biography==

McBrain first wanted to learn the drums at a young age after watching Joe Morello performing with The Dave Brubeck Quartet on television.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=235[/tpl] At the age of ten, he started to play drums with pots, pans and other kitchen utensils, before, to his parents' dismay, he began drumming on the gas cooker with a pair of knives and chipped off the paintwork.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=235[/tpl] McBrain recalls that he was eleven or twelve before his father bought him his first drum kit, "which was basically one snare, one tom-tom, one cymbal, two drumsticks and a pair of brushes."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=236[/tpl] He soon started playing Rolling Stones and Beatles covers with school bands, before he began regularly playing "pubs and weddings" by the age of 14.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=236[/tpl]
Although he obtained a degree in engineering at his parent's request,[tpl]cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=Nicko McBrain biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nicko-mcbrain-mn0000207661|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=21 November 2012[/tpl] upon finishing his education, McBrain paid his rent by undertaking session work, before deciding to join his first "proper" band, "The 18th Fairfield Walk", later known as "Peyton Bond".[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=237[/tpl] A small pub band, which he decided was "never gonna go anywhere" as they only performed Otis Redding, The Beatles and The Who covers, McBrain soon left to join "The Wells Street Blues Band", which renamed themselves "The Axe" in 1969.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=237[/tpl] Although this group would play their own material, the band split up after an argument between the singer and the guitarist, and McBrain began playing with Billy Day, a singer and keyboardist, and Michael "Mickey" Lesley, a guitarist, in 1971.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=238[/tpl] At that point, he was known as "Nicky", a nickname given to him by his parents after his teddy bear, Nicholas,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=235[/tpl] until an intoxicated Billy Day introduced him to Dick Asher, head of CBS Records, as "Neeko", while they were recording at CBS Studios, Whitfield Street.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=238[/tpl] McBrain liked the name, changing it to Nicko "so that it sounded more English," and decided to keep it even after leaving the group.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=239[/tpl]
In 1975, he began playing with Streetwalkers,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=239[/tpl] before joining Pat Travers and then the French band, Trust,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=240[/tpl] with whom he met Iron Maiden for the first time, while touring together in 1981.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=234[/tpl] In 1982, the band asked McBrain to replace their previous drummer, Clive Burr,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=240[/tpl] and, as news of Burr's departure had not yet been announced, made his first appearance with Iron Maiden on German TV disguised as Eddie.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=241[/tpl] He formed a close partnership with bassist, Steve Harris,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=241[/tpl] and completed what many critics consider the band's "definitive" lineup,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r9912|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Piece of Mind > Review|last=Prato|first=Greg|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=3 November 2008[/tpl] releasing a series of gold and platinum selling albums throughout the 1980s.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=242[/tpl]
Although the band's lineup changed frequently in the 1990s, McBrain remained in Iron Maiden and, since the return of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson in 1999, the group has undergone a resurgence in popularity,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/h8d3 | title = Iron Maiden: From Fear to Eternity – The Best of 1990-2010 Review | accessdate = 5 October 2011 | date = 23 May 2011 | last = Moffitt | first = Greg | publisher = BBC Online[/tpl] and are now considered by some as "bigger than ever".

Although he writes the drum parts for all the band's songs, McBrain registered his first and only album songwriting credit for "New Frontier," from 2003's Dance of Death,[tpl]cite journal | title = Nicko McBrain | journal = Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | date = 2005 | first = Dave | last = Ling | page = 103| id =[/tpl] which expresses his opposition to human cloning, arising from his religious beliefs.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=374[/tpl] However, McBrain had received two previous songwriting credits for non-album tracks: 1984's "Mission From 'Arry", which was actually a recording of a backstage argument with Steve Harris, and 1992's "Nodding Donkey Blues", which were B-sides of the singles "2 Minutes to Midnight" and "Be Quick or Be Dead" respectively.

==Drumming style==

McBrain's drumming has been an important element of Iron Maiden's sound from 1983's Piece of Mind onwards, with guitarist Adrian Smith remarking that, "he always had the chops and the technique, but in Maiden he really exploded, to the point where a lot of stuff we did after he joined was then founded on his playing, all those busy patterns he does, displaying tremendous technique."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=241[/tpl] As described in detail on the band's 2004 The Early Days documentary, Piece of Mind's opening track, "Where Eagles Dare", famously displays McBrain's ability to use the single drum pedal very quickly, plus his rapid tom fills.[tpl]cite video|date= 23 November 2004|title=The Early Days|chapter=The History Of Iron Maiden – Part 1|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony[/tpl]
He is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal/hard rock drummers of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/50-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-part-2-225815/8#content |title=50 greatest drummers of all time: part 2 |publisher=MusicRadar |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ranker.com/list/rolling-stones-100-greatest-drummers-of-all-time/music-lover?page=2&format=GRID&sortby=&sortdir= | title = 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time | accessdate = 6 October 2011 | work = Rolling Stone | publisher = Ranker[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.totaldrumsets.com/best-rock-drummers-2.html | title = The 100 Best Drummers Ever | accessdate = 6 October 2011 | publisher = Totaldrumsets.com[/tpl] In the 2008 Live After Death DVD, Steve Gadd, McBrain's then drum technician, comments that, on the World Slavery Tour, drummers such as Tommy Lee would refer to McBrain as an 'octopus' after witnessing the way in which his stamina gives him the ability to use all of his large signature drum kit in concert.[tpl]cite video|date= 4 February 2008|title=Live After Death | chapter = The History of Iron Maiden – Part 2|medium=DVD|publisher=EMI[/tpl]
McBrain often employs the back end of his left hand drum stick to allow for more powerful "snare hits".[tpl]cite web | url = http://maidenfans.com/index.php?ACT=module&name=rwarticles&show=25 | title = Nicko McBrain fan club interview | accessdate = 5 October 2011| work = ironmaiden.com | publisher = maidenfans.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130127005231/http://maidenfans.com/index.php?ACT=module&name=rwarticles&show=25|archivedate=27 January 2013[/tpl] He is known for not using a double bass pedal, with Bruce Dickinson commenting that he refused to use one on "Where Eagles Dare", considering them 'undrummerish'. He claims to have only ever used a double pedal once on "Face in the Sand", from Dance of Death, preferring to use a DW 5000 Accelerator single pedal.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ironmaiden.com/nicko-answers-your-20-questions.html | title = Nicko answers your 20 questions | accessdate = 5 October 2011 | publisher = ironmaiden.com[/tpl] Since switching to the DW pedal in 2000, McBrain plays barefoot, stating that it gives him "more freedom."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-iron-maidens-nicko-mcbrain-on-the-flight-666-dvd-an.html | title = Iron Maiden's Nicko McBrain on the Flight 666 DVD | accessdate = 21 January 2012 | date = 4 June 2009 | last = Grow | first = Kory | work = Revolver[/tpl]
Steve Harris remarks that "...he can play all kinds of music. Drummers from other bands sit round the back of him to see what he’s doing, but he’s got his kit set so he doesn't even look at what he's hitting half the time".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=334 | title = Nicko McBrain as known by Steve Harris | accessdate = 11 February 2012 | publisher = ironmaiden.com | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100819081436/http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=334 | archivedate = 19 August 2010 | last = Harris | first = Steve[/tpl] After McBrain joined the band in 1982, Harris also noted how much easier playing with McBrain was for a songwriter,'Band' interactive sub section of the Enhanced CD-ROM Piece Of Mind (1998 re-master edition) with Adrian Smith claiming that, "Steve loves playing with him. They used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=241[/tpl]
In 1991, McBrain released an instructional drum video, entitled Rhythms of the Beast, which was re-released on DVD in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Iron Maiden Drummer Nicko McBrain's Rhythms Of The Beast Remastered On DVD|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/150139|work=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|accessdate=18 August 2013|date=9 November 2010[/tpl] The video features McBrain demonstrating his technique, and covers tuning, soloing and parts of the drum kit.[tpl]cite web|title=Iron Maiden Drummer's 'Rhythms Of The Beast' Available On Limited-Edition DVD|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-drummer-s-rhythms-of-the-beast-available-on-limited-edition-dvd/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=18 August 2013|date=9 November 2010[/tpl]

==Equipment==

McBrain currently uses Premier drums and Paiste cymbals. For A Matter of Life and Death he used his Ludwig metal shell LM 402 snare drum which was purchased in 1975, making it the oldest drum in his kit.[tpl]cite video|date= 28 August 2006|title=A Matter of Life and Death | chapter = Documentary|medium=DVD|publisher=EMI[/tpl] He endorses Vic Firth signature drum sticks, also using them for his own drumming.

==Personal life==

McBrain converted to Christianity in 1999 after an experience in the Spanish River Church, near his Boca Raton, Florida home. His wife, Rebecca (from Whitman, West Virginia), had been asking him to attend with her, and upon entering the church, McBrain soon found himself crying as he experienced a "calling". Recounting the tale, he said "I just sat there thinking, 'I didn't drink last night...why can't I stand?' I had this love affair with Jesus going on in my heart."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.godscare.net/witness/Iron%20Maiden.htm|title=Nicko McBrain| publisher=Godscare.net|accessdate=2 June 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723135641/http://www.godscare.net/witness/Iron%20Maiden.htm|archivedate=23 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://rockgod.co.nz/id212.htm|author=WCA News|publisher=rockgod.co.nz|date=March and April 2001|title=Cracking Through a Heart of Iron|accessdate=2 June 2009[/tpl]
In an interview, McBrain was asked if he felt it was appropriate to be a member of Iron Maiden in light of his Christian views. He responded by saying, “When you become a Christian, you don’t become sinless. The idea is to sin less. We’re all sinners. We’re never going to be clean till the day the good Lord is standing in front and judgement comes. But to me, I try to live my life. I do fall off, and occasionally I fall off hard and I have to get down on my knees and beg forgiveness. So it’s not an easy ride, and it’s not professed to be either.” He was also asked if he shared his religious views with his band mates, and if so, how they felt about it. McBrain responded, “We’ve had some incredibly deep conversations amongst each of us. I can’t say to you that I’m trying to convert all these guys in my band to be Christians. I’m leading them on my route, and if they choose to follow what God’s plan is in the Bible, that’s up to them. I say to them all, you know, look, in my belief, at the moment, if you turn to your saviour Jesus Christ, I’ll have eternal life in Heaven with you! ... We don’t talk about it every time we get together, but we’ve had some interesting conversations over the years.”[tpl]cite web|last=Martin |first=Geoff |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=41753537-c41f-4f04-9c43-99def58956ef&k=3874 |title=Iron Maiden undergoes a renaissance |publisher=Canada.com |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl]
