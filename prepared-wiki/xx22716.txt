==Beach erosion==

Over time, Waikīkī beach has had problems with erosion, leading to the construction of groynes and beach replenishment projects. For example, in the 1920s and 1930s sand was imported from Manhattan Beach, California, via ship and barge to Waikīkī.[tpl]cite web|author=Bonnie Beckerson|title =City of Manhattan Beach History|url=http://manhattanbeachhistorical.org/history|accessdate = 2010-04-26|year=2001[/tpl] Importing stopped in the 1970s. Officials are looking for ways to sustain the existing sand by eliminating loss due to tide flow.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080707002846/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/07/05/waikiki.sand.ap/index.html |archivedate=July 7, 2008 |work=CNN |title=Where's Waikiki's sand? |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/07/05/waikiki.sand.ap/index.html |date=July 5, 2003 |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |location=Atlanta, GA, USA |accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl] Subject to permits, a partial restoration was completed in the spring of 2012. The proposed project imported sand from nearby shoals and widened the [tpl]convert|1700|ft|m|sigfig=2|adj=on[/tpl] long beach by about [tpl]convert|37|ft|m[/tpl] between the Royal Hawaiian Hotel concrete groin and the Kūhiō Beach crib wall. The project restored the beach to its 1985 shoreline.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20100630_Beach_to_be_rebuilt_with_recovered_sand.html |title=Beach to be rebuilt with recovered sand - Hawaii News |publisher=Staradvertiser.com |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl]
