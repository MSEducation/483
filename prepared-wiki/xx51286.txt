==History==

===Formation and early years (1997–1999)===

The members of Trapt met in high school in the mid-'90s and shortly thereafter developed an act with Chris Taylor Brown (vocals), Simon Ormandy (guitar), Peter Charell (bass), and David Stege (drums). The band's first few rehearsals were in Ormandy's guesthouse, which had a party-like atmosphere with its loft overlooking the living room.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-2356/2002-09-12-breaking_free+wiki|title=Trapt History|work=Synthesis|date=September 12, 2002[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] They began playing at local venues in 1997 before any members had graduated high school. The band received a great response and a positive buzz soon started to grow. In 1998, still before graduation, they were already opening for up-and-coming fellow acts like Papa Roach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/080801|title=Interview With Trapt|work=Shave Magazine|author=Abe|date=August 1, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl] They recorded and released their first CD, Amalgamation in 1999, which they sold at their live shows.  Their second release, the Glimpse EP, came in 2000, and another EP, 2001's self-titled Trapt, served as the band's demo. Between the strength of these releases and the successes in touring, they were able to garner major record label attention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/trapt|title=Trapt on Facebook[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=February 2012[/tpl]

==="Amalgamation" (1999-2000)===

The debut independent release by Trapt, released in June 1999 and sold only in the Los Gatos, California area. The album was a local success, selling over 900 copies by the end of 1999. This album sports a drastically different sound compared to later releases, with vocalist Chris Taylor Brown rapping in every song, with later releases not containing rapping at all.

==="The Glimpse" (2000)===

Trapt's final independent release, last EP.

===Trapt (2001–2003)===

The band proceeded to sign with Warner Bros. Records and started recording their debut album, with Robin Diaz replacing Stege on the drums. On November 5, 2002 the band released their self-titled album, Trapt, which produced a total of three singles. In 2002 "Headstrong" was the first, and it reached No. 1 on both the Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, as well as No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking their most successful single to date. The second single from the album, "Still Frame", also managed to achieve No. 1 spot on the US Mainstream Rock chart, and No. 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The third single, "Echo" peaked at No. 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The Trapt album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Although not a single, the last song on the album, "New Beginning", was featured in the film "Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler".

===Someone in Control (2004–2006)===

Before releasing their next full-length album, the band released a self-titled three-track EP, released March 30, 2004, that included live versions of the "Made of Glass" and "Echo" tracks from their debut album, as well as a previously unreleased non-LP track, "Promise".
Their second full length album, titled Someone in Control, was released September 13, 2005. It produced three singles for the band: "Stand Up", "Waiting", and "Disconnected (Out of Touch)". While these singles didn't do as well as those released from the first album, "Stand Up" still reached No. 3 on the US Mainstream Rock chart.
In support of this album, Trapt toured with Thousand Foot Krutch, Silvertide, Chevelle, Three Days Grace, Nickelback, and others.
