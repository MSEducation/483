 One such case is [[spider]]s, amongst which aggressive mimicry is quite common in both luring prey and disguising stealthily approaching predators.<ref>[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = R. R. | year = 1995 | title = Eight-legged tricksters: Spiders that specialize at catching other spiders | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 590–98 |jstor=1311924 | doi = 10.2307/1311924[/tpl]</ref> One case is the [[Golden Orb Weaver]] (''Nephila clavipes''), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow is the color of many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worthwhile. Another form of mimicry is based not on [[color]] but pattern. Species such as ''[[Argiope argentata]]'' employ prominent patterns in the middle of their webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as [[nectar guide]]s. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bee's ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.<ref>[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Craig | first1 = C.

Another case is where males are lured towards what would seem to be a sexually receptive female; the model in this situation being the same species as the dupe. Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's investigation of female fireflies of the genus Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal.Lloyd, J. E. (1965) Aggressive Mimicry in Photuris: Firefly Femmes Fatales Science 149:653–654. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these "femmes fatales", and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.[tpl]cite journal | author=Lloyd, J. E. | year = 1975 | title = Aggressive  Mimicry in Photuris Fireflies: Signal Repertoires by Femmes Fatales |  journal = Science | volume = 187 | issue = 4175| pages = 452–453 | doi = 10.1126/science.187.4175.452 | pmid = 17835312 |bibcode = 1975Sci...187..452L [/tpl]

The listrosceline katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia is capable of attracting male cicadas of the tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas.  This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry is similar to the Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = D.

Some carnivorous plants may also be able to increase their rate of capture through mimicry.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Jonathan A. | year = 1996 | title = Pitcher dimorphism, prey composition and the mechanisms of prey attraction in the pitcher plant Nepenthes rafflesiana in Borneo | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 84 | issue = 4| pages = 515–525 | doi = 10.2307/2261474 [/tpl]
Luring is not a necessary condition however, as the predator will still have a significant advantage by simply not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.
A case of the latter situation is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged by the presence of the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, who allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the Bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the Sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown to the right cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wickler, W. | year = 1966 | title = Mimicry  in Tropical Fishes | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of  London.

Another interesting example that does not involve any luring is the Zone-tailed Hawk, which resembles the Turkey Vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey.[tpl]cite journal | author = Willis, E. O. | year = 1963 | title = Is  the Zone-Tailed Hawk a Mimic of the Turkey Vulture? | journal = The  Condor | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 313–317 | doi = 10.2307/1365357 [/tpl] Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.

====Parasites====

Parasites can also be aggressive mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously.
Some of the predators described have a feature that draws prey, and parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird via the feces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and then must find of a suitable bird to mature in. As the host birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly colored and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks,See here for a photo.[ref]Moore J., 2002. Parasites and the behavior of animals. Oxford University
Press, Oxford.[/ref] coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can bridge the gap between hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 18279076 | year = 2008 | last1 = Yanoviak | first1 = SP | last2 = Kaspari | first2 = M | last3 = Dudley | first3 = R | last4 = Poinar Jr | first4 = G | title = Parasite-induced fruit mimicry in a tropical canopy ant | volume = 171 | issue = 4 | pages = 536–44 | doi = 10.1086/528968 | journal = The American naturalist |url=http://www.canopyants.com/2008_AmNat.pdf | format= PDF [/tpl]
In an unusual case, planidium larvae of some beetles of the genus Meloe will form a group and produce a pheromone that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species; when the male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen, and from there transfer to a female bee, and from there to the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0603901103 | title = Phoretic nest parasites use sexual deception to obtain transport to their host's nest | year = 2006 | last1 = Saul-Gershenz | first1 = L.

G. [/tpl]
Host-parasite mimicry is a two species system where a parasite mimics its own host. Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, cutting down the biological mother's parental investment in the process. The ability to lay eggs which mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called gentes. Cases of intraspecific brood parasitism, where a female lays in conspecific's nest, as illustrated by the Goldeneye duck (Bucephala clangula),[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = M. | last2 = Eriksson | first2 = M. O. G. | year = 1982 | title = Nest parasitism in Goldeneyes Bucephala clangula: some evolutionary aspects | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi = 10.1086/283965 [/tpl] do not represent a case of mimicry. Another example is that of chemical mimicry, in which the parasitic butterfly Phengaris rebeli, which parasitizes the ant species Myrmica schencki by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae, and enable the P. rebeli larvae to be brought directly into the M. schencki nest.[tpl]cite journal|last=Barbero|first=Francesca|coauthors=Thomas JA, Bonelli S, Balletto E, Schonrogge K|title=Acoustical mimicry in a predatory social parasite of ants|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=2009|volume=212|pages=4084–4090|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40039224_Acoustical_mimicry_in_a_predatory_social_parasite_of_ants|accessdate=28 September 2013|doi=10.1242/jeb.032912|pmid=19946088|issue=Pt 24[/tpl]

===Reproductive===

Reproductive mimicry occurs when the actions of the dupe directly aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants, which may have deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they would seem to. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, and brood parasitism, which also involves aggressive mimicry.

====Mimicry of flowers====

Bakerian mimicry, named after Herbert G. Baker,Baker H. G. 1976. "Mistake" pollination as a reproductive system, with special reference to the Caricaceae. Pp 161–169 in J. Burley and B. T. Styles, eds. [tpl]Clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] Variation, breeding, and conservation of tropical trees. Academic Press, London, U.K. is a form of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, cheating pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Bawa | first1 = K. S. | year = 1980 | title = Mimicry of male by female flowers and intrasexual competition for pollinators in Jacaratia dolichaula (D. Smith) Woodson (Caricaceae) | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 467–74 | doi = 10.2307/2408216 [/tpl]
Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry is a form of reproductive floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Dodson | first1 = C. H. | last2 = Frymire | first2 = G. P. | year = 1961 | title = Natural pollination of orchids | url = | journal = Missouri Botanical Garden Bulletin | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 133–39 [/tpl] By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense of the family Orchidaceae resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by Monarch Butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Boyden | first1 = T. C. | year = 1980 | title = Floral mimicry by Epidendrurn ibaguense (Orchidaceae) in Panama | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 135–36 | doi = 10.2307/2408322 [/tpl] Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though, for example a lamellicorn beetle which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Kullenberg | first1 = B. | year = 1961 | title = Studies in Ophrys pollination | url = | journal = Zool. Bidr. Uppsala | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–340 [/tpl]

====Pseudocopulation====

Pseudocopulation occurs when a flower mimics a female of a certain insect species, inducing the males to try to copulate with the flower. This is much like the aggressive mimicry in fireflies described previously, but with a  more benign outcome for the pollinator. This form of mimicry has been called Pouyannian mimicry, after Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne, who first described the phenomenon.Correvon H., Pouyanne M. (1916) [tpl]lang|fr|Un curieux cas de mimetisme chez les Ophrydées[/tpl]. J. Soc. Nat. Hortic. Fr. 17: 29–31, 41–42, 84.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Pouyanne | first1 = M. | year = 1917 | title = La fécondation des Ophrys par les insectes | url = | journal = [tpl]lang|fr|Bull. Soc. Hist. Nat. Afr. Nord[/tpl] | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 1–2 [/tpl] It is most common in orchids which mimic females of the order Hymenoptera (generally bees and wasps), and may account for around 60% of pollinations.Van der Pijl, L., Dodson, C. H. (1966) Orchid Flowers; Their Pollination and Evolution. Coral Gables, Florida, USA, Univ. Miami Press. Depending on the morphology of the flower, a pollen sac called a pollinia is attached to the head or abdomen of the male. This is then transferred to the stigma of the next flower the male tries to inseminate, resulting in pollination. Visual mimicry is the most obvious sign of this deception for humans, but the visual aspect may be minor or non-existent. It is the senses of touch and olfaction that are most important.

====Inter-sexual mimicry====

Inter-sexual mimicry occurs when individuals of one sex in a species mimic members of the opposite sex. An example is the three male forms of the marine isopod Paracerceis sculpta. Alpha males are the largest and guard a harem of females. Beta males mimic females and manage to enter the harem of females without being detected by the alpha males allowing them to mate. Gamma males are the smallest males and mimic juveniles. This also allows them to mate with the females without the alpha males detecting them.[tpl]cite journal |last=Shuster |first=Stephen |date=May 1987 |title=Alternative Reproductive Behaviors: Three Discrete Male Morphs in Paracerceis sculpta, an Intertidal Isopod from the Northern Gulf of California |journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=318–327 |doi=10.2307/1548612 |jstor=1548612[/tpl] Similarly, among common side-blotched lizards, some males mimic the yellow throat coloration and even mating rejection behavior of the other sex to sneak matings with guarded females.  These males look and behave like unreceptive females. This strategy is effective against "usurper" males with orange throats, but ineffective against blue throated "guarder" males, which chase them away.[tpl]cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |coauthors=C.

===Automimicry===

Automimicry or intraspecific mimicry occurs within a single species, one case being where one part of an organism's body resembles another part. Examples include snakes in which the tail resembles the head and show behavior such as moving backwards to confuse predators and insects and fishes with eyespots on their hind ends to resemble the head. The phrase is also used when the mimic imitates other morphs within the same species. When males mimic females or vice versa this may be referred to as sexual mimicry.
Examples:

===Others===

Some forms of mimicry do not fit easily within the classification given previously.
Owl butterflies (genus Caligo) bear eye-spots on the underside of their wings; if turned upside-down, their undersides resemble the face of an owl (such as the Short-eared Owl or the Tropical Screech Owl) for which in turn the butterfly predators – small lizards and birds – would be fooled.See here for a photo Thus it has been supposed that the eye-spots are a form of Batesian mimicry. However, the pose in which the butterfly resembles an owl's head is not normally adopted in life. Research suggests that eye-spots are not a form of mimicry and do not deter predators because they look like eyes. Rather the conspicuous contrast in the patterns on the wings deter predators.Martin Stevens, Chloe J. Hardman, and Claire L. Stubbins Conspicuousness, not eye mimicry, makes eyespots effective antipredator signals; Behavioral Ecology; volume 19, number 3, pp. 525–531 [tpl]doi|10.1093/beheco/arm162[/tpl]
Another case is floral mimicry induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Batra | first1 = L.  R. | last2 = Batra | first2 = S. | year = 1985 | title = Floral  Mimicry Induced by Mummy-Berry Fungus Exploits Host's Pollinators as  Vectors | url = | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4702| pages = 1011–1013 | doi = 10.1126/science.228.4702.1011 | pmid = 17797664 |bibcode = 1985Sci...228.1011B [/tpl] In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugary substances including glucose and fructose, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet strangely they still attract pollinating insects like bees. As it turns out, the sweet secretions are not the only cues—the leaves also reflect ultraviolet, which is normally absorbed by the plant's leaves. Ultraviolet light is also employed by the host's flowers as a signal to insects, which have visual systems quite capable of picking up this low wavelength (300–400 nm) radiation. The fungus is then transferred to the ovaries of the flower where it produces mummified, inedible berries, which overwinter before infecting new plants. This case is unusual in that the fungus benefits from the deception, but it is the leaves which act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It bears similarity to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It also has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.

==Evolution==

It is widely accepted that mimicry evolves as a positive adaptation. The lepidopterist and writer Vladimir Nabokov argued that although natural selection might stabilize a "mimic" form, it would not be necessary to create it. It may be that much of insect mimicry, including the Viceroy / Monarch mimicry, results from similar self-organizing processes, and thus the tendency for convergence by chance would be high.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Victoria N. | year = 2002 | title = Nabokov, Teleology and Insect Mimicry | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nabokov_studies/summary/v007/7.alexander.html | journal = Nabokov Studies | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 177–213 | doi = 10.1353/nab.2010.0004 [/tpl]
The most widely accepted model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. In this model the first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes associated with large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects and this leading to increasing closeness of resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that there are only a few single point mutations that cause large phenotypic effects while there are numerous others that produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements are now known to be involved in a supergene that is involved in the development of butterfly color patterns. Computational simulations of population genetics have also supported this idea.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Holmgren | first1 = N. M.
