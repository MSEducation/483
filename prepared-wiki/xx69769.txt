Texas root rot (also known as Phymatotrichopsis root rot, Phymatotrichum root rot, cotton root rot, or, in the older literature, Ozonium root rot) is a
pathogen fairly common in Mexico and the southwestern
United States that causes sudden wilt and death of
affected plants, usually during the warmer months.  It is a
soil-borne fungus of the species
Phymatotrichopsis omnivora that attacks the roots of
susceptible plants.  Because the damaged roots are unable to
take up enough water to maintain the plant in warm weather,
the leaves wilt and the plant dies.  The
dead leaves usually remain attached to the plant.
A multitude of dicotyledonous tree, shrub and herbaceous plants are susceptible to
Texas root rot, including figs, pomegranates, elms, grapes,
cotton, alfalfa, oleander, and roses. The largest compilation of hosts, more than 1,700, was made by J. Taubenhaus and W. Ezekiel.J.J. Taubenhaus and W.N. Ezekiel. 1936. A rating of plants with reference to their relative resistance or susceptibility to Phymatotrichum root rot. Texas Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 527 It is
one of the most destructive fungal plant diseases.  Some
monocot plants are tolerant and others are immune.
Eradication or control of Texas root rot is difficult, at best.
The fungus is known to thrive in moist and alkaline
soils.  It can survive for long periods in the soil,
sometimes lying dormant for decades, and can penetrate to
depths of up to twelve feet.  Increasing the organic
content of the soil with compost and green manure may
help to reduce growth of the fungus.
A monograph of this disease, which includes a historical review, was written by Streets and Bloss in 1973.R.B. Streets and H.E. Bloss. 1973. Phymatotrichum Root Rot. Monograph #8. The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN
