==Building design==

Steve Baron, president of Prime Group Realty, said in 1990 that 77 West Wacker had "very compact floors with virtually no columns." Therefore tenant companies would not pay for space that they would be unable to use.
To enhance its panoramic view over the city, the building's skin is predominantly glazed. The facade, of classical proportions, comprises glass surfaces framed in Portuguese white granite, with the dividers between the different floors linked by columns. The top floor is shaped like a temple. The ground floor houses an [tpl]convert|18|m|ft|disp = flip|adj = on[/tpl] high atrium in gray and white marble.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
At night, 540 lamps light the building and its surroundings, along with a United sign that was added to the building in 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
The interior is similarly styled. The classical Greek style is repeated inside, with Thassos marble walls and a 40 ft (12 m) tall coffered ceiling made of white oak wood.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
A sculpture by Xavier Corbero called "Three Lawyers and A Judge" graces the building, as does Antoni Tàpies' artwork called "Big Eyelids". Bofill further contributed by creating a sculpture entitled "Twisted Columns" which appears to float above a reflecting pool.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
