Interstate H-2 (abbreviated H-2) is an intrastate Interstate Highway located on the island of O‘ahu in Hawai‘i, USA.  H-2 is also known as the Veterans Memorial Freeway. Despite the number, this is a north–south interstate, the 'H'-series (for Hawaii) numbering reflects the order in which routes were funded and built. Its southern terminus is at Interstate H-1 in Pearl City, and its northern terminus is at Wilikina Drive (Wahiawa Bypass) (Route 99) in Wahiawā near Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield.

==Route description==

Interstate H-2 begins at the Waiawa Interchange at Interstate H-1.  The highway heads north/south with four lanes in each direction, passing the Waipio neighborhood of Waipahu and through the city of Mililani.  At this point the highway narrows for its final three miles (5 km) as it reaches its terminus in Wahiawa, near Wheeler Army Airfield and Schofield Barracks.
