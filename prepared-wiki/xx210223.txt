They campaigned on infrastructure improvements such as communication and transport and on their record in restoring order and economic growth.[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/europe/1405944.stm | title = Socialists claim Albania poll victory | accessdate = 2008-07-30 | date = 2001-06-25 | publisher = BBC Online[/tpl] They were also boosted by achieving the opening of negotiations with the European Union on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement just before the election.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/200106/10623-006-trae-tir.htm | title = PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN ALBANIA: A MISSION POSSIBLE?! | accessdate = 2008-07-27 | date = 2001-06-21 | publisher = Alternative Information Network[/tpl]
The main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Albania led by ex-President Sali Berisha, had moderated their message after losing the 2000 local elections. They formed a coalition of right wing parties, the Union for Victory Coalition, and said that they were open to dealing with other parties if they won the election. They hoped to make gains due to public concern over corruption and the continuing poverty in Albania.
The campaign was generally peaceful and with no reliable opinion polls most observers expected the ruling Socialists to be re-elected with a smaller majority.[ref]

==Voting==

===First round===

Both main parties initially claimed victory after the first round on the 24 June in which turnout reached about 60%. The governing Socialist party claimed that they won 45 of the 100 seats.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jun/26/2 | title = Albanian opposition alleges election fraud | accessdate = 2008-07-30 | date = 2001-06-26 | publisher = guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=Nicholas | last=Wood[/tpl] Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) described the election as having made progress towards international democratic standards. However the opposition Democratic party claimed there was widespread intimidation and electoral fraud. Procedural differences led to polling stations being kept closed in Lushnje leading to voting having to be delayed for about 30,000 people.[tpl]cite news| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDB1330F936A15755C0A9679C8B63 | title = Violence Mars Albania Vote for Parliament | accessdate = 2008-07-30 | date = 2001-06-25 | publisher = The New York Times[/tpl] The results of the first round showed that the Socialists won 33 seats as against 17 won by the Democrats.[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1428340.stm | title = Albania urged to accept vote result | accessdate = 2008-07-30 | date = 2001-07-08 | publisher = BBC Online[/tpl]
