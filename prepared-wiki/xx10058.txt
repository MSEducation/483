==Etymology==

One theory for the origin of the name Riga is that it is a corrupted borrowing from the Liv ringa meaning loop, referring to the ancient natural harbour formed by the tributary loop of the Daugava River.Endzelīns, Did Celts Inhabit the Baltics (1911 Dzimtene's Vēstnesis (Homeland Messenger) No. 227). Retrieved 24 July 2009. The other is that Riga owes its name to this already-established role in commerce between East and West, as a borrowing of the Latvian rija, for threshing barn, the "j" becoming a "g" in German{–}notably, Riga is called Rie by English geographer Richard Hakluyt (1589),Pronouncing the "i" and "e" separately, REE-eh, is the best approximation to the Latvian rija, as "Ria" would result in an "i" not "ee" sound. and German historian Dionysius Fabricius (1610) confirms the origin of Riga from rija.Fabrius, D. Livonicae Historiae Compendiosa Series, 1610: Riga nomen sortita est suum ab aedificiis vel horreis quorum a litus Dunae magna fuit copia, quas livones sua lingua Rias vocare soliti. [tpl]la icon[/tpl] Another theory could be that Riga was named after Riege, the German name for the River Rīdzene, a tributary of the Daugava.Rīdziņa

==History==

===Founding===

The river Daugava has been a trade route since antiquity, part of the Vikings' Dvina-Dnieper navigation route to Byzantium.Bilmanis, A. Latvia as an Independent State. Latvian Legation. 1947. A sheltered natural harbour [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] upriver from the mouth of the Daugava{–}the site of today's Riga{–}has been recorded, as Duna Urbs, as early as the 2nd century. It was settled by the Livs, an ancient Finnic tribe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ceroi.net/reports/riga/latviski/pamatlietas/teritorija.htm|title=Teritorija un administratīvās robežas vēsturiskā skatījumā|language=Latvian |accessdate=2 August 2007 |publisher=Cities Environmental Reports on the Internet[/tpl]
Riga began to develop as a centre of Viking trade during the early Middle Ages.
Riga's inhabitants occupied themselves mainly with fishing, animal husbandry, and trading, later developing crafts (in bone, wood, amber, and iron).
The Livonian Chronicle of Henry testifies to Riga having long been a trading centre by the 12th century, referring to it as portus antiquus (ancient port), and describes dwellings and warehouses used to store mostly corn, flax, and hides. German traders began visiting Riga, establishing a nearby outpost in 1158.
Along with German traders also arrived the monk Meinhard of SegebergVauchez et al. Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Routledge, 2001 to convert the Livonian pagans to Christianity. (Catholic and Orthodox Christianity had already arrived in Latvia more than a century earlier, and many Latvians baptised) Meinhard settled among the Livs, building a castle and church at Ikšķile, upstream from Riga, and established his bishopric there. The Livs, however, continued to practice paganism and Meinhard died in Ikšķile in 1196, having failed his mission.Germanis, U. The Latvian Saga. 10th ed. 1998. Memento, Stockholm. In 1198 the Bishop Bertold arrived with a contingent of crusaders and commenced a campaign of forced Christianization. Bertold was killed soon afterwards and his forces defeated.
The Church mobilised to avenge. Pope Innocent III issued a bull declaring a crusade against the Livonians. Bishop Albert was proclaimed Bishop of Livonia by his uncle Hartwig of Uthlede, Prince-Archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg in 1199. Albert landed in Riga in 1200 with 23 shipsLaffort, R. (censor), Catholic Encyclopedia, Robert Appleton Co., 1907 and 500 Westphalian crusaders.Tolstoy-Miloslavsky, D. The Tolstoys: Genealogy and Origin. A2Z, 1991 In 1201 he transferred the seat of the Livonian bishopric from Ikšķile to Riga, extorting agreement to do so from the elders of Riga by force.

===Under Bishop Albert===

The year 1201 also marked the first arrival of German merchants in Novgorod, via the Dvina.Dollinger, P. The Emergence of International Business 1200[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1800, 1964; translated Macmillan and Co edition, 1970 To defend territoryReiner et al. Riga. Axel Menges, Stuttgart. 1999. and trade, Albert established the Order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1202, open to nobles and merchants.
Christianization of the Livs continued. In 1207 Albert started on fortification of the town.Zarina, D. Old Riga: Tourist Guide, Spriditis, 1992 Emperor Philip invested Albert with Livonia as a fiefMoeller et al. History of the Christian Church. MacMillan & Co. 1893. and principality of the Holy Roman Empire. To promote a permanent military presence, territorial ownership was divided between the Church and the Order, with the Church taking Riga and two-thirds of all lands conquered and granting the Order a third.Palmieri, A. Catholic Origin of Latvia, ed. Cororan, J.A. et al. The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Volume XLVI, January–October 1921. Philadelphia. Until then, it had been customary for crusaders to serve for a year and then return home.
Albert had ensured Riga's commercial future by obtaining papal bulls which decreed that all German merchants had to carry on their Baltic trade through Riga. In 1211, Riga minted its first coinage, and Albert laid the cornerstone for the Riga Dom.Doma vēsture (history). Retrieved 29 July 2009. Riga was not yet secure as an alliance of tribes failed to take Riga. In 1212, Albert led a campaign to compel Polotsk to grant German merchants free river passage. Polotsk conceded Kukenois (Koknese) and Jersika to Albert, also ending the Livs' tribute to Polotsk.Kooper, E. The Medieval Chronicle V. Radopi, 2008.
Riga's merchant citizenry chafed and sought greater autonomy from the Church. In 1221 they acquired the right to independently self-administer Riga. and adopted a city constitutionWright, C.T.H. The Edinburgh Review, The Letts, 1917
That same year Albert was compelled to recognise Danish rule over lands they had conquered in Estonia and Livonia.Murray, A., Crusade and Conversion on the Baltic Frontier, 1150–1500. Ashgate, London. 2001. Albert had sought the aid of King Valdemar of Denmark to protect Riga and Livonian lands against Liv insurrection when reinforcements could not reach Riga. The Danes landed in Livonia, built a fortress at Reval (Tallinn), and set about conquering Estonian and Livonian lands. The Germans attempted, but failed, to assassinate Valdemar."The Ecclesiastical Review", Vol. LVI. American Ecclesiastical Review. Dolphin Press. 1917. Albert was able to reach an accommodation a year later, however, and in 1222 Valdemar returned all Livonian lands and possessions to Albert's control.Fonnesberg-Schmidt, I. The Popes and the Baltic Crusades, 1147–1254. Brill. 2006.
Albert's difficulties with Riga's citizenry continued; with papal intervention, a settlement was reached in 1225 whereby they no longer had to pay tax to the Bishop of Riga,Švābe, A., ed. Latvju Enciklopēdija. Trīs Zvaigznes, Stockholm. 1953–1955 (in Latvian) and Riga's citizens acquired the right to elect their magistrates and town councilors. In 1226, Albert consecrated the Dom Cathedral, built St. James's Church, (now a cathedral) and founding a parochial school at the Church of St. George.
In 1227, Albert conquered Oesel Fletcher, R.A., The Conversion of Europe: From Paganism to Christianity, 371–1386AD. Harper Collins. 1991. and the city of Riga concluded a treaty with the Principality of Smolensk giving Polotsk to Riga.[ref]
Michell, Thomas. Handbook for Travelers in Russia, Poland, and Finland. London, John Murray, 1888.[/ref]
Albert died in January 1229.Fonnesberg-Schmidt, I., The Popes and the Baltic Crusades, 1147–1254. Brill, 2007 He failed his aspiration to be anointed archbishop but the German hegemony he established over the Baltics would last for seven centuries.

===Hanseatic League===

In 1282 Riga became a member of the Hanseatic League. The Hansa was instrumental in giving Riga economic and political stability, thus providing the city with a strong foundation which endured the political conflagrations that were to come, down to modern times.

===Holy Roman Empire, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Swedish and Russian Empires===

As the influence of the Hanseatic League waned, Riga became the object of foreign military, political, religious and economic aspirations. Riga accepted the Reformation in 1522, ending the power of the archbishops. In 1524, iconoclast targeted a statue of the Virgin Mary in the Cathedral to make a statement against religious icons. It was denounced as a witch, and given a trial by water in the Daugava River. The statue floated, so it was denounced as a witch and burnt at Kubsberg.[tpl]cite book|last=MacCulloch|first=Diarmaid|authorlink=Diarmaid MacCulloch|title=The Reformation: A History|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rE7uAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|page = 150|isbn=978-0-670-03296-9[/tpl] With the demise of the Livonian Order during the Livonian War, Riga for twenty years had the status of a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire before it came under the influence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Treaty of Drohiczyn, which ended the war for Riga in 1581. In 1621, during the Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625), Riga and the outlying fortress of Daugavgriva came under the rule of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who intervened in the Thirty Years' War not only for political and economic gain but also in favour of German Lutheran Protestantism. During the Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658), Riga withstood a siege by Russian forces.
Riga remained the largest city in Sweden until 1710,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] a period during which the city retained a great deal of autonomous self-government. In that year, in the course of the Great Northern War, Russia under Tsar Peter the Great besieged plague-stricken Riga. Along with the other Livonian towns and gentry, Riga capitulated to Russia, but largely retained their privileges. Riga was made the capital of the Governorate of Riga (later: Livonia). Sweden's northern dominance had ended, and Russia's emergence as the strongest Northern power was formalised through the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. Riga became an industrialised port city of the Russian empire, in which it remained until World War I. By 1900, Riga was the third largest city in Russia after Moscow and Saint Petersburg in terms of the number of industrial workers and number of theatres.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
During these many centuries of war and changes of power in the Baltic, and despite demographic changes, the Baltic Germans in Riga had maintained a dominant position. By 1867 Riga's population was 42.9% German.National History Museum of Latvia Riga employed German as its official language of administration until the installation of Russian in 1891 as the official language in the Baltic provinces, as part of the policy of Russification of the non-Russian speaking territories of the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland, Finland and the Baltics, undertaken by Tsar Alexander III. More and more Latvians started moving to the city during the mid-19th century. The rise of a Latvian bourgeoisie made Riga a centre of the Latvian National Awakening with the founding of the Riga Latvian Association in 1868 and the organisation of the first national song festival in 1873. The nationalist movement of the Young Latvians was followed by the socialist New Current during the city's rapid industrialisation, culminating in the 1905 Revolution led by the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party.

===Interwar period===

The 20th century brought World War I and the impact of the Russian Revolution of 1917 to Riga. The German army marched into Riga on 3 September 1917.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Russian_Battery/Retirement_01.htm |title=Russian Retreat 1917 |publisher=Greatwardifferent.com |date=|accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] On 3 March 1918 the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, giving the Baltic countries to Germany. Because of the Armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918, Germany had to renounce that treaty, as did Russia, leaving Latvia and the other Baltic States in a position to claim independence. Latvia, with Riga as its capital city, thus declared its independence on 18 November 1918.
Between World War I and World War II (1918–1940), Riga and Latvia shifted their focus from Russia to the countries of Western Europe. The United Kingdom and Germany replaced Russia as Latvia's major trade partners.

===World War II and the Soviet Union===

During World War II Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 and then was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941–1944. The city's Jewish community was forced into the Riga Ghetto and a concentration camp was constructed in Kaiserwald. On 25 October 1941, the Nazis relocated all Jews from Riga and the vicinity to the ghetto. By 1942, most of Latvia's Jews (about 24,000) were killed on 30 November and 8 December 1941 in the Rumbula massacre.Ezergailis, The Holocaust in Latvia, p. 348 By the end of the war the Baltic Germans were forcibly repatriated to Germany.
The Soviet Red Army re-entered Riga on 13 October 1944. In the following years the massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. Microdistricts of the large multi-storied housing blocks were built to house local workers. By 1989 the percentage of Latvians in Riga had fallen to 36.5%.Ethnic composition of resident population by region or city, Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia Database

In 2004, the arrival of low-cost airlines resulted in cheaper flights from other European cities such as London and Berlin and consequently a substantial increase in numbers of tourists.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.com-citations.us/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/4633647.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Latvia prepares for a tourist invasion|first=Jonathan|last=Charles|accessdate=2 August 2007|date=30 June 2005[/tpl]

==Economy==

Riga is one of the key economic and financial centres of the Baltic States. Roughly half of all the jobs in Latvia are in Riga and the city generates more than 50% of Latvia's GDP as well as around half of Latvia's exports. Biggest exporters are in wood products, IT, food and beverage manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, transport and metallurgy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bizness.lv/prognozes-rezultati/id/10476/nosaukti-desmit-lielakie-eksportejosie-uznemumi-riga-un-rigas-regiona |title=/ Uzņēmējdarbība / Nosaukti desmit lielākie eksportējošie uzņēmumi Rīgā un Rīgas reģionā |publisher=Bizness.lv |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] Riga Port is one of the largest in the Baltics.

==Transport==

Riga, with its central geographic position and concentration of population, has always been the infrastructural hub of Latvia. Several national roads begin in Riga, and European route E22 crosses Riga from the east and west, while the Via Baltica crosses Riga from the south and north.
As a city situated by a river, Riga also has several bridges. The oldest standing bridge is the Railway Bridge, which is also the only railroad-carrying bridge in Riga. The Akmens Bridge connects Old Riga and Pārdaugava; the Salu Bridge connects Maskavas Forštate and Pārdaugava via Zaķusala; and the Vanšu Bridge connects Old Riga and Pārdaugava via Ķīpsala. In 2008, the first stage of the new Dienvidu Bridge route across the Daugava was completed, and was opened to traffic on 17 November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rdpad.lv/en/south_bridge/|title=Explanatory Note on Planning and Building of the Southern Bridge Route|publisher=rdpad.lv|accessdate=21 August 2007[/tpl]
The Dienvidu Bridge is currently the biggest construction project in the Baltic states in 20 years, and it is to reduce traffic congestion in the city centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dienvidutilts.lv/index.php?lang_id=2&menu_id=18|title=Dienvidu Tilts; Project of the Bridge|accessdate=21 August 2007|publisher=dienvidutilts.lv[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rdsd.lv/?ct=dienvidu_tilts|title=Dienvidu tilta maģistrālie pievedceļi|language=Latvian|publisher=rdsd.lv|accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] Another major construction project is the planned Riga Northern Transport Corridor,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ziemelukoridors.lv/pages/main.php?l=en&tema=2|title=Northern Corridor; About project|accessdate=21 August 2007|publisher=ziemelukoridors.lv|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110722164202/http://www.ziemelukoridors.lv/pages/main.php?l=en&tema=2|archivedate=22 July 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl] which is scheduled to commence in 2010.
The Freeport of Riga facilitates cargo and passenger traffic by sea. Sea ferries currently connect Riga to Stockholm and Lübeck, operated respectively by Tallink and DFDS Tor Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tallinksilja.com/en/tab2/schedules/stoRig/|title=Stockholm-Riga|publisher=Tallink|accessdate=31 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfdstorline.lv/DFDSTorlineSIA/EN/Timetables/RigaLuebeck/Index.htm|title=Sailing schedule on route Riga – Luebeck|publisher=DFDS Tor Line|accessdate=31 July 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110722161230/http://www.dfdstorline.lv/DFDSTorlineSIA/EN/Timetables/RigaLuebeck/Index.htm|archivedate=22 July 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The Latvian-flagged ferries MS Romantika and MS Silja Festival are located in the Riga Passenger Terminal.
Riga has one active airport that serves commercial airlines—the Riga International Airport (RIX), built in 1973. Renovation and modernization of the airport was completed in 2001, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of the city. In 2006, a new terminal extension was opened. Work on an extension of the runway was completed in October 2008, and the airport is now able to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A340, Boeing 747, 757, 767 and 777. The annual number of passengers has grown from 310,000 in 1993 to over 4 million in 2009. It has now become the largest airport in the Baltic States, and there are plans to construct a new terminal to cope with increasing passenger numbers.
Riga was also home to an air base during the Cold War—Rumbula Air Base. Another airport, the Spilve Airport, is a former civilian and military airport in Riga located [tpl]convert|5|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from Riga city centre, with active aircraft operating as early as the First World War. It became the first international airport of Riga in the 1930s, which, from 1937 linked the capital city with Helsinki via Tallinn, Warsaw via Vilnius, Berlin and Moscow via Kaunas. After World War II and the Soviet occupation, it was rebuilt into a 1950s-era airport, the hub of Aeroflot. A new ring taxiway and restored surface was added. The airport was closed for regular flights in the late 1980s. The terminal building still remains as a notable example of Stalin's neoclassical architecture.
Public transportation in the city is provided by Rīgas Satiksme which operates a large number of trams, buses and trolleybuses on an extensive network of routes across the city. In addition, many private owners operate minibus services. Riga is connected to the rest of Latvia by trains operated by the national railway company Passenger Train, whose headquarters are in Riga. There are also international rail links to Russia and plans to revive passenger railroad traffic with Estonia. Riga International Coach Terminal provides domestic and international connections by coach. Current plans envisage a trans-European rail link from Tallinn to Warsaw via Riga [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/19752/|title=Tallinn and Riga to be linked by 2010|author=Abdul Turay|publisher=Baltic Times|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=21 July 2009[/tpl] financed by the European Union, with the first phase to be completed by 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rzd-partner.com/news/2008/04/18/322781.html|title=Latvia to Begin Constructing Rail Baltica accessed|publisher=Latvian State Railways|date=18 April 2008|accessdate=21 July 2009[/tpl]

===Art Nouveau===

It is generally recognized that Riga has the finest and the largest collection of art nouveau buildings in the world. This is due to the fact that at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, when art nouveau was at the height of its popularity, Riga experienced an unprecedented financial and demographic boom. In the period from 1857 to 1914 its population grew from 282,000 to 558,000 making it the 4th largest city in the Russian Empire  (after Saint-Petersburg, Moscow  and Warsaw ) and its largest port. The bourgeoisie of Riga used their wealth to build imposing apartment blocks around the former city walls. Local architects, mostly graduates of Riga Technical University, adopted current European movements, and in particular art nouveau. However, the most notable architect of Riga, Mikhail Eisenstein was an alumnus of Saint-Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering. In that period around 800 art nouveau buildings were erected. The majority of them are concentrated in the central part of Riga and a few more in the Old Town.
