==Interests==

Dedicated to music education, Edwards enjoys conducting Beethoven for youth orchestras. He has admitted that he did not envision a career conducting youth orchestras but also that he "did not rule them out". His favorite composition is "Parsifal" by Wagner; other favorites include unaccompanied choral music, cello suites by Bach, quartets by Beethoven and jazz, including Nat King Cole. Apart from music, Edwards likes the Chicago Bears, CrossFit, golf, kayaking, Masterpiece Theater, poetry, and RhÃ´ne wine along with the winemaking process. Edwards is an avid sports fan and fitness advocate; he is a former rugby player, enjoys running and playing squash, and believes there are similarities between how music and sports affect the community. He was sometimes referred to as "coach" by musicians of the Portland Youth Philharmonic. Edwards has shared that he would want to work at a vineyard or winery, or be a sports radio host or travel correspondent for a publication if he were not a conductor.
