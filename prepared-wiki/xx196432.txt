[[Dyssodia]]

CATEGORIES: Tageteae, Asteraceae genera

Dyssodia Cav. is a small genus of flowering plants in the daisy family. Most dyssodias are now treated as members of other related genera, including Thymophylla or Adenophyllum, with Dyssodia as genus synonym. Dyssodia papposa is usually retained in this genus.
Several species of Dyssodia (sensu lato) have found their way into the nursery trade and are relatively popular flowering annuals for hot, dry sites.  Generally sold as threadleaf dyssodia (Dyssodia tenuisecta) and golden dyssodia (Dyssodia cf. pentachaeta).  They perform best in well drained soil.
