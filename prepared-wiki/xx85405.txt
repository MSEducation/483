==Biography==

Goodman was born and raised in Philadelphia, graduated from The Haverford School,Oscar Goodman, "Being Oscar: From Mob Lawyer to Mayor of Las Vegas--Only in America", (Weinstein Books, 2013), p. 277 Haverford College and received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He and his wife Carolyn have four children.
During his career as a defense attorney he represented defendants accused of being some of the leading organized crime figures in Las Vegas, such as Meyer Lansky, Nicky Scarfo, Herbert "Fat Herbie" Blitzstein, Phil Leonetti, former Stardust Casino boss Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal, and Jamiel "Jimmy" Chagra, a 1970s drug trafficker who was acquitted of ordering the murder of Federal Judge John H. Wood, Jr. One of his notorious clients was reputed Chicago mobster Anthony "Tony the Ant" Spilotro, who was known to have a short and violent temper. In the semi-factual 1995 movie Casino, the character of Nicky Santoro was based on Spilotro and was portrayed by actor Joe Pesci. Goodman had a cameo appearance in the film as himself while defending "Ace Rothstein", a character closely based on Lefty Rosenthal and played by Robert De Niro.
Goodman also represented former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, who was convicted of accepting illegal campaign contributions and eventually forced to resign. Hedgecock was later cleared of all charges on appeal.
In 1980-81, he served as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.http://www.nacdl.org/past_presidents/

==Seeking higher office==

Goodman briefly entertained challenging presidential son Jack Carter for the Democratic nomination to run against incumbent Republican U.S. Senator John Ensign in 2006. However, on April 20, Goodman announced that he would not run but instead would run for a third term as mayor.  After winning the mayoral election in 2007, Goodman, like his counterpart Michael Bloomberg in New York City, looked into a means to change the city charter to remove term limits.Las Vegas SUN newspaper, January 9, 2009 In the absence of that change, Goodman fueled speculation that he might run as an Independent in the 2010 gubernatorial race against embattled incumbent, Republican Jim Gibbons, and the presumptive Democrat candidate, Rory Reid.Ball, Molly (2009-6-11), Goodman Eyes Race for Governor.

==Controversies==

===Ethics investigation===

In February 2004, Robert Rose, an ethics watchdog, filed a complaint with the Nevada Commission on Ethics claiming that during the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Goodman handed out to fellow mayors, conference attendees and other political figures invitations to a cocktail party Goodman was hosting.  Rose alleged that this was nothing more than the mayor abusing his power of office to help promote a business that is owned by his son, Ross Goodman, and Las Vegas Councilman Michael Mack. The Nevada Ethics Commission opened an investigation on April 14, 2004, and on May 13, 2004, the members of the commission found the mayor in ethics violations, although no fine was rendered. Goodman sued the commission and won; the commission's ruling was reversed by the court.
On September 16, 2004, Rose again filed a complaint with the Nevada Commission on Ethics, this time asking the commission to clarify Goodman's affiliation with his son Ross's law firm. In a statement, the mayor explained his name on the letterhead is a way of informing out of state law firms that Ross Goodman is his son. However, a person serving as an elected public official in Nevada may not have his name listed on a law firm letterhead, and Goodman removed his name under protest after several newspaper articles noted the infraction.[tpl]cite web|last=Richmond |first=Emily |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2006/jul/19/566625454.html |title=Stories published July 19, 2006Las Vegas Sun |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl]
On July 18, 2005 the Nevada Commission on Ethics concluded insufficient cause for a hearing and recommended the allegations be dismissed, clearing Goodman of the ethics complaint regarding his name listed as "Of Counsel" to Goodman Law Group.[tpl]cite web|last=Ryan |first=Cy |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/jul/28/state-ethics-panel-clears-goodman-on-complaint/ |title=State Ethics Panel Clears Goodman on Complaint published July 28, 2005Las Vegas Sun |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl]

===Remarks to schoolchildren===

On March 3, 2005, Goodman spoke to a group of fourth-graders at Jo Mackey Elementary School. When asked what he would take with him if marooned on a desert island, the mayor replied, "A bottle of Bombay Sapphire Gin." When asked about his hobbies, the mayor named drinking Bombay Sapphire Gin as a favorite. Later, when asked to comment about his statements, Goodman was unapologetic: "I'm the George Washington of mayors. I can't tell a lie. If they didn't want the answer, the kid shouldn't have asked the question." This caused an outcry from parents whose children heard the remark, and school officials said the remark was inappropriate.[tpl]cite web|last=Koch |first=Ed |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2005/mar/02/518378833.html |title=Stories published March 2, 2005 Las Vegas Sun |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Here's Looking at You, Kid |date=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-12   |agency=AP |newspaper=Wired |url=  http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/03/66789         [/tpl]

===Thumb amputation and caning===

On November 3, 2005, Mayor Goodman suggested that those who deface freeways with graffiti should have their thumbs cut off on television. Goodman, appearing on the "Nevada Newsmakers" TV show, said, "In the old days in France, they had beheading of people who commit heinous crimes", "You know, we have a beautiful highway landscaping redevelopment in our downtown. We have desert tortoises and beautiful paintings of flora and fauna. These punks come along and deface it", I'm saying maybe you put them on TV and cut off a thumb", and "That may be the right thing to do."
Goodman also suggested that whippings or canings should be brought back for children who get into trouble.
"I also believe in a little bit of corporal punishment going back to the days of yore, where examples have to be shown," Goodman said. "I'm dead serious. Some of these (children) don't learn. You have got to teach them a lesson, and this is coming from a criminal defense lawyer." But, he added, "they would get a trial first."

===Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas===

In July 2006 the mayor criticized the Ubisoft game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas for its premise of terrorism in Las Vegas, because he thought it may tarnish the city's image. He stated, "It's based on a false premise.... It could be harmful economically, and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech (protection).... I will ask... whether or not we can stop it."[tpl]cite web |url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/323342.html |title=What Happens in Vegas Stays in Rainbow Six ...maybe |accessdate=2006-12-31 |last=McCauley |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis McCauley |coauthors= |date=2006-07-13 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=GamePolitics.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Publication of the game has not been hindered.

===Legalized prostitution===

Currently, prostitution is legal in Nevada only in rural counties with fewer than 400,000 residents, a requirement which excludes Clark County and the city of Las Vegas from allowing the practice. Mayor Goodman supports legalizing prostitution in the city's downtown area as a revenue generator and tool for revitalization,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Oct-24-Fri-2003/news/22438503.html | title=LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION: Vegas brothels suggested | first=Erin | last=Neff | date=2003-10-24 | publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal | accessdate=2007-09-10 [/tpl] although a majority of Nevadans polled in 2003 opposed the mayor's position.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Oct-30-Thu-2003/news/22479540.html | title=Majority opposes legalizing prostitution in Las Vegas | first=Richard | last=Lake | date=2003-10-30 | publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal | accessdate=2007-09-10 [/tpl] Goodman's views on prostitution have been criticized by New York Times columnist Bob Herbert,[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/opinion/04herbert.html | title=City as Predator | first=Bob | last=Herbert | authorlink=Bob Herbert | date=2007-09-04 | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=2007-09-10 [/tpl] as well as Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/commentary/2007/sep/05/566672466.html | title=Jon Ralston thinks New York Times columnist Bob Herbert has a pretty good take on Goodman | first=Jon | last=Ralston | date=2007-09-05 | publisher=Las Vegas Sun | accessdate=2007-09-10 [/tpl]
