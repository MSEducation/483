Shawn McManus (born June 30, 1958, Brookline, Massachusetts) is an American artist who has worked extensively over three decades for DC Comics and other companies, notably for DC's Vertigo imprint, including the current Fables.

==Swamp Thing==

McManus entered the comic book field in the early 1980s with work for Heavy Metal and DC Comics. He gained wider attention when he illustrated two 1980s issues of Swamp Thing written by Alan Moore. He received a nomination, with Alan Moore, for a 1985 Jack Kirby Award for "Pog" in Swamp Thing 32. The story, an inventive science fictional reinterpretation of Walt Kelly's Pogo, was written by Moore specifically for McManus, who rose to the challenge with an appropriate Kellyesque art style.
McManus and Todd Klein collaborated on Omega Men, creating Zirral and other characters for that series. He has also drawn issues of Batman, Doctor Fate and a pair of limited series about the witch Thessaly written by Bill Willingham.

==Grains of Sandman==

Randy Lander reviewed the debut issue of The Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad:
McManus also drew most of A Game of You for Neil Gaiman's The Sandman, and his other Sandman credits include The Sandman Presents: Taller Tales, The Sandman Presents: Thessaly, Witch for Hire, The Sandman: Fables & Reflections. Other Vertigo titles by McManus include Winter's Edge 3.
His work on the Tom Strong series (America's Best Comics) includes Tom Strong's Terrific Tales 2 and Tom Strong 3. His story "Jenny Panic & the Bible of Dreams", scripted by Steve Aylett, was collected in the hardback Tom Strong Collected Edition, Book Five, edited by Scott Dunbier.
For the June 1983 issue of Heavy Metal he collaborated with Bhob Stewart and John Coffey on "Zenobia". Six months later, McManus and Stewart teamed with Jim McDermott on "Symbiosis", also in Heavy Metal (December, 1983).

==DC, Marvel and others==

McManus' artwork for Marvel Comics includes Peter Parker Spider-Man Annual '97 (1997) and Daredevil #351. In an interview with Kuljit Mithra, John Rozum, who scripted that issue of Daredevil, recalled:
McManus has contributed to titles from a variety of other publishers, including Atomeka Press (A1), Dark Horse (Cheval Noir), Exhibit A Press (Wolff & Byrd: Counselors of the Macabre), First Comics (Grimjack), Image (Supreme), Malibu (The Man Called A-X) and DC's Paradox Press (The Big Book of Freaks). He worked on Leah Moore and John Reppion's Wild Girl (Wildstorm, 2004â€“2005) with J.H. Williams III, about 13-year-old Rosa Torez who discovers that she can communicate with animals. At least one issue was inked by Andrew Pepoy, but for some issues McManus did all the penciling and inking. In 2006, he did a seven-issue run on Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis, the end of which marked the cancellation of the Aquaman ongoing series. He also drew The Creeper for DC at the same time.

==Children's art==

Writer-illustrator and lecturer Mark McKenna, creator of the Banana Tail children's book series, described his long association with McManus that led to their Banana Tail: The Early Years (2009) color print:

==Television==

In 1987, McManus worked on the animated series Dinosaucers. For the TV series Tales from the Crypt, McManus and Mike Vosburg illustrated comic book covers designed to look like the original 1950s comics. The McManus Crypt cover is seen in the first episode ("The Man Who Was Death").

==Fables==

More recently, he illustrated Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. This collection of the six-issue Vertigo mini-series was published in August 2010.

==Awards==

1985 Jack Kirby Award nomination (with Alan Moore) for Best Single Issue ("Pog" in Swamp Thing 32).
