Dubgall mac Somairle (Modern Dubhghall mac Somhairle; Anglicized: "Dugald" or "Dougal, Somerled's son") was a 12th-century Scottish nobleman. The son of Somairle mac Gille Brigte, regulus of Argyll, Dubgall is the eponymous progenitor of Clan MacDougall (Clann Dubhghaill, literally "Children of Dougal" or "Dubgall"). 
According to the Chronicles of Mann, in 1155 he accompanied his father Somairle in an expedition against Goraidh mac Amhlaibh, King of Mann and the Isles.Lawrie, Annals, p. 20. In 1175, he was one of the Scottish magnates accompanying King William the Lion to York.Lawrie, Annals, p. 204; Woolf, "Age of the Sea-Kings", p. 105. In the same year, he and his chaplain Stephan made a pilgrimage to St Cuthbert at Durham, donating two gold rings to the Cathedral Priory.Lawrie, Annals, p. 204. The Chronicles of Mann alleged that the men of the Isles chose Dubgall to be their King, but this may have been a later concoction, and Dubgall is never given a title in any contemporary source.Woolf, "Age of the Sea-Kings", p. 105. It has been suggested that he was the founder of the bishopric of Argyll,McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 212. though more likely this took place under his brother Ragnall.Woolf, "The Age of Sea-Kings", pp. 105-6.
It is not known when Dubgall died. Dubgall is not mentioned again after 1175, but may have lived long afterwards, perhaps even into the 13th century.McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 73. He appears to have had the following sons, 
The last is uncertain. Gille Escoib appears in Haakon's Saga, which renders his name "Uspak", as a son of Dubgall upon whom is conferred the royal name Haakon; "Uspak" enjoyed a successful career, but it is not entirely certain that the Dubgall referred as his father is Dubgall mac Somairle.McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 89.
