==Naming and usage==

Although the island has been known as the North Island for many years,On some 19th-century maps, the North Island is named New Ulster, which was also a province of New Zealand that included the North Island. in 2009 the New Zealand Geographic Board found that, along with the South Island, the North Island had no official name.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/about-geographic-board/nzgb-news-notices/2009/0421-alternative-maori-names |title= The New Zealand Geographic Board Considers North and South Island Names |date=21 April 2009 |publisher=Land Information New Zealand |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] After a public consultation, the board officially named the island North Island or Te Ika-a-Maui in October 2013.[tpl]cite news|title=Two official options for NZ island names|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11138153|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=10 October 2013|date=10 October 2013[/tpl]
In prose, the two main islands of New Zealand are called the North Island and the South Island, with the definite articles. It is normal to use the preposition in rather than on, for example "Hamilton is in the North Island", "my mother lives in the North Island". Maps, headings, tables and adjectival expressions use North Island without the.

==Māori mythology==

According to Māori mythology, the North and South Islands of New Zealand arose through the actions of the demigod Māui. Māui and his brothers were fishing from their canoe (the South Island) when he caught a great fish and pulled it from the sea. While he was not looking his brothers fought over the fish and chopped it up. This great fish became the North Island and thus a Māori name for the North Island is Te Ika-a-Māui (The Fish of Māui). The mountains and valleys are believed to have been formed as a result of Māui's brothers' hacking at the fish. Until the early 20th Century, an alternative Māori name for the North Island was Aotearoa. In present Māori usage, Aotearoa is a collective name for New Zealand as a whole.

==Economy==

The sub-national GDP of the North Island was estimated at US$102.863 billion in 2003, 79% of New Zealand's national GDP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010[/tpl]
