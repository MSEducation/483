==History==

Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin visited for the first time Denmark in 1907, for a party meeting of Russian socialists in exile. Denmark deemed the meeting illegal and gave Lenin 12 hours to leave Denmark. In 1910, Lenin visited Denmark again, for the Eighth International Socialist Congress. Lenin later commented on the Danish socialism and the Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning; "Stauning was a quasi-socialist as well as one of the most stingy and mean-spirited class snobs he had ever met."[tpl]cite news|title=A government of lost turtles: Lenin in Denmark|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/culture/denmark-through-the-looking-glass/171-denmark-through-the-looking-glass/47726--a-government-of-lost-turtles-lenin-in-denmark.html|accessdate=11 September 2011|newspaper=Copenhagen Post|date=10 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Da Lenin var i København|url=http://www.historie-online.dk/nyt/lenin-i-koebenhavn.htm|accessdate=11 September 2011|language=Danish|trans_title= When Lenin was in Denmark[/tpl]
