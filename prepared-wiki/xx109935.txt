Bai Mudan ([tpl]zh|c=白牡丹|l=white peony[/tpl]) is a type of white tea made from plucks each with one leaf shoot and two immediate young leaves.陳宗懋, 中國茶經, pp 236 上海文化出版社 ISBN 7-80511-499-4 Bai Mudan is sometimes preferred by white tea drinkers for its fuller flavor and greater potency than the other major type of white tea, Bai Hao Yinzhen. The latter is made purely with leaf shoots, and so it is comparatively softer and more subtle. The typical taste of Bai Mudan is a result of both the processing and the tea plant cultivars employed in the production.[tpl]cite web | author=Tea Guardian | title=White & Other Lightly Oxidized Teas | url=http://teaguardian.com/nature_of_tea/whites.html | accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]

==Production Processing==

The family of tea cultivars used in producing Bai Mudan are the "Dai Bai" varieties. In eastern Fujian, the cultivar Fuding Dai Bai is used. In northern Fujian, the Zhenghe Dai Bai cultivar is used. The differences in the plant yield two distinct styles of Bai Mudan: the Fuding variety and the Zhenghe variety.[tpl]cite web | author=Tea Guardian | title=Lightly Oxidized: White Teas: White Peony | url=http://teaguardian.com/Tea_Varieties/white_baimudan.html | accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]
Genuine Bai Mudan is a white tea, therefore, it is a slightly oxidized tea. The plucks are sun-withered for an extended period of time and then piled briefly for oxidation, during which enzymes of the tealeaves interact with other constituents to form new materials that result in the final taste and aroma character of the tea. Depending on the weather, conditions of the pluck and the taste style requirements of the finished products, the sunning may last between 1 to 3 days and the piling between half and 3 hours.袁弟順, 中國白茶, 廈門大學出版社 ISBN756152506
The leaves are then baked to dry for packing. It is important to note that the handling of the leaves remains gentle and non-intrusive throughout the process to avoid breaking of the cell structure. This is needed because once the cell walls are physically broken, oxidation of the leaves quickens and the quality will be compromised.
Although the processing steps are simpler than those for other teas, the long process and the variable factors during which are key cost factors. For example, a sudden rainstorm during the lengthy withering can be destructive.

==Tasting and brewing==

You will notice a very mild peony aroma when brewing the tea and a floral aroma, the tea is best brewed with good mineral water and at 70°C to 80°C (158°F to 176°F). The brew is a very pale green or golden color. The flavor is fruity; stronger than Silver Needle, yet not as strong as Shou Mei. The finest quality should have a shimmering clear infusion with a delicate lingering fragrance and a fresh, mellow, sweet taste devoid of astringency, and grassy flavors.
