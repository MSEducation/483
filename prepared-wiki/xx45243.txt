[[Tomme de Savoie]]

CATEGORIES: French cheeses, Cow's-milk cheeses

Tomme de Savoie is a variety of Tomme cheese from Savoie in the French Alps. It is a mild, semi-firm cow's milk cheese with a beige interior and a thick brownish-grey rind.
Tomme de Savoie, like most Tommes, is usually made from the skim milk left over after the cream is used to make butter or richer cheeses. As a result, the cheese has a relatively low fat content (between 20 and 45%). The cheese is made year-round, and typically has a slightly different character depending on whether the cows are fed on winter hay or summer grass.
The cheese normally comes in discs approximately [tpl]convert|18|cm|in[/tpl] across, [tpl]convert|5|-|8|cm|in[/tpl] in thickness, and weighing between [tpl]convert|1|and|2|kg|lb[/tpl]. It is first pressed, and then matured for several months in a traditional cellar, which produces the characteristically thick rind and adds flavor.
