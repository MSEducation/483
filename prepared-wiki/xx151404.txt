==Board of trustees==

An elected Board of Trustees is responsible for the overall governance of the College.  Trustees are elected for different six-year terms by public election across District 514.
In addition to the elected trustees, there is a Student Trustee, as required by a 1974 amendment to the Public Community College Act.  Student Trustees are elected by campus referendum, for a single term from April 15 to April 14.  Student Trustees have the right to make and second board motions, and to attend closed sessions to which the general public is not privy.  A Student Trustee's vote is advisory and non-binding.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.icc.edu/eLibrary/Board%20of%20Trustees%20-%20Trustee%20Handbook.pdf | title = Board of Trustees Student Representative 2009–2010 Manual | publisher = Illinois Central College | location = East Peoria, Illinois | date = 2010-01-15 | accessdate = 2011-01-19 [/tpl]
