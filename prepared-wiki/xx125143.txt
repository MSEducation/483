CATEGORIES: Villages in North Yorkshire

Forcett is a village in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England, near the border with County Durham. It lies on the B6274 road about 8 miles south of Staindrop. Nearby villages include Eppleby, Caldwell and Aldbrough.
In 1367, the manor was granted to Sir Walter Urswyk by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, Earl of Richmond, for Urswyk's valour at the Battle of Navarretta during the Hundred Years' War.  Urswyk was later High Constable of Richmond Castle and Master Forester of the Forest of Bowland. 
On the edge of the village is Forcett Park in which stands Forcett Hall, a Palladian country house rebuilt in 1740.
