Code talkers were people who used obscure languages as a means of secret communication during wartime.  The term is now usually associated with the United States soldiers during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native-American languages as a basis to transmit coded messages. In particular, there were approximately 400–500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages. Code talkers transmitted these messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formal or informally developed codes built upon their native languages. Their service improved communications in terms of speed of encryption at both ends in front line operations during World War II.
The name code talkers is strongly associated with bilingual Navajo speakers specially recruited during World War II by the Marines to serve in their standard communications units in the Pacific Theater. Code talking, however, was pioneered by Choctaw Indians serving in the U.S. Army during World War I. These soldiers are referred to as Choctaw code talkers.
Other Native American code talkers were deployed by the United States Army during World War II, including Cherokee, Choctaw, Lakota,Last Lakota code talker Clarence Wolf Guts dies at 86 Rapid City Journal. Rapid City, SD: June 18, 2010. Meskwaki, and Comanche soldiers. Soldiers of Basque ancestry were also used for code talking by the U.S. Marines during World War II in areas where other Basque speakers were not expected to be operating.

==Cherokee code talkers==

The first known use of Native Americans in the American military to transmit messages under fire was a group of Cherokee troops utilized by the American 30th Infantry Division serving alongside the British during the Second Battle of the Somme. According to the Division Signal Officer, this took place in September 1918. Their unit was under British command at the time.Stanley, Captain John W. Personal Experience of a Battalion Commander and Brigade Signal Officer, 105th Field Signal Battalion in the Somme Offensive, September 29 – October 8, 1997. U.S. Army, 1932.

==Choctaw code talkers==

In the days of World War I, company commander Captain Lawrence of the U.S. Army overheard Solomon Louis and Mitchell Bobb conversing in the Choctaw language. He found eight Choctaw men in the battalion. Eventually, fourteen Choctaw men in the Army's 36th Infantry Division trained to use their language in code. They helped the American Expeditionary Forces win several key battles in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France, during the final big German push of the war. Within 24 hours after the Choctaw language was pressed into service, the tide of the battle had turned.  In less than 72 hours the Germans were retreating and the Allies were in full attack.
These soldiers are now known as the Choctaw code talkers.

==Comanche code talkers==

Adolf Hitler knew about the successful use of code talkers during World War I. He sent a team of some thirty anthropologists to learn Native American languages before the outbreak of World War II.NSA Code Talker Exhibit[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] However, it proved too difficult for them to learn the many languages and dialects that existed. Because of Nazi German anthropologists' attempts to learn the languages, the U.S. Army did not implement a large-scale code talker program in the European Theater. Fourteen Comanche code talkers took part in the Invasion of Normandy, and continued to serve in the 4th Infantry Division during further European operations. Comanches of the 4th Signal Company compiled a vocabulary of over 100 code terms using words or phrases in their own language. Using a substitution method similar to the Navajo, the Comanche code word for tank was "turtle", bomber was "pregnant airplane", machine gun was "sewing machine" and Adolf Hitler became "crazy white man".Army History Research: 124th Signal Battalion Matthew J. Seelinger[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Two Comanche code-talkers were assigned to each regiment, the rest to 4th Infantry Division headquarters. Shortly after landing on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, the Comanches began transmitting messages. Some were wounded but none killed.
In 1989, the French government awarded the Comanche code-talkers the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit. On November 30, 1999, the United States Department of Defense presented Charles Chibitty with the Knowlton Award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/25/AR2005072501542.html |title=Comanche Code Talker Charles Chibitty Dies |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl]

==Meskwaki code talkers==

Meskwaki men used their language against the Germans in North Africa. Twenty-seven Meskwaki, then 16% of Iowa's Meskwaki population, enlisted in the U.S. Army together in January 1941.

==Basque code talkers==

Captain Frank D. Carranza conceived the idea of using the Basque language for codes in May 1942 upon meeting about 60 U.S. Marines of Basque ancestry in a San Francisco camp."Egon arretaz egunari", Xabier G. Argüello, El País, August 1, 2004.La orden de desembarco en Guadalcanal se dió en vascuence para que no lo descubrieran los nipones, Juan Hernani, El Diario Vasco, December 26, 1952, it quotes Revista general de marina. Bibliographic reference in Euskomedia.orgLos vascos y la II Guerra Mundial, Mikel Rodríguez, Euskonews & Media 301.  His superiors were wary. There were 35 Basque Jesuits in Hiroshima, led by Pedro Arrupe. In China and the Philippines, there was a colony of Basque jai alai players and there were Basque supporters of Falange in Asia. The American Basque code talkers were kept from these theaters; they were initially used in tests and in transmitting logistic information for Hawaii and Australia.
On August 1, 1942, Lieutenants Nemesio Aguirre, Fernández Bakaicoa and Juanna received a Basque-coded message from San Diego for Admiral Chester Nimitz warning him of the upcoming Operation Apple to remove the Japanese from the Solomon Islands. They also translated the start date, August 7, for the attack on Guadalcanal. As the war extended over the Pacific, there was a shortage of Basque speakers and the parallel Navajo program came to be preferred.

==Navajo code talkers==

Philip Johnston, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles,[tpl]cite book|last=Holm|first=Tom|title=Code Talkers and Warriors|publisher=Chelsea House Pub|year=2007|accessdate=November 28, 2012|authorlink=Tom Holm|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G037twAACAAJ|isbn=0791093409[/tpl] proposed the use of Navajo to the United States Marine Corps at the beginning of World War II. Johnston, a World War I veteran, was raised on the Navajo reservation as the son of a missionary to the Navajos, and was one of the few non-Navajos who spoke their language fluently. Because Navajo has a complex grammar, it is not nearly mutually intelligible enough with even its closest relatives within the Na-Dene family to provide meaningful information, and was at this time an unwritten language, Johnston saw Navajo as answering the military requirement for an undecipherable code.  Navajo was spoken only on the Navajo lands of the American Southwest, and its syntax and tonal qualities, not to mention dialects, made it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. One estimate indicates that at the outbreak of World War II fewer than 30 non-Navajos could understand the language.[tpl]cite web|last=Vogel|first=Clayton|title=Letter to Commandant, USMC|url=http://archive.library.nau.edu/u?/cpa,44718|work=Demonstration in California, 1942|publisher=Northern Arizona University, Cline Library|accessdate=July 20, 2011|author2=Johnston, Philip|authorlink2=Philip Johnston (code talker)[/tpl]
Early in 1942, Johnston met with Major General Clayton B. Vogel, the commanding general of Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, and his staff. Johnston staged tests under simulated combat conditions which demonstrated that Navajos could encode, transmit, and decode a three-line English message in 20 seconds, versus the 30 minutes required by machines at that time. The idea was accepted, with Vogel recommending that the Marines recruit 200 Navajos. The first 29 Navajo recruits attended boot camp in May 1942. This first group then created the Navajo code at Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq61-2.htm |title=NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER, Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet |publisher=History.navy.mil |date=1992-09-17 |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl] The Navajo code was formally developed and modeled on the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet that uses agreed-upon English words to represent letters. As it was determined that phonetically spelling out all military terms letter by letter into words—while in combat—would be too time consuming, some terms, concepts, tactics and instruments of modern warfare were given uniquely formal descriptive nomenclatures in Navajo (the word for "potato" being used to refer to a hand grenade, or "turtle" to a tank, for example). Several of these portmanteaus (such as gofasters referring to running shoes, ink sticks for pens) entered Marine Corps vocabulary and are commonly used today to refer to the appropriate objects.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
A codebook was developed to teach the many relevant words and concepts to new initiates.  The text was for classroom purposes only, and was never to be taken into the field. The code talkers memorized all these variations and practiced their rapid use under stressful conditions during training. Uninitiated Navajo speakers would have no idea what the code talkers' messages meant; they would hear only truncated and disjointed strings of individual, unrelated nouns and verbs.
The Navajo code talkers were commended for their skill, speed, and accuracy accrued throughout the war. At the Battle of Iwo Jima, Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, had six Navajo code talkers working around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, "Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima."
As the war progressed, additional code words were added on and incorporated program-wide.  In other instances, informal short-cut code words were devised for a particular campaign and not disseminated beyond the area of operation. To ensure a consistent use of code terminologies throughout the Pacific Theater, representative code talkers of each of the U.S. Marine divisions met in Hawaii to discuss shortcomings in the code, incorporate new terms into the system, and update their codebooks. These representatives in turn trained other code talkers who could not attend the meeting. For example, the Navajo word for buzzard, [tpl]spell-nv|jeeshóóʼ[/tpl], was used for bomber, while the code word used for submarine, [tpl]spell-nv|béésh łóóʼ[/tpl], meant iron fish in Navajo.[tpl]cite news |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |title=Joe Morris Sr. dies at 85; Navajo code talker during World War II |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-joe-morris-20110722,0,3839149,full.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl]
The deployment of the Navajo code talkers continued through the Korean War and after, until it was ended early in the Vietnam War.

==Seminole code talkers==

The last surviving Seminole code talker, Edmond Harjo of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, died on March 31, 2014, at the age of 96.[tpl]cite news|first=Dana |last=Attocknie |title=Last living Seminole Code Talker walks on, loved ones pay respects, honor hero  |url=http://www.nativetimes.com/index.php/life/people/9747-last-living-seminole-code-talker-walks-on-loved-ones-pay-respects-honor-hero |work=Native American Times |publisher= |date=2014-04-07 |accessdate=2014-04-27[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=|last=|title=Seminole code talker Edmond Harjo dies at 96 |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/seminole-code-talker-edmond-harjo-dies-at/article_6d65c407-10e8-56ae-ab96-aaa1b3b3a29f.html |work=Tulsa World |publisher= |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-04-27[/tpl] Harjo had served as far afield as Normandy and the Battle of Iwo Jima during the war. His biography was recounted by Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony honoring Harjo and other code talkers at the U.S. Capitol on November 20, 2013.[tpl]cite news|first=Dick|last=Peterson |title= Treasury and Mint Join Congress to Honor Native American Code Talkers  |url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Treasury-and-Mint-Join-Congress-to-Honor-Native-American-Code-Talkers-.aspx |work=United States Department of the Treasury |publisher= |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-04-27[/tpl]

==Cryptographic properties==

Non-speakers would find it extremely difficult to accurately distinguish unfamiliar sounds used in these languages. Additionally, a speaker who has acquired a language during their childhood sounds distinctly different from a person who acquired the same language in later life, thus reducing the chance of successful impostors sending false messages. Finally, the additional layer of an alphabet cypher was added to prevent interception by native speakers not trained as code talkers, in the event of their capture by the Japanese. A similar system employing Welsh was used by British forces, but not to any great extent during World War II.  Welsh was used more recently in the Balkan peace-keeping efforts for non-vital messages.[tpl]Cite news| last = Heath | first = Tony | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/welsh-speak-up-for-their-ancient-tongue-1311562.html| title = Welsh speak up for their ancient tongue|work = The Independent | page = 6 | date = 1996-08-26[/tpl] 
Navajo was an attractive choice for code use because few people outside the Navajo themselves had ever learned to speak the language.  Virtually no books in Navajo had ever been published.  Outside of the language itself, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards and would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers worked together effectively. The Japanese had an opportunity to attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code talker, was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages made no sense to him. When he reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yvwiiusdinvnohii.net/articles/navcode.htm |title="The People's Paths home page: How Effective Was Navajo Code? One Former Captive Knows" |publisher=Yvwiiusdinvnohii.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl] Given the simplicity of the alphabet code involved, it is probable that the code could have been broken easily if Kieyoomia's knowledge of the language had been exploited more effectively by Japanese cryptographers. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.

==Post-war recognition==

The code talkers received no recognition until the declassification of the operation in 1968.[tpl]cite news |first=Felicia |last=Fonseca|title=Navajo Code Talker dead at age 82 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/obituaries/ci_8232269 |agency=Associated Press |work=The Denver Post |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080330130935/http://www.denverpost.com/obituaries/ci_8232269  |archivedate = March 30, 2008[/tpl] In 1982, the code talkers were given a Certificate of Recognition by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who also named August 14, 1982 "Navajo Code Talkers Day".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapahie.com/Navajo_Reagan.cfm |title=National Navaho Code Talkers Day |publisher=Lapahie.com |date=1982-08-14 |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/navajo-code-talkers/index.html |title=Navajo Code Talkers and the Unbreakable Code — Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl]
On December 21, 2000 the U.S. Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, Public Law 106-554, 114 Statute 2763, which awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the original twenty-nine World War II Navajo code talkers, and Silver Medals to each person who qualified as a Navajo code talker (approximately 300). In July 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush personally presented the Medal to four surviving original code talkers (the fifth living original code talker was not able to attend) at a ceremony held in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, DC. Gold medals were presented to the families of the 24 original code talkers no longer living.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.america.gov/st/peopleplace-english/2001/July/20080512115719tbyarg0.9792292.html|title = Bush Presents Congressional Gold Medals to Navajo Code Talkers|accessdate =November 6, 2007|last = Gray|first = Butler|date= October 6, 2005|publisher = America.gov[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ554/pdf/PLAW-106publ554.pdf |title=P.L. 106-554, see 114 STAT. 2763A–311 |publisher=gpo.gov |accessdate=2012-09-09[/tpl]
