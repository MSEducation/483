[[Acceptance sampling]]

CATEGORIES: Quality control tools, Sampling (statistics)

Acceptance sampling  uses statistical sampling to determine whether to accept or reject a production lot of material.  It has been a common quality control technique used in industry. It is usually done as products leave the factory, or in some cases even within the factory. Most often a producer supplies a consumer a number of items and a decision to accept or reject the lot is made by determining the number of defective items in a sample from the lot. The lot is accepted if the number of defects falls below where the acceptance number or otherwise the lot is rejected.[tpl]cite book |title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 9th Edition |last=Kreyszig |first=Erwin  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-471-48885-9 |page= |pages=1248 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
A wide variety of acceptance sampling plans are available.

==History==

Acceptance sampling procedures became common during WWII. Sampling plans, such as MIL-STD-105, were developed by Harold F. Dodge and others and became frequently used as standards.  
More recently, quality assurance broadened the scope beyond final inspection  to include all aspects of manufacturing. Broader quality management systems include  methodologies such as statistical process control, HACCP, six sigma, and ISO 9000. Some use of acceptance sampling still remains.

==Rationale==

Sampling provides one rational means of verification that a production lot conforms with the requirements of technical specifications. 100% inspection does not guarantee 100% compliance and is too time consuming and costly.  Rather than evaluating all items, a specified sample is taken, inspected or tested, and a decision is made about accepting or rejecting the entire production lot.  
Plans have known risks: an acceptable quality limit (AQL) and a rejectable quality level (LTDP) are part of the operating characteristic curve of the sampling plan.  These are primarily statistical risks and do not necessarily imply that defective product is intentionally being made or accepted.  Plans can have a known average outgoing quality limit (AOQL).

==Acceptance sampling for attributes==

MIL-STD-105 was a United States defense standard that provided procedures and tables for sampling by attributes (pass or fail characteristic). MIL-STD-105E was cancelled in 1995 but is available in related documents such as ANSI/ASQ Z1.4, "Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes". Several levels of inspection are provided and can be indexed to several AQLs. The sample size is specified and the basis for acceptance or rejection (number of defects) is provided.

==Variables plans==

When a measured characteristic produces a number, other sampling plans such as those based on MIL-STD-414 are often used.  Compared with attribute sampling plans, these often use a smaller sample size for the same indexed AQL.
