Habranthus tubispathus is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is a perennial bulb native to southern South America (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay). It is widely cultivated as an ornamental and reportedly naturalized in the southeastern United States (Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida), much of the West Indies as well as Bermuda, eastern Mexico, India, Easter Island, and central Chile.[tpl]Citation |last=Mathew |first=Brian |year=1987 |title=The Smaller Bulbs |publication-place=London |publisher=B.T.

==Description==

Flowers are produced sporadically during late summer and autumn, singly on stems [tpl]convert|10|to|20|cm|in|0[/tpl] tall. Flowers are usually yellow with copper tones on the outside, with tepals about [tpl]convert|3|cm|in|1[/tpl] long, fused for a short distance at the base to form a tube. As with all Habranthus species, the flowers are not upright on the stem but held at a slight angle. The leaves are not normally present at flowering time, appearing later; they are narrowly linear.

==Cultivation==

Habranthus tubispathus tolerates some frost if planted in sheltered sunny position. It seeds freely. A form with pinkish flowers is grown as H. tubispathus var. roseus, but may be a hybrid.
H. tubispathus has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
The synonym H. andersonii is commonly found in horticultural sources.
