[[Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor]]

CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1945 for the famous Liberal politician David Lloyd George. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1908 to 1915 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1922. Lloyd George was made Viscount Gwynedd, of Dwyfor in the County of Caernarvon, at the same time as he was given the earldom. This title is also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Under the rules governing titles within the peerage, Lloyd George's name in his title was hyphenated but not in his surname, similar to that of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber. 
As of August 2010, the titles are held by his great-grandson, the fourth Earl, who succeeded his father.
Two of Lloyd George's children also gained distinction. His second son the Hon. Gwilym Lloyd George was Home Secretary from 1954 to 1957 and was created Viscount Tenby in 1957. His daughter Megan Lloyd George represented Anglesey and Carmarthen in the House of Commons.  
Both Gwynedd and Dwyfor are ancient Welsh language placenames.  Their use in the titles was prior to their revival in 1974 for a local government county and district, respectively.
Residence address, Greystoke, Criccieth, Wales.
