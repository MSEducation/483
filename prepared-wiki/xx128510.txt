WNAS (88.1 FM) is the student-run high school radio station of New Albany High School and Floyd Central High School in southern Indiana, (along with WNAS-TV). The station's call letters, WNAS, reflect the ownership by New Albany High School. The first FM student-run high school radio station to be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), WNAS has been broadcasting live since May 1949.

==Management==

Lee Kelly has served as the general manager since 1973. Tim Dench is the Radio/TV teacher for Floyd Central High School and is in charge of Floyd Central on WNAS radio. Kelly announced his retirement in the 2012-2013 school year. Jason Flener, former assistant principal for NAHS, replaced Kelly beginning in the 2013-2014 school year.

==Programming==

WNAS can be picked up throughout all of the Louisville Metro area and is known for its eclectic programming. The station broadcasts music 24 hours a day and also covers boys and girls basketball, football, baseball and volleyball for both New Albany and Floyd Central. The station provides streaming audio from its website.

==Television==

WNAS also occupies a cable television channel on which local-interest interviews are conducted, as well as game show contest for elementary school students: Spellbound, Math-a-Thon, and Challenge.  Other highlights of the television station are the annual spelling bee and Floyd County election coverage (both of which are also carried on the radio station).

==Studio==

Recently, Floyd Central completed a renovation of its entire studios, both TV and radio. These studios are considered by many local TV and radio personalities to be better than their own. Sarah Jordan of 99.7 WDJX even told students at Floyd Central, "Become a part of the Radio/TV program because the stuff you all are using is a lot better than what I have."[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl]
