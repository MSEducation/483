Punk Rock Songs (The Epic Years) is a compilation album by Bad Religion, released in 2002.
Spanning the years from 1994 to 2000, this is a collection of the biggest hits and some live tracks from their Atlantic and Epic Records era, therefore it does not contain any songs from Bad Religion's first seven full-length albums, or their then-current album The Process of Belief.
The compilation was released by Epic Records without any input from the band members, as Bad Religion had already returned to Epitaph Records. It has never been released in the United States.
