Hubba Bubba is a brand of bubble gum originally produced by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/hubba-bubba.aspx | title=Hubba Bubba | publisher=Wrigley.com | accessdate=June 8, 2012[/tpl] in the United States in 1979 but more recently produced in countries around the world. The bubble gum got its name by the phrase "Hubba Hubba" that World War II soldiers used to express approval.http://www.oldtimecandy.com/hubba-bubba-gum.htm  The main gimmick used to promote the gum is that Hubba Bubba is less sticky than other brands of bubble gum and so burst bubbles are easier to peel from your skin. The first portions of Hubba Bubba were  produced in the traditional bubble gum flavor often referred to as Original, but different flavors of gum have been produced around the world. Many, but not all, of these flavors are  based on fruit. Hubba Bubba products also include many flavors of soda, bubble gum and squeeze pouches.

==Product description==

Before its launch, Hubba Bubba had been referred to as "Stagecoach" during product development and early manufacturing at the now-defunct Wrigley plant in Santa Cruz, California. The earliest series of TV commercials for Hubba Bubba that aired in the United States were set in a Wild West town and featured a character known as the Gumfighter, played by actor Don Collier. At the end of each commercial, the Gum Fighter declared, "Big bubbles, no troubles," followed by a jocular response from Western film veteran Dub Taylor.Hubba Bubba TV Commercial This was a reference to Hubba Bubba being less sticky than other brands.
