"Sing Sang Song" was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976, performed in German by the Les Humphries Singers. 
The Les Humphries Singers had had a series of hits Continental Europe and Scandinavia in the early 70s, most notably "Mexico" (1972) and "Mama Loo" (1973). The group's usual line-ups consisted of 20 performers and up from all over the world. For their performance in Eurovision they were however reduced to six singers; two female and four male. 
"Sing Sang Song" was composed by Eurovision veteran Ralph Siegel, who had made his debut in the 1974 Contest when he wrote Ireen Sheer's "Bye Bye I Love You", representing Luxembourg, this was however his first entry for his native Germany. 
The song was performed third on the night, following Switzerland's Peter, Sue and Marc with "Djambo, Djambo" and preceding Israel's Chocolat, Menta, Mastik with "Emor Shalom". At the close of voting, it had received 12 points, placing 15th in a field of 18.
The song consists largely of the title being repeated, however the other lyrics are a plea for global unity - to be provided by singing the song.
"Sing Sang Song" was only a modest commercial success for the Les Humphries Singers, and in late 1976 the group disbanded.
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1977 Contest by Silver Convention with "Telegram".
