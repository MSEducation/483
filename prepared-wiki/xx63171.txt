Buxales is a botanical name at the rank of order.  

Buxales is an order of eudicot flowering plants which includes two families, Buxaceae and Haptanthaceae, recognized by the APG III system of 2009. APG III, unlike previous classifications, does not recognize Didymelaceae but includes the genus Didymeles in Buxaceae.[tpl]Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105â€“121 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract |accessdate=2010-12-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x [/tpl]
Under the APG II system, Buxaceae is a family unplaced as to order in the eudicots. This family may optionally include the genus Didymeles, which in Cronquist system was given its own family and order, placed in subclass Hamamelidae. APG II allows the option of continuing treating Didymeles as a family of its own. In addition, APG II mentioned the possibility that in a future version of the system the family Buxaceae might be elevated to ordinal status. In that case Buxales Takht. ex Reveal (1996) could become an order of one to two families. This name is so used by the AP-Website. This was later confirmed by the APG III system of 2009.
