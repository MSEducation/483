"Bad Girls" is a 1979 single released by American singer Donna Summer, co-written by Summer and the Brooklyn Dreams. The inspiration for her to write the song came after one of her assistants was offended by a police officer who thought she was a street prostitute.
A rough version of the song had originally been written a couple of years before its release. Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart, upon hearing it, wanted Donna to give it to Cher for her upcoming album.[tpl]cite book |title=Ordinary Girl: The Journey |last=Summer |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Summer |author2=Marc Eliot |year=2003 |publisher=Villard |location=New York |isbn=1400060311 |page=172[/tpl] Donna refused and put it away for a couple of years.
The song became a number-one hit on the Billboard pop, R&B and dance singles charts simultaneously becoming, alongside "Hot Stuff", her most successful single. Bad Girls the single, spent 5 weeks on the top of the "Hot 100 chart" and sold over 2 millions copies in the US.
