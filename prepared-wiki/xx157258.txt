Originally constructed in 1974 for the IBA for its local radio contractor, Piccadilly Radio, located at 
This facility is still used for transmitting Piccadilly Magic 1152 on 1152 kHz. It uses a directional antenna consisting of 4 guyed masts, insulated against ground. This antenna has a maximum output toward 250°. In this direction the ERP is 1.5 kW, whereby the transmitter output is 350 Watts.
The antenna of this transmitter has therefore a highly directional pattern, in order not to interfere with other nearby transmitters on the same frequency.
Additionally, Asian Sound operates from this site on 1377 kHz 
It is designated "Ashton Moss (East) MF" by owners Arqiva

The stations were constructed and owned by the BBC and IBA as indicated above. Over time, (1974-2007), by a series of asset sell offs, and mergers, both sites are now owned and operated by Arqiva
