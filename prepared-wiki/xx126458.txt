The team was compose primarily of young, ex-college players with their first chance at professional play.  Player assistant coach Mike Garrett had played in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) and was named the head coach midway through year two with the team in last place.  Garrett led the team to a turnaround  as they won most of their remaining games and made the playoffs.
