The 1996 U.S. Open was the 96th U.S. Open, held June 13â€“16 at Oakland Hills Country Club in Birmingham, Michigan, a suburb northwest of Detroit. Steve Jones won his only major title, one stroke ahead of runners-up Tom Lehman and Davis Love III.[tpl]cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008288/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=Dear Mr. Hogan, |last=Reilly |first=Rick |authorlink=Rick Reilly |date=June 24, 1996 |page=38[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=htNRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zW8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6263%2C1913955 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |last=Parascenzo |first=Marino |title=Steve who? |date=June 17, 1996 |page=B-1 [/tpl]
Jones went through an incredible journey just to get to Oakland Hills. He had won four PGA Tour events, the last in 1989, but in November 1991 he was involved in a dirt bike accident that threatened to end his career. He separated his shoulder and sprained an ankle, as well as suffering ligament damage in his index finger. Jones was sidelined for three years, not making it back on tour until 1994. His win here came in his first U.S. Open since 1991, and he was the first champion to go through sectional qualifying since tour rookie Jerry Pate in 1976. After this win, Jones won three more times on tour.
This was the eighth major championship at the South Course, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, and 1985, and the PGA Championship in 1972 and 1979.  It later hosted the PGA Championship in 2008.

Lehman, the leader after 54 holes, led Jones by three going to the back-nine in the final round. He relinquished the lead, however, with bogeys at 10 and 12. At the 18th, he drove into a bunker and missed a [tpl]convert|15|ft|sing=on[/tpl] putt to save par. Love made a charge on the last day, recording birdies at 11, 12, and 15. But he bogeyed the final two holes, missing a 3-footer for par at the last. Jones, unlike Lehman and Love, did not bogey the last. Tied with Lehman and playing in the same group, he hit his approach to [tpl]convert|12|ft[/tpl] and two-putted for par from there to prevail by one.
Amateurs: Leen (+11), Kuehne (+13), Woods (+14), Scott (+21)
