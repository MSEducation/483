He is the first person in the line of succession to the British throne who is not a descendant of King George V. As a cognatic great-grandson of a British sovereign, he does not carry out royal and official duties or receive any funds from the Civil List. The Duke of Fife is the second cousin to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Harald V of Norway.  Through his maternal grandfather, he is also a descendant of William IV of the United Kingdom and his mistress Dorothea Jordan, and a distant cousin of David Cameron.

==Early life==

The Duke is the only son of the 11th Earl of Southesk (1893–1992) and his wife, Princess Maud of Fife (1893–1945), the younger daughter of the 1st Duke of Fife and Louise, Princess Royal.
The Duke was educated at Ludgrove, Gordonstoun School, and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. He served with the Scots Guards in Malaya in 1948–50. He served as vice patron of the Braemar Royal Highland Society and of the British Olympic Association.

==Duke of Fife==

The Dukedom of Fife was first granted to the Duke's grandfather, the 6th Earl Fife, in 1889 by Queen Victoria upon his marriage to Princess Louise of Wales, the eldest daughter of The Prince of Wales. The 1st Duke of Fife received a fresh patent as Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in April 1900, with special remainder to his daughters by Princess Louise and their male issue. As the Duke and Princess Louise only had two surviving daughters, the title went to Princess Alexandra of Fife (later Princess Arthur of Connaught).
On 26 February 1959, he succeeded his maternal aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife, as the 3rd Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff (Princess Arthur's only child, Alastair, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, had predeceased her).
He succeeded his father as 12th Earl of Southesk, as well as chief of the Clan Carnegie, on 16 February 1992.
He lives at the family estate Elsick House, near Stonehaven in Kincardineshire.

==Marriage==

On 11 September 1956, the then Lord Carnegie married The Hon. Caroline Dewar (born 12 February 1934), the elder daughter of the 3rd Baron Forteviot. They divorced in 1966.
The marriage produced three children:thePeerage.com http://www.thepeerage.com/p10160.htm#i101598
