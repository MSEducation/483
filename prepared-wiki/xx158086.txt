Male choir Amici Cantus was founded in 1983 in Helsinki, Finland. The choir's repertoire contains both sacred and secular music, with main emphasis on Finnish music.  Amici Cantus has recorded a collection of male choir songs from both Leevi Madetoja (1987) and Selim Palmgren (1990), and has also put out a complete collection of Einojuhani Rautavaaraâ€™s unaccompanied male choir repertoire (1997). In 2001, the choir published the complete male choir repertoire of Nils-Eric Fougstedt and in 2013, the complete a cappella male choir work of Toivo Kuula.
