==History==

Windows 2000 is a continuation of the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems, replacing Windows NT 4.0. The original name for the operating system was Windows NT 5.0. Beta 1 of NT 5.0 was released in September 1997, followed by Beta 2 in August 1998.Road to Gold: A Look at the Development of Windows 2000 On October 27, 1998, Microsoft announced that the name of the final version of the operating system would be Windows 2000, a name which referred to its projected release date. Windows 2000 Beta 3 was released in January 1999.The Road to Gold: The development of Windows 2000 Reviewed[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] NT 5.0 Beta 1 was similar to NT 4.0, including a very similar themed logo. NT 5.0 Beta 2 introduced a new 'mini' boot screen, and removed the 'dark space' theme in the logo. The NT 5.0 betas had very long startup and shutdown sounds, though these were changed in the early Windows 2000 beta, but during Beta 3, a new piano-made startup and shutdown sounds were made, featured in the final version as well as for Windows ME. The new login prompt from the final version made its first appearance in Beta 3 build 1946 (the first build of Beta 3). The new, updated icons (for My Computer, Recycle Bin etc.) first appeared in Beta 3 build 1976. The Windows 2000 boot screen in the final version first appeared in Beta 3 build 1994. Windows 2000 did not have a codename because, according to Dave Thompson of Windows NT team, "Jim Allchin didn't like codenames".[tpl]cite web|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|title=SuperSite Flashback: NT’s First Decade|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows/supersite-flashback-nt-s-first-decade|work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton Media|accessdate=10 August 2013|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|date=8 August 2013[/tpl]
Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 was codenamed "Asteroid"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/hardware/0,39042972,13024785,00.htm |title=Windows 2000 service pack nearing release |publisher=Zdnetasia.com |date=January 27, 2000 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] and Windows 2000 64-bit was codenamed "Janus."[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/64-bit-windows-2000-on-track-for-mid-2000.aspx |title=64-bit Windows 2000 on track for mid-2000 |journal=Windows IT Pro |first=Paul |last=Thurrott |authorlink=Paul Thurrott |date=July 27, 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_1999_August_26/ai_55572391 |title=Windows 2000 to Launch at Comdex, 64-Bit Janus in the Wings |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=August 26, 1999 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] During development, there was a build for the Alpha which was abandoned some time after RC1[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alphant.com/articles/windows2000.html |title=RC1 was the build 2072 from June 1999 (and last public Alpha/2000 build), the last known internal build was 2128 and the "Gold" release of Windows 2000 was build 2195 |publisher=Alphant.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] after Compaq announced they had dropped support for Windows NT on Alpha. From here, Microsoft issued three release candidates between July and November 1999, and finally released the operating system to partners on December 12, 1999. The public could buy the full version of Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. Three days before this event, which Microsoft advertised as "a standard in reliability," a leaked memo from Microsoft reported on by Mary Jo Foley revealed that Windows 2000 had "over 63,000 potential known defects."Bugfest! Win2000 has 63,000 'defects' February 14, 2000 After Foley's article was published, Microsoft blacklisted her for a considerable time.Mary Jo Foley: The Exit Interview September 20, 2006 However, Abraham Silberschatz et al. claim in their computer science textbook that "Windows 2000 was the most reliable, stable operating system Microsoft had ever shipped to that point. Much of this reliability came from maturity in the source code, extensive stress testing of the system, and automatic detection of many serious errors in drivers."[ref]John Wiley & Sons (2010). Operating System Concepts with Java, 8th Edition, page 901.
[/ref] InformationWeek summarized the release "our tests show the successor to NT 4.0 is everything we hoped it would be. Of course, it isn't perfect either."InformationWeek, December 28, 1999, "Special Report" Wired News later described the results of the February launch as "lackluster."Wired News, November 2000, "The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth" Novell criticized Microsoft's Active Directory, the new directory service architecture, as less scalable or reliable than its own Novell Directory Services (NDS) alternative.
Windows 2000 was first planned to replace both Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. However, that changed later. Instead, an updated version of Windows 98 called Windows 98 Second Edition was released in 1999 and Windows ME was released in late 2000.
On or shortly before February 12, 2004, "portions of the Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 source code were illegally made available on the Internet." The source of the leak remains unannounced. Microsoft issued the following statement:
  "Microsoft source code is both copyrighted and protected as a trade secret. As such, it is illegal to post it, make it available to others, download it or use it."  
Despite the warnings, the archive containing the leaked code spread widely on the file-sharing networks. On February 16, 2004, an exploit "allegedly discovered by an individual studying the leaked source code" for certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer was reported.
Microsoft planned to release two additional editions of Windows based on the Windows 2000 codebase, Advanced Server Limited Edition and Datacenter Server Limited Edition, which ran on 64-bit Intel Itanium microprocessors.[tpl]cite press release |title=Microsoft and Intel Announce Preview Release of 64-Bit Windows for Intel Itanium Processor |publisher=Microsoft |date=July 12, 2000 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/jul00/itaniumpr.mspx |accessdate=October 4, 2007[/tpl] However, the first officially-released edition was considered part of the Windows Server 2003 family of products.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/64bit/overview/default.mspx|title=Introducing Windows Advanced Server, Limited Edition|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=12 January 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021022044243/http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/64bit/overview/default.mspx|archivedate=22 October 2002[/tpl]

==New and updated features==

Windows 2000 introduced many of the new features of Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE into the NT line,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/reskit/part1/proch01.mspx?mfr=true |title=Introducing Windows 2000 Professional |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] such as the Windows Desktop Update, Internet Explorer 5 (Internet Explorer 6, which came in 2001, is also available for Windows 2000), Outlook Express, NetMeeting, FAT32 support,Description of the FAT32 File System, Windows Driver Model,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/wdmoverview.mspx |title=Windows Driver Model (WDM) |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=April 15, 2002 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Internet Connection Sharing, Windows Media Player, WebDAV support[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195851 |title=Overview of Web Folders in Internet Explorer 5 |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] etc. Certain new features are common across all editions of Windows 2000, among them NTFS 3.0, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC),[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742441.aspx |title=Microsoft Management Console – Overview |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] UDF support, the Encrypting File System (EFS),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windows2000/w2kccadm/dataprot/w2kadm21.mspx |title=Implementing the Encrypting File System in Windows 2000 |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Logical Disk Manager,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/deploy/dgbj_sto_csmg.mspx |title=Disk Management |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Image Color Management 2.0,[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GZQ/is_34_40/ai_55660669 |title=Windows 2000 To Include New On-Screen And Printed Scalable Color Solution |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=September 6, 1999 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] support for PostScript 3-based printers, OpenType (.OTF) and Type 1 PostScript (.PFB) font support, the Data protection API (DPAPI),[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309408 |title=How to troubleshoot the Data Protection API (DPAPI) |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] an LDAP/Active Directory-enabled Address Book,[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238007 |title=How to Configure the Address Book to Query Users Contained in Active Directory |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] usability enhancements and multi-language and locale support.

A new capability designed to protect critical system files called Windows File Protection was introduced. This protects critical Windows system files by preventing programs other than Microsoft's operating system update mechanisms such as the Package Installer, Windows Installer and other update components from modifying them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193|title=Microsoft KB article 222193: Description of the Windows File Protection Feature[/tpl] The System File Checker utility provides users the ability to perform a manual scan the integrity of all protected system files, and optionally repair them, either by restoring from a cache stored in a separate "DLLCACHE" directory, or from the original install media.
Microsoft recognized that a serious error or a stop error could cause problems for servers that needed to be constantly running and so provided a system setting that would allow the server to automatically reboot when a stop error occurred.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307973 |title=How to configure system failure and recovery options in Windows |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=May 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Also included is an option to dump any of the first 64 KB of memory to disk (the smallest amount of memory that is useful for debugging purposes, also known as a minidump), a dump of only the kernel's memory, or a dump of the entire contents of memory to disk, as well as write that this event happened to the Windows 2000 event log. In order to improve performance on servers running Windows 2000, Microsoft gave administrators the choice of optimizing the operating system's memory and processor usage patterns for background services or for applications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/reskit/part6/proch29.mspx |title=Analyzing processor activity: Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Windows 2000 also introduced core system administration and management features as the Windows Installer,[tpl]cite web|url=http://entmag.com/archives/article.asp?editorialsid=5169 |title=Using Windows Installer in Windows 2000 beta 3 |publisher=Entmag.com |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Windows Management Instrumentation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=19489 |title=Programming with Windows Management Instrumentation |publisher=Informit.com |date=October 4, 2000 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968803(VS.85).aspx |title=Event Tracing for Windows (ETW): MSDN |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] into the operating system.

===Plug and Play and hardware support improvements===

The most notable improvement from Windows NT 4.0 is the addition of Plug and Play with full ACPI and Windows Driver Model support. Similar to Windows 9x, Windows 2000 supports automatic recognition of installed hardware, hardware resource allocation, loading of appropriate drivers, PnP APIs and device notification events. The addition of the kernel PnP Manager along with the Power Manager are two significant subsystems added in Windows 2000.
Windows 2000 introduced version 3 print drivers (user mode printer drivers).[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545949(v=vs.85).aspx |title=Choosing User Mode or Kernel Mode |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Generic support for 5-button mice is also included as standard  Windows and the 5-Button Wheel Mouse  and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning the programmable buttons. Windows 98 lacked generic support.  Fourth and Fifth Mouse Buttons Not Recognized by Windows  Driver Verifier was introduced to stress test and catch device driver bugs.Driver Verifier at MSDN. Microsoft.

===Shell===

Windows 2000 introduces layered windows that allow for transparency, translucency and various transition effects like shadows, gradient fills and alpha blended GUI elements to top-level windows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997507.aspx |title=Layered Windows: MSDN |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Menus support a new Fade transition effect.
The Start Menu in Windows 2000 introduces personalized menus, expandable special folders and the ability to launch multiple programs without closing the menu by holding down the SHIFT key. A Re-sort button forces the entire Start Menu to be sorted by name. The Taskbar introduces support for balloon notifications which can also be used by application developers. Windows 2000 Explorer introduces customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, and Places bar in common dialogs for Open and Save.
Windows Explorer has been enhanced in several ways in Windows 2000. It is the first Windows NT release to include Active Desktop, first introduced as a part of Internet Explorer 4.0 (specifically Windows Desktop Update), and only pre-installed in Windows 98 by that time.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Dino|last=Esposito|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0600/w2kui2/|title=More Windows 2000 UI Goodies: Extending Explorer Views by Customizing Hypertext Template Files|publisher=MSDN Magazine|date=June 2000|accessdate=August 26, 2007|postscript=[/tpl] It allowed users to customize the way folders look and behave by using HTML templates, having the file extension HTT.

The "Web-style" folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default in Windows 2000. For certain file types, such as pictures and media files, the preview is also displayed in the left pane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/prork/prde_ffs_sleq.mspx?mfr=true |title=Managing Files, Folders, and Search Methods: Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Until the dedicated interactive preview pane appeared in Windows Vista, Windows 2000 had been the only Windows release to feature an interactive media player as the previewer for sound and video files, enabled by default.

The right pane of Windows 2000 Explorer, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It's possible to define additional Explorer panes by using DIV elements in folder template files. This degree of customizability is new to Windows 2000; neither Windows 98 nor the Desktop Update could provide it.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Figure 1 Windows Shell Extensions|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0300/w2kui/w2kuifigs.asp|publisher=MSDN Magazine|accessdate=August 26, 2007|date=June 2000|postscript=|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040831153932/http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0300/w2kui/w2kuifigs.asp |archivedate = August 31, 2004[/tpl] The new DHTML-based search pane is integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, unlike the separate search dialog found in all previous Explorer versions.

===NTFS 3.0===

Microsoft released the version 3.0 of NTFS (sometimes incorrectly called NTFS 5 in relation to the kernel version number) as part of Windows 2000; this introduced disk quotas (provided by QuotaAdvisor), file-system-level encryption, sparse files and reparse points. Sparse files allow for the efficient storage of data sets that are very large yet contain many areas that only have zeros.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/231388 |title=Sparse Files Use Quota Equal to Total Allocated Length |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=February 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Reparse points allow the object manager to reset a file namespace lookup and let file system drivers implement changed functionality in a transparent manner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/evaluate/featfunc/bestperf.mspx#EME |title=Improved NTFS File System |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Reparse points are used to implement volume mount points, junctions, Hierarchical Storage Management, Native Structured Storage and Single Instance Storage. Volume mount points and directory junctions allow for a file to be transparently referred from one file or directory location to another.
Windows 2000 also introduces a Distributed Link Tracking service to ensure file shortcuts remain working even if the target is moved or renamed. The target object's unique identifier is stored in the shortcut file on NTFS 3.0 and Windows can use the Distributed Link Tracking service for tracking the targets of shortcuts, so that the shortcut file may be silently updated if the target moves, even to another hard drive.[tpl]cite web|title=Distributed Link Tracking and Object Identifiers (Windows)|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363997%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|work=Microsoft TechNet[tpl]![/tpl]TechNet|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=16 October 2012[/tpl]

===Encrypting File System===

The Encrypting File System (EFS) introduced strong file system-level encryption to Windows. It allows any folder or drive on an NTFS volume to be encrypted transparently by the user. EFS works together with the EFS service, Microsoft's CryptoAPI and the EFS File System Runtime Library (FSRTL).[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/997fdd99-73ec-4041-9cf4-1370739a59201033.mspx?mfr=true |title=How Encrypting File System Works |publisher=Technet2.microsoft.com |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] To date, its encryption has not been compromised.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]
EFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK), which is used because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher were used. The symmetric key used to encrypt the file is then encrypted with a public key associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted data is stored in the header of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in the file header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because this is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user."Encrypting File System." Microsoft.
For a user losing access to their key, support for recovery agents that can decrypt files is built into EFS. A Recovery Agent is a user who is authorized by a public key recovery certificate to decrypt files belonging to other users using a special private key. By default, local administrators are recovery agents however they can be customized using Group Policy.

===Basic and dynamic disk storage===

Windows 2000 introduced the Logical Disk Manager and the diskpart command line tool for dynamic storage. All versions of Windows 2000 support three types of dynamic disk volumes (along with basic disks): simple volumes, spanned volumes and striped volumes:
In addition to these disk volumes, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server support mirrored volumes and striped volumes with parity:

===Accessibility===

With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other disabilities into the NT-line of operating systems. These included:
Additionally, Windows 2000 introduced the following new accessibility features:

===Languages and locales===

Windows 2000 introduced the Multilingual User Interface (MUI).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/muiapp.mspx |title=Writing Win32 Multilingual User Interface Applications |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Besides English, Windows 2000 incorporates support for Arabic, Armenian, Baltic, Central European, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Indic, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkic, Vietnamese and Western European languages. It also has support for many different locales.

===Games===

Windows 2000 included version 7.0 of the DirectX API, commonly used by game developers on Windows 98.Ask the Windows 2000 Dev Team. The last version of DirectX that Windows 2000 supports is DirectX 9.0c (Shader Model 3.0), that shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Microsoft published quarterly updates to DirectX 9.0c through the February 2010 release after which support was dropped in the June 2010 SDK. These updates contain bug fixes to the core runtime and some additional libraries such as D3DX, XAudio 2, XInput and Managed DirectX components. The majority of games written for versions of DirectX 9.0c (up to the February 2010 release) can therefore run on Windows 2000.
Windows 2000 included the same games as Windows NT 4.0 did: FreeCell, Minesweeper, Pinball, and Solitaire.[tpl]cite book|title=Upgrading to Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional: A Migration Guide for Windows 98 and Windows NT Users|first=Jerry Lee, Jr|last=Ford|publisher=iUniverse.com, Inc.|location=Lincoln, NE|year=2000|isbn=0595148042|accessdate=January 8, 2013|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=fYwGEZPXvFkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=90[/tpl]

===System utilities===

Windows 2000 introduced the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools. Each of these is called a console, and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called snap-ins. These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in author mode or user mode. Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.Microsoft Press (2000). MCSE 70–210, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, pages 58–63.
The main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the Computer Management console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel).[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726960.aspx |title=Managing Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstations and Servers |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] This contains the Event Viewer—a means of seeing events and the Windows equivalent of a log file,[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726966.aspx |title=Event Logging and Viewing |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] a system information utility, a backup utility, Task Scheduler and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage COM+ applications, configure Group Policy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742376.aspx |title=Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] manage all the local users and user groups, and a device manager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314747 |title=Description of Device Manager in Windows 2000 and Windows XP |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=May 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] It contains Disk Management and Removable Storage snap-ins,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/reskit/part3/proch18.mspx |title=Windows 2000: Removable Storage and Backup |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] a disk defragmenter as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a service configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. CHKDSK has significant performance improvements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shared/community/docs/Windows%202000%20CHKDSK%20Management.doc |title=Windows 2000 Chkdsk Management |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]
Windows 2000 comes with two utilities to edit the Windows registry, REGEDIT.EXE and REGEDT32.EXE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/141377 |title=Differences between Regedit.exe and Regedt32.exe |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] REGEDIT has been directly ported from Windows 98, and therefore does not support editing registry permissions. REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions in the same manner that Windows NT's REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side tree view of the Windows registry, lists all loaded hives and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the top menu bar. Windows XP is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.
The System File Checker (SFC) also comes with Windows 2000. It is a command line utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in conjunction with the Windows File Protection mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the Dllcache folder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222471|title=Microsoft KB article 222471: Description of the Windows 2000 System File Checker (Sfc.exe) [/tpl]

===Recovery Console===

The Recovery Console is run from outside the installed copy of Windows to perform maintenance tasks that can neither be run from within it nor feasibly be run from another computer or copy of Windows 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/229716 |title=Description of the Windows 2000 Recovery Console |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=February 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] It is usually used to recover the system from problems that cause booting to fail, which would render other tools useless, like Safe Mode or Last Known Good Configuration, or chkdsk. It includes commands like 'fixmbr', which are not present in MS-DOS.
It has a simple command line interface, used to check and repair the hard drive(s), repair boot information (including NTLDR), replace corrupted system files with fresh copies from the CD, or enable/disable services and drivers for the next boot.
The console can be accessed in either of the two ways:

===Windows Scripting Host 2.0===

Windows 2000 introduced Windows Script Host 2.0 which included an expanded object model and support for logon and logoff scripts.

===Server family features===

The Windows 2000 server family consists of Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.
All editions of Windows 2000 Server have the following services and features built in:
The Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS), Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage.

====Distributed File System====

The Distributed File System (DFS) allows shares in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or DFS root. When users try to access a network share off the DFS root, the user is really looking at a DFS link and the DFS server transparently redirects them to the correct file server and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server.
There can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other domain controllers within the domain – this provides fault tolerance to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft File Replication Service (FRS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812487|title=Microsoft KB article 812487: Overview of DFS in Windows 2000[/tpl]

====Active Directory====

A new way of organizing Windows network domains, or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous domain name space to form trees. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form forests.
Active Directory services could always be installed on a Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, or Datacenter Server computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory's new features. As part of an organization's migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to native mode and maximum functionality achieved.
Active Directory requires a DNS server that supports SRV resource records, or that an organization's existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There should be one or more domain controllers to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory directory services.

====Volume fault tolerance====

Along with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the server family of Windows 2000 also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are mirrored volumes and RAID-5 volumes:

==Deployment==

Windows 2000 can be deployed to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or unattended. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an answer file, or a predefined script in the form of an INI file that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical Setup manager. The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), via the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep), via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via Remote Installation Services (RIS). The ability to slipstream a service pack into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/depopt/easydep.mspx#EKFAC |title=Make deployment easier in Windows 2000 |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]
The Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer – though the hardware need not be similar – and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources.
Sysprep allows the duplication of a disk image on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same HALs, ACPI support, and mass storage devices – though Windows 2000 automatically detects "plug and play" devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.)
Systems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides centralised control over upgrades to systems.
Remote Installation Services (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.Mark Minasi. Installing Windows 2000 on Workstations with Remote Installation Services.
RIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a network interface card that has a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote boot disk generator. The remote computer must also meet the Net PC specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network DNS Service, a DHCP service and the Active Directory services.Microsoft Press (2000). MCSE 70–210, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, pages 543–551.

==Editions==

Microsoft released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately.

==Service packs==

Windows 2000 has received four full service packs and one rollup update package following SP4, which is the last service pack. These were: SP1 on August 15, 2000, SP2 on May 16, 2001, SP3 on August 29, 2002 and SP4 on June 26, 2003. Microsoft phased out all development of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from Windows 2000 in SP3. Internet Explorer 5.01 has also been upgraded to the corresponding service pack level.
Microsoft had originally intended to release a fifth service pack for Windows 2000, but Microsoft cancelled this project early in its development, and instead released Update Rollup 1 for SP4, a collection of all the security-related hotfixes and some other significant issues. The Update Rollup does not include all non-security related hotfixes and is not subjected to the same extensive regression testing as a full service pack. Microsoft states that this update will meet customers' needs better than a whole new service pack, and will still help Windows 2000 customers secure their PCs, reduce support costs, and support existing computer hardware.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |title=Windows 2000 Update Rollup 1 for Service Pack 4|accessdate=September 27, 2006|publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060113110336/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |archivedate = January 13, 2006[/tpl]

==Security==

During the Windows 2000 period, the nature of attacks on Windows servers changed: more attacks came from remote sources via the Internet. This has led to an overwhelming number of malicious programs exploiting the IIS services – specifically a notorious buffer overflow tendency.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/trends/article.php/3065801|title=Worms Wreak Havoc|date=August 19, 2003|publisher=ECommerce-Guide|accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl] This tendency is not operating-system-version specific, but rather configuration-specific: it depends on the services that are enabled. Following this, a common complaint is that "by default, Windows 2000 installations contain numerous potential security problems. Many unneeded services are installed and enabled, and there is no active local security policy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/Windows2000Security.php|title=governmentsecurity.org[/tpl] In addition to insecure defaults, according to the SANS Institute, the most common flaws discovered are remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/top20/|title=SANS Institute[/tpl] Other criticized flaws include the use of vulnerable encryption techniques.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,36336,00.html|first=Declan|last=McCullagh|title=Critics Blast MS Security|date=May 16, 2000|publisher=Wired News|accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl]
Code Red and Code Red II were famous (and much discussed) worms that exploited vulnerabilities of the Windows Indexing Service of Windows 2000's Internet Information Services (IIS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-19.html |title=cert.org |publisher=cert.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] In August 2003, two major worms called Sobig and Blaster began to attack millions of Microsoft Windows computers, resulting in the largest downtime and clean-up cost to that date[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]. The 2005 Zotob worm was blamed for security compromises on Windows 2000 machines at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the New York Times Company, ABC and CNN.Wired News, April 12, 2006, "Border Security System Left Open"
On September 8, 2009, Microsoft skipped patching two of the five security flaws that were addressed in the monthly security update, saying that patching one of the critical security flaws was "infeasible."Techworld, September 9, 2009, "Microsoft: Windows 2000 too old to update" According to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-048: "The architecture to properly support TCP/IP protection does not exist on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating system, ... there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 would continue to operate on the updated system." No patches for this flaw were however released for the newer Windows XP (32-bit) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition either, despite both also being affected.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-048.mspx |title=microsoft.com |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

==Support lifecycle==

Windows 2000 was superseded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows 2000 Server products by Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2000 Professional by Windows XP Professional.
The Windows 2000 family of operating systems moved from mainstream support to the extended support phase on June 30, 2005. Microsoft says that this marks the progression of Windows 2000 through the Windows lifecycle policy. Under mainstream support, Microsoft freely provides design changes if any, service packs and non-security related updates in addition to security updates, whereas in extended support, service packs are not provided and non-security updates require contacting the support personnel by e-mail or phone. Under the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide critical security updates every month for all components of Windows 2000 (including Internet Explorer 5.0 SP4) and paid per-incident support for technical issues. Because of Windows 2000's age, updated versions of components such as Windows Media Player 11 and Internet Explorer 7 have not been released for it. In the case of Internet Explorer, Microsoft said in 2005 that, "some of the security work in IE 7 relies on operating system functionality in XP SP2 that is non-trivial to port back to Windows 2000."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Windows+2000+users+to+miss+out+on+IE+7/2100-1032_3-5729544.html|title=Windows 2000 users to miss out on IE 7|accessdate=January 11, 2007|publisher=news.com|archiveurl=http://archive.is/74uA|archivedate=July 13, 2012[/tpl]
While users of Windows 2000 Professional and Server are eligible to receive the upgrade license for Windows Vista Business or Windows Server 2008, neither of these operating systems can directly perform an upgrade installation from Windows 2000; a clean installation must be performed instead or a two-step upgrade through XP/2003. Microsoft has dropped the upgrade path from Windows 2000 (and earlier) to Windows 7. Users of Windows 2000 must buy a full Windows 7 license.
Although Windows 2000 is the last NT-based version of Microsoft Windows which does not include product activation, Microsoft has introduced Windows Genuine Advantage for certain downloads and non-critical updates from the Download Center for Windows 2000.
Windows 2000 reached the end of its lifecycle on July 13, 2010. It will not receive new security updates and new security-related hotfixes after this date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?sort=PN&alpha=Windows+2000&Filter=FilterNO|title=Microsoft Product Lifecycle for Windows 2000 family[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/extendedsupport.mspx|title=Windows 2000 Transitions to Extended Support[/tpl] In Japan, over 130,000 servers and 500,000 PCs in local governments are affected; many local governments said that they will not update as they do not have funds to cover a replacement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100820a7.html |title=Windows 2000 still in use locally |work=The Japan Times |date= August 20, 2010 |accessdate=August 20, 2010[/tpl]
As of 2011 Windows Update still supports the Windows 2000 updates available on Patch Tuesday in July 2010, e.g., if older optional Windows 2000 features are enabled later. Microsoft Office products under Windows 2000 have their own product lifecycles. While Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP did received security patches up until it lost support, this is not the case for IE6 under Windows 2000. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool installed monthly by Windows Update for XP and later versions can be still downloaded manually for Windows 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx|title=Malicious Software Removal Tool|publisher=Microsoft|year=2011|work=n (KB890830)|accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl]

==Total cost of ownership==

In October 2002, Microsoft commissioned IDC to determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) for enterprise applications on Windows 2000 versus the TCO of the same applications on Linux. IDC's report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 North American companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services.
IDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux – over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees – were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way SMP Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific application servers – servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change."Windows 2000 Versus Linux in Enterprise Computing," IDC.
