The Igbo people, formerly known as the Ibo, are an ethnic group of southeastern Nigeria. They speak Igbo, which includes various Igboid languages and dialects.[tpl]cite book |title=African languages, development and the state |first1=Richard |last1=Fardon |first2=Graham |last2=Furniss  |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |isbn=0-415-09476-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_34ReDEC2hMC&pg=PA66 |page=66 |accessdate=2009-04-12[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oHt6gmjbpewC&pg=PA106 |page=106 |chapter=Cultural Harmony I: Igboland – the World of Man and the World of Spirits |title=Understanding Things Fall Apart |first=Kalu |last=Ogbaa |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=0-313-30294-4[/tpl] Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa.[tpl]cite book|title=Nigeria: The Bradt Travel Guide |first=Lizzie |last=Williams |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2008 |isbn=1-84162-239-7 |page=32 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fwuQ71ZbaOcC&pg=PA32[/tpl]
In rural areas of Nigeria, Igbo people are mostly craftsmen, farmers and traders. The most important crop is the yam; celebrations are held annually to celebrate its harvesting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/08/01/yam_and_the_igbos_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Birmingham |title=Yam and the Igbos |first=Kene |last=Agwu |accessdate=2008-11-24[/tpl] Other staple crops include cassava and taro.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/282215/Igbo |title=Igbo |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2009-02-01[/tpl]
Before British colonialism, the Igbo were a politically fragmented group. There were variations in culture such as in art styles, attire and religious practices. Various subgroups were organized by clan, lineage, village affiliation, and dialect. There were not many centralized chiefdoms, hereditary aristocracy, or kingship customs except in kingdoms such as those of the Nri, Arochukwu, Agbor and Onitsha.[tpl]cite book|title=The End of slavery in Africa |first1=Suzanne |last1=Miers |first2=Richard L. |last2=Roberts |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-299-11554-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G3VSwvEG4QcC&pg=PA437 |page=437[/tpl] This political system changed significantly under British colonialism in the 19th century; Eze (kings) were introduced into most local communities by Frederick Lugard as "Warrant Chiefs".[tpl]cite book|title=The foundations of Nigeria: essays in honor of Toyin Falola |first=Toyin |last=Falola |editor=Adebayo Oyebade |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H5Lzf7s2M8EC&pg=PA476 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-59221-120-8 |page=476 |accessdate=2010-06-27[/tpl] The Igbo became overwhelmingly Christian under colonization. Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is one of the most popular novels to depict Igbo culture and changes under colonialism.
By the mid-20th century, the Igbo people developed a strong sense of ethnic identity. Certain conflicts with other Nigerian ethnicities led to the Igbo-dominant Eastern Nigeria seceding to create the independent state of Biafra. The Nigerian-Biafran war (6 July 1967 – 15 January 1970) broke out shortly after. With their defeat, the Republic of Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria.[tpl]cite book |last=Forsythe |first=Frederick |year=2006 |title=Shadows: Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967–1970 |page=1 |isbn=1-902109-63-5[/tpl] MASSOB, a sectarian organization formed in 1999, continues a non-violent struggle for an independent Igbo state.[tpl]cite book|title=The "civil society" problematique: deconstructing civility and southern Nigeria's ethnic radicalization |first=Adedayo Oluwakayode |last=Adekson |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=0-415-94785-5 |pages=87, 96[/tpl]

==Identity==

The Igbo people have had fragmented and politically independent communities.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures |page=120 |first=David |last=Levinson |coauthor=Timothy J O'Leary |isbn=0-8161-1815-9 |publisher=G.K. Hall |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-12-24[/tpl] Before knowledge of Europeans and full exposure to other neighbouring ethnic groups, the Igbo did not have a strong identity as one people. As in the case of most ethnic groups, the British and fellow Europeans identified the Igbo as a tribe.[tpl]cite book |title= Home and Exile |last= Achebe |first= Chinua |authorlink= Chinua Achebe |year= 2000 |publisher= Oxford University Press US |isbn= 0-19-513506-7 |page=4 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=BZc25_jgOhgC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA4,M1 |quote=...Igbo people might score poorly on the Oxford dictionary test for tribe... Now, to call them a nation... This may not be perfect for the Igbo, but it is close.[/tpl] Chinua Achebe, among other scholars, challenged this because of its negative connotations and possible wrong definition. He suggested defining the Igbo people as a nation similar to the Cherokee Native Americans or Japanese, although the Igbo do not have an officially recognized physical state of their own.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: S-Z |first=James |last=Minahan |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=0-313-32384-4 |page=762 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K94wQ9MF2JsC&pg=PA762[/tpl]
Due to the effects of migration and the Atlantic slave trade, there are descendant historical Igbo populations in countries such as Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, as well as outside Africa; many African Americans and Afro Caribbeans are believed to be partially of Igbo descent.

==History==

===Origin===

Pottery dated at around 2500 BCE showing similarities with later Igbo work was found at Nsukka, along with pottery and tools at nearby Ibagwa; the traditions of the Umueri clan have as their source the Anambra valley.  In the 1970s the Owerri, Okigwe, Orlu, Awgu, Udi and Awka divisions were determined to constitute "an Igbo heartland" from the linguistic and cultural evidence.[tpl]cite book|last=Elizabeth |first=Isichei |title=A History of the Igbo People |publisher=London: Macmillan |year=1976 |isbn=0-333-18556-0[/tpl]; excerpted in "Cultural Harmony I: Igboland — the World of Man and the World of Spirits", section 4 of Kalu Ogbaa, ed., Understanding Things Fall Apart (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1999; ISBN 0-313-30294-4), pp. 83–85.

===Nri Kingdom===

The Nri people of Igbo land have a creation myth which is one of the many creation myths that exist in various parts of Igbo land. The Nri and Aguleri people are in the territory of the Umueri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure Eri. Eri's origins are unclear, though he has been described as a "sky being" sent by Chukwu (God).[tpl]cite book|last=Uzukwu |first=E. Elochukwu |title=Worship as Body Language |year=1997 |isbn=0-8146-6151-3 |page=93 |publisher=Liturgical Press |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9hhmzVrYPHAC&pg=PA93[/tpl] He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra. The historian Elizabeth Allo Isichei says "Nri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan, are a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri."[tpl]cite book|title=A History of African Societies to 1870 |page=246 |isbn=0-521-45599-5 |first=Elizabeth Allo |last=Isichei |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LqIVnr9h7DsC&pg=PA246|accessdate=2008-12-13 | year=1997 | publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl]
Archaeological evidence suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century,[tpl]cite book |last=Hrbek |first= Ivan; Fāsī, Muḥammad |title=Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century |publisher=Unesco  |location=London |year=1988 |page=254 |isbn=92-3-101709-8 [/tpl] and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled the region around 948 with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century.[tpl]cite book | last = Lovejoy | first = Paul | title = Identity in the Shadow of Slavery | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | page=62| year = 2000 | isbn  = 0-8264-4725-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yEHVCsSFRUcC&pg=PA62[/tpl] The first Eze Nri (King of Nri) Ìfikuánim followed directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043.[tpl]cite book |title= Igbo Civilization: Nri Kingdom & Hegemony |first=M.

 Each king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor, Eri. Each king is a ritual reproduction of Eri. The initiation rite of a new king shows that the ritual process of becoming Ezenri (Nri priest-king) follows closely the path traced by the hero in establishing the Nri kingdom.

The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, a sort of theocratic state, that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had seven types of taboos which included human (such as the birth of twins), animal (such as killing or eating of pythons),[tpl]cite book |title=The Archaeology of Contextual Meanings |first=Ian |last=Hodder |edition=illustrated |publisher=CUP Archive |year=1987 |isbn=0-521-32924-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pv48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA72 |page=72[/tpl] object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos.[tpl]cite book | last=Nyang |first=Sulayman; Olupona, Jacob K. | title = Religious Plurality in Africa: Essays in Honour of John S.

===Traditional society===

Traditional Igbo political organization was based on a quasi-democratic republican system of government. In tight knit communities, this system guaranteed its citizens equality, as opposed to a feudalist system with a king ruling over subjects.[tpl]cite book |title=Power, Marginality and African Oral Literature  |first=Graham |last=Furniss |coauthor=Elizabeth Gunner, Liz Gunner |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-48061-2 |page=65 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1p3nlW3TM-kC&pg=PA65[/tpl] This government system was witnessed by the Portuguese who first arrived and met with the Igbo people in the 15th century.[tpl]cite book |title=Foreign Missionary Background and Indigenous Evangelization in Igboland |first=Nkem Hyginus M.

Communities were usually governed and administered by a council of elders.[tpl]cite book |title=Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook |first=April A. |last=Gordon |edition=illustrated, annotated |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=1-57607-682-2 |page=37 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H26pO3vwmHoC&pg=PA37[/tpl]
Although title holders were respected because of their accomplishments and capabilities, they were never revered as kings, but often performed special functions given to them by such assemblies. This way of governing was immensely different from most other communities of Western Africa, and only shared by the Ewe of Ghana. Umunna are a form of patrilineage maintained by the Igbo. Law starts with the Umunna which is a male line of descent from a founding ancestor (who the line is sometimes named after) with groups of compounds containing closely related families headed by the eldest male member. The Umunna can be seen as the most important pillar of Igbo society.[tpl]cite book|title=Christianity and Ibo culture |first=Edmund |last=Ilogu |publisher=Brill Archive |year=1974 |isbn=90-04-04021-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0uMUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA11 |page=11[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Achievement as Value in the Igbo/African Identity: The Ethics |first1=Vernantius Emeka |last1=Ndukaihe |first2=Peter |last2=Fonk |publisher=LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster |year=2006 |isbn=3-8258-9929-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ERM77W_wgZYC&pg=PA204 |page=204[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Women in Igbo Life and Thought |first=Joseph Thérèse |last=Agbasiere |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-22703-8 |page=12 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HdOhY8HqTREC&pg=PA12 |accessdate=2008-12-19[/tpl]

===Transatlantic slave trade===

The transatlantic slave trade, which took place between the 16th and late 19th centuries, had huge effects on the Igbo because so many young people were taken, and warfare increased for the taking of captives.

===Colonial period===

The 19th-century British colonization effort in present-day Nigeria and increased encounters between the Igbo and other ethnicities near the Niger River led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. The Igbo proved remarkably decisive and enthusiastic in their embrace of Christianity and Western education.[tpl]cite book |title=Igbo Women and Economic Transformation in Southeastern Nigeria, 1900–1960: 1900–1960 |first=Gloria |last=Chuku |edition= illustrated |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-97210-8 |page=145 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3jouPZxPC4C&pg=PA145[/tpl] Due to the incompatibility of the Igbo decentralized style of government and the centralized system required for British indirect rule, British colonial rule was marked with open conflicts and much tension. Under British colonial rule, the diversity within each of Nigeria's major ethnic groups slowly decreased and distinctions between the Igbo and other large ethnic groups, such as the Hausa and the Yoruba, became sharper.[tpl]cite book |year=1992 |title=Groundwork of Igbo history |authorlink=Adiele Afigbo |last=Afigbo |first=A.

Colonial rule drastically transformed Igbo society, as portrayed in Chinua Achebe's novel, ook Things Fall Apart. British rule brought about changes in culture, such as the introduction of Warrant Chiefs as Eze (traditional rulers) where there were no such monarchies.[tpl]cite book|title=Power, Marginality and African Oral Literature |first=Graham |last=Furniss |coauthor=Elizabeth Gunner, Liz Gunner |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-48061-2 |page=67 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G8ZDWbwIwdQC&pg=PA67[/tpl] Christian missionaries introduced European ideology into Igbo society and culture, sometimes shunning parts of the culture.[tpl]cite book |title=Christianity and Ibo Culture |first=Edmund |last=Ilogu |publisher=Brill Archive |year=1974 |isbn=90-04-04021-8 |page=63 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0uMUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA63[/tpl] The rumours that the Igbo women were being assessed for taxation sparked off the 1929 Igbo Women's War in Aba (also known as the 1929 Aba Riots), a massive revolt of women never encountered before in Igbo history.[tpl]cite book |title=Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality |first=Peggy Reeves |last=Sanday |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-521-28075-3 |page=136 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=39ScGl-T3J0C&pg=PA136[/tpl]
Living conditions changed under colonial rule. The tradition of building houses out of mud walls and thatched roofs ended as the people shifted to materials such as cement blocks for houses and zinc roofs. Roads for vehicles were built. Buildings such as hospitals and schools were erected in many parts of Igboland. Along with these changes, electricity and running water were installed in the early 20th century. With electricity, new technology such as  radios and televisions were adopted, and have become commonplace in most Igbo households.[tpl]cite book|title=Nigeria's Diverse Peoples |first=April A. |last=Gordon |page=87 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=1-57607-682-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H26pO3vwmHoC&pg=PA87 |accessdate=2008-12-19[/tpl]

===Nigerian–Biafran War===

A series of ethnic clashes between Northern Muslims and the Igbo, Ibibio, Efik and other ethnic groups of Eastern Nigeria Region living in Northern Nigeria took place between 1966 and 1967. Elements in the army had assassinated the Nigerian military head of state General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi (29 July 1966) and peace negotiations failed between the military government that deposed Ironsi and the regional government of Eastern Nigeria at the Aburi Talks in Ghana in 1967. 
These events led to a regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria deciding that the region should secede and proclaim the Republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967.[ref]

General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu made this declaration and became the Head of state of the new republic. The resultant war, which became known as the Nigerian Civil War or the Nigerian-Biafran War, lasted from July 6, 1967 until January 15, 1970, after which the federal government re-absorbed Biafra into Nigeria.
Several million Eastern Nigerians, especially Igbo, are believed[tpl]by whom|date=August 2013[/tpl] to have died from the pogroms against them and the civil war. In their brief struggle for self-determination, the people of Biafra earned the respect of figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre and John Lennon, who returned his British honor, MBE, partly in protest against British collusion in the Nigeria-Biafra war.
In July 2007 the former President of Biafra, General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, renewed calls for the secession of the Biafran state as a sovereign entity. "The only alternative is a separate existence...What upsets the Igbo population is we are not equally Nigerian as the others".

===Recent history (1970 to present)===

After the Nigerian–Biafran War, Igboland was devastated. Many hospitals, schools, and homes were completely destroyed in the war. In addition to the loss of their savings, many Igbo people were discriminated against by other ethnic groups and the new non-Igbo federal government.[tpl]cite book|title=Human Rights in Commonwealth Africa |first=Rhoda E. |last=Howard-Hassmann |page=95 |isbn=0-8476-7433-9 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=1986 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B8wmGpg9nf0C&pg=PA95&dq=igbo+discrimination+nigeria |accessdate=2008-12-18[/tpl] Some Igbo subgroups, such as the Ikwerre, started disassociating themselves from the larger Igbo population after the war.[tpl]cite book |title=A Tri-Generational Study of Language Choice & Shift in Port Harcourt |first=Kelechukwu U. |last=Ihemere |page=26 |publisher=Universal-Publishers |year=2007 |isbn=1-58112-958-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uwk5IkralBAC&pg=PA26[/tpl] In the post-war era, people of eastern Nigeria changed the names of both people and places to non-Igbo-sounding words.

Igboland was gradually rebuilt over a period of twenty years and the economy was again prospering due to the rise of the petroleum industry in the adjacent Niger Delta region.

==Culture==

Igbo culture includes the various customs, practices and traditions of the people. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people's visual art, music and dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and language dialects. Because of their various subgroups, the variety of their culture is heightened further.

===Language and literature===

The Igbo language was used by John Goldsmith as an example to justify deviating from the classical linear model of phonology as laid out in The Sound Pattern of English. It is written in the Roman script as well as the Nsibidi formalized ideograms, which is used by the Ekpe society and Okonko fraternity, but is no longer widely used.[tpl]cite web |title=Nsibidi|url=http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/nsibidi.html |work=National Museum of African Art |publisher=Smithsonian Institution  |quote=Nsibidi is an ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to the Ejagham peoples of southeastern Nigeria and the southwestern Cameroon in the Cross River region. It is also used by neighboring Ibibio, Efik and Igbo peoples. |accessdate=2010-02-25[/tpl] Nsibidi ideography existed among the Igbo before the 16th century, but died out after it became popular among secret societies, who  made Nsibidi a secret form of communication.[tpl]cite book |last=Oraka |first=L. N. |year=1983 |title=The foundations of Igbo studies |publisher=University Publishing Co. |pages=17, 13 |isbn=978-160-264-3[/tpl] Igbo is a tonal language and there are hundreds of different Igbo dialects and Igboid languages, such as the Ikwerre and Ekpeye languages. In 1939, Dr. Ida C. Ward led a research expedition on Igbo dialects which could possibly be used as a basis of a standard Igbo dialect, also known as Central Igbo. This dialect included that of the Owerri and Umuahia groups, including the Ohuhu dialect. This proposed dialect was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, publishers, and Cambridge University.[tpl]cite book |last=Oraka |first=L.

G. A. Oldendorp, was the first book to publish any Igbo material.
Perhaps the most popular and renowned novel that deals with the Igbo and their traditional life was the 1959 book by Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart. The novel concerns influences of British colonialism and Christian missionaries on a traditional Igbo community during an unspecified time in the late nineteenth or early 20th century. Most of the novel is set in Umuofia, one of nine villages on the lower Niger.[tpl]cite book |last=Achebe |authorlink=Chinua Achebe |first=Chinua |year=1994 |page=11 |title=Things fall apart |publisher=Anchor |isbn=0-385-47454-7[/tpl]

===Performing arts===

The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, igba, and ichaka.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5IYAAAAIAAJ |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |first=George |last=Grove |coauthor=Stanley Sadie |edition=6 |page=239 |year=1980 |isbn=0-333-23111-2[/tpl] Another popular musical form among the Igbo is Highlife. A widely popular musical genre in West Africa, Highlife is a fusion of jazz and traditional music. The modern Igbo Highlife is seen in the works of Dr Sir Warrior, Oliver De Coque, Bright Chimezie, and Chief Osita Osadebe, who were among the most popular Igbo Highlife musicians of the 20th century.[tpl]cite book |title=Culture and Customs of Nigeria |first=Toyin |last=Falola |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001 |pages= 174–183 |isbn=0-313-31338-5[/tpl]
Masking is one of the most common art styles in Igboland and is linked strongly with Igbo traditional music. A mask can be made of wood or fabric, along with other materials including iron and vegetation. Masks have a variety of uses, mainly in social satires, religious rituals, secret society initiations (such as the Ekpe society) and public festivals, which now include Christmas time celebrations.[tpl]cite book|title=Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity, and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade |first=David |last=Eltis |coauthor=David Richardson |page=87 |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kuXEzQZQmawC&pg=PA87&dq | isbn=978-0-7146-4820-0[/tpl] Best known are the Agbogho Mmuo ([tpl]Lang-ig|Maiden spirit[/tpl]) masks of the Northern Igbo which represent the spirits of deceased maidens and their mothers with masks symbolizing beauty.
Other impressive masks include Northern Igbo Ijele masks. At [tpl]convert|12|ft|m[/tpl] high, Ijele masks consist of platforms [tpl]convert|6|ft|m[/tpl] in diameter, supporting figures made of colored cloth and representing everyday scenes with objects such as leopards. Ijele masks are used for honoring the dead to ensure the continuity and well-being of the community and are only seen on rare occasions such as the death of a prominent figure in the community.
There are many Igbo dance styles, but perhaps, Igbo dance is best known for its Atilogwu dance troops. These performances include acrobatic stunts such as high kicks and cartwheels, with each rhythm from the traditional instruments indicating a movement to the dancer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=384736&fullArticle=true&tocId=57106 |title=African dance |location=18th paragraph under 'Dance style' |last=Harper |first=Peggy |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia[/tpl]

===Visual art and architecture===

There is such variety among Igbo groups that it is not possible to define a general Igbo art style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/print?articleId=384738&fullArticle=true&tocId=57172 |title=art, African |location=West Africa, Igbo, |last=Picton |first=John |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-23 |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia[/tpl] Igbo art is known for various types of masquerade, masks and outfits symbolising people animals or abstract conceptions. Bronze castings found in the town of Igbo Ukwu from the 9th century, constitute the earliest sculptures discovered in Igboland. Here, the grave of a well-established man of distinction and a ritual store, dating from the 9th century AD, contained both chased copper objects and elaborate castings of leaded bronze. Along with these bronzes were 165,000 glass beads said to have originated in Egypt, Venice and India.[tpl]cite book|title=Igbo women and economic transformation in southeastern Nigeria, 1900–1960 |first=Gloria |last=Chuku |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |pages= 43–44 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z3jouPZxPC4C&pg=PA43 | isbn=978-0-415-97210-9[/tpl] Some popular Igbo art styles include Uli designs.

Mbari houses of the Owerri-Igbo are large opened-sided square planned shelters. They house many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi (deity) and Ala, the earth goddess, with other deities of thunder and water).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/print?articleId=384737&fullArticle=true&tocId=57112 |title=African architecture |location=Geographic influences, Palaces and shrines, last paragraph |last=Oliver |first=Paul |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-23 |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia[/tpl] Other sculptures are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), animals, legendary creatures and ancestors. Mbari houses take years to build in what is regarded as a sacred process. When new ones are constructed, old ones are left to decay. Everyday houses were made of mud and thatched roofs with bare earth floors with carved design doors. Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior. These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women.[tpl]cite web|title=The Poetics of Line |url=http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/uli.htm |work=National Museum of African Art |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2008-12-19[/tpl]
One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the town of Nsude, in Abaja[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl], northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60 ft. in circumference and 3 ft. in height. The next stack was 45 ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.Basden, G. S(1966). Among the Ibos of Nigeria, 1912.

===Religion and rites of passage===

The Igbo believe in reincarnation. People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behavior, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female.[tpl]cite book|title=Ancestors |first=William Hare |last=Newell |pages= 293–294 |isbn=90-279-7859-X |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |chapter=Ancestoride!

====Burials====

After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased's finest garments. Animal sacrifices may be offered and the dead person is well perfumed.[tpl]cite book |title=The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano |last=Equiano |first=Olaudah |page=24 |publisher=I.

In the 21st century, the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence. Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is determined by an individual's age, gender and status in society. For example, children are buried in hiding and out of sight; their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights. A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin: in a garden or a farm-area that belonged to her father.[tpl]cite book|title=Foreign Missionary Background and Indigenous Evangelization in Igboland |first=Nkem Hyginus M.

===Attire===

Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing, as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private parts, although elders were fully clothed.[tpl]cite book|title=Dirt, Undress, and Difference: Critical Perspectives on the Body's Surface |first=Adeline Marie |last=Masquelier |isbn=0-253-34628-2 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2005 |pages= 38–45|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZV9C2AjtFfsC&pg=PA38 |accessdate=2008-12-18[/tpl] Children were usually nude from birth until they reach puberty status (the time when they were considered to have something to hide), but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for spiritual reasons. Uli body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3jouPZxPC4C&pg=PA135 |last=Chuku |first=Gloria |title=Igbo Women and Economic Transformation in Southeastern Nigeria, 1900–1960: 1900–1960 |page=135 |isbn=0-415-97210-8 |publisher=Routledge |year=2005|accessdate=2008-12-18[/tpl]
Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa. This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. In most cases, Igbo women did not cover their breast areas. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads. Both men and women wore wrappers. Men would wear loin cloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming.
In Olaudah Equiano's narrative, Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka;
 "Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with  palm oil; with which both men and women perfume themselves."

===Cuisine===

The yam is very important to the Igbo as the staple crop. There are celebrations such as the New yam festival ([tpl]lang-ig|Iwaji[/tpl]) which are held for the harvesting of the yam.

The 1930s saw the rise of Igbo unions in the cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt. Later, the Ibo Federal Union (renamed the Ibo State Union in 1948) emerged as an umbrella pan-ethnic organization. Headed by Nnamdi Azikiwe, it was closely associated with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), which he co-founded with Herbert Macaulay.
