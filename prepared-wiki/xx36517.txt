==Plot==

Joey Crown (Jack Klugman) is a down-and-out, alcoholic trumpet player in New York, looking for a chance to work again.  After being turned down by the manager at his old club, and insulted by a pawn shop owner (after he is forced to sell his beloved trumpet for cash), Joey decides that his life is worthless, and steps into the path of a speeding truck.
When Joey comes to, he finds that the people around him cannot see or hear him, and assumes that he is dead.  Returning to his old night club, he meets another trumpet player (John Anderson), and is startled to discover that the other man recognizes him.
The other man explains that Joey is in "a kind of limbo"; while the people he encountered are actually dead, he can still return to the living, if he so chooses.  With the player's encouragement, Joey remembers that even at its worst, life still has enough good in it to be worth living, and he chooses to go back.  As the other player leaves, Joey asks his name; he answers, "My name? Call me Gabe. Short for Gabriel."
Joey wakes up on the street, just after his collision; he is shaken but otherwise unharmed.  The driver of the truck, not wanting his driving record tarnished, pushes some money into Joey's hand, enough for him to buy his trumpet back.
That night, while Joey is playing to himself, a girl (Mary Webster) approaches to express her appreciation. Introducing herself as Nan, she explains that she is new to the city; excited to be connected to another human being, Joey offers to show her the town.
