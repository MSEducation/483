</ref>  Boris dispatched emissaires led by the [[kavhan]] [[Peter (diplomat)|Peter]] with a long list of questions to [[Pope Nicholas I]] at Rome in August 866, and obtained 106 detailed answers, detailing the essence of [[religion]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[convention (norm)|custom]]s and personal [[faith]].  Stemming from his concerns with the baptism of the Bulgarians, Boris also complained to Nicholas about the abuses perpetrated by the Byzantine priests responsible for baptizing the Bulgarians and how he could go about correcting the consequences resulting from these abuses. The pope temporarily glossed over the controversial question of the autocephalous status desired by Boris for his church and sent a large group of missionaries to continue the conversion of Bulgaria in accordance with the western rite.<ref name="Duffy, 2006, p. 103">Duffy, 2006, p. 103</ref> Bulgaria's shift towards the Papacy infuriated Patriarch Photios who wrote an encyclical to the eastern clergy in 867, in which he denounced the practices associated with the western rite and Rome's ecclesiastical intervention in Bulgaria.<ref name="Duffy, 2006, p. 103"/> This occasioned the [[Photian Schism]], which was a major step in the rift between the eastern and western churches.
To deliver his response to Boris’ questions, Pope Nicholas I sent two bishops to Bulgaria: Paul of Populonia and Formosus of Porto. While he intended that these popes would execute their episcopal responsibilities to address the Boris’ concerns, the pope did not intend for these bishops to be elevated to the positions that they assumed in the Bulgar hierarchy. In Bulgaria the activities of the papal legate Bishop Formosus (later Pope Formosus) met with success, until the pope rejected Boris' request to nominate Formosus archbishop of Bulgaria. Nicholas justified the request rejection by arguing that it was “uncanonical to transfer an already established bishop from one see to another”. The new Pope Adrian II refused Boris' request for a similar nomination of either Formosus or Deacon Marinus (later Pope Marinus I), after which Bulgaria began to shift towards Constantinople once again.  At the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 870 the position of the Bulgarian church was reopened by Bulgarian envoys, and the eastern patriarchs adjudicated in favor of Constantinople.  This determined the future of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which was granted the status of an autocephalous archbishopric by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and an archbishop of its own. Later in the 870s, the Patriarch of Constantinople surrendered Bulgaria to the Papacy, but this concession was purely nominal, as it did not affect the actual position of Bulgaria's autocephalous church.[ref]

The Christianization of the Bulgarian as a result of Boris’ actions had profound changes not only to the religious belief system of the Bulgars but also the structure of the Bulgarian government. The conversion to Christianity demanded an expansion of the power of the khan.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] As a result, the position of the khan was elevated from a war chieftain to that of a true chief of state possessing powers such as the authority over territory and the ability to conduct foreign policy.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Boris not only gained the powers of a true chief of state but the responsibility of being a kind of guardian of the body of truth as dictated by Christianity.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] 
By 880, it seemed that Boris could mold the Bulgarian clerical hierarchy that had developed as he wished so that it was not concerned with any further disputes regarding what jurisdiction the Bulgarian nation was a part of.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] To this end, towards the end of his reign, Boris began to increase the number of native Bulgarian clergy. Consequently, Boris began to send Bulgarians to Constantinople to obtain a monastic education and some of these Bulgarians returned to their homeland to serve as clergymen.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] In 885, Boris was presented with a new opportunity to establish a native clergy when Slavic-speaking disciples of St. Methodius were forced to flee from Moravia after a German-inspired reaction to the death of the apostle.[tpl]source needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Changes to Bulgarian culture brought on by Clement and Naum===

In 886 Boris' governor of Belgrade welcomed the disciples of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, who were exiled from Great Moravia into Bulgaria and sent them on to Boris in Pliska. Boris happily greeted two of these disciples, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav, who were of noble Bulgarian origin. To utilize the disciple’s talents, Boris commissioned Clement to be a “teacher” of a territory of a province in the Macedonian area of the Bulgar realm.
Both Clement and Nahum were instrumental in furthering the cultural, linguistic and spiritual works of Cyril and Methodius. [ref]
