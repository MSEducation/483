== Career == 
In 1982, Ishii directed Burst City, an action film about a wild gang of quasi-mutant bikers who ride into a town staging protests against the construction of a nearby nuclear reactor plant. The film starred members of Japanese punk bands The Roosters, The Rockers, The Stalin and Inu, among others. He became a favorite among rebel and punk cineastes in Japan. The film is also credited as a precursor to the underground Japanese cyberpunk movement that emerged later in the decade.[tpl]cite web|last=Player|first=Mark|title=Post-Human Nightmares: The World of Japanese Cyberpunk|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/post-human-nightmares-the-world-of-japanese-cyberpunk-cinema.shtml|publisher=Midnight Eye|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011[/tpl]
