[[Vertical translation]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary geometry

In function graphing, a vertical translation is a related graph which, for every point (x, y); has a y value which differs from another graph, by exactly some constant c. For example, the antiderivatives of a family are vertical translations of each other.
