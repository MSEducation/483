[[Shade tree]]

CATEGORIES: Trees

A shade tree is any tree grown specifically for its shade. This term usually applies to large trees with spreading canopies. Shade trees are effective in reducing the energy used in cooling homes.
Some of the most popular shade trees in temperate countries are oaks, maples, ashes, lindens, and elms. 
In tropical countries trees such as the African tulip tree, Hopea odorata and some Erythrina species are often planted as shade trees.AgroForestryTree Database - Species information

==Planting==

Things to look for when choosing a shade tree include deciduousness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations.
Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a garden by obstructing the view.  A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens.
Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches, causing rapidly expanding fires.
