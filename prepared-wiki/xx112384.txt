==Controversy==

===Lil' Mo===

A feud between Keyshia Cole and R&B singer Lil' Mo originated in August 2005 via controversial radio series Star and Buc Wild Morning Show, the lead hosts of whom were well noted in the press for ridiculing the death of Mo's close friend Aaliyah.[tpl]cite web|last1=Rush|first1=George|last2=Molloy|first2=Joanna|last3=Ogunnaike|first3=Lola|last4=Anderson|first4=Kasia|title=Star Falls Faster after Aaliyah 'Joke'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/star-falls-faster-aaliyah-joke-article-1.929910|work=New York Daily News|date=31 August 2001|accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl] While on the show, allegations of Mo criticizing Keyshia Cole's presence in the industry were made, where Mo was reported to have compared Cole's vocal talent to "new" chicks like Ashanti. Angered, Keyshia Cole rushed to Dream Hotel in New York, where Lil' Mo's manager Phil Thornton and a stylist were preparing a concert venue. Cole angrily questioned the two why they were present; the pair responded that they wanted to see Mo. Cole in response stated, "You all are traitors. Mo is the enemy," and immediately rushed off. Lil' Mo stated that witnesses from the scene recalled Cole being "drunk".[tpl]cite web|last=Murray|first=Jawn|title=Inside the Buzz|url=http://blackvoices.aol.com/black_entertainment/bvbuzzcanvas?id=20050822102109990001|work=AOL Black Voices|publisher=AOL|date=23 August 2005|accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] On October 7, 2005, during her interview with Angie Martinez on Hot 97, Keyshia Cole challenged Lil' Mo's take on the event and cited her own side of the story being true; insituating that Lil' Mo was a liar.[tpl]cite web|title=Buzz Notes > Keyshia "Troll" Cole Clears The Air|url=http://www.crunktastical.net/2005/10/15/buzz-notes-31/|work=Crunk + Disorderly|publisher=crunktastical.net|date=15 October 2005|accessdate=16 January 2014[/tpl]

But, just a couple of weeks ago you just said that Beyoncé was your queen and you dissed Michelle ... You can't get mad.

Despite the exchanges, in May 2013, Mo addressed to The Breakfast Club that there was no beef between her and Cole. She added, "I felt some type of way, she shaded Michelle first. I feel like when you try to attack (what you think is) the weakest link, be careful. Why are you tryin' to come for Beyoncé? She's at the Superbowl. Bitch you ain't there.
