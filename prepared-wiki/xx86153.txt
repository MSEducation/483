==Episodes==

===Operation 01: Curious Fruit===

An innocent girl named Ai is lured by her curiosity into the underground world of sado-masochists and exhibitionists by a couple who visits the club where she and her girlfriends are visiting.  For some strange reason, Ai follows the two, and is drawn into a world of bondage and rough sex.  The experience transforms the girl, who embraces the lifestyle, and a weird but romantic relation with a man she is drawn to and will most likely marry.

===Operation 02: Sacred Girl===

A reclusive young man and his sister live in a mansion, where the young man frequently hosts sex parties, which he watches in his room via a network of surveillance cameras. It is later revealed that he wants to have sex with his sister, which he eventually does in a consensual scene near the end of the episode.

===Operation 03: Lover Doll / Winter Swimsuit / Enema===

====Lover Doll====

An anthropomorphic female rabbit is held in a cell as sexual slave. Soon, a Catgirl enters her room and has sex with the rabbit through the cell. Later, a man comes in and punishes the Catgirl for wandering off, then proceeds to rape her.

====Winter Swimsuit====

With a subtle BDSM premise, a couple has sex in what seems to be a closed public bath house in the middle of winter. A reluctant girl is fondled, has her bathing suit cut off to expose her erogenous zones, and is coerced into performing various sex acts by her unnamed male partner.

====Enema====

An unnamed girl is coaxed into having sex in the women's bathroom.  The ensuing sex acts culminate in anal sex which cures her constipation.

===Operation 04: Kirei===

In what seems to be an island paradise, two well-endowed girls called Rui and Kirei are on vacation.  As time progresses, they notice that there is something unusual with the natives and the beautiful butterflies that inhabit the island.  As they begin to notice these oddities, they begin to have sex with each other and the natives.  The episode ends with the girls being gang raped, thrown down a chute, and emerging as butterflies.

===Operation 05: Seek I (Slave Girl Marino)===

Marino, a virgin, is captured by the dominatrix Saki and her unnamed master.  Saki and her master spend the episode training Marino to be their sex slave, a process which involves Marino being forced to perform various sex acts and submit to the demands of her masters.  As the episode progresses, it becomes apparent that Saki's current master is actually the son of her original master, now deceased.  Saki's original master made a living as a world-famous bondage artist.  This, however, was only his public face.  His true face was that of a masochist female dominator.  The episode culminates with Marino being left chained in a cell to await her next "session".

===Operation 06: Seek II (SM Queen Saki)===

This episode is a continuation of Operation 05, and takes place during a sex party commemorating the anniversary of Saki's master's death.  Saki presents the guests with a gift: Marino and two other girls (Momomi and Haruka), as their sex toys for the evening.  Despite the introduction of new characters, this episode focuses mostly on Saki and her relationship with her previous master.  Scenes of Saki reminiscing about her S&M training as a child are interspersed with displays of Marino and the other girls being subjected to humiliation and torture at Saki's hands.  As Saki masturbates to thoughts of her deceased master, the three slaves enter the room, armed with bondage equipment, and take Saki back to the main party hall.  Here, her current master presents Saki to the party guests for their enjoyment.  Saki is subjected to much the same treatment to which she earlier exposed the other girls and is gang-raped; the episode ends with Saki being chained in a cell of her own.

===Operation 07: Yellow Star===

Ayana's mother remarries a famous detective, who had been following the distribution of an illegal drug, called "yellow star", which is a mild hallucinogen, paralyzing agent, and aphrodisiac.  As the story continues, it becomes apparent that the detective is buying a steady supply of the illegal drug so he can sexually abuse his stepdaughter.  The abuse escalates to gang rape involving her, her stepfather, and two of the drug manufacturers.  After the incident, Ayana kills her stepfather and returns to a normal life with her boyfriend, Kohei.  In the final scene, Ayana waits in a park for her boyfriend but is abducted before they can meet.  The two men who kidnapped her are soon revealed to be distributors of "yellow star" and force her into another round with them.
The character designer for this episode was Yasuomi Umetsu.  It can be seen as a precursor to Kite.

Maya is transported to another world, where she meets 2 lizard like creatures who use trickery to convince her to take all of her clothes off where she is sold into slavery to Lord Estilgar, and used in experiments to turn her into a sex slave.  She escapes and evades recapture by using a hidden power within herself to slaughter her opponents.  This display of power gets the attention of two warring human and alien factions.  Maya is recaptured, subjected to more sexual experiments, and is transformed into a hermaphrodite.

Continuing the story, Maya is transferred to a dominatrix who is given instructions to break her will and turn her into a sex slave.

In captivity, Maya meets another slave, Leyna, who is not used for sex.  They escape, but are quickly caught. The dominatrix implants an alien mass into Maya's uterus through her mechanically stretched vagina to lower her inhibitions and forces her to copulate with Leyna. As she is about to succumb to her sexual desires, Maya unleashes her hidden power and becomes the warrior prophesied.

===Operation 10: Binding===

Masaki stays the night and soon realizes that he has stumbled into a S&M situation.  The oldest woman is the mistress of the house and the younger women are her slaves.  This leads to his voyeuristic observation of various sexual acts, before actually engaging in sex with several of the residents.  Eventually there's an earthquake which destroys the house, though Masaki and one of the girls manage to escape.  The episode ends with the two of them walking along the train tracks before a train roars towards them.  Right before impact however, Masaki wakes up, still on the train with his sketch book in his lap.  He opens the book and sees a drawing of the girl who left with him.

===Operation 11: Fallen Angel Rina===

Pop idol Rina is renowned for her amazing stage shows and musical talent, which gets her noticed by a new production company, Angel Productions.  At one of her concerts, she learns that her father has suffered a medical emergency, and has been hospitalized.  The manager of Angel Productions approaches her about switching to their company, and after learning her father owes the company a substantial amount of money and that the company is apparently part of a mob-related conglomerate, she agrees to sign on with them.
It turns out that AngelPro also works in the flesh peddling business, and under the guise of giving her a "new image", they begin to train Rina through drugs, public humiliation scenarios, and outfits. Among these humiliations she is taken to a sex shop pretending to be a porn actress and masturbates in a porn cinema.  Once her training has culminated, she's auctioned off at a BDSM auction as a sex slave for 580 million yen (roughly $5.9 million USD).  Six months later she returns to her career as a singer.  The manager and his assistant/slave are backstage, discussing how Rina turned out to be a good buy. In the backstage it is revealed her father had already died during her training.
At the end of her performance, Rina strips and begins masturbating with her microphone before finally losing her mind. The representatives from AngelPro walk off, and Rina's manager collapses to the floor in disbelief. The final shot shows the all male audience rushing the stage and crowding around her as she smiles vacantly, with a tear streaming down her cheek.
