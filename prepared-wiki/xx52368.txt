CATEGORIES: Bachelor's degrees

The Bachelor of Applied Science, often abbreviated as B.AS., BAS, BSAS, BASc, B.ASc., or BAppSc, is an undergraduate degree awarded for a course of study that generally lasts three to four years in the United Kingdom and Australia, and four to six years in Canada, the Netherlands and the United States.

==Usage==

In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) is equivalent to the Bachelor of Engineering, and is classified as a professional degree. In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree. However, in the United States it is also considered a highly specialized professional technical degree; the Bachelor of Applied Science is an applied baccalaureate, typically containing advanced technical training (e.g. military training) in sciences combined with liberal arts that traditional degrees do not have. All the general education courses are valid courses if taken at accredited universities and colleges that have Regional accreditation. Hence, an earned BAS degree does include having to take upper-division coursework as required in addition to traditional bachelor degree programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/degrees/index.php |title=Penn Engineering - Majors |publisher=Seas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://asuonline.asu.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-applied-science-health-sciences |title=Applied Science (Health Sciences) (BAS) | Online Degree Programs |publisher=Asuonline.asu.edu |date=2011-04-13 |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl]
The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree is designed to grow professional management skills of the learner and meet the demand for leadership of highly technical professionals in the workplace. A Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree requires an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree, a minimum of 4-years of professional development or additional classes in an approved field,  professional certifications or approved military training, and 2-years of upper level college courses. This degree takes longer than a basic traditional degree because of the specialized technical skill level and professional development requirements. Most people who pursue this degree are already experienced professional adults that are working towards an advanced graduate degree or interested in upward mobility in their field.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wbu.edu/academics/undergraduate_programs/degrees_offered/bachelor_of_applied_science/ |title=Wayland Baptist University | Academics | Undergraduate Programs | Bachelor of Applied Science |publisher=Wbu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl]
The Associate of Applied Science (AAS) is historically considered a technical degree in the United States.The Adult Learner and the Applied Baccalaureate (University of Illinois) An accredited AAS degree is a 2 to 3-year degree that articulates well with advanced academics and/or approved technical programs. A high school diploma and entry level testing is necessary for college acceptance. The AAS provides opportunities for advanced learning through 4-year undergraduate studies in approved fields that will transfer to an accredited BAS program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alamo.edu/ |title=Alamo Colleges : District : Homepage |publisher=Alamo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl] 
On 20 February 2009 the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Ronald Plasterk, proposed to replace all the existing degrees offered by Dutch vocational universities, such as the BBA, BEd and BEng, with the BAA and the BASc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.regering.nl/Actueel/Pers_en_nieuwsberichten/2009/februari/20/Voorstel_titel_voor_elke_afgestudeerde_aan_HBO |title=Website of the Dutch government |publisher=Regering.nl |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl]
