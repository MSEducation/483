Herodotus reported that lions had been common in Greece in 480 BC; they attacked the baggage camels of the Persian king Xerxes on his march through the country. Aristotle considered them rare by 300 BC. By 100 AD they were extirpated.Schaller, p. 5.

==Population and conservation status==

Most lions now live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30–50% decline per 20 years in the late half of the 20th century. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bauer, H.; Van Der Merwe, S. |year= 2002|title=The African lion database |journal=Cat news |volume=36 |pages=41–53[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Chardonnet, P. |year=2002|title=Conservation of African lion|url=http://conservationforce.org/pdf/conservationoftheafricanlion.pdf|publisher =International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife|location=Paris, France[/tpl] down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950.

There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem.

Conservation of both African and Asian lions has required the setup and maintenance of national parks and game reserves; among the best known are Etosha National Park in Namibia, Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and Kruger National Park in eastern South Africa.

The former popularity of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes twelve lions at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent, England that are descended from animals owned by the King of Morocco.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigcatrescue.org/barbary_lion_news.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051217091555/http://www.bigcatrescue.org/barbary_lion_news.htm |archivedate=17 December 2005 |title=Barbary Lion News |accessdate=24 September 2007[/tpl] Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.
Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.

===In captivity===

Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that are the core of zoo exhibits since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible.de Courcy, p. 81 Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,de Courcy, p. 82 there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes.[tpl]cite web|last1= Dollinger | first1= P |last2= Geser | first2= S| title= Lion: In the Zoo (subpage) |work=Visit the Zoo|publisher=WAZA (World Association of Zoos and Aquariums)|url= http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/visit-the-zoo/cats-1254385523/panthera-leo| accessdate=5 April 2011[/tpl] Lions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu, Hawaii, died at age 22 in August 2007.

At the ancient Egyptian cities of Taremu and Per-Bast were temples to the lioness goddesses of Egypt, Sekhmet and Bast and at Taremu there was a temple to the son of the deity, Maahes the lion prince, where live lions were kept and allowed to roam within his temple. The Greeks called the city Leontopolis, the "City of Lions" and documented that practice.
Lions were kept and bred by Assyrian kings as early as 850 BC, and Alexander the Great was said to have been presented with tame lions by the Malhi of northern India.[tpl]Cite book|last= Smith |first=Vincent Arthur|title= The Early History of India|year=1924|page=97|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=[/tpl] Later in Roman times, lions were kept by emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas or for executions (see bestiarii, damnatio ad bestias, and venatio).

The first European "zoos" spread amongst noble and royal families in the thirteenth century, and until the seventeenth century were called seraglios; at that time, they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 19–21, 42. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, Lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the thirteenth century,Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 20.[tpl]cite web|last=Owen|first=James|title=Medieval Lion Skulls Reveal Secrets of Tower of London "Zoo"|work=National Geographic Magazine|publisher=National Geographic|date=3 November 2005|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1103_051103_tower_lions.html| accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his palace in Woodstock, near Oxford; where lions had reportedly been stocked by William of Malmesbury.Blunt, p. 15.
Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and elephants, in particular, symbolised power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 24–28.
The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou the wife of Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time.Blunt, p. 16. The menagerie was open to the public by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.Blunt, p. 17. A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century.de Courcy, pp. 8–9. The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV, and animals transferred to the London Zoo which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828.Blunt, p. 32.
The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than giant pandas.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 122. Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 114, 117. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 113. Explorers and hunters exploited a popular Manichean division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures. This resulted in big cats, always suspected of being man-eaters, representing "both the fear of nature and the satisfaction of having overcome it."Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 173, 180–83.
Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.Blunt, p. 208. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.de Courcy, p. 69. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park. Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam.
There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness Elsa, who was raised by George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.

===Baiting and taming===

Lion-baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in Vienna by 1800 and England in 1825.[tpl]Cite book|last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825–1826 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=25 January 2011|year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |page=26 |chapter=July |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080624080642/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |archivedate= 24 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |date=November 1997 |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding Of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424001716/http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archivedate=24 April 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl]
Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).[tpl]Cite book| first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 [/tpl]

==Cultural depictions==

The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong and noble. A common depiction is their representation as "king of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,[tpl]Cite book|last = Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn = 0-671-21773-9[/tpl] as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several fables of the sixth century BC Greek storyteller Aesop.[tpl]Cite book| author = Aesop | editor-last = Gibbs | editor-first = L |title= Fables |series=Oxford World's Classics |year=2002 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= 0-19-284050-9[/tpl]
Representations of lions date back to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The sculpture has been determined to be at least 32,000 years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago.Martin Bailey Ice Age Lion Man is world’s earliest figurative sculpture The Art Newspaper, 31 January 2013, accessed 01 February 2013.

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in Chinese art.
