==History==

thumb|left|Lady JusticeThe building, completed in 1886, was the second courthouse in the county.  The first courthouse in the county, a 20-by-24 foot one-story stone building, was built in 1857. It served as the location for the trial of 392 Dakota Indians after the Sioux Uprising. Thirty-eight Dakota were simultaneously hanged in December 1862.
By the late 1800s, the county commissioners felt that the previous buildings were a "disgrace and gave strangers that we were behind the times.  That the county was either poverty stricken or greatly lacking in enterprise."[tpl]cite book|title=Courthouses of Minnesota|last=Logue|first=Mary|author2=Douglas Ohman|year=2006|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|isbn=0-87351-550-1[/tpl]  The new building combined a Second Empire roof and dome with Italianate features.  The stone was provided by a local quarry, with various techniques giving it both rusticated and ashlar surfaces.  The copper-sheathed dome is capped with a statue of Lady Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mncourts.gov/?siteID=0&page=CourtHouseProfile&ID=40006|title=Building Location Details: Blue Earth County Courthouse|publisher=Minnesota Judicial Branch|accessdate=2007-06-17[/tpl]
