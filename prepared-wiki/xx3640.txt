==Population==

According to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects the total population was 7,621,000 in 2010, compared to only 1,487,000 in 1950 (a fivefold increase in 60 years). The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.3% was 65 years or older

==Vital statistics==

Registration of vital events is in Honduras not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.

==Ethnic groups==

"Mestizos", (European mixed with Amerindian) make up more than 90% of the country, with only 6% Amerindians and 1% AfroHonduran people.
As in other Latin American countries, the question of racial breakdown of a national population is problematic. Since the beginning of the 20th century at least, Honduras has framed itself as a "mestizo" country, ignoring and at times disparaging both the African component of the population and often also the surviving indigenous population that was still regarded as pure blood.Dario Euraque, "The Threat of Blackness to the Mestizo Nation: Race and Ethnicity in the Honduran Banana Economy, 1920s and 1930s," in Steve Striffler and Mark Moberg, eds. Banana Wars: Power, Production and History in the Americas (Duke University Press, 2003), pp. 229-49.Dario Euraque, "Antropólogos, archaeólogos, imperialismo y la mayanicación de Honduras, 1890-1940," Revista Historia 45 (2002): 73-103 Because of social stigmas attached, many people denied having African ancestry, and after African descended Caribbean workers arrived in Honduras, an active campaign to denigrate all people of African descent, made persons of mixed race anxious to deny any African ancestry. Hence official statistics quite uniformly under represent those people who have ancestry in favor of a "two race" solution.

===Amerindian===

According to the 2001 census the Amerindian population in Honduras included 381,495 people (6.3% of the total popuation).http://www.unicef.org/lac/HONDURAS_revisado.pdf With the exception of the Lenca and the Ch'orti' they still keep their language.
Six different Amerindian groups were counted at the 2001 census:

===Afro-Honduran===

The Afro-Honduran population consists of Garifuna and Creoles.

===Other ethnicities===

Honduras hosts a significant Palestinian community (the vast majority of whom are Christian Arabs).The Arabs of Honduras. Larry Luxner. Saudi Aramco World. These Arab-Hondurans are sometimes called "Turcos", because they arrived in Honduras using Turkish travel documents, as their homeland was then under the control of the Ottoman Empire.  The Palestinians arrived in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, establishing themselves especially in the city of San Pedro Sula.http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=639
There is also a small Chinese community in Honduras. A lawyer of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) stated that the Chinese community in Honduras is rather small. Many of the Chinese are immigrants who arrived from China after the revolution and their descendants.http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22523,4565c25f287,3ae6ad3818,0,,,HND.html.
