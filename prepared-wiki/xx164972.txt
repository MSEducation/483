==Professional career==

Hope has taught at Harvard Law School in addition to multiple adjunct appointments at Georgetown. She served as vice chair of the President's Commission on Organized Crime under President Ronald Reagan, her tenure spanning years in which federal prosecution of organized crime made some of its greatest strides in American history.  In the administration of President Gerald Ford, Hope served as associate director of the White House Domestic Council.  She was the first woman on Harvard University’s governing board, the Harvard Corporation, where she served from 1989 to 2000 and chaired among other committees the Inspection Committee.
Hope was a partner and senior advisor at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky, and Walker, for 24 years, serving as the first woman on that firm's (then) four-person governing Executive Committee.  She is the chair emerita of the National Housing Partnership Foundation, Director of the Altius Financial Corporation, and a member of the National Council of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni.  She has served in governing roles and as Chair of the Audit Committee of a number of Fortune 500 companies, including (currently) Union Pacific. She is on the Board of Directors of Russell Reynolds Associates and The Castleton Festival.

==Judicial nomination==

In April 1988, President Reagan nominated Hope to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and, more specifically, to the seat vacated by Robert Bork and later filled by Clarence Thomas.  Although not seen as controversial, Hope's nomination fell victim to election-year stalling by Senate Democrats, and nomination expired without an up or down vote by the end of 1988, when Congress adjourned.http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/us/washington-talk-briefing-a-second-chance.html  Reagan's successor, President George H. W. Bush, did not renew the nomination, and possibly, the New York Times speculated, as Hope served as General Counsel to Bush's primaries opponent in 1988, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/us/washington-talk-briefing-a-second-chance.html  Bush ultimately tapped Clarence Thomas for the seat.
