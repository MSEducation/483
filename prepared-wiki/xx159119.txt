USS ''Miantonomah'' (ACM-13/MMA-13) was built as the US Army Mine Planter USAMP Col. Horace F. Spurgin (MP-14) for the U.S. Army by Marietta Manufacturing Co., Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1943. Col. Horace F. Spurgin was christened by Mrs. Barbee Rothgeb. Col. Horace F. Spurgin was transferred from the US Army to the US Navy and commissioned as ACM-13 on 25 January 1950.

==Army Service==

USAMP Col. Horace F. Spurgin MP-14 is known to have served in Sausalito, California at Fort Baker's Submarine Mine Depot supporting the San Francisco Bay Coast Artillery defenses with the USAMP Gen. Samuel M. Mills. The ship became the prototype for correction of a deficiency in engine order telegraphs to extend them to bridge wings. One commercial system was installed on USAMP Col. Alfred A. Maybach while a second, fabricated and installed by Chief Engineer CWO John B. May, aboard Col. Horace F. Spurgin became the recommended correction for all M1 type Mine Planters.

==Navy Service==

Commissioned as ACM-13 at Treasure Island on 25 January 1950 under the command of Lt. Harold G. Gibson. Assigned to the 12th Naval District, based at US Naval Station, Treasure Island, California, the unnamed auxiliary minelayer operated out of San Francisco Bay along the California coast training for harbor defense. In addition she towed sea targets and supported fleet gunnery exercises.
The ship was involved with the transition of harbor defense responsibilities from Army to Navy as shown in photographs in the March 1950 issue of All Hands magazine. The Fort Baker Submarine Mine Depot was in close proximity to the Naval School, Harbor Defense, Fort Winfield Scott, San Francisco, California in which Naval Reserve personnel were trained for duties previously performed by Army Coast Artillery Corps personnel. Both services would man the Harbor Entrance Control Post (HECP).[tpl]cite journal  |title=Learning How to Defend Our Harbors |magazine=All Hands |number=397 |date=March 1950 |pages=23â€“26 |publisher=Bureau of Naval Personnel |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah195003.pdf |format=pdf[/tpl] [tpl]linknote|note=File size: 29.5MB[/tpl]
