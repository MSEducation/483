The development of Region 2 has traditionally centred around the N1, the main highway that links Johannesburg to Pretoria to the north.  Housing in Region 2 is mostly formal with many affluent suburbs.  Midrand has not had much significant development, so a lot of open space remains.  Region 2 currently has a population of 200,000.  While many people in Region 2 are wealthy, the vast majority of residents are poor: 36% earn no reported income at all.
