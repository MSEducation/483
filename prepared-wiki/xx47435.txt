Television broadcasting started in the :United Kingdom in 1936 as public service free of advertising. Now there is a collection of free and subscription services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 480 channelsTaking the base Sky EPG TV Channels. A breakdown is impossible due to a) the number of platforms, b) duplication of services, c) regional services, d) part time operations, and e) audio. For the Sky platform alone, there are basically 485 TV Stations, additionally 57 "timeshifted versions", 36 HDTV versions, 42 regional TV options, 81 audio channels, and 5 promotion channels as of mid-2010 for consumers as well as on-demand content. There are six main channel owners who are responsible for most viewing. There are 27,000 hours of domestic content produced a year at a cost of £2.6 billion.Taking the data from note 1 above, this is a very crude estimate As of 24 October 2012, all television broadcasts in the United Kingdom are in a digital format, following the end of analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland. Digital content is delivered via terrestrial, satellite and cable as well as over IP.

==Television providers==

Free and subscription providers are available, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the programme guide (EPG), video on demand (VOD), high-definition (HD), interactive television via the red button, and coverage across the UK. Set-top boxes are generally used to receive these services; however Integrated digital televisions (IDTVs) can also be used to receive Freeview or Freesat. Most TVs sold in the UK come with a DVB-T (terrestrial) tuner for Freeview – a rare thing in Europe. BT TV and TalkTalk Plus TV, both based on YouView, utilise hybrid boxes which receive Freeview as well as additional subscription services. Households viewing TV from the internet (YouTube, Joost, downloads etc.) are not tracked by Ofcom. The UK's five most watched channels, BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, are available from all providers.

===Analogue terrestrial television===

====VHF 405 Line Monochrome====

The first regular TV broadcasts started in 1936. Transmissions were originated by the BBC, using the Band I-VHF 405-line television system. In 1955, a second commercial service was created using the higher Band III VHF 405-line television system, administered by the Independent Television Authority. Both systems were superseded and finally closed in 1985.

====UHF 625 Line Colour Service====

A decision was made to introduce a nationally co-ordinated network of transmitters using the UHF 625-line television system. The first station to appear on this system was BBC 2 in April 1964. From 1969, the two VHF services also started to use this network, which took many years to complete. One reason for the long switch-over period was the difficulty in matching the coverage level of the new UHF 625 line service with the very high level of geographic coverage achieved with the 405-line VHF service. Whereas the VHF system had less than 200 transmitters at approximately 100 locations at closure, the UHF system numbered more than 4,500 transmitters at over 1,100 sites.
Over the next 30 years, whilst the network of transmitters expanded, two additional commercial services were offered (Channel 4 and Channel 5).
Since 1998, a small number of local channels have operated under Restricted service licences. These ceased by 2012.
Analogue terrestrial transmissions finally ceased on 24 October 2012 following the shutdown of the last remaining analogue transmitters in Northern Ireland, with the rest of the United Kingdom having undergone switchover in the four years prior to this. See Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom for more information. Some of the frequencies previously used for analogue television would be used for new high-power digital terrestrial television services, while others were earmarked for use by 4G mobile data networks.
As of January 2009, BBC One, BBC Two, ITV and Channel 4 broadcast from a network of 1,134 transmitters. Channel 5 broadcasts from 52 transmitters, and the Restricted Service Licence stations broadcast from 14 transmitters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wolfbane.com/uktv.htm |title=UK Television Stations (UHF Analogue System) |publisher=Wolfbane.com |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] See :Category:Transmitter sites in the United Kingdom for information on some of these. The transmitters are operated by Arqiva.

====NICAM-728====

Without affecting the definition of the "PAL-I" system, the UK also used a digital stereo companding system on analogue terrestrial television called NICAM. Standing for Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex and used for digital stereo TV broadcasts to the public, it used the NICAM digital audio system used since the early 1970s for transmitting the audio carrier signal of a broadcast between two or more regional broadcasters and sometimes to the transmitters, where it was converted back to an analogue FM audio carrier almost 6 MHz above the video carrier signal.
Reception of the NICAM signal was possible provided the user had a VCR or a TV capable of decoding the NICAM signal, which was broadcast on a carrier 6.552 MHz above the video carrier, and thus just 0.552 MHz above the FM mono audio carrier. The first UK NICAM stereo broadcast was made in May 1986 on BBC2, NICAM slowly being rolled out across the UK and across the broadcaster's programme schedules over the next 5 years, culminating in the official launch of NICAM on the BBC in 1991, ITV and Channel 4 having begun broadcasting NICAM in 1989 and 1990 respectively.
The service is sometimes referred to by its full, official, name, NICAM-728 – the 728 denoting the datarate (728kps) of the digital stereo information. Adaptive DPCM.
As of 2012, and the close of the analogue service, the NICAM digital stereo system will be obsolete. It has been superseded by digital stereo and surround-sound audio systems on digital TV platforms.

===Digital terrestrial television===

Digital terrestrial television launched in 1998 as a subscription service named ONdigital. Since October 2002, the primary broadcaster is Freeview, with BT TV providing additional subscription services.
Ofcom reports that, at the end of June 2009, there are

===Cable television===

There are three providers of cable television, targeting different geographic areas within the UK. In all cases cable TV is a subscription service normally bundled with a phone line and broadband.
Smallworld Cable is available in south-west Scotland and north-west England. Pricing ranges from £10.50 (cost of phone line with 'free' TV) to £80 per month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smallworldmedia.com/default.aspx?page=prices |title=Price Guide |publisher=Smallworldmedia.com |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]

Virgin also market V+, a digital video recorder and high-definition receiver.
Virgin Media is the only cable provider to supply high-definition television and video on demand, although these aren't available in areas provided with their analogue TV service.

===Satellite television===

There are three distinctly marketed direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services (also known as direct-to-home (DTH), to be distinguished from satellite signals intended for non-consumer reception).
Sky is a subscription service owned by BSkyB. It is the dominant satellite provider with the largest number of channels compared to other providers. As of September 2011, subscription starts at £20 per month and rises to £52 per month. Installation is from £0 to £180 depending on the chosen set-top-box.[tpl]cite web|author=0.5 |url=http://www.sky.com/portal/site/skycom/skyproducts/skytv/pricesandpackages |title=Sky Products>Sky TV>Prices and Packages |publisher=BSkyB |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] Additional pay-per-view films, events and individual subscription channels are available. Sky TV markets Sky+ and Sky+HD, digital video recorders; the latter additionally provides high-definition television. Sky TV also provides video on demand branded as 'On Demand'
Freesat from Sky, is a free satellite service owned by BSkyB. Installation is priced at £75 or £150, which includes the receiver, dish, viewing card and access to all free-to-air and free-to-view channels in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freesatfromsky.co.uk/ |title=Home – Freesat from Sky |publisher=Freesatfromsky.co.uk |date=1 January 1980 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] Existing Sky TV customers can also end their ongoing subscriptions, and opt for the Free-To-View viewing card, giving them the Freesat from Sky service. Freesat from Sky does not provide high-definition television or video on demand.
Freesat is a free satellite service created jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. It is the UK's first provider of high definition television without a subscription; one HD channel was available at launch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a95362/in-full-freesat-channels-at-launch.html |title=In full: Freesat channels at launch |work=Digital Spy |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] Freesat now provides five HD channels, BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, ITV HD, Channel 4 HD and NHK World HD. Freesat currently provides the BBC iPlayer in terms of video on demand, which has been rolled out to all compatible HD receivers, and ITV Player is currently testing, available only to Humax boxes at the present time. To access on-demand services, you must have a broadband connection of at least 1 Mbit/s, and an ethernet connection is required (using either a cable or Homeplug adaptors).

===Internet television===

Television received via the Internet may be free, subscription or pay-per-view, and use a variety of distribution methods (e.g. multicast/unicast/peer-to-peer, streamed/downloaded). Playback is normally via a computer and broadband Internet connection, although digital media receivers, media centre computers or video game consoles can be used for playback on televisions, such as the Netgear Digital Entertainer, a computer equipped with Windows Media Center, or a PlayStation 3.
Sky Go is available on the Xbox 360 providing both live and on demand catchup services.
Ofcom does not regulate Internet television, nor consider the use of Internet television in its quarterly reports of digital TV penetration.

====Catch-up services====

Since 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. These services generally block users outside of the UK. TVCatchup is the only service not owned by a current UK broadcaster.

====Other services====

Other Internet TV services may consist of

==Channels and channel owners==

===Viewing statistics===

====Most viewed channels====

The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) measures television ratings in the UK. The following table shows viewing shares from 1992 to 2009 of channels which have once had, or still have, a viewing share of ≥ 1.0%. The figures for 2010 only account for the weeks up until 14 November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/ |title=BARB Viewing Figures |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl]
As of 2009, 15 channels have a viewing share of ≥ 1.0% together accounting for 67.4% of total viewing share. (4 additional channels had a viewing share ≥ 1.0% in 1992 but have since fallen below this). Of the 15 channels, 7 of these collectively had a viewing share of 79.3% in 1992, the largest of which was ITV with a share of 30.5%. As the number of channels rose and with the launch of digital television, the collective share of these channels had declined to 67.8% in 2002, and has remained at about that level ever since. ITV viewing share fell below BBC One in 2002; whist ITV viewing share declined, BBC One has remained stable at about 20% since 2001. Of these 15 channels, 4 are funded by the license fee; 2 are subscription; 7 of these channels launched after 1999. Comparing 1992 to 2009, only Channel 4/S4C has seen an overall increase in viewing share.
NOTE- Figures after 2010 are an average of the monthly viewing figures from BARB.
Since 1992, there are 11 channels which previously had a viewing share of ≥ 1.0%, but which have now fallen below. (These are depicted with grey titles in the table above). In 1992, these channels collectively had a viewing share of 12.8% via analogue satellite and cable television. This peaked in 1998 at 16.5%, coinciding with the launch of digital television. In 2009, the collective viewing share of these 11 channels is 3.5%. The largest individual loss is for a channel now known as Sky Movies Action & Thriller, from 6% in 1992 to 0.1% in 2009. With the exception of Sky News, these are all subscription channels.

====Availability of channels from various providers====

===British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)===

The BBC is the world's oldest and largest broadcaster, and is the country's principal public service broadcaster. The BBC is funded primarily by a television licence and from sales of its programming to overseas markets. It does not carry advertising. The licence fee is levied on all households that watch or record TV as it's being broadcasthttp://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/ and the fee is determined by periodic negotiation between the government and the BBC.
Its analogue channels were BBC One and BBC Two (styled BBC 1 and BBC 2 until 1997). The BBC first began a television service, initially serving London only, in 1936. BBC Television was closed during World War II but reopened in 1946. The second station was launched in 1964. In addition to the now-digital BBC One and Two, the British Broadcasting Corporation also offers BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC News, BBC Parliament, CBBC, CBeebies, BBC Alba and BBC Red Button.

===Independent Television (ITV)===

ITV (Independent Television) is the network of fifteen regional commercial television franchises, originally founded in 1955 to provide competition to the BBC. ITV was the country's first commercial television provider funded by advertisements, and has been the most popular commercial channel through most of its existence. Through a series of mergers, takeovers and relaxation of regulation, twelve of these companies are now owned by ITV plc, two by STV Group plc while UTV remains independent. ITV plc, the operator of all English, Welsh, Southern Scotland and Channel Island franchises, had branded the channel as ITV1 since 2001, with regional names being used prior to regional programmes only since 2002. The ITV name was restored in 2013. STV Group plc, which operates the two other Scottish franchises, has now unified the regions under the single name of STV. UTV, the Northern Ireland franchisee operated by UTV plc, uses its own name on air at all times, while the Channel Television uses the generic ITV stream and its own name prior to regional programmes. ITV has been officially known as Channel 3 since 1990, although this is seldom used to identify itself.
ITV plc also operates digital channels ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV, some with HDTV streams. ITN, a subsidiary, currently holds the national news franchise, ITV Breakfast operates the breakfast franchise and Teletext Ltd operated the national teletext franchise.

===Channel 4===

Launched in 1982, Channel 4 is a state-owned national broadcaster which is funded by its commercial activities (including advertising). Channel 4 has expanded greatly after gaining greater independence from the IBA, especially in the multi-channel digital world launching E4, Film4, More4, 4Music and various timeshift services. Since 2005, it has been a member of the Freeview consortium, and operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplexes with ITV as Digital 3&4. Since the advent of digital television, Channel 4 is now also broadcast in Wales across all digital platforms. Channel 4 was the first British channel not to carry regional variations for programming, however it does have 6 set advertising regions.

===Channel 5===

Channel 5 was the final analogue broadcaster to be launched, in March 1997. Its analogue terrestrial coverage was less than that of the other analogue broadcasters, and broadcast in re-assigned frequencies, often at a lower power from major transmitters only. The UHF analogue network was only designed for 4 channels, and so a small number of additional sites, already used for radio broadcasting, were used to boost coverage. It was also the first terrestrial broadcaster to broadcast on satellite and carry a permanent digital on-screen graphic (DOG). The channel was renamed "Five" in 2002, which saw an overhaul of the channel's identity and removal of the infamous DOG. RTL Group, Europe's largest television broadcaster and a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, took full control of the channel in August 2005. Channel 5 launched two new channels, Five US (now 5USA) and Five Life (now 5*) in October 2006. All of these channels are also carried on satellite television, cable television and digital terrestrial television services. Channel 5 also owned 20% of the digital terrestrial pay-TV provider, Top Up TV. In July 2010, Channel 5 was sold to Richard Desmond's Northern & ShellBusfield, Steve & Robinson, James (23 July 2010). "Richard Desmond buys Channel Five for £103.5m". The Guardian. Retrieved 21 August 2010. which then decided to reinstate the channel's original name, "Channel Five".Sweney, Mark (11 August 2010). "Richard Desmond rebrands Five as Channel 5". The Guardian. Retrieved 21 August 2010. It was then changed to "Channel 5" in February 2011. Like Channel 4, Channel 5 does not have programming regional variations, however it does so for advertising.

===Local television in the United Kingdom===

The previous Secretary of State for Media, Culture, and Sport Jeremy Hunt announced his intentions[tpl]when|date=December 2011[/tpl] to set up a network of local television stations across the UK. The initial plan was to create a network of local television stations, connected through a national backbone. This plan would create a television network similar to that of the network-affiliate model in the United States and Canada.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] In June 2011 it was announced that the national spine plan would be scrapped, and a 'bottom-up' approach would be followed instead, were stations are individually licensed.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Richard Horwood, a former Trinity Mirror executive announced that when the local television stations are first licensed he intends to create a television network called Channel 6; this will be a network of local television stations, with Channel 6 supplying the prime time schedule (similar to the American network-affiliate model).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Another operator which has announced its intentions to set up a network of local television stations with a television network connecting them is City TV Broadcasting. That company says it is basing its operations on the Citytv television system in Canada, but there does not appear to be any official affiliation with the latter's owner, Rogers Communications. City TV is initially bidding on a station to be based in Birmingham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citytvbroadcasting.co.uk/about-city-tv-broadcasting/|title=About City TV Broadcasting|author=City TV Broadcasting|accessdate=17 December 2011[/tpl]

===British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB)===

British Sky Broadcasting operates a satellite television service and numerous television channels including Sky1, Sky2, Pick, Challenge, Sky Atlantic, Sky Living, Sky Livingit, Sky Arts 1, Sky Arts 2, Sky Movies and Sky Sports.

===UKTV===

UKTV is a joint venture between the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and Scripps Networks Interactive (previously co-owned by Virgin Media). Both companies additionally wholly own a number of other channels, broadcast domestically or internationally.
Channels under the joint venture are Alibi, Drama, Dave, Eden, Gold, Good Food, Really, Home, Watch, Yesterday plus a number of timeshift and high-definition services.

===Other channel owners===

The most watched digital channels are owned by the six broadcasters above. Other broadcasters who have secured a notable place on British television include Virgin Media, Viacom, Discovery Networks, Disney & Turner.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

==Programming==

British television differs from other countries, such as the United States, in as much that programmes produced in the United Kingdom do not generally have a long 'season' run of around 20 weeks. Instead, they are produced in a series, a set of episodes varying in length, usually aired over a period of a few months. See List of British television series.

===100 Greatest British Television Programmes===

100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute (BFI), chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened. Although not including any programmes made in 2000 or later, the list is useful as an indication of what were generally regarded as the most successful British programmes of the 20th century.

===Terrestrial channel programming===

====Weekday====

Weekday programming on terrestrial channels begins at 6 am with breakfast national news programmes (along with regional news updates) on BBC One and ITV, with Channel 5. BBC Two also showed children's programming all morning until the end of 2012. That channel now broadcasts repeats of BBC One's daytime programmes. Channel 4 predominately broadcasts comedy and music programmes such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Freshly Squeezed in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:15 am on BBC One and 9:25 am on Daybreak.
Following this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home/garden makeover. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has a soap called Doctors followed by dramas currently occupy the schedule. BBC Two broadcasts repeats of recent BBC one programmes with on-screen signing before airing news and politics programming between 11 am and 1 pm. ITV on the other hand takes over from Daybreak at 9:25 am, and generally broadcasts more human-interest chat-style shows, including The Jeremy Kyle Show, This Morning and Loose Women, in the morning to mid-afternoon slots, with the ITV Lunchtime News (including a regional bulletin) at 1:30 pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a Channel 4 News summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chatshow programmes in the morning including The Wright Stuff with regular news bulletins followed by the last nights Big Brother (when the show is on air). In the afternoon it shows a drama followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as Home and Away and Neighbours and a film.
Until the end of 2012 BBC One showed children's programmes in the late afternoon but the channel now continues to show lifestyle programming until broadcasting the game show Pointless at 5:15 pm. BBC Two used to show lifestyle programming such as Animal Park in the late afternoon before these programmes were switched to BBC One. BBC Two now broadcasts repeats unless it is showing sporting events. ITV shows a lifestyle programme followed by a chat show such as The Alan Titchmarsh Show before repeats of classic ITV shows, such as Heartbeat, Poirot and Midsomer Murders in late-afternoon, before a gameshow-style programme at 5:00 pm, which have included Golden Balls and The Price Is Right.
News bulletins are broadcast between 6 pm and 7 pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national BBC News at Six and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 6.30, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the ITV News at 6:30. Channel 4 News starts at 7 pm.
Primetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps—includingDoctors, EastEnders on BBC One, Coronation Street and Emmerdale on ITV, and Hollyoaks on Channel 4. These soap operas or 'continuing dramas' as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as Holby City, are also fixed to scheduling. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the BBC Red Button service or the built in Electronic Programme Guides.
After midnight, when late evening films are shown, many channels cease broadcasting "normal" programming or simulcast with another channel. Before 2000, the channels simply closed down. However, since then programming has been shown continuously. BBC One will join BBC News in a multichannel simulcast and BBC Two shows a continuous loop of forthcoming programme previews and trailers although prior to the completion of Digital switchover BBC Two had filled its overnight downtime with Pages from Ceefax. Between 2005 and 2007 ITV broadcast the ITV Play strand of phone-in participation TV programmes but now much of the night is dedicated to the text-based ITV information service ITV Nightscreen. Depending on the time of year, Channel 4 will close down to show live feeds of Big Brother (in the summer) and its spin-off, Celebrity Big Brother (in January). Until the end of the 2000s Channel 5 generally showed various sports from around the world, including boxing and football from European leagues as well as live American sport, with phone-in participation-TV Quiz Call on weekends. These days Quiz Call is shown every night of the week.

====Weekend====

Weekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming, as well as afternoon live and recorded coverage of sporting events and films. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring reality or talent game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week.

==Cultural impact==

===Christian morality===

In 1963, Mary Whitehouse incensed by the liberalising policies followed by Sir Hugh Greene, then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign. She subsequently launched the Clean Up TV Campaign, and founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1965. In 2008, Toby Young in an article for The Independent wrote: "On the wider question of whether sex and violence on TV has led to a general moral collapse in society at large, the jury is still out. No one doubts that Western civilization is teetering on the brink ... but it is unfair to lay the blame entirely at the feet of BBC2 and Channel 4."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/culture-why-mary-whitehouse-was-right-all-along-828784.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Culture: Why Mary Whitehouse was right all along | first=Toby | last=Young | date=18 May 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, the BBC's broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera elicited 55,000 complaints,[tpl]cite news|author=James Bone Athens Last updated 1|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1547719,00.html |title=BBC 'right' to screen Jerry Springer musical |work=The Times |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] and provoked protests from Christian organisation Christian Voice,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4158977.stm |title=Protest held over Springer show |publisher=BBC News |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] and a private prosecution against the BBC by the Christian Institute.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4606085.stm |title=Legal threat over Springer opera |publisher=BBC News |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] A summons was not issued.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4098752.stm |title=Springer Opera legal bid rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=16 June 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
In 2007, the General Synod of the Church of England claimed that programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother and Little Britain were eroding moral standards. The Synod criticised broadcasting trends that "exploit the humiliation of human beings for public entertainment", and called for research to determine the behavioural impact of sexual or violent images.[tpl]cite news|last=Petre |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544349/Blame-TV-for-moral-decline-says-Synod.html |title=Blame TV for moral decline, says Synod |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]

==Awards==

The British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) are the most prestigious awards given in the British television industry, analogous to the Emmy Awards in the United States. They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy's Television Committee.
The National Television Awards is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.

==Regulation==

Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom's duties include:
In 2008, Ofcom issued fines to the total of £7.7m. This included £5.67m of fines to ITV companies, including a £3m fine to LWT over voting irregularities on Saturday Night Takeaway, and fines totalling £495,000 to the BBC. Ofcom said phone-in scandals had contributed significantly to the fine totals.[tpl]cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/02/ofcom_tv_fines_hit_77m.html |title=Ofcom TV fines hit£7.7m |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
The Committee for Advertising Practice (CAP, or BCAP) is the body contracted by Ofcom to create and maintain the codes of practice governing television advertising. The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP's web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unnacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licenses if necessary.

==Licensing==

In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, a television licence is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions. The money from the licence fee is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh-language television programmes for S4C. The BBC[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2 March 2005|title=BBC governors set to be scrapped|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4309325.stm|accessdate=18 June 2006[/tpl] gives the following figures for expenditure of licence fee income:

==Recent technical developments==

===Digital television===

Digital television has been available in the UK since 1998 via satellite, cable or terrestrial, and since 1999 via IPTV. It introduced interactive television, 16:9 widescreen, electronic programme guides and audio description. The last analogue terrestrial transmissions ceased on 24 October 2012, meaning all television in the UK is now digital.
Ofcom is tracking digital television penetration as part of the digital switchover, and releases quarterly reports. The report for Q2 2009 states:
Ofcom does not consider households which use Internet television as their primary source, whether connected to a TV set or not, nor television from the mobile TV providers or Freewire.
Broadcast digital television uses the MPEG-2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC technical standards, encapsulated as MPEG transport streams, which are themselves packaged/multiplexed using the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of technical standards.

===Video on demand===

Video on demand (VOD) offers the viewer a choice of programmes in an on-screen programme guide. When the viewer selects a programme to watch, it starts playing immediately. The programmes may be free, pay-per-view or subscription.
Freesat, BT Vision, TalkTalk TV and Virgin Media are the UK's four providers of video on demand delivered via IPTV or cable. They offer a combination of catch-up and archive content from programme makers and channel owners. Virgin is the UK's largest provider of on-demand content, with over 3,000,000 subscribers. Video on demand in the UK is also seeing overseas programme makers such as HBO launching VOD services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a42699/hbo-to-launch-uk-video-on-demand-service.html |title=Cable – News – HBO to launch UK video on demand service |work=Digital Spy |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] Virgin also offers high-definition VOD.
BSkyB and Top Up TV market on Demand and Top Up Anytime. On Demand is available to subscribers of Sky+ or Sky+HD with a particular model of set-top-box. Both are 'push VOD' services which offer access to pre-selected programmes which are played back from the set-top-boxes hard disk drive.
In July 2009, BSkyB stated the intention to launch a full video on demand service in 2010, accessible to Sky+HD subscribers with a broadband Internet connection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2009/3d_tv.htm |title=Sky to launch 3D TV in 2010 following record Sky+HD growth |publisher=BSkyB |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
Internet television also provides access to VOD, e.g. YouTube and other streamed video websites.

===High-definition television===

High-definition television (HDTV) has four to five times as much picture information compared to standard-definition television, which results in sharper pictures. HDTV uses three resolutions, with equipment bearing the HD ready or HD ready 1080p logos to signal their display capability and connectivity. The 1080p logo signifies reproduction of the three HD resolutions without distortion or overscan; however the 1080p resolution itself is not currently used for broadcasting. Unlike standard-definition television, all HD is widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio).
BT Vision, Freesat, Freeview, Sky TV and Virgin Media are the UK's providers of high-definition television. Freesat and Freeview are free, and also provide ITV HD without manual tuning. BT Vision and Virgin Media are the only providers of on-demand high-definition. Sky TV's and Virgin's services are marketed as Sky+ HD and V+ respectively. BT Vision does not offer channels, but pay-per-view programmes which are downloaded and then played back.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
77% of the UK can currently receive Freeview HD with the rest of the country expected to be able to receive Freeview HD by 2012. Reception requires purchase of a set-top-box, IDTV or TV tuner card capable of decoding MPEG-4 and DVB-T2.[tpl]cite web|last=Whitfield |first=Nigel |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/12/03/freeview_hd_launch_report/ |title=Freeview HD goes live • reghardware |publisher=Reghardware.co.uk |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
As of June 2008, there are almost 10 million high-definition TVs in the UK.[tpl]cite web|last=Joseph |first=Cliff |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/06/27/hdtv_in_the_uk/ |title=HD TV in the UK; Register Hardware |publisher=Reghardware.co.uk |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] Historically, the UK's first television service using the 405-line television system was also termed 'high definition' when it launched; for comparison, the screen resolution would be called 377i (377 visible interlaced rows) using the nomenclature of the table above.

===3D television===

Three-dimensional television (3D television) displays an image with an illusion of depth, the third dimension. In July 2009, BSkyB announced a plan to launch a 3D television channel in 2010, accessible to Sky+HD subscribers with a '3D Ready' television.
3D television is also available via the Internet; video website YouTube launched online 3D videos in July 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ANcspdYh_U&feature=related |title=in 3D |publisher=YouTube |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
3D television has occasionally been broadcast before, such as the Dimensions in Time crossover of EastEnders and Doctor Who in 1993, requiring special spectacles.

==Production==

As of 2002, 27,000 hours of original programming are produced year in the UK television industry, excluding news, at a cost of £2.6bn. Ofcom has determined that 56% (£1.5bn) of production is in-house by the channel owners, and the remainder by independent production companies. Ofcom is enforcing a 25% independent production quota for the channel operators, as stipulated in the Broadcasting Act 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/01/nr_20060110a |title=television production sector review |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]

===In-house production===

ITV plc, the company which owns 11 of the 15 regional ITV franchises, has set its production arm ITV Studios a target of producing 75% of the ITV schedule,Our businesses[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] the maximum allowed by Ofcom. This would be a rise from 54% at present, as part of a strategy to make ITV content-led chiefly to double production revenues to £1.2bn by 2012.[tpl]cite news|author=Steve Hewlett |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/sep/17/mondaymediasection3 |title=Media FAQ: Is Grade's ITV strategy right? | Media |work=The Guardian |date= 16 September 2007|accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] ITV Studios currently produces programmes such as Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Heartbeat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.granadamedia.com/sf/gm/standard.asp?section_id=3&sub_section_id=0&redirect_id=0 |title=Granada Media, a world leader in television production and distribution |publisher=Granadamedia.com |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
In contrast, the BBC has implemented a Window of Creative Competition (WOCC), a 25% proportion over and above the 25% Ofcom quota in which the BBC's in-house production and independent producers can compete.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/network/wocc.shtml |title=Commissioning – Window of Creative Competition (WOCC) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] The BBC produces shows such as All Creatures Great and Small and F*** off I'm a Hairy Woman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2007/04_april/miptv_nos.shtml |title=Press Office – BBC Worldwide sells 200 hours of programming to NOS |publisher=BBC |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl]
Channel 4 commissions all programmes from independent producers.

===Independent production===

As a consequence of the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, and the 25% independent quota from the Broadcasting Act 1990, an independent production sector has grown in the UK. Notable companies include Talkback Thames, Endemol UK, Hat Trick Productions, and Tiger Aspect Productions.

===Commentary===

====The rise of television in the UK====

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was established in 1927 to develop radio broadcasting, and inevitably became involved in TV in 1936. The BBC is funded by income from a "Broadcast Receiving Licence" purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the British Government.
Television caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only 2 transmitters, near London and Birmingham, only 9 percent of British homes owned a TV. The United Kingdom was the first country to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs. (A. Smith, Television: An International Hero 1995)
The British government previously appointed people to the BBC's Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the BBC Trust replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers
Commercial television was first introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts being strictly controlled by the ITA the body controlling commercial television.

====History of satellite television====

The first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, Sky Television, was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched Astra satellite at 19.2° east, providing 4 analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent VideoCrypt video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).
In 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, a flat plate antenna and low-noise block converter (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper dish and LNB technology.
The two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in Isleworth in West London, whereas BSB had newly built offices in London (Marco Polo House). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB's D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky's VideoCrypt video encryption system.
In 1994 17% of the group was floated on the London Stock Exchange (with ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange), and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation owns a 35% stake. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
By 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra's 19.2° east position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra's new satellite, at 28.2° east position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB's analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.
In May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name Freesat, carrying a variety of channels from Astra 28.2°E, including some content in HD formats.
