==History==

MIPS Computer Systems Inc. was founded in 1984CrunchBase. "MIPS Computer Systems." Retrieved September 16, 2011.Junko Yoshida, EE Times. "New CEO Sandeep Vij forms ‘Team MIPS’." February 7, 2010. Retrieved September 16, 2011. by a group of researchers from Stanford University that included John L. Hennessy, as a vendor of microprocessor chips.James DeTar, Investors Business Daily. "Panel: Information Technology Still Early Stage." October 6, 2010. Retrieved September 16, 2011. Other principal founders were Skip Stritter, formerly a Motorola technologist, and John Moussouris, formerly of IBM.
The initial CEO was Vaemond Crane, who left early and was replaced by Bob Miller, a former senior IBM and Data General executive. Miller ran the company through its IPO and subsequent sale to Silicon Graphics.
In 1988, MIPS Computer Systems designs were noticed by Silicon Graphics (SGI) and the company adopted the MIPS architecture for its computers.Om Malik, Forbes. "Can MIPS beat ARM?." December 2, 1998. Retrieved September 19, 2011. A year later, in December 1989, MIPS held its first IPO.
After developing the R2000 and R3000 microprocessors, a management change brought along the larger dreams of being a computer vendor. The company found itself unable to compete in the computer market against much larger companies and was struggling to support the costs of developing both the chips and the systems (MIPS Magnum). To secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit R4000), SGI acquired the company in 1992PC Magazine. "SGI." Retrieved September 19, 2011. for $333 millionComputer History Museum. "Silicon Graphics Professional IRIS 4D/50GT." Retrieved September 19, 2011.Cate Corcoran (March 16, 1992), MIPS, Silicon merger could kill ACE/ARC, InfoWorld, pp. 1 and 107. Retrieved September 19, 2011. and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI.Cate Corcoran (March 16, 1992), MIPS, Silicon merger could kill ACE/ARC, InfoWorld,  p. 107. Retrieved Sep 19, 2011.
During SGI's ownership of MIPS, the company introduced the R8000 in 1994 and the R10000Linley Gwenapp, Microprocessor Report. "MIPS R10000 Uses Decoupled Architecture."

Vol. 11, No. 13, October 6, 1997. Retrieved September 19, 2011. During this time, two future microprocessors code-named The Beast and Capitan were in development; these were cancelled after SGI decided to migrate to the Itanium architectureStephen Shankland, ZDNet.

Retrieved September 19, 2011. As a result, MIPS was spun out as an intellectual property licensing company, offering licences to the MIPS architecture as well as microprocessor core designs.
On June 30, 1998, MIPS held an IPO after raising about $16.3 million with an offering price of $14 a share.Debora Vrana, Los Angeles Times. "June IPOs Were Not so Hot, but Summer Is Still Young." July 6, 1998. Retrieved  September 20, 2011.Crag Bicknell, WIRED. "MIPS Slips in IPO." July 1, 1998. Retrieved September 19, 2011. In 1999, SGI announced it would overhaul its operations; it planned to continue introducing new MIPS processors until 2002, but its server business would include Intel’s processor architectures as well.Margaret Quan, EE Times. "SGI to shed Cray, shift OS focus to Linux." August 10, 1999. Retrieved September 20, 2011. SGI spun MIPS out completely on June 20, 2000 by distributing all its interest as stock dividend to the stockholders.
In early 2008 MIPS laid-off 28 employees from its processor business group. On August 13, 2008, MIPS announced a loss of $108.5 million for their fiscal fourth-quarter and that they would lay-off another 15% of their workforce. At the time MIPS had 512 employees.Suzanne Deffree, EDN News, "MIPS plans 15% layoff on $108.5M loss." August 14th, 2008. Retrieved March 4th, 2012.
