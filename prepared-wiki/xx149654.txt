[[X-ray pulsar-based navigation]]

CATEGORIES: Satellite navigation systems

X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing (XNAV) is a navigation technique whereby the periodic X-ray signals emitted from pulsars are used to determine the location of a spacecraft in deep space.  A spacecraft using XNAV compares received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations.  Similar to GPS, this comparison allows the spacecraft to triangulate its position accurately (accurate to 1-5km) .
