The Honour of Richmond in north-west Yorkshire was granted to Count Alan Rufus by William the Conqueror in the year 1071. The honour, which was assessed for the service of 60 knights, was one of the most important fiefs in Norman England.[tpl]cite book|last=Butler|first=Lawrence|title=Anglo Norman Castles|editor=Robert Liddiard|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|year=2003|pages=91–95|chapter=4.The origins of the honour of Richmond and its castles|isbn=0-85115-904-4[/tpl]

==Territory==

Most of the land granted to Count Alan in Yorkshire had previously belonged to Edwin, Earl of Mercia. It consisted of three main land divisions; the wapentakes of Hang, of Gilling and of Hallikeld. The first two of these correspond to later medieval civil land divisions or wapentakes: the third is less easily defined.
The Gilling territory consisted mainly of land which lay between the River Tees and the River Swale, with the Tees forming the northern border which separated the land from that granted to the Bishop of Durham. The western border was the watershed of the Pennines and the southern border was the watershed between the River Ure and the Swale. The River Wiske formed the eastern border. Gilling village, which was close to the boundary, was the manorial centre before Count Alan supplanted it with Richmond Castle. The division of Hang, or Hangshire, had the River Swale as its northern boundary; its western boundary was the Pennine watershed and its southern boundary was the watershed with the River Wharfe and the River Nidd. The eastern border followed small streams and minor landmarks from the previous watershed to the Swale. The wapentake meeting place was situated on the Hang Beck in Finghall parish. The third part of the territory, Hallikeld, consisted of the parishes lying between the River Ure and the River Swale until their confluence at Ellenthorpe.
The Honour of Richmond, being 60 km from east to west and 45 km from north to south, took in most of the land between the River Tees and the River Ure and ranged in its landscape from the bleak mountainous areas of the Pennines to the fertile lowlands of the Vale of York.

==List of Holders of the Honour of Richmond==

The holders of the Honour of Richmond were usually referred to as Lords of Richmond. The Honour of Richmond was sometimes held separately from the titles Earl of Richmond, and later Duke of Richmond. Grants were sometimes partial, and sometimes included or excluded Richmond Castle as noted in the list below.
