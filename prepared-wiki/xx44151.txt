[[De facto standard]]

CATEGORIES: Technological change, Standards

A ''de facto'' standard is a custom, convention, product, or system that has achieved a dominant position by public acceptance or market forces (such as early entrance to the market). De facto is a Latin phrase that means "concerning fact." De facto  means "existing in fact,"thefreedictionary.com/de+facto   adv; in fact, adj; existing in fact, whether legally recognized or not or "in practice but not necessarily ordained by law" or "in practice or actuality, but not officially established."
The term "de facto standard" is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as "de jure standards"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one  standard available for the same use.
