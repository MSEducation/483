[[The Sex Files]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian documentary television series, Discovery Channel shows

The Sex Files is a television program appearing on Discovery Channel Canada and shown on CTVglobemedia around midnight hours, because of content. It talks about several issues of sexuality, from genetics, reproduction, sexual orientation, puberty, etc. It does contain nudity, which is why it is shown in the midnight hours, but the nudity is done from a scientific point-of-view showing exactly what the topic is visually, good for people who want information on sexuality and the biology behind it. In Europe the show was called Sex Sense and featured a male narrator. The number of episodes and their titles were the same but the episodes themselves were slightly different as the more explicit scenes were replaced. It aired on Discovery Channel Europe.
Starting with episode 41 (season 4), it is broadcast in high-definition.
