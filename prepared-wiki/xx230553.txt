==Song story==

The song begins as an apparent tribute to the jukebox and how one can listen to a lot of great music for a small price. But instead of continuing along those lines, the song picks up on how some songs on the jukebox can trigger bad memories. This happens when the protagonist — at a tavern with friends, trying to get over a just-broken relationship — sees another customer at the jukebox, trying to play "B-17," which is coded to a song the woman does not want to hear.
The song, she cries, was one of the now-broken relationship. The song now triggers such bad memories to the point that she never wants to hear the song again. The refrain sees the woman begging the "button-pushin' cowboy" not to play the undesirable song.
