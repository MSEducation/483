The Jenny Lind Tower is a stone tower located in North Truro, Massachusetts. It is named after Jenny Lind, who is rumored to have climbed the tower when it was located in Boston to prevent a riot among people who were unable to attend her concert.[tpl]cite web|last1=Berlin|first1=Michael|title=Truro looks back: The Jenny Lind tower comes to town |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/truro/news/lifestyle/celebrations/x1008347583/Truro-looks-back-The-Jenny-Lind-tower-comes-to-town |publisher=Provincetown Banner, reprinted on Wickedlocal.com |accessdate=3 January 2011| author2=Richard F.

==History==

The tower itself, similar to a castle's battlement, was once part of the original circa 1845 Fitchburg RR depot in Boston; later (1900-1927) owned by the Boston and Maine Railroad which took over the Fitchburg in 1900.B&MRR Historical Society Bulletins; B&MRRHS Archive collection, Lowell, MA[tpl]cite book |last1=Vuilleumier |first=Marion |title=Sketches of Old Cape Cod|date=December 1, 1980|location=Cape Cod|isbn=0-937338-00-1|author2=Louis Vuilleumier |page=49 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YmhuuN74QEoC&q=Sketches+of+Old+Cape+Cod&dq=Sketches+of+Old+Cape+Cod&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2SwCU5rDB8egyAH7oYCwCQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl] In 1850, Opera singer Jenny Lind sang in the auditorium above the station. The concert was oversold and many people were not able to get in. Soon after, she had to cut her performance short after fans began to crash the gates.[tpl]cite news|title=The Cape's Unsung Delight|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/42492036.html?dids=42492036:42492036&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+17%2C+1999&author=&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=THE+CAPE%60S+UNSUNG+DELIGHT&pqatl=google|accessdate=25 January 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=Jun 17, 1999[/tpl] P.

In 1927, the station was being torn down. Lawyer Henry M. Aldrich, connected with the railroad, had the tower dismantled and transported to land in North Truro, Massachusetts that he bought one hundred acres of from a local named Mort Small. Erection of the tower took more than two months and involved the labor of five men. He also erected five cottages on the land, but left no reasoning for the erection of the tower.
The Cape Cod National Seashore attained the deed for the tower in 1961; it was donated by Aldrich's daughter-in-law.[tpl]cite book|last=Gellerman|first=Bruce|title=Massachusetts Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities, & Other Offbeat Stuff|year=2005|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=0-7627-3070-6|pages=264|edition=1st ed.|coauthors=Sherman, Erik |page=169 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7lZbrHUYx_cC&dq=Massachusetts+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities,+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff&source=gbs_navlinks_s |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl] There are no roads to the tower, although it is fairly close to a road that goes to a Federal Aviation Administration radar facility on land that is part of the old North Truro Air Force Station.

==Legend behind the name==

A common myth surrounding the naming of the tower is that on the night of her performance, Jenny Lind climbed the tower and sang to the public. While this has not been proven to be false, newspaper reports of the time do not mention any sort of performance by her to the public below. It is also rumored that Henry Aldrich was an admirer of her, hence the reason that he moved the tower to his land, despite not being born for another 17 years. In "A Pilgrim Returns to Cape Cod", Edward Snow made the myth more attractive by stating, "There are those who like to believe", that because an Aldrich family member was captivated by Jenny's voice, this caused them to decide to move the tower to their land in Truro, Massachusetts. He went on to undermine the myth by stating that Aldrich's son, later told him that Lind's performance did not motivate his father to move the tower to the Cape. It is because of this myth that the legend of the tower lives on in local lore.
