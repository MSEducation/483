This is a list of Sheriffs and High Sheriffs of Rutland. The Sheriff is the oldest secular office under the Crown: there has been a Sheriff of Rutland since 1129. Formerly the Sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer in the county but over the centuries most of the responsibilities associated with the post have been transferred elsewhere or are now defunct, so that its functions are now largely ceremonial. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the office previously known as Sheriff was retitled High Sheriff. The High Sheriff changes every March. The High Sheriff changes every March.
After some 22 years as part of Leicestershire, Rutland was split away in 1996 as a Unitary Authority with its own shrievalty, thus establishing the separate High Sheriff of Rutland.
