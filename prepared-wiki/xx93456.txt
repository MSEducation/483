Emery Go-RoundEmery Go-Round: About Us is a zero-fare bus service in Emeryville, California, between Oakland and Berkeley. It has three lines that run five days a week, with more limited service on weekends, and no or reduced service on holidays. It provides a crucial link between the Amtrak station, where some trains terminate, and the local-transport BART system (although Capital Corridor riders get faster transfers from Richmond Station).  Emery Go-Round also provides access to major shopping areas, businesses, schools, and some larger residences around Emeryville. It is funded by commercial property owners in the citywide transportation business improvement district.
All the bus lines provide service to the MacArthur BART station in Oakland.
